 prologue a small dusty man in a small dusty room thats how i always thought of him just a small dusty man in a small dusty room no cleaning woman was ever allowed to enter that office with its sootstained heavily curtained windows overlooking birdcage walk and no person cleaner or not was ever allowed inside unless colonel raine himself were there and no one could ever have accused the colonel of being allergic to dust it lay everywhere it lay on the oakstained polished floor surrounds that flanked the threadbare carpet it filmed the tops of bookcases filing cabinets radiators chairarms and telephones it lay smeared streakily across the top of the scuffed kneehole desk the dustfree patches marking where papers or books had recently been pushed to one side motes danced busily in a sunbeam that slanted through an uncurtained crack in the middle of a window and trick of the light or not it needed no imagination at all to see a patina of dust on the thin brushedback hair of the man behind the desk to see it embedded in the deeply trenched lines on the grey sunken cheeks the high receding forehead and then you saw the eyes below the heavy wrinkled lids and you forgot all about the dust eyes with the hard jewelled glitter of a peridot stone eyes of the clear washedout aquamarine of a greenland glacier but not so warm he rose to greet me as i crossed the room offered me a cold hard bony hand like a gardening tool waved me to a chair directly opposite the lightcoloured veneered panel so incongruously let into the front of his mahogany desk and seated himself sitting very straight hands clasped lightly on the dusty desk before him welcome home bentall the voice matched the eyes you could almost hear the faroff crackling of dried ice you made fast time pleasant trip no sir some midlands textile tycoon put off the plane to make room for me at ankara wasnt happy im to hear from his lawyers and as a sideline hes going to drive the bea off the european airways other passengers sent me to coventry the stewardesses ignored me completely and it was as bumpy as hell apart from that it was a fine trip such things happen he said precisely an almost imperceptible tic at the lefthand corner of the thin mouth might have been interpreted as a smile all you needed was a strong imagination but it was hard to say twentyfive years of minding other peoples business in the far east seemed to have atrophied the colonels cheek muscles sleep i shook my head not a wink pity he hid his distress well and cleared his throat delicately well im afraid youre off on your travels again bentall tonight pm london airport i let a few seconds pass to let him know i wasnt saying all the things i felt like saying then shrugged in resignation back to iran if i were transferring you from turkey to iran i wouldnt have risked the wrath of the midlands textile industry by summoning you all the way back to london to tell you so again the faint suggestion of a tic at the corner of the mouth considerably further away bentall sydney australia fresh territory for you i believe australia i was on my feet without realising i had risen australia look sir didnt you get my cable last week eight months work everything tied up except the last button all i needed was another week two at the most sit down a tone of voice to match the eyes it was like having a bucket of icewater poured over me he looked at me consideringly and his voice warmed up a little to just under freezing point your concern is appreciated but needless let us hope for your own sake that you do not underestimate ourahantagonists as much as you appear to underestimate those who employ you you have done an excellent job bentall i am quite certain that in any other government department less forthcoming than ours you would have been in line for at least an obe or some such trinket but your part in the job is over i do not choose that my personal investigators shall also double in the role of executioners im sorry sir i said lamely i dont have the overall to continue in your own metaphor the last button is about to be tied it was exactly as if he hadnt heard me this leakthis near disastrous leak i should sayfrom our hepworth ordnance and fuel research establishment is about to be sealed completely and permanently sealed he glanced at the electric clock on the wall in about four hours time i should say we may consider it as being in the past there are those in the cabinet who will sleep well tonight he paused unclasped his hands leaned his elbows on the desk and looked at me over steepled fingers that is to say they should have been sleeping well tonight he sighed a faint dry sound but in these securityridden days the sources of ministerial insomnia are almost infinite hence your recall other men i admit were available but apart from the fact that there is no one with your precise and in this case very necessary qualifications i have a fainta very faintand uneasy feeling that this may not be entirely unconnected with your last assignment he unsteepled his fingers reached for a pink polythene folder and slid it across the desk to me take a look at these will you i quelled the impulse to wave away the approaching tidal wave of dust picked up the folder and took out the halfdozen stapled slips of paper inside they were cuttings from the overseas vacancy columns of the daily telegraph each column had the date heavily pencilled in red at the top the earliest not more than eight months ago and each of the columns had an advertisement ringed in the same heavy red except for the first column which had three advertisements so marked the advertisers were all technical engineering chemical or research firms in australia and new zealand the types of people for whom they were advertising were as would have been expected specialists in the more advanced fields of modern technology i had seen such adverts before from countries all over the world experts in aerodynamics microminiaturization hypersonics electronics physics radar and advanced fuel technologies were at a premium those days but what made these advertisements different apart from their common source was the fact that all the jobs were being offered in top administrative and directorial capacity carrying with them what i could only regard as astronomical salaries i whistled softly and glanced at colonel raine but those icegreen eyes were contemplating some spot in the ceiling about a thousand miles away so i looked through the columns again put them back in the folder and slid them across the desk compared to the colonel i made a hardly noticeable ripple across the dustpond of the tabletop eight advertisements the colonel said in his dry quiet voice each over a hundred words in length but you could reproduce them all word for word if need be right bentall i think i might sir an extraordinary gift he murmured i envy you your comments bentall that rather delicately worded advertisement for a thrust and propellant specialist to work on aero engines designed for speeds in excess of mach properly speaking there are no such aero engines only rocket engines on which the metallurgical problems have already been solved theyre after a topflight fuel boffin and apart from a handful at some of the major aircraft firms and at a couple of universities every worthwhile fuel specialist in the country works at the hepworth research establishment and there may lie the tiein with your last job he nodded just a guess and it could be far more easily wrong than right probably a straw from another haystack altogether he doodled in the dust with the tip of his forefinger what else all advertisements from a more or less common source i went on new zealand or the eastern australian seaboard all jobs to be filled in a hurry all offering free and furnished accommodation house to become the property of the successful applicant together with salaries at least three times higher than the best of them could expect in this country theyre obviously after the best brains we have ah specify that the applicants be married but say theyre unable to accommodate children doesnt that strike you as a trifle unusual colonel raine asked idly no sir quite common for foreign firms to prefer married men people are often unsettled at first in strange countries and theres less chance of their packing up and taking the next boat home if they have their families to consider those advertisers are paying single fare only with the money a man could save in the first weeks or months it would be quite impossible to transport his family home but there are no families the colonel persisted only wives perhaps theyre afraid the patter of tiny feet may distract the highlypaid minds i shrugged or limited accommodation or the kids to follow later all it says is no accommodation for children nothing in all of this strikes you as being in any way sinister superficially no with all respects i question whether it would strike you either sir scores of our best men have been lured overseas in the past years but if you were to provide me with the information youre obviously withholding i might very well begin to see it your way another momentary tic at the lefthand corner of the mouth he was really letting himself go today then he fished out a small dark pipe and started scraping the bowl with a penknife without looking up he said there was a further coincidence that i should have mentioned all the scientists who accepted those jobsand their wiveshave disappeared completely with the last word he gave me a quick upfromunder glance with those arctic eyes to see how i was taking it i dont much like being played catandmouse with so i gave him back his wooden indian stare and asked in this country en route or after arrival i think maybe you are the right man for the job bentall he said inconsequently all of them left this country four seem to have disappeared en route for australia from the immigration authorities in new zealand and australia we have learned that one landed in wellington and three others in sydney and thats all they know about them thats all any of the authorities in those countries know they arrived they vanished finish any idea why none could be several alternatives i never waste my time guessing bentall all we knowhence of course the very great official anxietyis that though all the men concerned were engaged in industrial research their unique knowledge could all too easily be put to military uses how thorough a search has been made for them sir you can imagine and im led to believe that the police forces in theahantipodes are as efficient as any in the world but its hardly a job for a policeman eh he leaned back in his chair puffing dark clouds of foulsmelling smoke into the already overweighted air and looked at me expectantly i felt tired irritable and i didnt like the turn the conversation was taking he was waiting for me to be a bright boy i supposed id better oblige what am i going out as a nuclear physicist he patted the arm of his chair ill keep this seat warm for you my boy it may be yours some day its not easy for an iceberg to sound jovial but he almost made it no false colours for you bentall youre going out as precisely what you were in the days you worked at hepworth and we discovered your unique gifts in another and slightly less academic field youre going out as a specialist in fuel research he extracted a slip of paper from another folder and tossed it across to me read all about it the ninth advertisement appeared in the telegraph a fortnight ago i let the paper lie where it had fallen i didnt even look at it the second application for a fuel specialist i said who answered the first i should know him does that matter bentall his voice had dropped a few degrees certainly it matters my tone matched his perhaps theywhoever they may bepicked on a dud perhaps he didnt know enough but if it was one of the top boyswell sir the implication is pretty clear somethings happened to make them need a replacement it was dr charles fairfield fairfield my old chief the secondincommand at hepworth who else i didnt answer immediately i knew fairfield well a brilliant scientist and a highlygifted amateur archaeologist i liked this less and less and my expression should have told colonel raine so but he was examining the ceiling with the minute scrutiny of a man who expected to see it fall down any second and youre asking me to i began thats what im doing he interrupted he sounded suddenly tired it was impossible not to feel a quick sympathy for the man for the heavy burden he had to carry im not ordering my boy im only asking his eyes were still on the ceiling i pulled the paper towards me and looked at the redringed advertisement it was almost but not quite the duplicate of one id read a few minutes earlier our friends required an immediate cable answer i said slowly i suppose they must be getting pushed for time you answered by cable in your name and from your home address i trust you will pardon the liberty he murmured drily the allison and holden engineering company sydney i went on a genuine and respected firm of course of course we checked and the name is that of their personnel manager and an airmail letter that arrived four days ago confirming the appointment was on the genuine letterhead of the firm signed in the name of the personnel manager only it wasnt his signature what else do you know sir nothing im sorry absolutely nothing i wish to god i could help more there was a brief silence then i pushed the paper back to him and said havent you rather overlooked the fact that this advert is like the restit calls for a married man i never overlook the obvious he said flatly i stared at him you never i broke off then continued i suppose youve got the banns already called and the bride waiting at the church ive done better than that again the faint tic in the cheek he reached into a drawer pulled out a nine by four buff envelope and tossed it across to me take care of that bentall your marriage certificate caxton hall ten weeks ago you may examine it if you wish but i think youll find everything perfectly in order im sure i will i muttered mechanically i should hate to be a party to anything illegal and now he said briskly you would of course like to meet your wife he lifted a phone and said ask mrs bentall to come here please his pipe had gone out and hed resumed the excavations with the penknife examining the bowl with great care there was nothing for me to examine so i let my eye wander until i saw again the lightcoloured panel in the wood facing me i knew the story behind that less than nine months ago shortly after colonel raines predecessor had been killed in an air crash another man had sat in the chair i was sitting in now it had been one of raines own men but what raine had not known was that that man had been subverted in central europe and persuaded to act as a double agent his first taskwhich would also probably have been his last was simple and staggering in its audacity nothing less than the murder of raine himself had it been successful the removal of colonel rainei never knew his real name chief of security and the receptacle of a thousand secrets would have been an irreparable loss the colonel had suspected nothing of this until the agent had pulled out his gun but what the agent did not knowwhat nobody had known before thenwas that colonel raine kept a silenced luger with the safety catch permanently off fastened to the underside of his chair by a spring clip i did think he might have had a better job made of repairing that splintered panel in the front of his desk colonel raine had had no option of course but even had he had the chance of disarming or just wounding the man he would probably still have killed him he was without exception the most utterly ruthless man i had ever met not cruel just ruthless the end justified the means and if the end were important enough there were no sacrifices he would not make to achieve it that was why he was sitting in that chair but when ruthlessness became inhumanity i felt it was time to protest i said are you seriously considering sending this woman out with me sir im not considering it he peered into the bowl of his pipe with all the absorbed concentration of a geologist scanning the depths of an extinct volcano the decision is made my blood pressure went up a couple of points even though you must know that whatever happened to dr fairfield probably happened to his wife too he laid pipe and knife on the desk and gave me what he probably imagined was a quizzical look with those eyes of his it felt more as if a couple of stilettos were coming my way you question the wisdom of my decisions bentall i question the justification for sending a woman on a job where the odds on chances are that shell get herself killed there was anger in my voice now and i wasnt bothering very much about concealing it and i do question the wisdom of sending her with me you know im a loner colonel raine i could go by myself explain that my wife had taken ill i dont want any female hanging round my neck sir with this particular female raine said drily most men would consider that a privilege i advise you to forget your concern i consider it essential that she go this young lady has volunteered for this assignment shes shrewd very very able and most experienced in this businessmuch more so than you are bentall it may not be a case of you looking after her but vice versa she can take care of herself admirably she has a gun and she never moves without it i think youll find he broke off as a side door opened and a girl walked into the room i say walked because it is the usual word to describe human locomotion but this girl didnt locomote she seemed to glide with all the grace and more than the suggestion of something else of a balinese dancing girl she wore a light grey ribbed wool dress that clung to every inch of her hourandahalfglass figure as if it fully appreciated its privilege and round her waist she wore a narrow belt of darker grey to match her court shoes and lizard handbag that would be where the gun was in the bag she couldnt have concealed a peashooter under that dress she had smooth fair gleaming hair parted far over on the left and brushed almost straight back dark eyebrows and lashes clear hazel eyes and a delicately tanned fair skin i knew where the tan came from i knew who she was shed worked on the same assignment as i had for the past six months but had been in greece all the time and id only seen her twice in athens in all this was only the fourth time id ever met her i knew her but knew nothing of her except for the fact that her name was marie hopeman that she had been born in belgium but hadnt lived there since her father a technician in the fairey aviation factory in that country had brought her and her belgian mother out of the continent at the time of the fall of france both her parents had been lost in the lancastria an orphan child brought up in what was to her a foreign country she must have learned fast how to look after herself or so i supposed i pushed back my chair and rose colonel raine waved a vaguely introductory hand and said mr andahmrs bentall you have met before have you not yes sir he knew damned well wed met before marie hopeman gave me a cool firm hand and a cool level look maybe this chance to work so closely with me was the realisation of a lifes ambition for her but she was holding her enthusiasm pretty well in check id noticed this in athens this remote and rather aloof selfsufficiency which i found vaguely irritating but that wasnt going to stop me from saying what i was going to say nice to see you again miss hopeman or it should be but not here and not now dont you know what youre letting yourself in for she looked at me with big hazel eyes wide open under her raised dark brows then the mouth curved slowly into an amused smile as she turned away has mr bentall been coming all over chivalrous and noble on my account colonel raine she asked sweetly well yes im afraid he has rather the colonel admitted and please we must have none of this mr bentallmiss hopeman talk among young married couples i mean he poked a pipecleaner through the stem of his pipe nodded in satisfaction as it emerged from the bowl black as a chimney sweeps brush and went on almost dreamily john and marie bentall i think the names go rather well together do you feel that too the girl said with interest she turned to me again and smiled brightly i do so appreciate your concern its really most kind of you a pause then she added john i didnt hit her because i hold the view that that sort of thing went out with the cavemen but i could appreciate how the old boys felt i gave her what i hoped was a cool and enigmatic smile and turned away clothes sir i said to raine ill need to buy some its high summer out there now youll find two new suitcases in your flat bentall packed with everything you need tickets here he slid a packet across they were mailed to you four days ago by wagons lits cook paid by cheque man called tobias smith no one has ever heard of him but his bank account is healthy enough you dont fly east as you might expect but west via new york san francisco hawaii and fiji i suppose the man who pays the piper calls the tune passports both in your cases in your flat the little tic touched the side of his face yours for a change is in your own name had to be theyd check on you university subsequent career and so forth we fixed it so that no enquirer would know you left hepworth a year ago also in your case youll find a thousand dollars in american express cheques i hope i live to spend it i said whos travelling with us sir there was a small silence a brittle silence and two pairs of eyes were on me the narrow cold icegreen ones and the large warm hazel eyes marie hopeman spoke first perhaps you would explain hah i interrupted perhaps i would explain and youre the personwell never mind sixteen people leave from here for australia or new zealand eight never arrive fifty percent which means that theres a fifty percent chance that we dont arrive so there will be an observer in the plane so that colonel raine can erect a tombstone over the spot where were buried or more likely just a wreath flung on the pacific the possibility of a little trouble en route had occurred to me the colonel said carefully there will be an observer with younot the same one all the way naturally it is better that you do not know who those observers are he rose to his feet and walked round the table the briefing was over i am sincerely sorry he finished i do not like any of this but i am a blind man in a dark room and there is no other course open to me i hope things go well he offered his hand briefly to both of us shook his head murmured im sorry goodbye and walked back to his desk i opened the door for marie hopeman and glanced back over my shoulder to see how sorry he was but he wasnt looking sorry he was just looking earnestly into the bowl of his pipe so i closed the door with a quiet hand and left him sitting there a small dusty man in a small dusty room chapter one tuesday am am fellowpassengers on the plane the old hands on the americaaustralia run had spoken of the grand pacific hotel in viti levu as the finest in the western pacific and a very brief acquaintance with it had persuaded me that they were probably right oldfashioned but magnificent and shining like a newlyminted silver cein it was run with a quiet and courteous efficiency that would have horrified the average english hotelier the bedrooms were luxurious the food superbthe memory of the sevencourse dinner wed had that night would linger for yearsand the view from the verandah of the hazesoftened mountains across the moonlit bay belonged to another world but theres no perfection in a very imperfect world the locks on the bedroom doors of the grand pacific hotel were just no good at all my first intimation of this came when i woke up in the middle of the night in response to someone prodding my shoulder but my first thought was not of the doorlocks but of the finger prodding me it was the hardest finger id ever felt it felt like a piece of steel i struggled to open my eyes against weariness and the glare of the overhead light and finally managed to focus them on my left shoulder it was a piece of steel it was a dullygleaming colt automatic and just in case i should have made any mistake in identification whoever was holding it shifted the gun as soon as he saw me stir so that my right eye could stare down the centre of the barrel it was a gun all right my gaze travelled up past the gun the hairy brown wrist the whitecoated arm to the brown cold still face with the battered yachting cap above then back to the automatic again ok friend i said i meant it to sound cool and casual but it came out more like the raventhe hoarse one croaking on the battlements of macbeths castle i can see its a gun cleaned and oiled and everything but take it away please guns are dangerous things a wise guy eh he said coldly showing the little wife what a hero he is but you wouldnt really like to be a hero would you bentall you wouldnt really like to start something i would have loved to start something i would have loved to take his gun away and beat him over the head with it having guns pointed at my eye gives me a nasty dry mouth makes my heart work overtime and uses up a great deal of adrenalin i was just starting out to think what else i would like to do to him when he nodded across the bed because if you are you might have a look there first i turned slowly so as not to excite anyone except only for the yellow of his eyes the man on the other side of the bed was a symphony in black black suit black sailors jersey under it black hat and one of the blackest faces i had ever seen a thin taut pinchnosed face the face of a pure indian he was very narrow and very short but he didnt have to be big on account of what he held in his hands a twelvebore shotgun which had had almost twothirds of its original length sawn off at stock and barrels it was like looking down a couple of unlit railway tunnels i turned away slowly and looked at the white man i see what you mean can i sit up he nodded and stepped back a couple of feet i swung my leg over the bed and looked across to the other side of the room where marie hopeman with a third man also black standing beside her was sitting in a rattan chair by her bed she was dressed in a blue and white sleeveless silk dress and because it was sleeveless i could see the four bright marks on the upper arm where someone had grabbed her not too gently i was more or less dressed myself all except for shoes coat and tie although we had arrived there several hours earlier after a long and bumpy road trip forced on us by a lack of accommodation at the airfield at the other end of the island with the unexpected influx of stranded aircraft passengers into the grand pacific hotel the question of separate rooms for mr and mrs john bentall had not ever arisen but the fact that we were almost completely dressed had nothing to do with modesty false or otherwise it had to do with survival the unexpected influx was due to an unscheduled stopover at the suva airfield and what the unscheduled stopover was due to was something that exercised my mind very much indeed primarily it was due to a mediumscale electrical fire that had broken out in our dc immediately after the fuelling hoses had been disconnected and although it had been extinguished inside a minute the plane captain had quite properly refused to continue until airline technicians had flown down from hawaii to assess the extent of the damage but what i would have dearly loved to know was what had caused the fire i am a great believer in coincidences but belief stops short just this side of idiocy four scientists and their wives had already disappeared en route to australia the chances were even that the fifth couple ourselves would do likewise and the fuelling halt at the suva airfield in fiji was the last chance to make us vanish so wed left our clothes on locked the doors and taken watches id taken the first sitting quietly in the darkness until three oclock in the morning when id given marie hopeman a shake and lain down on my own bed id gone to sleep almost immediately and she must have done exactly the same for when i now glanced surreptitiously at my watch i saw it was only twenty minutes past three either i hadnt shaken her hard enough or she still hadnt recovered from the effects of the previous sleepless night a san franciscohawaii hop so violent that even the stewards had been sick not that the reasons mattered now i pulled on my shoes and looked across at her for the moment she no longer looked serene and remote and aloof she just looked tired and pale and there were faint blue shadows under her eyes she was a poor traveller and had suffered badly the previous night she saw me looking at her and began to speak im afraid i be quiet i said savagely she blinked as if she had been struck across the face then tightened her lips and stared down at her stockinged feet the man with the yachting cap laughed with the musical sound of water escaping down a wastepipe pay no attention mrs bentall he doesnt mean a thing the worlds full of bentalls tough crusts and jelly inside and when theyre nervous and scared theyve just got to lash out at someone makes them feel better but of course they only lash out in a safe direction he looked at me consideringly and without much admiration isnt that so bentall what do you want i asked stiffly what is the meaning of thisof this intrusion youre wasting your time i have only a very few dollars in currency about forty there are travellers cheques those are no good to you my wifes jewellery why are you both dressed he interrupted suddenly i frowned and stared at him i fail to see something pressed hard and cold and rough against the back of my neck whoever had hacksawed off the barrels of that twelvebore hadnt been too particular about filing down the outside edges my wife and i are priority passengers i said quickly it is difficult to sound pompous and scared at the same time my business is of the greatest urgency ii have impressed that on the airport authorities i understand that planes make overnight refuelling stops in suva and have asked that i should be notified immediately of any vacancies on a westbound plane the hotel staff has also been told and were on a minutes notice it wasnt true but the hotel day staff were off duty and there would be no quick way of checking but i could see he believed me thats very interesting he murmured and very convenient mrs bentall you can come and sit by your husband here and hold his handit doesnt look any too steady to me he waited till she had crossed the room and sat down on the bed a good two feet from me and staring straight ahead then said krishna yes captain this from the indian who had been watching marie go outside put a call through to the desk say youre speaking from the airport and that theres an urgent call for mr and mrs bentall that theres a klm plane with two vacant seats just stopped over for refuelling theyve to go at once got it yes captain a gleam of white teeth and he started for the door not that way fool the white man nodded to the french doors leading to the outside verandah want everyone to see you when youve put the call through pick up your friends taxi come to the main door say youve been phoned for by the airport and come upstairs to help carry the bags down the indian nodded unlocked the french doors and disappeared the man with the yachting cap dragged out a cheroot puffed black smoke into the air and grinned at us neat eh just what is it that you intend to do with us i asked tightly taking you for a little trip he grinned showing irregular and tobaccostained teeth and therell be no questions everyone will think you have gone on to sydney by plane aint it sad now stand up clasp your hands behind your head and turn round with three gun barrels pointing at me and the furthest not more than eighteen inches away it seemed a good idea to do what he said he waited till i had a birds eye view of the two unlit railway tunnels jabbed his gun into my back and went over me with an experienced hand that wouldnt have missed even a book of matches finally the pressure of the gun in my spine eased and i heard him taking a step back ok bentall sit bit surprising maybetoughtalking pansies like you often fancy themselves enough to pack a gun maybe its in your grips well check later he transferred a speculative glance to marie hopeman how about you lady dont you dare touch me youyou horrible man shed jumped to her feet and was standing there erect as a guardsman arms stretched stiffly at her sides fists clenched breathing quickly and deeply she couldnt have been more than five feet four in her stockinged soles but outraged indignation made her seem inches taller it was quite a performance what do you think i am of course im not carrying a gun on me slowly thoughtfully but not insolently his eyes followed every curve of the more than adequately filled silk sheath dress then he sighed it would be a miracle if you were he admitted regretfully maybe in your grip but laterneither of you will be opening those bags till we get where were going he paused for a thoughtful moment but you do carry a handbag dont you lady dont you touch my handbag with your dirty hands she said stormily theyre not dirty he said mildly he held one up for his own inspection at least not really the bag mrs bentall in the bedside cabinet she said contemptuously he moved to the other side of the room never quite taking his eye off us i had an idea that he didnt have too much faith in the lad with the blunderbuss he took the grey lizard handbag from the cabinet slipped the catch and held the bag upside down over the bed a shower of stuff fell out money comb handkerchief vanity case and all the usual camouflage kit and warpaint but no gun quite definitely no gun you dont really look the type he said apologetically but thats how you live to be fifty lady by not even trusting your own mother and he broke off and hefted the empty bag in his hand does seem a mite heavy though dont it he peered inside fumbled around with his hand withdrew it and felt the outside of the bag low down there was a barely perceptible click and the false bottom fell open swinging on its hinges something fell on the carpet with a thud he bent and picked up a small flat snubnosed automatic one of those trick cigarette lighters he said easily or it might be for perfume or sandblasting on the old face powder whatever will they think of next my husband is a scientist and a very important person in his own line marie hopeman said stonily he has had two threats on his life ii have a police permit for that gun and ill give you a receipt for it so everything will be nice and legal he said comfortably the speculative eyes belied the tone all right get ready to go out rabatthis to the man with the sawnoff gunover the verandah and see that no one tries anything stupid between the main door and the taxi hed everything smoothly organised i couldnt have tried anything even if id wanted to and i didnt not now obviously hed no intention of disposing of us on the spot and i wasnt going to find any answers by just running away when the knock came to the door he vanished behind the curtains covering the open french windows the bellboy came in and picked up three bags he was followed by krishna who had in the meantime acquired a peaked cap krishna had a raincoat over his armhe had every excuse it was raining heavily outsideand i could guess he had more than his hand under it he waited courteously until we had preceded him through the door picked up the fourth bag and followed at the end of the long corridor i saw the man in the yachting cap come out from our room and stroll along after us far enough away so as not to seem one of the party but near enough to move in quick if i got any funny ideas i couldnt help thinking that hed done this sort of thing before the nightclerk a thin dark man with the worldweary expression of night clerks the world over had our bill ready as i was paying the man with the yachting cap cheroot sticking up at a jaunty angle sauntered up to the desk and nodded affably to the clerk good morning captain fleck the clerk said respectfully you found your friend i did indeed the cold hard expression had gone from captain flecks face to be replaced with one that was positively jovial and he tells me the man i really want to see is out at the airport call me a taxi will you certainly sir fleck appeared to be a man of some consequence in those parts he hesitated is it urgent captain heck all my business is urgent fleck boomed of course of course the clerk seemed nervous anxious to ingratiate himself with fleck it just so happens that mr and mrs bentall here are going out there too and they have a taxi delighted to meet you mrahbentall fleck said heartily with his right hand he crushed mine in a bluff honest sailormans grip while with his left he brought the complete ruin of the shapeless jacket he was wearing another long stage nearer by thrusting his concealed gun so far forward against the offwhite material that i thought he was going to sunder the pocket from its moorings flecks my name i must get out to the airport at once and if you would be so kindshare the costs of courseid be more than grateful no doubt about it he was the complete professional we were wafted out of that hotel and into the waiting taxi with all the smooth and suave dexterity of a headwaiter ushering you to the worst table in an overcrowded restaurant and had i had any doubts left about flecks experienced competence they would have been removed the moment i sat down in the back seat between him and rabat and felt something like a giant and none too gentle pincers closing round my waist to my left rabats twelvebore to my right flecks automatic both digging in just above the hipbones the one position where it was impossible to knock them aside i sat still and quiet and hoped that the combination of ancient taxi springs and bumpy road didnt jerk either of the forefingers curved round those triggers marie hopeman sat in front beside krishna very erect very still very aloof i wondered if there was anything left of the careless amusement the quiet selfconfidence she had shown in colonel raines office two days ago it was impossible to say wed flown together side by side for miles and i still didnt even begin to know her she had seen to that i knew nothing at all about the town of suva but even if i had i doubt whether i would have known where we were being taken with two people sitting in front of me one on either side and what little i could see of the sidescreens blurred and obscured by heavy rain the chances of seeing anything were remote i caught a glimpse of a dark silent cinema a bank a canal with scattered faint lights reflecting from its opaque surface and after turning down some narrow unlighted streets and bumping over railway tracks a long row of small railway wagons with csr stamped on their sides all of those especially the freight train clashed with my preconceptions of what a south pacific island should look like but i had no time to wonder about it the taxi pulled up with a sudden jerk that seemed to drive the twelvebore about halfway through me and captain fleck jumped out ordering me to follow i climbed down and stood there rubbing my aching sides while i looked around me it was as dark as a tomb the rain was still sluicing down and at first i could see nothing except the vague suggestion of one or two angular structures that looked like gantry cranes but i didnt need my eyes to tell me where i was my nose was all that was required i could smell smoke and diesel and rust the tang of tar and hempen ropes and wet cordage and pervading everything the harsh flat smell of the sea what with the lack of sleep and the bewildering turn of events my mind wasnt working any too well that night but it did seem pretty obvious that captain fleck hadnt brought us down to the suva docks to set us aboard a klm plane for australia i made to speak but he cut me off at once flicked a pencil torch at two cases that krishna had carefully placed in a deep puddle of dirty and oily water picked up the other two cases himself and told me softly to do the same and follow him there was nothing soft about the confirmatory jab in the ribs from rabats twelvebore i was getting tired of rabat and his ideas as to what constituted gentle prods fleck probably fed him on a straight diet of american gangster magazines fleck had either better night eyes than i had or he had a complete mental picture of the whereabouts of every rope hawser bollard and loose cobble on that dockside but we didnt have far to go and i hadnt tripped and fallen more than four or five times when he slowed down turned to his right and began to descend a flight of stone stairs he took his tune about it and risked using his flash and i didnt blame him the steps were greenscummed and greasy and there was no handrail at all on the seaward side the temptation to drop one of my cases on top of him and then watch gravity taking charge was strong but only momentary not only were there still two guns at my back but my eyes were now just sufficiently accustomed to the dark to let me make out the vague shape of some vessel lying alongside the low stone jetty at the foot of the steps if he fell now all fleck would suffer would be considerable bruising and even greater damage to his pride which might well make him pass up his desire for silence and secrecy in favour of immediate revenge he didnt look like the kind of man who would miss so i tightened my grip on the cases and went down those steps with all the care and delicate precision of a daniel picking his way through a den of sleeping lions and there wasnt all that difference here just that the lions were wide awake a few seconds later marie hopeman and the two indians were on the jetty behind me we were now only about eight feet above water level and i peered at the vessel to try to get a better idea of her shape and size but the backdrop of that rainfilled sky was scarcely less dark than that of the land and sea broadbeamed maybe seventy feet longalthough i could have been twenty feet out either waya fairly bulky midships superstructure and masts whether two or three i couldnt be sure that was all i had time to see when a door in the superstructure opened and a sudden flood of white light completely destroyed what little night sight id been able to acquire someone tall and lean i thought passed quickly through the bright rectangle of light and closed the door quickly behind him everything ok boss id never been to australia but id met plenty of australians this ones accent was unmistakable ok got em and watch that damned light were coming aboard boarding the ship was no trick at all the top of the gunwale amidships where we were was riding just level with the jetty and all we had to do was jump down the thirty inches to the deck below a wooden deck i noticed not steel when we were all safely down captain fleck said we are ready to receive guests henry he sounded relaxed now relieved to be back where he was staterooms all ready boss henry announced his voice was a hoarse and lugubrious drawl shall i show them to their quarters do that ill be in my cabin all right bentall leave your grips here ill see you later henry led the way aft along the deck with the two indians close behind once clear of the superstructure he turned right flicked on a torch and stopped before a small square raised hatch he bent down slipped a bolt heaved the hatchcover up and back and pointed down with his torch get down there the two of you i went first ten rungs on a wet clammy and vertical steel ladder marie hopeman close behind her head had hardly cleared the level of the hatch when the cover slammed down and we heard the scraping thud of a bolt sliding home she climbed down the last two or three steps and we stood and looked round our stateroom it was a dark and noisome dungeon well not quite dark there was a dim yellow glowworm of a lamp behind a steelmeshed glass on the deckhead enough so that you didnt have to paw your way around but it was certainly noisome enough it smelled like the aftermath of the bubonic plague stinking to high heaven of some disgusting odour that i couldnt identify and it was all that could have been asked for in the way of a dungeon the only way out was the way we had come in aft there was a wooden bulkhead clear across the width of the vessel i located a crack between two planks and though i couldnt see anything i could sniff diesel oil the engineroom without a doubt in the forard bulkhead were two doors both unlocked one led to a primitive toilet and a ruststained washbasin supplied by a tap that gave a good flow of brown and brackish water not seawater the other opened on to a tiny six by four cabin where nearly all the floor space was occupied by a low madeup bunk without sheets but with what seemed in the sputtering light of a match to be fairly clean blankets near the two forard corners of the hold were sixinch diameter holes in the deckhead i peered up those but could see nothing ventilators probably and they could hardly have been called a superfluous installation but on that windless night and with the ship not under way they were quite useless heavy spaced wooden battens held in place by wooden slots in deck and deckhead ran the whole foreandaft length of the hold there were four rows of those battens and behind the two rows nearest the port and starboard sides wooden boxes and opensided crates were piled to the very top except where a space had been left free for the air from the ventilators to find its way in between the outer and inner rows of battens other boxes and sacks were piled half the height of the hold between the two inner rows extending from the engineroom bulkhead to the two small doors in the forard bulkhead was a passage perhaps four feet wide the wooden floor of this alleyway looked as if it had been scrubbed about the time of the coronation i was still looking slowly around feeling my heart making for my boots and hoping that it was not too dark for marie hopeman to see my carefully balanced expression of insouciance and intrepidity when the overhead light dimmed to a dull red glow and a highpitched whine came from aft a second later an unmistakable diesel engine came to life the vessel began to vibrate as it revved up then as it slowed again i could just hear the patter of sandalled feet on the deck abovecasting off no doubtjust before the engine note deepened as gear was engaged it didnt require the slight list to starboard as the vessel sheered off from the jetty wall to tell us that we were under way i turned away from the after bulkhead bumped into marie hopeman in the near darkness and caught her arm to steady her the arm was goosefleshed wet and far too cold i fumbled a match from a box scratched it alight and peered at her as she screwed her eyes almost shut against the sudden flare her fair bedraggled hair was plastered over her forehead and one cheek the saturated thin silk of her dress was a clammy cocoon that clung to every inch and she was shivering constantly not until then did i realise just how cold and dank it was in that airless hole i waved the match to extinction removed a shoe started hammering the after bulkhead and when that had no effect climbed a few steps up the ladder and started beating the hatch what on earth do you imagine youre doing marie hopeman asked room service if we dont get our clothes soon im going to have a pneumonia case on my hands wouldnt it suit you better to look round for some kind of weapon she said quietly has it never occurred to you to ask why theyve brought us out here to do us in nonsense i tried out my carefree laugh to see how it went but it didnt it sounded so hollow and unconvincing that it lowered even my morale of course theyre not going to knock us off not yet at least they didnt bring me all the way out here to do thatit could have as easily been done in england nor was it necessary to bring you that i should be knocked off thirdly they didnt have to bring us out on this boat to do itfor instance that dirty canal we passed and a couple of heavy stones would have been all that was needed and fourthly captain fleck strikes me as a ruffian and a rogue but no killer this was a better line altogether if i repeated it about a hundred times i might even start believing it myself marie hopeman remained silent so maybe she was thinking about it maybe there was something in it after all after a couple of minutes i gave the hatch up as a bad job went forard into the tiny cabin and hammered against the bulkhead there crew quarters must have been on the other side for i got reaction within half a minute someone heaved open the hatchcover and a powerful torch shone down into the hold will you kindly quit that flamin row henry didnt sound any too pleased cant you sleep or somethin where are our cases i demanded we must have dry clothes my wife is soaked to the skin comin comin he grumbled move right forard both of you we moved he dropped down into the hold took four cases from someone invisible to us then stepped aside to make room for another man to come down the ladder it was captain fleck equipped with a torch and gun and enveloped in an aroma of whisky it made a pleasant change from the fearful stink in that hold sorry to keep you waiting he boomed cheerfully locks on those cases were a mite tricky so you werent carrying a gun after all eh bentall of course not i said stiffly i had been but k was still under the mattress of my bed back in the grand pacific hotel whats the damnable smell down here damnable damnable fleck sniffed the foul atmosphere with the keen appreciation of a connoisseur bent over a brandy glass of napoleon copra and sharks fins mainly copra very healthgiving they say i dare say i said bitterly how long are we to stay in this hellhole theres not a finer schooner fleck began irritably then broke off well see few more hours i dont know youll get breakfast at eight he shone his torch around the hold and went on apologetically we dont often have ladies aboard maam especially not ones like you we might have cleaned it up more but theres a bunk there quite clean dont either of you sleep with your shoes off why i demanded cockroaches he explained briefly very partial to the soles of the feet he flicked the torch beam suddenly to one side and picked up a couple of brown monstrous beetlelike insects at least a couple of inches in length that scuttled out of sight almost immediately asas big as that marie hopeman whispered its the copra and diesel oil henry explained lugubriously their favourite food except for ddt we give them gallons of that and them were only the small ones their parents know better than to come out when there are people around thats enough fleck said abruptly he thrust the torch into my hand take this youll need it see you in the morning henry waited till flecks head was clear of the hatch then pushed back some of the sliding battens that bordered the central aisle he nodded at the four foot high platform of cases exposed by this sleep here he said shortly theres more than cockroaches down this hold and keep that light on why what is there here that i dont know he interrupted ive never spent the night here theres not enough money to pay me to with that he was gone and moments later the hatch shut to behind him spreads sweetness and light wherever he goes doesnt he i asked i wonder what he does mean but id take any money theyre not hired assassins murderers dont do you mind she interrupted my suitcase id like to change sorry i passed it to her along with the torch did you pack any slacks she nodded then wear them i rummaged in one of my own cases brought out a couple of pairs of socks pull these over them anticockroach you can change up in the cabin there you didnt think i was going to do it here she said coldly no gratitude i grinned at her but no answering smile she closed the cabin door behind her not gently id finished changing by the faint glow of the overhead light and was tapping a cigarette out of its packet when a sudden scream of pure terror from the cabin froze me immobile for a second but only for a second four steps and i was at the cabin door just as it was torn violently open and marie hopeman came stumbling frantically out struck her head a glancing blow against the low overhead doorway and literally fell into my arms she grabbed me and clung on desperately a young koala bear stranded on its first eucalyptus tree had nothing on marie hopeman at that moment at any other time it would have been very pleasant but just then it wasnt getting us anywhere what happened i demanded quickly what on earth is it take me away from here she sobbed she twisted in my arms and looked over her shoulder with wide horrorfilled eyes please at once away her eyes widened still further she took that deep breath that is so often prelude to a scream so i picked her up hurriedly walked the ten feet to where henry had pushed the battens aside and sat her there her back propped up against the inner battens what was it i asked urgently quickly it was horrible horrible she didnt know what i was saying her breath was coming in long quivering gasps and she was trembling violently she felt me straightening and sunk her fingers deep into my arms dont leave me dont ill only be a moment i said soothingly i pointed to where a beam of light lay angled across the floor of the cabin i want that torch i broke away from her desperate grip and almost literally flung myself through the small cabin door this wasnt courage it was the lack of it i didnt know what the fauna of the south pacific was but it might have ranged from nests of cobras to colonies of black widow spiders and if id stopped to think of all the unpleasant possibilities it might have taken me a very long time indeed to cross that threshold i picked the blazing torch off the floor and swung it round in a complete circle all in one movement nothing another a much slower and more thorough inspection still nothing nothing except a pile of damp clothes and a couple of my socks on the bed i went out taking the socks with me and pulled the door tight shut behind me her breathing had quietened but she was still trembling badly when i got back the change from the cool selfsufficient and rather aloof young lady who had flown out to fiji with me to this panicstricken defenceless girl was just within the limits of credibility and it gave me no pleasure at all her fair hair was in wild disorder she was wearing a matched jumper and cardigan and a pair of light blue slacks on her left foot she wore two of my socks the right foot was bare i turned the torch on this bare foot leaned forward suddenly and swore on the outside of the foot just behind the little toe were two narrow deep punctures from which blood was slowly welling rat i said youve been bitten by a rat yes she said shakily her eyes darkened in remembered terror it was horrible horrible horrible a black rat huge as big as a cat i tried to shake it off but it hung on and on and on its all over now i saidsharply the hysteria had been climbing back into her voice just a moment wherewhere are you going she asked fearfully first aid kit in my case i fetched it squeezed out the wounds and soaked up all the blood with cottonwoof used iodine liberally applied a plaster dressing and pulled on the socks you wont come to any harm from that i lit and gave her a cigarette ripped a spar off one of the wooden crates used it as a lever to rip off a larger spar from another crate and finally used that to wrench off a threefoot long three by one from the biggest crate i could see with three threeinch nails sticking out from the far end it made quite a weapon more than a match for the fangs of any rat as big as a cat marie hopeman had said but i took that with a pinch of saltthey might be as long as a cat but never as bigbut for all that black ships rats could be vicious especially in numbers i went into the cabin again peered around cautiously for the enemy found none picked up the two pillows and blankets from the bunk went out again shook the blankets ostentatiously to demonstrate that there were no rats concealed in the folds wrapped them tightly round her put the pillows behind her back dug out a spare jacket from one of my cases made her put it on and stepped back to admire my handiwork not bad at all i admitted i have the touch mirror and comb perhaps they tell me it does wonders for a womans morale no she smiled shakily at me as long as i cant see it i dont worry you know i dont really think youre tough at all i smiled back at her very enigmatic i thought then used my tie to hang the torch from a batten close by the deckhead i pulled back some battens across the aisle from her and hoisted myself up on a platform of wooden boxes the three by one ready to hand you cant sleep there she protested its too hard and and youll fall off this was something new marie hopeman showing any concern for me ive no intention of going to sleep i said thats for you ratcatcher bentall thats me goodnight we must have been well clear of the land by this time for the schooner was beginning to roll not much but enough to be perceptible the timbers creaked the torch swung to and fro throwing huge black moving shadows and all the time now that our movements and voices had ceased i could hear a constant sibilant rustle either our rodent pals on safari or a cockroach battalion on the march the combination of the creaking the rustling and the black ominous shifting shadows was hardly calculated to induce a mood of soporific tranquillity and i was hardly surprised when after ten minutes marie hopeman spoke areare you asleep are you all right sure im all right i said comfortably goodnight another five minutes then john it was the first time shed ever called me that except when company had made it necessary to keep up the fiction of our marriage hullo oh damn it there was vexation in her voice a small reluctant anger at herself but there was nervousness too and the nervousness had the upper hand come and sit beside me right i said agreeably i jumped down to the deck swung myself up on the other side and seated myself as comfortably as i could with my feet propped against the outboard battens she made no move or stir to acknowledge my arrival she didnt even look at me but i looked at her i looked and i thought of the change a couple of short hours could make on the fourstage hop from london airport to suva shed hardly acknowledged my existence as a human being except in airport terminals and conspicuous seats in a plane where shed smiled at me taken my arm and sweettalked me as any bride of ten weeks ought to have done but the moment we had been alone or secure from observation her normal cool aloof remote personality had dropped between us like a portcullis with a broken hoistrope the previous afternoon waking out of a short sleep on the hawaiisuva hop and drowsily forgetting that we werent being watched id incautiously taken her hand shed taken my right wrist in her right hand slowlyfar too slowly withdrawn her left hand at the same time giving me the kind of look that stays with you for a long time to come if i could have hidden under the seat id have done just that and with the size id felt it would have been no trick at all i didnt make the same mistake again id sworn to myself that i wouldnt make the same mistake again so now sitting beside her in the dank and chilly hold of that gently rolling schooner i reached down and took her hand in mine her hand was icecold and stiffened immediately at my touch next second it was clamped round mine and doing its best to give an imitation of a small but powerful vise i hadnt taken all that of a chance she wasnt scared she was terrified and that was all out of character with marie hopeman i could feel her shiver from time to time and it wasnt all that cold down in the hold why did you bawl me out back in the hotel room she said reproachfully it wasnt nice i seldom am i agreed but that was different you were about to start apologising to me for falling asleep it was the least i could do iim sorry didnt it strike you that our friend fleck might have found it rather curious i asked innocent people with nothing to hide dont strive to keep awake all night along my one thought at the moment was that the less reason fleck had to suspect us of being anything other than we claimed the greater would be our later freedom of movement im sorry she repeated it doesnt matter no harm done a pause did you ever read george orwells her voice was surprised and wary at the same time yes i have remember how the authorities finally broke the resistance of the central character dont she jerked her hand from mine and covered her face with her hands itsits too horrible all sorts of different people have all sorts of different phobias i said gently i took one of her hands away from her face yours just happens to be rats itits not a phobia she said defensively not liking things is not a phobia all sorts of people especially women hate rats and mice i agreed they yell and they scream and they dance about and they make for the highest piece of furniture they can reach but they dont have the pink fits not even if bitten theyre not still shaking like a broken bedspring half an hour after it happens what started all this off she was silent for half a minute then abruptly pushed up the tousled blonde hair at the side of her neck even in the dim halflight i had no difficulty in seeing the scar behind the right ear it must have been a mess at the time i nodded rat i take it how after my parents were drowned on the way to england i was brought up by my uncle and aunt on a farm her voice was not that of a person discussing the faraway green fields of treasured memories there was a daughter three or four years older than i was she was nice so was her mother my aunt and he was the wicked uncle dont laugh its not funny he was all right at first until my aunt died about eight years after i came to them then he started drinking lost the farm and had to move to a smaller place where the only room for me was an attic above the barn okay thats enough i interrupted i can guess the rest i used to lie awake at night with a torch in my hand she whispered a ring of eyes round the room red and pink and white watching me just watching me then id light a candle before going to sleep one night the candle went out and when i woke up thisthisit was caught in my hah and biting and it was dark and i screamed and screamed i told you thats enough i said harshly do you like hurting yourself not nice but necessary im sorry she said in a low voice thats all i was three weeks in hospital not with my neck but because i was a bit out of my mind and then they let me out again all this in a very matteroffact voice i wondered what it cost her to say it i tried not to feel sorry for her not to feel pity involvement with any person was the one thing i couldnt afford but i couldnt help myself from saying your unpleasant experiences werent just confined to the rats were they she twisted to look at me then said slowly you are more shrewd than i had thought not really when you find women behaving in the handsoff down the nose snooty superciliousness affected by some its because they think its an interesting attitude or a mark of superiority or provocative or simply because its a coverup for the fact that they havent sufficient intelligence or common sense to behave and converse like a human being we include you out how about the wicked uncle he was wicked all right she said unsmiling by and by my cousin ran away because she couldnt stand him any longer a week later i did the same but for different reasons some neighbours found me crying in the woods in the dark i was taken to some institution then put in care of a guardian she didnt like any of this and neither did i he had a sick wife and a fullgrown son andand they fought over me then another institution and another and another i had no family i was young a foreigner and had no money some people think the combination entitles them to all right i said you dont like rats and you dont like men ive never had any reason to change my mind about either it was hardly the time to point out that with her face and her figure she had as much chance of escaping attention as a magnet would have of moving untouched through a heap of iron filings instead i cleared my throat and said im a man too so you are id quite forgotten the words meant nothing but the little smile that went with them made me feel ten feet tall ill bet youre just as bad as the rest worse i assured her ravening would be a weak word to describe me thats nice she murmured put your arm around me i stared at her come the dawn i said youll regret this weakness let the dawn look after itself she said comfortably youll stay here all night whats left of it you wont leave me this with a childlike persistence not even for a moment nary a minute i rattled my club against the battens ill sit here and ill keep awake and ill fight off every rat in the south pacific every man in the south pacific too if it conies to that im quite sure you would she said peacefully she was asleep inside a minute chapter two tuesday am pm she slept serenely like one dead for over three hours her breathing so quiet that i could hardly hear it as the time slipped by the rolling of the schooner became increasingly more pronounced until after one particularly violent lurch she woke up with a start and stared at me her eyes reflecting confusion and perhaps a touch of fear then understanding came back and she sat up taking the weight off my arm for the first time in hours hullo knighterrant she said morning feel better mmm she grabbed a batten as another violent lurch sent some loose boxes banging about the hold but i wont be for long not if this sort of thing keeps up nuisance i know but i cant help it whats the time i made to look at the watch on my left wrist but the arm was quite dead i reached it across with my right hand trying not to wince as the pins and needles of returning circulation shot through it she frowned and said whats wrong you told me not to stir all night i pointed out patiently so i didnt you are no light weight young lady im sorry she said quickly she looked at me quizzically colour in her cheeks but smiled without embarrassment its come the dawn and i still dont regret my weakness halfpast eight your watch says must be broad daylight i wonder where were heading north or south were neither quartering nor corkscrewing which means that we have this swell right on the beam i dont remember much of my geography but enough to be pretty sure that at this time of the year the steady easterly trades push up an eastwest swell so north or south i lowered myself stiffly to my feet walked forard along the central aisle to where the two narrow spaces one on each side had been left clear of cargo to give access to the ventilator intakes i moved into those in turn and touched both the port and starboard sides of the schooner high up the port side was definitely warmer than the starboard that meant we were moving more or less due south the nearest land in that direction was new zealand about a thousand miles away i filed away this helpful information and was about to move when i heard voices from above faint but unmistakable i pulled a box down from behind its retaining batten and stood on it the side of my face against the foot of the ventilator the ventilator must have been just outside the radio office and its trumpetshaped opening made a perfect earphone for collecting and amplifying soundwaves i could hear the steady chatter of morse and over and above that the sound of two men talking as clearly as if they had been no more than three feet away from me what they were speaking about id no idea it was in a language id never heard before after a couple of minutes i jumped down replaced the box and went back to marie what took you so long she asked accusingly she knew the rats were still around and a phobia doesnt die away in a night sorry but you may be grateful yet for the delay ive found out that were travelling south but much more important ive found out that we can hear what the people on the upper deck are talking about i told her how id discovered this and she nodded it could be very useful it could be more than useful i watched her as she swung her legs over the side of the boxes then touched the side of the right foot gently how does it feel stiff not very sore i pulled off the socks and one side of the plaster bandage the wound was clean slightly swollen and slightly blue but no more than it had any right to be itll be ok i said hungry well she made a face and rubbed a hand across her stomach its not just that im a bad sailor its the fearful smell down here those ventilators appear to be no damned help in the world i agreed but perhaps some tea might be i moved into the tiny cabin striking an apprehensive match or two to make sure that there were no rats lurking around and called for attention as id done a few hours earlier by hammering on the bulkhead i moved aft and within a minute the hatch was opened i blinked in the blinding glare of light that flooded down into the hold then moved back as someone came down the ladder a man with a lanternjawed face lean and lined and mournful whats all the racket about henry demanded wearily you promised us some breakfast i reminded him so we did he looked at me curiously had a good night you might have told us about the rats i might have hopin they didnt show themselves trouble my wife was badly bitten on the foot i dropped my voice so that marie couldnt hear it rats carry plague dont they he shook his head rats carry fleas the fleas carry plague but not here place is awash in ddt breakfast in ten minutes with that he was gone shutting the hatch behind him less than the promised time later the hatch opened again and a stocky brownhaired youngster with dark frizzy golliwog hair came nimbly down the ladder carrying a battered wooden tray in one hand he grinned at me cheerfully moved up the aisle and set the tray down on the boxes beside marie whipping a dented tin cover off a dish with the air of escoffier unveiling his latest creation i looked at the brown sticky mass i thought i could see rice and shredded coconut whats this i asked last weeks garbage dalo pudding very good sir he pointed to a chipped enamel pot here is coffee also very good he ducked his head at marie and left as nimbly as he had come it went without saying that he shut the hatch behind him the pudding was an indigestible and gelatinous mess that tasted and felt like cooked cowhide glue it was quite inedible but no match for the fearful coffee lukewarm bilgewater strained through old cement sacks do you think theyre trying to poison us marie asked impossible no one could ever eat this stuff in the first place at least no european could by polynesian standards it probably ranks with caviar well there goes breakfast i broke off and looked closely at the crate behind the tray well ill be damned dont miss very much do i ive only been sitting with my back against it for about four hours well you havent eyes in the back of your head she said reasonably i didnt reply id already unhitched the torch and was peering through the inch cracks between the spars of the crate looks like lemonade bottles or some such to me and to me are you developing scruples about managing captain flecks property she asked delicately i grinned latched on to my antirat club pried off the top spar pulled out a bottle and handed it to marie watch it probably neat bootleg gin for sale to the natives but it wasnt it was lemon juice and excellent stuff at that excellent for thirst but hardly a substitute for breakfast i took off my jacket and began to investigate the contents of the schooners hold captain fleck appeared to be engaged in the perfectly innocuous business of provision carrier the halffilled spaces between the two sets of battens on either side were taken up by crates of food and drink meat fruit and soft drinks probably stuff he loaded up on one of the larger islands before setting off to pick up copra it seemed a reasonable guess but then fleck didnt seem like an innocuous man i finished off a breakfast of corned beef and pearsmarie passed it up with a shudderthen began to investigate the contents of the boxes and crates packed ceiling high between the two outer rows of battens and the sides of the schooner but i didnt get very far the battens in those rows werent of the freesliding type in the inboard rows but were hinged at the top and were designed to lift upwards and inwards with their lower halfs jammed by the boxes in the inner rows this was quite impossible but two of the battens the two directly behind the lemonade crate were loose i examined their tops with the torch and could see that there were no hinges attaching them to the deckhead from the freshness of the wood where the screws had been the hinges appeared to have been recently removed i pushed the battens as far apart as possible wrestled the top box out of position without breaking my neck not so easy as it sounds for the boxes were heavy and the rolling of the schooner pretty violent by this timeand placed it on the platform where wed spent the night the box was about two feet long by eighteen inches wide and a foot deep made of oiled yellow pine on each of the four corners of the lid was the broad arrow property mark of the royal navy at the top a stencil semiobliterated by a thick black line said fleet air arm below that were the words alcohol compasses and beneath that again redundant authorised for disposal followed by a stencilled crown very official looking i pried the top off with some difficulty and the stencils didnt lie six unmarked alcohol compasses packed in straw and white paper looks ok to me i said ive seen those stencils before redundant is a nice naval term for obsolete gets a better price from civilian buyers maybe captain fleck is in the legitimate exgovernment surplus stock disposal trade maybe captain fleck had his own private stock of stencils marie said skeptically how about the next one i got the next one down this was stencilled binoculars and binoculars it contained the third box had again the fleet air arm marking semiobliterated and the stencil inflatable lifebelts and again the stencil didnt lie bright red lifebelts with co charges and yellow cylinders marked shark repellent were wasting our time i said having to brace ones self against the heavy rolling of the schooner made the lifting and prying open of the boxes heavy work the heat in the hold was building up as the sun climbed in the sky and the sweat was pouring down my face and back just a commonorgarden secondhand dealer secondhand dealers dont kidnap people she said tartly just one more please i have a feeling i checked the impulse to say that it was easy enough to have a feeling when you didnt have to do the sweating lugged a fourth and very heavy box off the steadily diminishing pile and lowered it beside the others the same disposal stencils as before contents marked champion spark plugs gross it took me five minutes and a twoinch strip of skin from the back of my right hand to get the lid off marie carefully avoided looking at me maybe she was a mindreader maybe she was just getting good and seasick but she turned as the lid came clear peered inside then glanced up at me maybe captain fleck does have his own stencils she murmured maybe he does at that i acknowledged the case was full of drums but the drums werent full of spark plugs there was enough machinegun belt ammunition inside the case to start off a fairsized revolution this interests me strangely isis it safe if captain fleck whats captain fleck ever done for me let him come if he wants to i lugged out a fifth case sneered at the spark plug stencil wrenched off the lid with a combination of leverage and a few wellchosen kicks stared down at the writing on the heavy blue paper wrapped round the contents then replaced the lid with all the gentle tenderness and reverent care of a chicago gangster placing a wreath on the grave of his latest victim ammonal aluminium powder marie too had glimpsed the writing what on earth is that a very powerful blasting explosive just about enough to send the schooner and everybody aboard it into orbit i lifted it gingerly back into position and fresh sweat came to my face when i thought of the elan with which i had hammered it open damn tricky stuff too wrong temperature wrong handling excessive humiditywell it makes quite a bang i dont like this hold so much any more i caught up the ammunition crate and returned that also thistledown never fell so light as that box did on top of the ammonal are you putting them all back there was a tiny frown between her eyes what does it look like to you scared no terrified the next box might have had nitroglycerine or some such that really would be something i replaced all the boxes and battens took the torch and went aft to see what else there was but there wasnt much on the port side six diesel oil drums all full kerosene ddt and some fivegallon water drums shaped and strapped for carrying over the shouldersfleck i supposed would need these when he topped up water supplies in the more remote islands where there were no other loading facilities on the starboard side there were a couple of square metal boxes halffull of assorted and rusted ships ironmongerynuts bolts eyebolts blocks tackles bottle screws even a couple of marlin spikes i eyed the spikes longingly but left them where they were it didnt seem likely that captain fleck would have overlooked the possibility but even if he had a marlinspike was a good deal slower than a bullet and very difficult to conceal i walked back to marie hopeman she was very pale nothing there at all any ideas about what to do now you can do what you like she said calmly im going to be sick oh lord i ran for the cabin hammered on the bulkhead and was standing below the hatch when it opened it was captain fleck himself cleareyed rested freshlyshaved and clad in white ducks he courteously removed his cheroot before speaking a splendid morning bentall i trust you my wifes sick i interrupted she needs fresh air can she come up on deck sick fever his tone changed i heard a rat had seasick i yelled at him on a day like this fleck halfstraightened and looked around what he probably regarded as an expanse of flat calm one minute he snapped his fingers said something i couldnt catch and waited till the boy whod brought us breakfast came running up with a pair of binoculars fleck made a slow careful sweep of the horizon then lowered the glasses she can come up you too if you like i called marie and let her precede me up the ladder fleck gave her a helping hand over the edge of the hatch and said solicitously im so sorry to hear that you are not too well mrs bentall you dont look too good and thats a fact you are most kind captain fleck her tone and look would have shrivelled me but it bounced right off fleck he snapped his fingers again and the boy appeared with a couple of sunshaded deckchairs you are welcome to remain as long as you wish both of you if you are told to go below you must do so immediately that is understood i nodded silently good you will not of course be so foolish as to try anything foolish our friend rabat is no annie oakley but he could hardly miss at this range i turned my head and saw the little indian still in black but without his jacket now sitting on the other side of the hatch with his sawnoff shotgun across his knees it was pointed straight at my head and he was looking at me in a longing fashion i didnt care for i must leave you now fleck went on he smiled showing his brown crooked teeth we shipmasters have our business to attend to i will see you later he left us to fix up the deckchairs and went forard into the wheelhouse beyond the wireless cabin marie stretched herself out with a sigh closed her eyes and in five minutes had the colour back in her cheeks in ten minutes she had fallen asleep i should have liked to do the same myself but colonel raine wouldnt have liked it eternal vigilance my boy was his repeated watchword so i looked round me as vigilantly as i could but there was nothing much to be vigilant about above a hot white sun in a washedout bluewhite sky to the west a greenblue sea to the east the sunward side deep green sparkling waters pushed into a long low swell by the warm knot trade wind off to the southeast some vague and purplish blurs on the horizon that might have been islands or might equally well have been my imagination and in the whole expanse of sea not a ship or boat in sight not even a flying fish i transferred my vigilance to the schooner perhaps it wasnt the filthiest vessel in all the seven seas id never seen them all but it would have taken a good ship to beat it it was bigger much bigger than i had thought close on a hundred feet in length and everyone of them greasy cluttered with refuse unwashed and unpainted or there had been paint but most of it had sunblistered off two masts sparred and rigged to carry sails but no sails in sight and between the mastheads a wireless aerial that trailed down to the radio cabin about twenty feet forard from where i sat i could see the rusted ventilator beyond its open door and beyond that a place that might have been flecks charthouse or cabin or both and still further forard but on a higher elevation the closedin bridge beyond that again i supposed below deck level would be the crew quarters i spent almost five minutes gazing thoughtfully at the superstructure and fore part of the ship with the odd vague feeling that there was something wrong that there was something as it shouldnt have been maybe colonel raine would have got it but i couldnt i felt i had done my duty to the colonel and keeping my eyes open any longer wouldnt help anyone asleep or awake they could toss us over the side whenever they wished id had three hours sleep in the past fortyeight i closed my eyes i went to sleep when i awoke it was just on noon the sun was almost directly overhead but the chair shades were wide and the trade winds cool captain fleck had just seated himself on the side of the hatchway apparently whatever business he had had to attend to was over and guessing the nature of that business was no trick at all hed just finished a long and difficult interview with a bottle of whisky his eyes were slightly glazed and even at three feet to windward id no difficulty at all in smelling the scotch but conscience or maybe something else had got into him for he was carrying a tray with glasses a bottle of sherry and a small stone jar well send you a bit of food byandby he sounded almost apologetic thought you might like a snifter first uhhuh i looked at the stone jar whats in it cyanide scotch he said shortly he poured out two drinks drained his own at a gulp and nodded at marie who was lying facing us her face almost completely hidden under her windblown hair how about mrs bentall let her sleep she needs it whos giving you the orders for all of this fleck eh he was offbalance but only for a second his tolerance to alcohol seemed pretty high orders what orders whose orders what are you going to do with us impatient to find out arent you bentall i just love it here not very communicative are you have another drink i havent even started this one how much longer do you intend keeping us here he thought it over for a bit then said slowly i dont know your guess isnt so far out im not the principal in this there was somebody very anxious indeed to see you he gulped down some more whisky but he isnt so sure now he might have told you that before you took us from the hotel he didnt know then radio not five minutes ago hes coming through again at hoursseven oclock sharp youll have your answer then i hope you like it there was something sombre in his voice that i didnt find very encouraging he switched his glance to marie looked at her for a long time in silence then stirred kind of a nice girl you got there bentall sure thats my wife fleck look the other way he turned slowly and looked at me his face hard and cold but there was something else in it too i just couldnt put my finger on it if i were ten years younger or maybe even a half a bottle soberer he said without animosity id have your front teeth for that bentall he looked away across the green dazzle of the ocean the glass of whisky forgotten in his hand i got a daughter just a year or two younger than her right now shes in the university of california liberal arts thinks her old mans a captain in the australian navy he swirled the drink around in his glass maybe its better she keeps on thinking just that maybe its better that she never sees me again but if i knew i would never see her again i got it im no einstein but i dont have to be beaten over the head more than a few times to make me see the obvious the sun was hotter than ever but i didnt feel warm any more i didnt want him to realise that he had been talking to me too not just to himself so i said youre no australian are you fleck no no you talk like one but its an overlaid accent im as english as you are he growled but my homes in australia whos paying you for all this fleck he rose abruptly to his feet gathered up the empty glasses and bottles and went away without another word it wasnt until about halfpast five in the evening that fleck came to tell us to get below maybe hed spotted a vessel on the horizon and didnt want to take the chance of anyone seeing us if they approached too closely maybe he just thought wed been on deck long enough or maybe it had something to do with that dark brown smudge i could vaguely make out on the southern horizon just off the starboard bow it could have been cloud of course but even through that heat haze it looked too solidand too solitaryfor cloud it was difficult to estimate its distancefifteen maybe twenty miles away the prospect of returning to that stinking and ratinfested hole was no pleasure but apart from the fact that both of us had slept nearly all day and felt rested again we werent too reluctant to go black cumulus thunderheads had swept up out of the east in the late afternoon an obscured sun had turned the air cool and the rain wasnt far away it looked as if it were going to be a black and dirty night the sort of night that would suit captain fleck very well indeed the sort of night i hoped that would suit us even better the hatchcover dropped in place behind us and the bolt slid home marie gave a little shiver and hugged herself tightly well another night in the ritz coming up you should have asked for fresh batteriesthat torch isnt going to last us all night it wont have to one way or another weve spent our last night on this floating garbage can just as we came down i thought i saw an island way ahead i could be wrong and if ive made a mistake about it well its my last mistake but its also our last chance were leaving this evening just as soon as its good and dark if fleck had his way well be leaving with a couple of iron bars tied to our feet if i have mine well leave without them if i were a betting man id put my money on fleck what do you mean she whispered youyou were sure that nothing was going to happen to us remember all the reasons you gave me when we arrived on board last night you said fleck was no killer i still dont think he is not by nature anyway hes been drinking all day trying to drown his conscience but there are many things that can make a man do what he doesnt want to do even kill threats blackmail a desperate need for money i was speaking to him while you slept it seems that whoever wanted me out here no longer needs me what it was for i dont know but whatever it was the end appears to have been achieved without me he told you that wethat we he told me nothing directly he merely said that the person who had arranged the kidnap thought that he no longer wanted meor us the definite word is to come through at seven but from the way fleck spoke there wasnt much doubt about what the word is going to be i think old flecks got a soft spot for you and he spoke of you by inference as if you already belonged to the past very touching very wistful she touched my arm looked up at me with a strange expression id never seen before and said simply im scared its funny all of a sudden i look into the future and i dont see it and im scared are you of course im scared i said irritably what do you think i dont think you are its just something you say i know youre not afraidnot of death anyway its not that youre any braver than the rest of us its just that if death came your way youd be so busy figuring planning calculating scheming working out a way to beat it that youd never even see it coming except in an academic sort of way youre working out a way to beat it now youre sure you will beat it death for you death that even one chance in a million might avoid would be the supreme insult she smiled at me rather selfconsciously then went on colonel raine told me a good deal about you he said that when things are completely desperate and theres no hope left its in the nature of man to accept the inevitable but he said you wouldnt not because it was any positive thing but just because you wouldnt even know how to set about giving up he said he thought you were the one man he could ever be afraid of for if you were strapped to an electric chair and the executioner was pulling the switch youd still be figuring a way to beat it shed been abstractedly twisting one of my shirt buttons until it was just about off but i said nothing if that blur id seen on the southern horizon really had been cloud one shirt button more or less wasnt going to matter very much that night and now she looked up and smiled again to rob her next words of offence i think youre a very arrogant man i think youre a man with a complete belief in himself but one of these days youre going to meet up with a situation where your selfbelief is going to be of just no help at all mark my words i said nastily you forgot to say mark my words the smile faded and she turned away as the hatch opened it was the brownskinned fijian boy with soup some sort of stew and coffee he came and left without a word i looked at marie ominous eh what do you mean she said coldly our fijian friend this morning a grin from ear to ear tonight the look of a surgeon whos just come out to tell you that his scalpel slipped so its not the custom i said patiently to crack gags and do a songanddance act when youre bringing the last meal to the condemned man the better penitentiaries frown on it oh she said flatly i see do you want to sample this stuff i went on or will i just throw it away i dont know she said doubtfully i havent eaten for twentyfour hours ill try it was worth the try the soup was good the stew better the coffee excellent the cook had made a miraculous recovery from the depths hed plumbed that morning or maybe theyd shot the old one id more to think of i drained my coffee and looked at marie you can swim i take it not very well she said hesitantly i can float provided there are no iron bars tied to your feet i nodded thatll be enough would you like to do a little listening while i do a little work of course she was getting round to forgiving me we went forard and i pulled down a couple of boxes for her to stand on just below the opening to the port ventilator you wont miss much of what they say up top i said especially youll hear everything thats said in or by the radio room probably nothing much before seven but you never know im afraid youre going to get a bit of a crick in the neck but ill relieve you as soon as im through i left her there went back to the after end of the hold climbed three steps up the iron ladder and made a rough estimate of the distance between the top rung and the bottom of the hatchcover above then i came down and started rummaging around in the metal boxes in the starboard corner until i found a bottlescrew that suited me picked up a couple of hardwood battens and stowed them away together with the bottlescrew behind some boxes back at the platform of wooden boxes where wed spent the night i pushed aside the two loose battens in the outboard row cautiously lifted down the boxes with the compasses and binoculars shoved them to one side took down the box with the aircrafttype life belts and emptied out the contents there were twelve of the belts altogether rubber and reinforced canvas covers with leather harness instead of the more usual tapes in addition to the co bottle and sharkrepellent cylinder each belt had another waterproof cylinder with a wire leading up to a small red lamp fixed on the left shoulder strap there would be a battery inside that cylinder i pressed the little switch on one of them and the lamp at once glowed a deep bright red indication that the equipment though obsolete was not old and good augury for the operating efficiency of the gas and watertightness of the inflated belts but it wasnt a thing to be left to chance i picked out four belts at random and struck the release knob on the first of them the immediate hiss of compressed gas wasnt so terribly loud i supposed but inside that confined space it seemed as if everybody aboard the schooner must hear it certainly marie heard it for she jumped off her box and came quickly back into the pool of light cast by the suspended torch whats that she asked quickly what made the noise no rats no snakes no fresh enemies i assured her the hissing had now stopped and i held up a round stiff fullyinflated lifebelt for her inspection just testing seems ok ill test one or two more but ill try to keep it quiet heard anything yet nothing plenty of talk that is fleck and that australian man but its mostly about charts courses islands cargoes things like that and their girl friends in suva that must be interesting not the way they tell it she snapped dreadful i agreed just what you were saying last night men are all the same better get back before you miss anything she gave me a long considering look but i was busy testing the other lifebelts muffling the noise under the two blankets and the pillows all four worked perfectly and when after ten minutes none showed any sign of deflation the chances seemed high that all the others were at least as good i picked out another four hid them behind some boxes deflated the four id tested and replaced them in the box with the others a minute later id all the battens and boxes back in place i looked at my watch it lacked fifteen minutes to seven there was little enough time left i went aft again inspected the water drums with my torch heavy canvas carrying straps the shell concave to fit the back fiveinch diameter springloaded lid at top a spigot with tap at the bottom they looked sound enough i dragged two of them out of the corner snapped open the lids and saw that they were nearly full i closed the lids again and shook the drums as vigorously as possible no water escaped they were completely tight i turned both the taps on full let the water come gushing out on the deckit wasnt my schoonerthen when they were as empty as i could get them mopped their interiors dry with a shirt from my case and made my way forard to marie anything yet i whispered nothing ill take overfor a bit heres the torch i dont know what things there are that go bump in the night in the pacific ocean but it is possible that those lifebelts may get torn or just turn out to be perished through age so i think well take along a couple of empty water drums they have a very high degree of buoyancy far more than we require so i thought we might as well use them to take along some clothes inside whatever you think youll need dont spend all night deciding what to take incidentally i believe many women carry cellophane bags in their cases for wrapping up this and that got any one or two leave one out please right she hesitated i dont know much about boats but i think this one has changed course once or twice in the past hour how do you figure that out old seadog bentall very tolerant to the landlubbers were not rolling any more are we the waves are passing under us from the stern and its the second or third change ive noticed she was right the swell had died down considerably but what little was left was from aft but i paid small attention to this i knew the trades died away at night and local currents could set up all kinds of crossmotions in the water it didnt seem worth worrying about she went away and i pressed close to the deckhead all i could hear at first was a violently loud tinny rattling against the ventilator a rattling that grew more violent and persistent with every second that passed rain and very heavy rain at that it sounded like rain that meant to keep going on for a long time both fleck and i would be happy about that and then i heard flecks voice first the patter of hurrying footsteps then his voice i guessed that he was standing just inside the doorway of the wireless cabin time you got your earphones on henry the voice had a reverberating and queerly metallic timbre from its passage down the funnelshaped ventilator but was perfectly plain just on schedule six minutes yet boss henry seated at the radio table must have been five feet away from fleck yet his voice was hardly less distinct the ventilators amplifying effects were as good as that doesnt matter tune in i strained my ear against that ventilator until it seemed to me that i was about halfway up it but i heard nothing further after a couple of minutes i felt a tug at my sleeve all done she said in a low voice heres the torch right i jumped down helped her up and murmured for heavens sake dont move from there our friend henrys listening in for the final word right now i had little enough left to do and three or four minutes saw me all through i stuffed a blanket inside the cellophane bag and tied the neck securely that made me the complete optimist there were an awful lot of its attached to that blanket if we managed to break open the hatch if we managed to get off the schooner without too many bullet holes in us if we didnt subsequently drown if we werent eaten alive by sharks or barracuda or whatever else took a fancy to us during the hours of darkness if that island were far away from our jumpingoff point or worse didnt exist at all then it seemed like a good idea to have a watersoaked blanket to ward off sunstroke but i didnt want to have to cope with its waterlogged dead weight during the night hence the cellophane bag i tied the bag on to one of the drums and had just finished stowing some clothes and cigarettes inside the same drum when marie came aft and stood beside me she said without preamble and in a quiet still voice not scared they dont need us any more well at least all my preparations havent been wasted they discussed it yes they might have been discussing the weather i think youre wrong about fleck hes not worried about doing away with anyone from the way he talked it was just an interesting problem henry asked him how they were going to get rid of us and fleck said lets do it nice and quiet and civilized well tell them that the boss has changed his mind well tell them theyre to be delivered to him as soon as possible well forget and forgive well take them up to the cabin for a drink slip them the knockout drops then ease them soft and gently over the side a charming fellow we drown peacefully and even if we do wash up somewhere therell be no bullet holes to start people asking questions but a postmortem can always show the presence of poison or narcotics any postmortem carried out on us i interrupted heavily could be made without the doctor taking his hands from his pockets if there are no broken bones you cant determine anything about the cause of death from a couple of nice clean shiny skeletons which would be all that was left after the denizens of the deep had finished with us or maybe the sharks eat bones too i wouldnt know do you have to talk like that she asked coldly im only trying to cheer myself up i handed her a couple of lifebelts adjust the shoulder straps so that you can wear them both round your waist one above the other be careful that you dont strike the co release accidentally wait till you are in the water before you inflate i was already shrugging into my own harness she appeared to be taking her time about adjusting the straps so i said please hurry there is no hurry she said henry said i suppose well have to wait a couple of hours before we do anything and fleck said yes that at least maybe theyre going to wait until it gets really dark or maybe they dont want the crew to see anything the reasons dont matter what does matter is that the twohour delay refers to the time when they intend ditching us maybe there is an island and they want to get well past it in case we should be washed up there before the sharks get to us they could come for us any time and youre overlooking the fact that when they do discover were missing the first thing theyll do is to backtrack and search i dont much fancy being run down by a schooner or chopped to pieces by a propeller blade or just used for a little target practice the sooner were gone the less chance we have of being picked up when they do discover were missing i hadnt thought of that she admitted its like the colonel told you i said bentall thinks of everything she didnt think that worth any comment so we finished fixing the lifebelts in silence i gave her the torch and asked her to hold it in position while i climbed up the ladder with the bottlescrew and two hardwood battens and set about opening the hatch i placed one of the hardwood battens on the top rung set one end of the bottlescrew on the wood directly above the rung and unscrewed the upper eyebolt until it was firmly against the other batten which id placed under the hatch to spread the load i could hear the rain drumming furiously on the hatch and shivered involuntarily at the prospect of the imminent soaking which was pretty silly when i came to consider just how much wetter i would be a few seconds later forcing that hatchcover was easy either the wood of the cover was old and dry or the screws holding the bolt in position were rusted for id only given the central shank of the bottlescrew halfadozen turns the counterthreaded eyebolts steadily forcing themselves further apart when i heard the first creak of the wood beginning to give way and splinter another halfdozen turns and suddenly all resistance to my turning had ceased the bolt had come clear of its moorings and the way out was clearif that was to say fleck and his friends werent standing there patiently waiting to blow my head off as soon as it appeared above the level of the hatch there was only one way to find that out it didnt appeal much but at least it was logical i would stick my head out and see what happened to it i handed down the battens and bottlescrew checked that the two water drums were conveniently to hand softly told marie to switch off the torch eased the hatchcover open a few inches and cautiously felt for the bolt it was just where it ought to have been lying loose on top of the hatchcover i lowered it gently to the deck bent my back as i took another two steps up the ladder hooked my fingers over the edge of the hatchcover and straightened both back and arm in one movement so that the hinged cover swung vertically open and my head was suddenly two feet above deck level a jackinthebox couldnt have done any better nobody shot me nobody shot me because there was nobody there to shoot me and mere was nobody there to shoot me because no one but a very special type of moron would have ventured out on that deck without an absolutely compelling reason even then he would have required a suit of armour if you were willing to stand at the bottom of niagara falls and say to yourself that it was only raining then you could have said it was raining that night if anyone ever gets around to inventing a machine gun that fires water instead of bullets ill know exactly what it will be like at the receiving end enormous cold drops of water so close together as to be almost a solid wall lashed the schooner with a ferocity and intensity i would not have believed possible the decks were a welter of white seething foam as those cannonball giant drops disintegrated on impact and rebounded high into the air while the sheer physical weight the pitiless savagery of that torrential rain drumming on your bent back was nothing short of terrifying within five seconds i was literally soaked to the skin i had to fight the almost overwhelming impulse to pull that cover shut over my head and retreat to the haven of that suddenly warm and dry and infinitely desirable hold but then i thought of fleck and his knockout drops and of a couple of nice new shiny skeletons on the floor of the sea and i had the hatchcover fully back and was on deck calling softly for the water drums before i was properly aware of what i was doing fifteen seconds later marie and the two drums were on deck and i was lowering the hatchcover back into position and placing the bolt in approximately the original position in case someone did venture out later on a tour of inspection with the darkness and blinding rain visibility didnt exceed a few feet and we felt rather than saw our way to the stern of the schooner i leaned far over the rail on the port counter to try to establish the position of the screw for although the schooner was making hardly any more than three knots nowi supposed the lack of visibility must have forced fleck to reduce speedeven so that screw could still chop us up pretty badly at least that at first i could see nothing just a sea surface that was no longer that but a churned and hissing expanse of milky white froth but my eyes were gradually becoming more adjusted to the darkness and after a minute or so i could clearly make out the smooth black water in the rainfree shelter under the long overhang of the schooners stern not quite blackit was black flecked with the sparkling iridescence of phosphorus and it wasnt long before i traced the area of maximum turbulence that gave rise to the phosphorescence that was where the screw wasand it was far enough forward to let us drop off over the sternpost without any fear of being sucked into the vortex of the screw marie went first she held a water drum in one hand while i lowered her by the other until she was halfsubmerged in the water then i let go five seconds later i was in the water myself no one heard us go no one saw us go and we didnt see fleck and his schooner go he wasnt using his steaming lights that night with the line of business he was in hed probably forgotten where the switch was chapter three tuesday pmwednesday am after the numbing stinging cold of that torrential rain the water in the sea was almost blissfully warm there were no waves any that dared show their heads were beaten flat by that deluge and what little swell there was was long enough to be no more than a gentle undulation on the surface of the sea the wind still seemed to be from the east that was if my assumption that the schooner had still been travelling south had been correct for the first thirty seconds or so i couldnt see marie i knew she could be only yards away but the rain bouncing off the water raised so dense and impenetrable a curtain that nothing at sea level could be seen through its milky opacity i shouted twice but there was no reply i took halfadozen strokes towing the can behind me and literally bumped into her she was coughing and spluttering as if she had swallowed some water but she still retained hold of her water drum and seemed otherwise unharmed she was high in the water so she must at least have remembered to operate the co release switch on her lifebelt i put my head close to hers and said all right yes she coughed some more and said my face and neck that rainthey feel cut it was too dark to see whether her face was in fact cut but i could believe it my own face felt as if it had blundered into a wasps nest black mark for bentall the first and most obvious thing that i should have done after opening that hatch and feeling the lash of that cannonading rain should have been to dig some of the leftover clothes out of our suitcases and wrap them round our heads bandannafashion but too late for tears now i reached for the plastic bag attached to my drum ripped it open and spread the blanket over our heads we could still feel the impact of that rain like a shower of huge hailstones but at least our skins were no longer exposed it was better than nothing when id finished arranging it marie said what do we do now stay here in our tent or start swimming i passed up all the obvious remarks about wondering whether we should swim for australia or south america they didnt even begin to seem funny in the circumstances and said i think we should try to move away from here if this rain keeps up fleck will never find us but theres no guarantee that it will last we might as well swim west thats the way the wind and the swell are running its roughly the direction in which the island would lie if fleck hasnt altered course too much and its easiest for us isnt that the way fleck would think and move to the west looking for us if he thinks were only half as twisted as he is himself hell probably figure weve gone in the other direction heads you win tails you lose come on we made poor speed as shed said she was no shakes as a swimmer and those two drums and the soggy heavy blanket didnt help us much but we did cover a fair bit of ground in the first hour swimming for ten minutes resting for five if it hadnt been for the thought that we could do this sort of thing for the next month and still not arrive anywhere it would have been quite pleasant the sea was still warm the rain was beginning to ease and the sharks stayed to home after an hour and a half or what i guessed to be approximately that during which marie became very quiet rarely speaking not even answering when i spoke to her i said enough thisll do us any energy we have left well use for survival if fleck swings this far off course its just bad luck and not much that we can do about it i let my legs sink down into the sea then let out an involuntary exclamation as if i had been bitten or stung something large and solid had brushed by my leg and although there are a lot of large and solid things in the sea all i could think of was of something about fifteen feet long with a triangular fin and a mouth like an unsprung beartrap and then it came to me that id felt no swirl or disturbance in the water and i cautiously lowered my legs again just as marie said what is it whats the matter i wish old fleck would bring his schooner by here i said yearningly that would be the end of both of them it wasnt that something large and solid had brushed by my leg it had been my leg brushing by something large and solid which was a different thing altogether im standing in about four feet of water there was a momentary pause then she said me too it was the slow dazed answer of one who cannot believe something more accurately of one who cant understand something and i found it vaguely puzzling what do you think land dear girl i said expansively i felt a bit lightheaded with relief i hadnt given tuppence for our chances of survival must be that island we thought we saw the way the seabed is sloping up it can be nothing else nows our chance to see those dazzling sands and waving palms and the brownskinned beauties weve heard so much about give me your hand there was no answering levity or even gladness from her she just took my hand in silence as i transferred the blanket to my other hand and started feeling my cautious way up the rapidly shelving seafloor in less than a minute we were standing on rock and on any other night we would have been high and dry in that rain we were high and wet but we were high nothing else mattered we lifted both water drums on to the shore and i draped the blanket over maries head the rain had slackened but slackening on that night was a comparative thing only it was still fierce enough to be hurtful i said im just going to take a brief look round back in five minutes all right she said dully it didnt seem to matter whether i came or went i was back in two minutes not five id taken eight steps and fallen into the sea on the other side and it didnt take me long to discover that our tiny island was only about four times as long as it was broad and consisted of nothing but rock i would have liked to see robinson crusoe making out on that little lot marie hadnt moved from where i had left her its just a little rock in the middle of the sea i reported but at least were safe for the present anyway yes she rubbed the rock with the toe of her sandal its coral isnt it i suppose so as with many others the sundrenched coral islands of the pacific had formed a staple part of my earlier reading diet but when i incautiously sat down to take the weight off my feet and stock of the situation my youthful enthusiasms vanished pretty rapidly if this was coral it felt like the sort of thing an indian fakir might graduate to after hed mastered the easier stuff like sleeping on a bed of redhot nails the rock was hard broken jagged and with frequent spiny razorsharp edges i pushed myself quickly to my feet careful not to cut my hand on the coral picked up the two drums and set them down on the highest part of the reef i went back for marie took her arm and we sat down side by side on the drums with our backs to the wind and the rain she offered me part of the blanket as protection and i wasnt too proud to take it it at least gave the illusion of shelter i talked to her for some time but she had only monosyllables to offer in return then i dug a couple of cigarettes out from the packet id stowed in my water drum and offered her one which she took but that wasnt very successful either for the blanket leaked like a sieve and inside a minute both cigarettes were completely sodden after ten minutes or so i said whats the matter marie i agree that this is not the grand pacific hotel but at least were alive yes a pause then matter of factly i thought i was going to die out there tonight i expected to die i was so sure i would that thiswell its a sort of anticlimax its not real not yet you understand no what made you sure you were going to i broke off for a moment dont tell me that youre still thinking along the same daft lines as you were last night she nodded in the darkness i felt the movement of the blanket rather than saw that of her head im sorry i really am i cant help it maybe im not well its never been like this before she said helplessly you look into the future but almost all the time there isnt any but if you do catch glimpses of it youre not there yourself its a kind of curtain drawn between you and tomorrow and because you cant see past it you feel that there is none no tomorrow i mean superstitious rubbish i said shortly just because youre tired and out of sorts and soaked and shivering you start having recourse to those morbid fancies youre no help to me just no help at all half the time i think colonel raine was right and that you would make a firstclass partner in this godforsaken racket of ours and half the time im convinced that youre going to be a deadweight round my neck and drag me under it was cruel but i meant to be kind god knows how youve managed to survive in this business until now i told you its new something completely new for me it is superstitious nonsense and ill not mention it again she reached out and touched my hand its so terribly unfair to you im sorry i didnt feel proud of myself at all i let the subject go and returned to the consideration of the south pacific i was coming to the conclusion that i didnt much care for the south pacific the rain was the worst id ever known coral was nasty sharp dangerous stuff it was inhabited by a bunch of homicidallyminded characters and another shattered illusion the nights could be very cold indeed i felt clammy and chilled under the clinging wetness of that blanket and both of us were shaken by uncontrollable bouts of shivering which grew more frequent as the night wore on at one stage it seemed to me that the sensible and logical thing for us to do would be to lie down in the very much warmer sea water and spend the night like that but when i went briefly to test this theory i changed my mind the water was warm enough what changed my mind was a tentacle that appeared from a cleft in the coral and wrapped itself round my left ankle the octopus to which it belonged couldnt have weighed more than a few pounds but it still took most of my sock with it as i wrenched my leg away which gave me some idea of what to expect if its big brother happened by it was the longest the most miserable night i have ever known it must have been about midnight when the rain eased off but it continued in a steady drizzle until shortly before dawn sometimes i dozed off sometimes marie did but when she did it was a restless troubled sleep her breathing too shallow and quick her hands too cold her forehead too warm sometimes we both rose and stumbled around precariously on the rough slippery rock to get our circulation moving again but mostly we just sat in silence i stared out into the rain and the darkness and i thought of just three things during the interminable hours of that night the island we were on captain fleck and marie hopeman i knew little enough about polynesian islands but i did recall that those coral islets were of two types atolls and barrier reefs for larger islands if we were on the former a broken circular and probably uninhabited ring of coral islets the future looked bleak indeed but if it were part of a reef enclosing the lagoon round a large and possibly inhabited island then we might still be lucky i thought of captain fleck i thought of how much i would give for the chance of meeting him again and what would happen then and i wondered why he had done what he had done and who was the man behind the kidnap and attempted murder one thing seemed certain and that was that the missing scientists and their wives were going to stay missing i had been classified as redundant and would never now find out where they were or what had happened to them right then i wasnt so worried about them the longing to meet up with fleck was the predominant emotion in my mind a strange man a hard callous ruthless man but a man i would have sworn was not all bad but i knew nothing of him all i did know now with certainty was his reason for deciding to wait till nine oclock before getting rid of us he must have known that the schooner had been passing a coral reef and if theyd thrown us overboard at seven oclock we might well have been washed up before morning if we had been found identifiedand traced back to the grand pacific hotel fleck would have had a great deal of explaining to do and i thought of marie hopeman not as a person but as a problem whatever dark forebodings had possessed her had had no validity in themselves they were just symptomatic of something else and i no longer had any doubts about what that something else was she was sick not mentally but physically the succession of bad flights from england to suva and then the night on the boat and now this all added up to far too little sleep and too little food and the lack of those coupled with physical exhaustion had lowered her resistance till she was pretty open to anything that came along and what was coming along was fever or chill or just plain oldfashioned flu there had certainly been plenty of that around when we had left london i didnt like to think what the outcome was going to be if she had to spend another twentyfour hours in seasoaked clothes on this bare and exposed islet or even twelve sometime during the night my eyes became so tired from staring into the rain and the darkness that i began to have some mild forms of hallucination i thought i could see lights moving in the ramblurred distance and that was bad enough but when i began to imagine i could hear voices i resolutely shut my eyes and tried to force myself into sleep sitting hunched forward on a watercan with only a soaking blanket for cover falling off to sleep is quite a feat but i finally made it about an hour before the dawn i awoke with the sun hot on my back i awoke to the sound of voices real voices this time i awoke to the most beautiful sight i had ever seen i flung back the overhanging blanket as marie stirred and rubbed the sleep from her eyes it was a gleaming glorious dazzling world a peaceful sunwarmed panorama of beauty that made the long night just gone a dark nightmare that could never have been a string of coral isles and reefs reefs painted in the most impossible greens and yellows and violets and browns and whites stretched away on both sides from us in two huge curving horns that all but encircled and enclosed a huge lagoon of burnished aquamarine and beyond the lagoon the most remarkablyshaped island id ever laid eyes on it was as if some giant hand had cut a giant stetson down the middle and thrown one half away the island reached its highest point in the extreme north where it plunged vertically down into the sea from this peak it sloped down steeply to the east and southi could only guess that it would be the same on the westand where the wide brim of the stetson would have been was a flat plain running down to beaches of dazzling white sand which even at that hour of the morning and at a distance of three miles was positively hurtful to the eyes the mountain itself a rich bluishpurple in that early sunlight was bald and bare of any vegetation the plain below was bare too only scrub bushes and grass with scattered palms down near the waters edge but i didnt spend much time on the scenery id like to think id be right in there with the next man when it came to appreciating the beauties of nature but not after a rainsoaked and chilly night on an exposed reef i was far more interested in the outrigger canoe that was coming arrowing in towards us through the mirrorcalm waters of that green lagoon there were two men in it big sturdy brownskinned men with huge mops of crinkly black hair and their paddles were driving in perfect unison into and through the gleaming glass of those waters faster than i would have believed possible moving so quickly that the flying spray from the paddles was a continuously iridescent rainbow glitter in the rays of the rising sun less than twenty yards away from the reef they dug their paddles deep slowed down their outrigger canoe and brought it slewing round to a standstill less than ten feet away one of the men jumped out into the thigh deep water waded towards us then climbed nimbly up the coral his feet were bare but the sharp rock didnt worry him any that i could see his face was a comical mixture of astonishment and good humour astonishment at finding two white people on a reef at that hour in the morning good humour because the world was a wonderful place and always would be you dont see that kind of face often but when you do you can never mistake it good humour won he gave us a huge white grin and said something that meant just nothing at all to me he could see that it meant nothing at all and he wasnt the kind of man to waste time he looked at marie shook his head and clucked his tongue as his eyes took in the pale face the two unnaturally red patches on her cheeks and the purplish shadows under her eyes then grinned again ducked his head as in greeting picked her up and waded out to the canoe i made it under my own steam lugging the two water drums along the canoe was fitted with a mast but there was no wind yet so we had to paddle across the lagoon to the island at least the two brown men did and i was glad to leave it to them what they did with that canoe would have had me gasping and wheezing in five minutes and in a hospital bed in ten theyd have been a sensation at henley they kept it up nonstop for the twenty minutes it took us to cross the lagoon churning up the water as if the loch ness monster was after them but still finding time and energy to chatter and laugh with each other all the way if they were representative of the rest of the islands population we had fallen into good hands and that there were others on the island was obvious as we came close to the shore i could count at least half a dozen houses stilted affairs with the floor about three feet off the ground and enormously deepeaved thatched roofs that swept down steeply from high ridgepoles to within four or five feet of the ground the houses had neither doors nor windows understandably enough for they had no walls either except for one the largest in a clearing near the shore close in to a stand of coconut palms the other houses were set further back and to the south still further south was a metal and corrugated iron eyesore grey in colour like an oldfashioned crushing plant and hopper in a quarry beyond this again was a long low shed with a slightly sloping corrugated iron roof it must have been a real pleasure to work under that when the sun was high in the sky we were heading in just to the right of a small piernot a real landingstage with anchored piles but a thirty foot long floating platform of bound logs secured on the shore end by ropes tied round a couple of tree stumpswhen i saw a man lying on the shore a white man sunbathing he was a lean wiry old bird with a lot of white hair all over his face dark spectacles on his eyes and a grubby towel strategically placed across his midriff he appeared to be asleep but he wasnt for when the bow of the canoe crunched into the sand he sat up with a jerk whipped off his dark glasses peered myopically in our direction pawed around the sand till he located a pair of slightlytinted spectacles stuck them across the bridge of his nose said god bless my soul in an agitated voice jumped to his feet with remarkable speed for such an old duffer and hurried into a nearby palmthatched hut clutching his towel round him quite a tribute to you my dear i murmured you looking like something the tide washed up and the old boy about ninetynine but you can still knock him for six he didnt seem any too pleased to see us i thought she said doubtfully she smiled at the big man whod just lifted her from the canoe and set her on her feet on the sand and went on maybe hes a recluse maybe hes one of those remittance man beachcombers and other white people are the last he wants to see hes just gone for his best bib and tucker i said confidently hell be back in a minute to give us the big hand and he was wed hardly reached the top of the beach when he reappeared from the hut dressed in a white shirt and white ducks with a panama on his head hed a white beard flowing white moustache and plentiful thick white hair if buffalo bill had ever worn tropical whites and a straw hat hed have been a dead ringer for buffalo bill he came puffing down to meet us his hand outstretched in greeting id made no mistake about the warmth of welcome but i had about the age he wasnt a day over sixty perhaps only fiftyfive and a pretty fit fiftyfive at that god bless my soul god bless my soul he wrung our hands as if wed brought him the first prize in the irish sweepstake what a surprise what a surprise morning dip you knowjust drying offcouldnt believe my eyeswhere in all the world have you two come from no no dont answer now straight up to my house delightful surprise delightful he scurried off in front of us godblessing himself with every other step marie smiled at me and we walked after him he led us along a short path across a whiteshingled front up a wide flight of six wooden steps into his house like the others the floor was well clear of the ground but once inside i could see why unlike the other houses it had walls it had to have to support the large bookcases and glasscovered showcases that lined three quarters of the wall area of the room the rest of the walls were given over to doors and window spaces no glass in the windows just screens of plaited leaves that could be raised or lowered as wished there was a peculiar smell that i couldnt place at first the floor seemed to be made of the midribs of some type of leaf coconut palm probably laid across closeset joists and there was no ceiling as such just steepangled rafters with thatch above i looked at this thatch for a long and very interested moment there was a big oldfashioned rolltop desk in one corner and a large safe against the inside wall there were some brightly coloured straw mats on the floor most of which was given over to lowslung comfortable looking rattan chairs and settees each with a low table beside it a man could be comfortable in that roomespecially with a drink in his hand the old boywith that beard and moustache i couldnt think of him as anything elsewas a mindreader sit down sit down make yourselves comfortable a drink yes yes of course first of all a drink you need it you need it he picked up a little bell rang it furiously as if he were trying to see how much punishment it could stand before it came apart in his hands replaced it and looked at me too early in the morning for whisky eh not this morning and you young lady some brandy perhaps eh brandy thank you she let him have the smile she never bothered letting me have and i could just about see the old boys toes curling you are very kind i was just coming to the resigned conclusion that his staccato and repetitive way of talking was habitual and was going to be a little wearing if we had to stay with him for any length of timeand i had the thought even then that the voice was vaguely familiar to me when a rear door opened and a chinese youth came in he was very short very thin dressed in khaki drill and the only use he had for his facial muscles was to keep his expressions buttoned up for he didnt even bat an eyelid when he saw us ah tommy there you are we have guests tommy drinks brandy for the lady a large whisky for the gentleman andlet me see now yes yes perhaps i rather think i willa small whisky for me then run a bath for the lady i could get by with a shave then breakfast you havent breakfasted yet i assured him we hadnt excellent excellent he caught sight of the two men who had rescued us standing outside on the white shingles with the water drums raised a bushy white eyebrow in my direction and said whats in those our clothes indeed yes yes i see clothes any opinion he held as to our eccentricities in the choice of suitcases he kept to himself he went to the doorway just leave them there james youve done a splendid job both of you splendid ill speak to you later i watched the two men smile broadly then turn away i said they speak english certainly of course they do they didnt speak any to us urn they didnt eh he tugged his beard buffalo bill to the life you speak any to them i thought then grinned no there you are then you might have been any of a score of nationalities he turned as the chinese boy came in took the drinks from the tray and handed them to us your excellent health i grunted something appropriate and as short as it could decently be and went for that drink like a thirststricken camel for the nearest oasis i insulted a perfectly good scotch by swallowing half of it at one gulp but even so it tasted wonderful and i was about to start on the remainder when the old boy said well preliminaries over decencies observed your story sir lets have it it brought me up short and i looked at him cautiously i could be wrong about him being a hoppity old fusspot i was wrong the bright blue eyes were shrewd and what little of his face was available for expression seemed to indicate a certain carefulness if not actual wariness being a little odd in your behaviour doesnt necessarily mean that youre a little odd in the head i gave it to him short and straight i said my wife and i were en route to australia by plane during an overnight stop at suva we were taken from our hotel room at three in the morning by a captain fleck and two indians forced to board his schooner and locked up last night we heard them planning to murder us so we broke out from the hold where theyd put usit was a bad night and they didnt see us gojumped over the side and after some time washed up on a coral reef your men found us there this morning god bless my soul what an extraordinary tale extraordinary he kept on blessing himself and shaking his head for a bit then looked up at me from under bushy white eyebrows if we could have it with a little more detail perhaps so i gave it to him again telling him everything that had happened since we had arrived in suva he peered at me through those tinted glasses all the time i was speaking and when i finished he sighed did some more headshaking and said incredible the whole things quite incredible do you mean that literally what what that i dont believe you god bless this might convince you marie interrupted she slipped off her shoe and peeled back the plaster to show the two deep fang marks on her foot the rat caused that but i do believe it young lady its just that everything is so bizarre soso fantastic of course its true how else would you be here butbut why should this villainous fellow this captain fleck kidnap you and talk of killing you it all seems so purposeless so mad ive no idea i said the only thing i can think ofand even that is ridiculousis that im a scientist a specialist in fuel technology and maybe someone wanted to extract some information from me why on earth they should want to do that i just cant imagine and how the skipper of an obscure schooner knew that we should be flying out to australia via fijiwell it doesnt make any kind of sense at all as you say it makes no sense at all mrahbless my soul you must forgive me i havent even asked your names yet bentall john bentall and this is my wife marie i smiled at him and you dont need to tell me who you are its just come back to me dr harold witherspoonprofessor witherspoon i should say the doyen of british archaeologists you know me then you recognized me the old boy seemed quite bucked about it well you do get a good deal of newspaper space i said tactfully professor witherspoons love of the public limelight was a byword and i saw your series of lectures on television about a year ago he didnt look so pleased any longer he suddenly looked downright suspicious and his eyes narrowed as he said you interested in archaeology mr bentall know anything about it i mean im like a million others professor i know about this egyptian tomb and this lad tutenkhamon who was in it but i couldnt begin to spell his name i doubt if im even pronouncing it properly so good forgive my asking ill explain later i am being most remiss most remiss this young lady here is far from well fortunately im a bit of a doctor have to be you know living your life at the back of beyond he bustled out of the room returned with a medical case took out a thermometer and asked marie to put it in her mouth while he took her wrist i said i dont want to appear ungrateful or unappreciative of your hospitality professor but my business is rather urgent how soon will we be able to leave here and get back to suva not long he shrugged theres a ketch from kandavu thats about a hundred miles or so north of herecalls in about every six weeks it was last here let me seeyes about three weeks ago so another three weeks that was handy three weeks not long he said but they probably had a different time scale on those islands and looking out over that shimmering lagoon with the coral reefs beyond i found it easy to understand why but i didnt think colonel raine would be so happy if i just sat back and admired the lagoon for three weeks so i said any planes ever pass this way no ships no planes nothing he shook his head and kept on shaking it as he examined the thermometer bless my soul a hundred and three and a pulse of dear dear youre a sick young lady mrs bentall probably taken it from london with you bath bed and breakfast in that order he held up his hand as marie murmured a token protest i insist i insist you can have carstairs room red carstairs my assistant he explained in suva at present recuperating from malaria rife in those parts expect him back on the next ship and you mr bentalli expect youd like a sleep too he gave a deprecating little laugh i daresay you didnt sleep too soundly out on that reef last night a cleanup shave and a couple of hours on one of those very inviting chairs on your verandah will do me i said no planes either eh any boats on the island i could hire the only boat on the island is the one belonging to james and john not their right names those natives from kandavu have unpronounceable names theyre here on contract to supply fresh fish and whatever food and fruit they can gather they wouldnt take you anywayeven if they would id absolutely forbid it absolutely too dangerous if it was i was right with him of course and illegal the fijian government forbids interisland proa travel in the cyclone season heavy penalties very heavy penalties for breaking the law no radio we could use to send a message no radio not even a radio receiver the professor smiled when im investigating something that happened many thousands of years ago i find contact with the outside world disturbing in the extreme all i have is an oldfashioned handwound gramophone he seemed a harmless old duffer so i didnt tell him what he could do with his gramophone instead while marie bathed i had another drink then after a shave change and firstclass breakfast stretched out on a low rattan armchair in the shade of the verandah i meant to do some heavy thinking for it seemed to me that the situation was such that it was long past time that i showed some rudimentary signs of intelligence but id reckoned without my weariness the warmth of the sun the effects of a couple of double scotches on an empty stomach and the soporific sound of the tradewind whispering its sibilant clicking way through the nodding palms i thought of the island and how anxious id been to leave it and what professor witherspoon would say if he knew that the only way to get me off now would be by sheer force i thought of captain fleck and i thought of the professor and i thought of them both with admiration fleck for the fact that he was twice as smart as id thoughtwhich made him at least twice as smart as meand the professor for the fact that he was as polished and accomplished a liar as id ever met and then i fell asleep chapter four wednesday pm pm there was a war on and i was right in the middle of it i couldnt see who or what was to the right or the left of me and i wasnt even sure whether it was day or night but there was a war on i was sure of that heavy artillery laying down a barrage before an attack the low ominous nimble of explosions the very earth shaking i was no hero let me get out of the way i wasnt going to be cannonfodder for anyone i moved seemed to stumble and felt the sharp pain in my right arm shrapnel perhaps or a bullet maybe theyd invalid me out it would be a change from the front line then i opened my eyes and found that i wasnt in the front line id achieved the near impossible feat of falling out of an armchair and had landed on the wooden floor of professor witherspoons verandah i seemed to have made a neat one point landing on my right elbow my elbow hurt id been dreaming but i hadnt been dreaming about the rumble of the explosions and the earthshaking as i got to my feet clutching my arm and trying not to hop around too much i heard another couple of distant muffled thuds and the floor of the verandah shook both times quite violently i hadnt even had tune to try to guess at the source of those disturbances when i caught sight of professor witherspoon standing in the doorway leading in off the verandah his face filled with concern at least his voice was so i assumed that what lay behind the foliage would reflect his voice my dear fellow my dear fellow he came hurrying forward hands outstretched as if he thought i was going to collapse at any moment i heard the sound of the fall by jove it was loud you must have hurt yourself what happened i fell out of my chair i said patiently i thought it was the second front its my nerves dear me dear me dear me he fussed and fluttered around without achieving anything have youhave you damaged anything only my pride i felt my elbow with cautious fingers nothing broken just numbed whats making all that damned racket ha he smiled relieved i thought youd want to know that im just about to show youthought youd like to have a look over the place anyway he regarded me with quizzical eyes enjoy your two hour snooze except for the wakingup bit yes youve been asleep for six hours mr bentall i looked at my watch and looked at the sun already far past the meridian and realised that he was right but it didnt seem worth making a fuss over so i merely said politely i hope that didnt cause you any trouble having to stay behind and look after me when you may have wished to be working not at all not at all no time clock here young man i work when i want to hungry thank you no thirsty some hongkong beer before we go excellent stuff chilled eh sounds fine professor so we went and drank his beer and it was as good as he had promised we had it in the livingroom where hed first taken us and i looked at the various exhibits in the glassfronted cases to me they were only a mouldy collection of bones and fossils and shells of stone pestles and mortars of charred timber and clay utensils and curiously shaped stones it was no difficulty at all not to show any interest and i didnt show any interest because the professor had shown signs of being wary of any person interested in archaeology but it seemed hed given up being wary for when he caught my roving eye he said enthusiastically magnificent collection of specimens eh magnificent im afraid its hardly in my line i began apologetically i dont know of course not of course not wouldnt expect you to he went across to his rolltop desk pulled out a handful of papers and magazines from the central drawer and gave them to me those may help you understand better i leafed quickly through the magazines and papers nearly all of them were dated six months previously and of eight papers five london national dailies and three major us papers no less than seven had given the professor page one headlines it must have been a field day for the old boy most of the headlines were of the archaeological discovery of the century variety far outranking in importance tutenkhamon troy or the dead sea scrolls every latest archaeological discovery of course was usually acclaimed in the same way but there did appear to be some basis for this latest claim oceania it seemed had long been the dark continent of archeological research but now professor witherspoon claimed to have discovered on the island of vardu south of the fijis complete proof of the migration of the polynesians from the southeast of asia and of there being some form of primitive civilization in those islands as far back as bc some years before the previous earliest estimate three magazines carried coloured spreads of the story and one had a very fine picture of the professor and dr red carstairs standing by what looked to me like a cracked paving stone but which the caption said was part of a stepped tomb dr carstairs was a remarkable looking character six and a half feet tall if he was an inch with a flaming red handlebar moustache of heroic proportions i missed it all im afraid i said i was in the middle east at the time and pretty cut off from everything this must have caused a terrific stir it was the crowning moment of my life he said simply it must have been why havent i read anything about this recently theres been nothing about it in the papers since and there wont be till im through here he said darkly i foolishly granted news agencies papers and magazines facilities to come here after my first announcement had caused some stir they hired a special ship from suva descended on me like locustslike locusts i tell you sir all over the shop interfering poking ruining weeks of intensive work helpless i was completely helpless the anger deepened and there were spies among them spies you must forgive me rival archaeologists trying to steal my thunder that would be just about the ultimate crime as far as the old boy was concerned trying to steal other things too some of the most valuable finds ever made in the pacific never trust a fellow archaeologist my boy he said bitterly never trust em i said i wouldnt and he went on one of them actually had the effrontery to arrive here in a yacht a couple of months ago american millionaire who does archaeology as a hobby just wanted credit damned impertinence to say hed lost his way never trust an archaeologist threw him off thats why i was suspicious of you how was i to know you werent a reporter eh at first that is i quite understand professor i said soothingly got the government behind me now though he went on triumphantly british territory this of course all access to the island forbidden till im through he drained his glass well well shouldnt be bothering you with my troubles shall we go for this look round pleasure mind if i see my wife first certainly certainly you know the way marie hopeman stirred turned and looked up at me sleepily as i opened the creaking door the bed was a pretty primitive affair a wooden frame with crisscross stringing but she seemed comfortable enough i said sorry if i wakened you hows it going you didnt waken me ten times better now she looked it the blueness had gone from beneath her eyes and the harsh red spots from her cheeks she stretched luxuriously i dont intend moving for hours and hours hes very kind isnt he couldnt have fallen into better hands i agreed i didnt bother to keep my voice down best thing would be for you to go to sleep again my dear she blinked a bit at the my dear but let it go it wont be too difficult and you professor witherspoon is going to show me around apparently hes made some very important archaeological discoveries here should be very interesting i added a few more banalities bade her what i hoped old witherspoon would consider a suitable tender farewell and left he was waiting for me on the verandah pith helmet on head malacca cane in hand the british archaeologist abroad he was perfect this is where hewell lives he waved his stick in the direction of the thatched house nearest his own my overseer american rough diamond of coursethe tone of his voice lumped citizens of the united states into the same categorybut able yes indeed very able this next house is my guest house unused but having it done up looks a bit airy i admithe wasnt exaggerating all it consisted of was a roof floor and four supporting cornerpostsbut very comfortable adapted for the climate reed curtain divides it in half and all the wallsscreens of plaited coconut leavescan be lowered to the floor kitchen and bathroom behindcant have them inside a house of this type and that next long house belongs to the workersthe diggers and this eyesore i nodded at the corrugated iron building quarry hopper or crusher not a bad guess at all my boy it is ghastly isnt it propertyor expropertyof the british phosphate commissioners you can see the name on the side if you look closely their crushing mill that flattopped shed behind was the drying plant he waved his malacca around in a sweeping halfcircle almost a year since they left but still the place is covered in this damnable grey dust killed off most of the vegetation on this side of the island damnable its not very nice i agreed whats a british firm doing out in this forsaken part of the world not purely british international but run mostly by new zealand digging out the rock of course phosphate of lime they were taking out a thousand tons a day a year ago valuable stuff he peered at me shrewdly know anything of geology hey the professor seemed suspicious of anyone who knew anything about anything so i said i didnt ah well who does these days he said cryptically but to put you in the picture my boy you must understand that this island once probably lay on the bottom of the seaand as the bottom of the sea is about three miles down here that was a fair depth then one daygeologically speaking you understand it probably took a million yearsthe bottom came up to near the top upthrust or volcanic activity associated with the continuous outpouring of lava who knows he coughed deprecatingly when one knows a little of those thingsfrom the tone of his voice i gathered that if he knew only a little anybody who claimed to know a lot was a liaryou are unwilling to be dogmatic about it anyway the net result was that after a few aeons you had this massive underwater mountain with the peak not yet above water but less than feet below the surface he peered at me waiting for the obvious remark so i obliged how can you be so certain about something that happened millions of years ago because this is a coral island he said triumphantly and the polyps that build the coral reefs must live in water but die below feet well some time later another million years give or take a million this must have been a big lowlying coral reef when it was upthrust below this upthrust probably coincided with the beginning of the age of birds this became a sanctuary for untold numbers of birdsthere are many such in the pacificwho stayed here for countless years eventually you had a layer of guano up to perhaps fifty feet thick millions of tons of it millions of tonsand then island coral and guano subsided and sank to the floor of the sea it seemed to me that this island had had a pretty chequered history some time later he went on up it comes again by this time the actions of sea deposits and salt water had changed the guano into a very rich phosphate of lime then came the slow laborious process of soil forming of growing grass shrubs trees a veritable tropical paradise then probably in the last ice age along came the wandering searovers from southeast asia and settled in this idyllic spot if it was all that idyllic why did they leave it but they never left it they never left it for the same reason that those fabulous deposits of lime phosphate werent discovered until recently though most other deposits in the pacific had been worked out by the end of the last century this mr bentall is a highly volcanic regionthere are still active volcanoes on the neighboring tonga islands you know in the space of a few hours a gigantic volcano erupted out of the sea drowning half of this coral island and covering the other halfcoral phosphate vegetation and the unfortunate people who lived here in a tremendous layer of basaltic lava the ad eruption that destroyed pompeii professor witherspoon finished disparagingly was a bagatelle compared to this i nodded at the mountain sloping up sharply behind us thats the volcano that was formed yes indeed what happened to the other half of it must have been some ground fault formed at the same time as the volcano one night it just broke in half and vanished into the sea it took the seabed with it and the coral reefs built out to the north you can see that the lagoon is open there he marched on at a brisk pace apparently undisturbed by the thought that he lived in a very dicey spot where cataclysmic upheavals of a very final nature were of the order of the day he was angling his way slightly uphill and less than three hundred yards from the crushing mill we came to a sudden cleft in the side of the mountain it was about seventy feet high and thirty wide vertical at the sides and back and with a flat floor leading in to a circular hole in the mountainside there were railway tracks of very narrow gauge coming out from the hole running along the horizontal floor of the fissure then turning to the south where they dipped from view there were two or three small sheds just outside the entrance and from one of these came the humming sound id been hearing more and more clearly on the way up petroldriven generators it had never occurred to me until then but of course if the professor and his assistants were prospecting about inside the mountain they would have to have electric power for light and probably also for ventilation well here we are the professor announced this is the spot where some curious intelligent prospector for the phosphate company noticed this peculiar fault in the mountainside started digging through the topsoil and struck phosphate before hed gone three feet heaven knows how many million tons of rock they took outthe mountain is a perfect honeycomb just as they were finishing up here somebody found a few pieces of pottery and curiouslyshaped stones an archaeologist in wellington was shown them and immediately sent them to me the professor coughed modestly the rest of course is history i followed the historymaker through the entrance and along a winding horizontal passageway until we came to a huge circular excavation in the rock it was a gigantic cavern forty feet high twenty by the encircling walls supported by concrete columns and about two hundred feet in diameter half a dozen tiny electric lights suspended from some of the pillars at about a height of ten feet gave the dingy grey rock an eerie and forbidding appearance and were but token illumination at best spaced evenly round the perimeter of this cavern were five more tunnels each with its own railway track well what do you think of this mr bentall it looks like the catacombs in rome i said but not so cheery its a remarkable mining feat the professor said severely he didnt care for any flippancy about his nearest and dearest and his nearest and dearest would always be those dank and gloomy holes in the ground very difficult stuff to work with this limestone and when you have to support a thick layer of basaltic lava and half the weight of a volcano above it it becomes very tricky indeed this mountainside is honeycombed with similar caverns all joined by tunnels hexagonal system those domed roofs give the greatest structural strength but theres a limit to their size the mining company only managed to get out about a third of the available limestone before the cost of supporting pillars to hold the roof in place became prohibitive doesnt that make this blasting rather dangerous then i thought an interested question might put me back in his good books well yes it is rather he said thoughtfully chance we have to take chance we must take interests of science come and see where our first discoveries were made he led the way straight across the cavern to the tunnel opposite to the one by which wed entered and went down this hopping briskly along the sleepers of the railway tracks after about twenty yards we entered another cavern in height width and number of exit tunnels the duplicate of the one we had just left there was no illumination here other than one single lamp suspended from the electric light cable that traversed the width of the cavern and vanished down the faraway tunnel but it was enough to let me see that the two tunnels to the left had been blocked off by heavy vertical baulks of timber what happened there professor cavein afraid so he shook his head two tunnels and parts of the caverns to which they led collapsed at the same time had to shore up the tunnel entrances in case the collapse spread to this chamber before my time of course i believe three men perished in the righthand cavern in theretheyd just started to excavate it a bad business a bad business he paused for a few moments to let me see how bad he thought it had been then said brightly well this is the historic spot it was a fivefoot niche in the wall just to the right of the tunnel by which wed entered the cavern to me it was just a fivefoot niche but to witherspoon it was a temple and he himself the officiating priest this he said reverently is where the mystery of polynesia and the polynesians was solved it was here that were found the first adzeheads stone mortars and pestles it was this that triggered off the biggest archaeological discovery of our generation doesnt it make you think mr bentall it certainly does i refrained from specifying the nature of my thoughts instead i reached out for a spur of rock damp and slimy to the touch and pulled it off with little effort i said in surprise pretty soft stuff this youd think picks or pneumatic drills would be almost as effective as blasting for removing this stuff and so they are my boy and so they are but how would you like to tackle basalt with a pick and shovel he asked jovially a different proposition altogether id forgotten about that i confessed of course when the lava poured down it covered everything what kind of stuff do you find in the basaltpottery stone utensils axe handles things like that to name only a very few he nodded he hesitated then said to speak frankly unlike the average merchant i put only my worst goods in the shop window the things you saw in my room i regard only as trinkets as the merest trifles i have one or two hidden caches in herei wouldnt dream of even hinting to you where they arethat contain a fantastic collection of neolithic polynesian relics that will astound the scientific world astound them he moved off again but instead of crossing the chamber and following the electric cable and farspaced lights down the opposite tunnel he switched on a torch and turned into the first tunnel on his right pointing out the various places from which those polynesian relics had been recovered he stopped in front of a particularly large excavation in the limestone and said and here we excavated the joists and timbers of what must be the oldest wooden house in the world in an almost perfect state of preservation and how old was that seven thousand years near enough he said promptly van duprez of amsterdam who was out here with all the newspaper people says its only four thousand but the mans a fool of course what basis do you use for assessing the age of those things i asked curiously experience and knowledge he said flatly van duprez despite his inflated reputation hasnt got a great deal of either mans a fool um i said noncommittally i looked apprehensively at the third chamber now opening out before us how deep are we here about a hundred feet i should say perhaps a hundred and twenty moving into the side of the mountain you know nervous mr bentall sure im nervous i never realized you archaeologists went so deep or that you could find any trace of early life so deep this must be about a record eh close to it close to it he said complacently thought they went pretty deep in the nile valley and troy you know he led the way across the third chamber into a tunnel sparsely illuminated with battery lamps we should find hewell and his crew down here he glanced at his watch they must be about due to pack up shortly been at it here all day they were still working when we arrived at the spot where the tunnel began to open out into a rudimentary fourth chamber there were nine men there altogether some prising out lumps of limestone with pickaxes and crowbars to add to the heap of rubble at their feet others loading the rubble on to rubbertyred wheelbarrows while a gigantic man clad only in denim trousers and singlet closely examined each lump with a powerful torch both the workers and the man with the torch were worth looking at the workers were all chinese unusually tall and heavilybuilt for members of their race and looked about the toughest and hardestbitten characters id ever seen but it could have been pure illusion that feeble light shining on sweat and dustcoated faces would have made anyone seem unnatural but there was no illusion about the foreman who straightened from his examination of the rock and came to meet us he was the toughest and hardestbitten character id ever seen he was about six feet three niches tall but stunted for his breadth with a couple of massive arms ending in fivefingered shovels that almost brushed his knees his face looked as if it had been carved from solid rock by a sculptor whose only ambition was to get the job done in a hurry there wasnt a curve worth calling a curve in his entire face just a granitic mass of crudely intersecting planes that would have had the old cubist boys jumping for joy he had a chin like a powershovel a gash for a mouth a huge beak of a nose and black cold eyes set so far back under the beetling overhang of tufted brows that you had the illusion of some wild animal peering out from the dark depths of a cave the sides of his faceyou couldnt have called them cheeksand forehead were deeply trenched by a crisscross of sunweathered lines like some ancient parchment he would have had a terrible time making the romantic lead in a musical comedy professor witherspoon introduced us and hewell stretched out his hand and said glad to meet you bentall his voice deep and cavernous matched both his vast frame and his occupation and he was glad to see me with the same sort of gladness that you would have found in those same islands a hundred years previously when the cannibal chief hailed the arrival of the latest of a long line of toothsome missionaries i braced myself as the giant hand closed over mine but he was surprisingly gentle it felt as if i was being pulled through a power wringer but when he gave me back my hand all the fingers were still there bent and mangled a bit but still there heard about you this morning he boomed canada or the american northwest i couldnt be sure heard your wife wasnt so well neither the islands anything can happen in the islands must have had a terrible time we talked for a bit about the terrible time i had then i said curiously youve had to go a fair way to recruit labour for this job had to my boy had to it was witherspoon who answered indians no damn goodsullen uncooperative suspicious havent the physique fijians have but theyd have a heart attack if you suggested they do any work same with any white man you could pick uploafers and wasters to a man but the chinese are different best workers ive ever had hewell confirmed he had a curious trick of speaking without appearing to move his mouth when it comes to building railroads and driving tunnels you cant beat em never have built the western railroads of america without them i made some suitable remark and peered around me witherspoon said sharply what are you looking for bentall relics of course the right note of surprise be interesting to see one being excavated from the rock wont see none today im afraid hewell boomed lucky to find anything once a week aint that so professor if were very lucky witherspoon agreed well well mustnt hold you back hewell mustnt hold you back just brought bentall along to show him what all the bangs were about well see you at suppertime witherspoon led the way back through the mine out into the brilliant sunshine and down to his house chattering away all the time but i wasnt listening any more id heard and seen all i wanted to hear and see when we got back he excused himself on the ground that he had some work to catch up on and i went to see marie she was sitting up in bed with a book in her hands and there wasnt anything much the matter with her that i could see i said i thought you said you were going to sleep i said i wasnt going to move different thing altogether she lay back luxuriously on her pillow warm day cool breeze sound of the wind in the palms the sea on the surf and all the blue waters of the lagoon and white sand out there wonderful isnt it sure whats that youre reading there book on fiji very interesting she gestured at the books piled on the table beside her some more on fiji some on archaeology tommythe chinese boybrought them to me you should read them later how are you feeling took your time in getting round to ask me didnt you i frowned at her at the same time jerking my head backwards she caught on fast im sorry dear the impulsive cry very well done shouldnt have said that much better im feeling much better right as rain tomorrow had a nice walk round the banal touch like the cry perfectly done i was in the middle of telling her about the nice walk id had when there came a diffident tap on the door a clearing of the throat and witherspoon came in by my reckoning hed been outside that door for about three minutes behind him i could see the brownskinned forms of john and james the two fijian boys good evening mrs bentall good evening how are you better yes better you certainly look better his eyes fell on the books by the bedside and he checked and frowned where did these come from mrs bentall i do hope that i havent done anything wrong professor witherspoon she said anxiously i asked tommy for something to read and he brought me these id just started the first one and those are rare and valuable editions he said testily very rare very rare personal library and all that we archaeologists never lead them out tommy had no right well never mind i have an excellent selection of novels detective fiction you can have what you like he smiled the incident magnanimously forgotten ive come to bring you some good news you and your husband are to have the guest house for yourselves during the remainder of your stay here ive had john and james here at work most of the day clearing it up why professor marie stretched out her hand and took his how very very nice its so kind of youits really far too kind of you nothing at all my dear nothing at all he patted her hand and held on to it longer than was necessary about ten times longer than was necessary i just thought you might appreciate the privacy i dare saythis with a crinkling of halfclosed eyes which i took to be a dyspeptic twinge but it wasnt dyspepsia it was meant as a roguish twinklethat you havent been married very long now tell me mrs bentall will you be fit enough to join us for supper tonight she could be as quick as a cat she caught the all but imperceptible shake of my head and she wasnt even looking in my direction im so sorry professor witherspoon it takes some doing to combine a dazzling smile with a tone of deep regret but she managed it theres nothing id like better but i really do feel so weak yet if i could be excused until the morning i of course but of course mustnt overdo the convalescence must we he seemed to be on the point of grabbing her hand again but thought better of it well send a tray along and well also send you along no need to stir at a signal from him the two fijians caught an end of the bed apiece and lifted not such a feat as the bed itself probably didnt weigh even thirty pounds the chinese boy came in to carry all the clothes we had the professor led the way and there was nothing for me to do but to take her hand as we walked between the two houses bend over her solicitously and murmur ask him for a torch i didnt suggest a reason why she should ask for one for the excellent reason that none occurred to me but she handled it beautifully when the professor had dismissed the bearers and was expatiating at length on how the guest house was built entirely from the products of two trees the pandanus and coconut palm she interrupted diffidently to ask is thereis there a bathroom here professor witherspoon but of course my dear how remiss of me down the steps to the left and its the first small hut you come to the next is the kitchen for obvious reasons you cant have fire and water in houses like these of course not butbut doesnt it get rather dark at night here i mean god bless my soul what must you think of me a torchof course you shall have a torch you shall have it after our evening meal he glanced at his watch expect you in about half an hour bentall a few more platitudes a smirk at marie and he bustled briskly away the westering sun had already dipped behind the shoulder of the mountain but the heat of the day still lingered in the air for all that marie shivered and pulled the coverlet high about her shoulders she said would you care to let the sidescreens down those trade winds arent what theyre cracked up to be not when the darkness comes let the screen down and have a dozen listening ears pressed against them in a couple of minutes youyou think so she said slowly you feel theres something wrong here with professor witherspoon ive long passed the feeling stage i know damn well theres something wrong ive known it ever since we arrived here i pulled a chair up to her bed and took her hand a hundred to one that we had a keen and interested audience and i didnt want to disappoint them what are you going on feeling fey again or womanly intuition or hard facts dont be unpleasant she said quietly ive already apologised for my foolish behaviourjust the fever as you said this is intuition or a hunchquite different this ideal spot those smiling fijian boys the marvellous chinese servant that hollywood dream of what an english archaeologist should look like and behaveits all too idyllic too perfect you get the impression ofof a carefully maintained facade its too dreamlike if you know what i mean you mean youd feel better if you saw the professor roaring and cursing round the place or saw someone lying under a stoop and drinking from the neck of a whisky bottle well something like that ive heard the south pacific often affects people like that at first the sense of unreality i mean dont forget ive seen the professor several times on the screen hes just as large as life and if you want perfection marred just wait until the boyfriend hewell happens by why whats he like couldnt describe him youre too young to have seen the king kong films you wont mistake him though and while youre watching out for him i want you to check the number of people who come and go into the workers hut thats why i didnt want you to come across for supper that shouldnt be hard nor so easy theyre all chinesethe ones ive seen so far anywayand theyll probably all look alike to you check what theyre doing how many stay in whether the ones that come out are carrying anything or not dont let anyone guess youre checking let down the screens when its dark enough and if there are no window cutouts you can peek through why dont you write it all down for me she said sweetly ok so youve been at this longer than i have just a cowardly concern for my own neck im going to take a walk around during the middle of the night and id like to know what the score is she didnt put her hand to her mouth or gasp or try to dissuade me i couldnt even have sworn to it that the pressure of her hand had increased she said matteroffactly do you want me to come with you no i just want to look around and theres nothing wrong with my own eyes and while i dont expect trouble i cant see youd be much help if any did come along no offence of course well she said doubtfully flecks got my gun there wouldnt be much point in calling the cops and i dont suppose i could do very much if someone jumped me but if someone jumped you then i you have the wrong idea entirely i said patiently youre not built for speed i am you never saw anyone who could run away from a fight as fast as bentall i crossed the coconut floor and pulled over a madeup string bed placing it close to hers do you mind suit yourself she said agreeably she looked at me lazily under halfclosed eyelids and an amused smile curved across her mouth but it wasnt at all the same amused smile as shed given me in colonel raines office in london ill hold your hand i think youre just a sheep in wolfs clothing wait till i get off duty i threatened you and me and the lights of london youll see she looked at me for a long moment and then turned to gaze out over the darkening lagoon she said i dont see it ah well wrong type lucky fm not the sensitive kind about this bed i know this is going to be a big disappointment to you but it occurred to me that when i took a walk tonight it might be a good thing to shove some sort of dummy in here and its not likely theyll investigate its genuineness when the bed is so near yours i heard the sound of voices looked up and saw hewell and his chinese come into sight round a corner of the crushing mill hewell was a walking mountain there was something almost frighteningly simian about the bowed form the perceptibly rolling gait the slow swing of the hands that all but brushed his knees as he walked i said to marie if you want to have the screaming heebiejeebies during the night turn round and have an eyeful the boyfriends here if it hadnt been for the boyfriends face the professors incessant chatter and the bottle of wine hed produced to mark he said the occasion it would have been quite a pleasant meal the chinese boy certainly knew how to cook and there was none of this nonsense of birds nests and sharks fins either but i couldnt keep my eyes off that gaunt and ravaged face opposite methe immaculate white drills into which hed changed only emphasised the neanderthalic hideousness of it i could shut my ears to witherspoons banalities the wine an australian burgundy was quite excellent if your tastes ran to sweetened vinegar but i was thirsty and managed to force some down but it was hewell curiously enough who made the meal tolerable behind that primitive broken face lay a keen mind at least he was smart enough to stay away from the burgundy and drink hongkong beer by the quartand his stories of life as a hardrock mining engineer in what seemed to have been half the countries in the world made good listening or they would have made good listening if he hadnt stared unwinkingly at me all the time he was speaking the black eyes so far back in their sockets that the illusion of a bear peering out from his cave was stronger than ever hed the ancient mariner whacked to the wide i might have been sitting there transfixed all night if witherspoon hadnt finally pushed back his chair rubbed his hands together in satisfaction and asked me how id enjoyed the meal it was excellent i told him dont let that cook go very many thanks indeed and now if you will i think ill be getting back to my wife nonsense nonsense the affronted host to the life coffee and brandy to come yet my boy when ever do we archaeologists get an opportunity to celebrate were delighted to see a strange face here arent we hewell hewell didnt contradict him but he didnt agree with him either it didnt matter to witherspoon he brought forward a rattan armchair set it in position for me and fussed around like an old hen until he was certain i was comfortably seated then tommy brought in the coffee and brandy from that moment on the evening went well after the chinese boy had brought in drinks for the second time the professor told him to bring the bottle and leave it there the level in the bottle sank as if there was a hole in the bottom of it the professor was in tremendous form the level sank some more hewell smiled twice it was a great night the calf was being fatted for the kill they werent wasting all that excellent brandy for nothing the bottle was emptied and another brought in the professor told some mildly risque jokes and convulsed himself with laughter hewell smiled again i wiped away some tears of mirth and caught the quick flicker of interchanged glances the axe was starting on its back swing i congratulated the professor on his wit in a slurred and stumbling voice i never felt more sober in my life theyd obviously rehearsed the whole thing meticulously witherspoon the dedicated scientist to the life started to bring me some of the exhibits from the showcases lining the walls but after a few minutes he said come hewell we are insulting our friend here let us show him our real treasures hewell hesitated doubtfully and witherspoon actually stamped his foot on the floor i insist damn it man what harm in it very well hewell crossed to the big safe on my left hand side and after a minutes fruitless twiddling of the knob said combinations stuck again professor well open it from the back combination witherspoon said testily he was standing to my right a piece of broken pottery in his hand now look at this mr bentall i want you to pay particular attention to but i wasnt paying any attention particular or otherwise to what he was saying i wasnt even looking at the pottery i was looking at the window behind him a window which the kerosene lamp inside and the darkness outside transformed into an almost perfect mirror i was looking at hewell and the safe that he was tilting away from the wall that safe weighed three hundredweights if it weighed an ounce and the way i was sitting leaning to the right in the armchair and left leg crossed over the right my right foot was sticking out directly in its path if it toppled and it was going to topple the safe was now a good foot away from the wall at the top and i could see hewell actually sighting along its side to see if my foot was in the line of fall and then he gave it a push my god professor witherspoon shouted look out the cry of horror was as perfectly done as it was calculatedly late but he neednt have bothered himself i was already looking out for myself i was already starting to fall out of my chair as the safe fell on my leg twisting my foot so that the side lay flush along the floor the sole was more than half an inch of solid leather but even so it was a chance a long chance but i had to take it there was nothing faked about my shout of pain that stout leather sole felt as if it were being bent in half and so did my foot but the safe didnt touch any other part of my foot or leg i lay there gasping trapped by the weight of the safe until hewell rushed round to the front to heave it up while witherspoon dragged me clear i struggled painfully to my feet shook off the professors arm took one step on my injured foot and collapsed heavily to the floor what with the safe and myself the floor was certainly taking a beating that night are youare you badly hurt the professor was aghast with anxiety hurt no im not hurt i just felt tired and lay down for a rest i glared up at him savagely both hands cradling my right foot how far do you think you could walk with a broken ankle chapter five wednesday pmthursday am abject apologies restoring the patient with what few drops of brandy still remained splinting and taping my ankle in a surgical dressing took about ten minutes after that they halfhelped halfcarried me back to the guest hut the sidescreens were down but i could see the chinks of light through them the professor rapped on the door and waited the door opened whowho is there marie had thrown some kind of wrap over her shoulders and the light of the kerosene lamp behind her made a shining halo round the soft fair hair nothing to worry about mrs bentall witherspoon said soothingly your husbands just had a slight accident hurt his foot rather im afraid slight accident i yelped hurt his foot ive broken my bloody ankle i pushed off the restraining hands tried to lurch through the door stumbled cried out and measured my length on the floor of the guest house i was getting good at measuring my length on floors it was far quicker than using a tape marie her voice highpitched in anxiety said something i couldnt catch above my own moans and dropped to her knees beside me but the professor lifted her gently to her feet while hewell picked me up and placed me on my bed i weigh close on two hundred but he lifted and set me down with as little effort as a girl her doll except perhaps not quite so gently but those string beds were stronger than they looked and i didnt go through to the floor i moaned some more and then propped myself up on one elbow letting them see how a stifflipped englishman suffers in silent agony wincing and screwing my eyes shut from time to time just in case they didnt get it professor witherspoon explained rather haltingly what had happenedat least his version of what had happened a convincing amalgam of jammed combinations topheavy safes and sagging floors which made safes unstableand marie listened to him in stormy silence if she was acting shed missed out on her profession the quick breathing the compressed lips the slightly flared nostrils the tightly clenched fists those i could understand but to get your face as pale as she did hers you really have to put your heart into it when hed finished i really thought she was going to start in on him she didnt seem the slightest scared or awed by hewells towering bulk but she seemed to control herself and said in an icy voice thank you both very much for bringing my husband home it was most kind of you im sure it was all an accident goodnight that hardly left the door open for any further conversational gambits and they took themselves off hoping aloud that i would be better the next day what they were really hoping they kept to themselves and they forgot to say how they expected a broken bone to set overnight for about ten seconds more marie stood staring through the door by which theyd left then whispered heshes terrifying isnt he hes like something left over from the dark ages hes no beauty scared of course i am she stood still for some seconds longer sighed turned round and came and sat on the edge of my bed for a long moment she looked down at me like a person hesitating or making up her mind then she touched me lightly on the forehead with both cool hands smoothed her fingertips past my hair and looked down at me propped up by a hand on either side of my head she was smiling but there was no amusement in the smile and her hazel eyes were dark with worry im sorry for all this she murmured itits pretty bad isnt it johnny shed never called me that before terribly i reached my hands up put them round her neck and pulled her down till her face was buried in the pillow she didnt resist any recovering from the shock of a firsttime closeup of hewell would always take time or maybe she was just humouring a sick man she had a cheek like a flower petal and she smelled of the sun and the sea i put my lips close to her ear and whispered go and check if theyve really gone she stiffened as if shed touched a live wire then pushed herself upright and rose she went to the door peered through some interstices in the side screens then said in a quiet voice theyre both back in the professors living room i can see them lifting the safe into position put the lights out she crossed to the table turned down the wick cupped her hands above the top of the glass funnel and blew the room was plunged into darkness i swung off the bed unwound the couple of yards of medical plaster theyd wrapped round splints and ankle cursing softly as it stuck to the flesh put the splints to one side stood up and gave two or three experimental hops on my right foot i was hopping almost as good as ever the only pain was on the outside of my big toe which had taken the brunt of the weight of the safe when the sole had bent i tried it again and it was still ok i sat down and began to pull on sock and shoe what on earth are you doing marie asked the soft concern i noticed with regret had gone from her voice just testing i said softly i think the old foot will carry me around a bit yet but the bonei thought the bone was broken just a natural fast healer i tried the foot inside the shoe and hardly felt a thing then i told her what had happened at the end she said i suppose you thought it was clever to fool me id become used to a lot of feminine injustice in my life so i let it pass she was too smart not to see how unfair she was not at least when shed cooled down why she had to cool down i didnt know but when her temperature dropped she would realise the immense advantage id gained by having created the impression that i was completely incapacitated i heard her moving across the room back to the bed and as she passed me she said quietly you told me to count the chinese going in and out of the long hut well there were eighteen eighteen all id counted in the mine was eight eighteen notice what any of them was carrying when he came out i didnt see any come out not before it was dark uhhuh wheres the torch under my pillow here she turned in and shortly i could hear her slow even breathing but i knew she wasnt asleep i tore up strips of the plaster and stretched them across the face of the torch until there was only a quarter inch diameter hole left in the middle then i took up position by a crack in the sidescreens where i could watch the professors house hewell left shortly after eleven oclock went to his own house i saw a light come on then go out after about ten minutes i crossed to the cupboard where the chinese boy had put our clothes hunted around with the tiny spotlight of light until id found a pair of dark grey flannels and a blue shirt and quickly changed in the darkness taking a midnight walk in white shirt and white ducks was something that colonel raine wouldnt have approved of at all then i went back to maries bed and said softly youre not sleeping are you what do you want no warmth in the voice just none at all look marie dont be silly to fool them i had to fool you too when they were there dont you see the advantage of being mobile when they think im completely immobilised what did you expect me to do stand there at the door supported by hewell and the prof and sing out cheerily dont worry about this dear im only kidding i suppose not she said after a minute what did you want just to tell me that as a matter of fact it wasnt that it was your eyebrows my what eyebrows your hair is so blonde the eyebrows so black are they real the colour i mean are you all right i want to blacken my face mascara i thought you might have why didnt you say that in the first place instead of trying to be clever whatever her intelligence said about forgive some other part of her mind was against it no mascara all i have is black shoe polish top drawer right side i shuddered at the thought but said thanks and left her an hour later i left her altogether id made up a rough dummy in my bed checked every side of the house for interested spectators and left by the back lifting a corner of the sidescreens just sufficiently to squirm under there were no cries or shouts or shots bentall abroad unobserved and mighty glad of it against a dark background you couldnt have seen me from five yards although you could have smelled me at ten times the distance down wind certain makes of boot polish are like that on the first part of my trip between our house and the professors it wouldnt really have mattered whether my foot had been in commission or not to anyone looking out from hewells house or the workers hut i would have been silhouetted against the lightness of the sea and the white glimmer of the sands so i made it on my hands and elbows and knees heading for the rear of the house out of sight of all the others i passed the corner of the house and rose slowly and soundlessly to my feet pressing close in against the wall three long quiet steps and i was at the back door defeat had come almost before id started because there had been a hinged wooden door at front i had assumed that there would be the same at the rear but it was a plaited bamboo screen and as soon as id touched it it rustled and clicked with the sound of a hundred distant castanets i flattened myself against the door hand clenched round the base of my torch five minutes passed nothing happened nobody came and when finally a passing catspaw of wind brushed my face the reeds rustled again just as they had done before it took me two minutes to gather up twenty reeds in one hand without making too much racket about it two seconds to pass through into the house and another two minutes to let those reeds fall one by one into place the night wasnt all that warm but i could feel the sweat dripping down my forehead and into my eyes i wiped it away hooded my hand over the already tiny hole in the centre of the torch face slid on the switch with a cautious thumb and started going over the kitchen i didnt expect to find anything there that i wouldnt have found in any other kitchen and i didnt but i found what i was after the cutlery drawer tommy had a fine selection of carving knives all of them honed to a razors edge i picked a beauty a inch triangular job serrated on one side and straight on the other that tapered from two inches below the hilt to just nothing at all it had the point of a surgeons lancet it was better than nothing it was a lot better than nothing if i could find the gap between the ribs not even hewell would think i was tickling him i wrapped it carefully in a kitchen cloth and stuck it under my belt the inside kitchen door the one giving on the central passage was made of wood to keep the cooking smells from percolating throughout the house i supposed it opened inwards on oiled leather hinges i eased myself through into the passage and stood there listening i didnt have to listen very hard the professor was something less than a silent sleeper and the source of the snoring a room with an opened door about ten feet up the passage on the right was easy to locate i had no idea where the chinese boy slept i hadnt seen him leaving the house so i assumed that he must be in one of the other rooms and i didnt intend to find out which he seemed to me like a boy who would sleep very lightly indeed i hoped the professors adenoidal orchestration would blanket any noise i might make but for all that i went up the passage towards the livingroom door with all the rush and clatter of a cat stalking a bird across a sunlit lawn i made it in safety and closed the door behind me without even a whisper of sound i didnt waste any time looking around the room i knew where to look and went straight for the big kneehole desk if the direction of the burnished copper wire not quite buried in the thatch that had caught my eye when first id sat in the rattan chair that morning hadnt been guide enough my nose would have led me straight there the pungent smell however faint of sulphuric acid is unmistakeable most kneehole desks are lined on either side with a row of drawers but professor witherspoons was an exception there was a cupboard on either side and neither of them was locked there was no reason why they should have been i opened the lefthand door first and shone the pencil beam of light inside the compartment was big thirty niches high by eighteen wide and perhaps two feet in depth it was packed with lead acid accumulators and dry batteries there were ten of the accumulators on an upper shelf big glasssided volt cells wired together in series below were eight exide volt drycell batteries wired up in parallel enough power there to send a signal to the moon if a man had a radio transmitter and the man had a radio transmitter it was in the locker on the other side it took up the entire space of the locker i know a little of transmitterreceivers but this metallic grey mass with its score or more of calibrated dials wavebands and tuning knobs was quite unknown to me i peered closely at the makers name and it read kurabysankowa radio corporation osaka and shanghai it didnt mean a thing to me any more than the jumble of chinese characters engraved beneath it the wavelengths and receiving stations on the transmitting waveband were marked in both chinese and english and the needle was locked on foochow perhaps professor witherspoon was the kindhearted sort of employer who allowed his homesick workers to speak to their relatives in china but perhaps he wasnt i closed the door softly and turned my attention to the upper part of the desk the professor might have known i was coming he hadnt even bothered to pull down the rolltop after five minutes methodical search i was beginning to understand why he hadnt bothered there was nothing in the desktop drawers and pigeonholes worth concealing i was about to give it up and fold my tent when i looked again at the most obvious thing on that deskthe blotting pad with its fourcornered leather holder i took the blotters out of the holder and looked down at the piece of thin parchment paper that had been concealed between the lowest blotter and the pad it was a typewritten list of six lines each line consisting of a doublebarrelled name followed by figures eight figures every time the first line read pelicantakishmaru the second linkianghawetta and so on with the other four lines containing equally meaningless names and combinations of figures then there was a space of an inch then another line which read every hour tombola i could make nothing of it it seemed to be about the most useless informationif thats what it wasthat anyone could ever want or i could be looking at the most important code id ever seen either way it didnt seem much help to me but it might help later colonel raine reckoned id a photographic memory but not for this kind of junk i took pencil and paper from the professors desk copied the writing put the parchment back where id found it took off my shoe folded the paper and placed it wrapped in some waterproof cellophane between the sole of my foot and my sock i didnt fancy making that traverse through the passage to the kitchen again so i left through a window remote from hewells and the workers houses twenty minutes later i was well clear of all the houses and rose painfully to my feet i hadnt travelled so far on my hands elbows and knees since my nursery days and id lost the hang of the thing moreover years of not moving around on them had made mine quite unsuitable for this kind of locomotion and they ached fiercely but they werent in any worse condition than the clothes that covered them the sky was almost completely overcast but not quite and every now and then a sudden unveiling of the almost full moon made me drop quickly into the shelter of some scrub or bush and wait until the sky darkened over again i was following the line of the railway tracks which led from the crushing mills and drying shed round to the south and then presumably west of the island i was very interested in this line and its destination professor witherspoon had carefully refrained from making any mention of what lay on the other side of the island but for all his care professor witherspoon talked too much hed told me that the phosphate company used to take tons a day out of the hillside and as it wasnt there any more they must have taken it away that meant a ship a big ship and no big ship would ever have used that tiny floating pier of logs below the professors house even if it could have approached it closely enough in the shallow lagoon water which it couldnt something bigger was needed something much bigger a stone or concrete pier maybe one made from coral blocks and either a crane or a raised hopper with a canted loading chute maybe professor witherspoon hadnt wished me to walk in this direction a few seconds later i was wishing the same thing myself id just passed over a tiny culvert where a small stream almost covered in with bushes and thickets ran down from the mountain to the sea and had taken no more than ten paces beyond when there came the quick stealthy rush of padding feet behind me something heavy crashed into my back and shoulder and then before id time to start reacting something else closed over my upper left arm just above the elbow with all the power and brutal savagery of a sprung beartrap the immediate pain was agonizing hewell that was my first and instinctive reaction as i staggered and lurched and all but fell hewell it must be hewell no one else id ever known could have a grip like that it felt as if my arm was being crushed in half i swung round in a vicious halfcircle hooking with all the strength of my right arm for where his stomach ought to have been and all i did was make a hole in the night i almost dislocated my right shoulder but id more to think about than that as i lurched sideways again fighting for my balance fighting for my balance and fighting for my life it wasnt hewell who had me but a dog about the size and power of a wolf i tried to tear him off with my right hand but all i did was to sink those huge teeth still deeper into my arm i tried crashing my right fist again and again against that powerful body but he was so far to my left and back that i could barely reach him i tried kicking but i couldnt get anywhere near him i couldnt get at him i couldnt shake him off there was no solid object i could crush him against and i knew that if i tried falling on top of him hed have loosened his grip and had my throat before i knew what he was about he must have weighed between eighty and ninety pounds he had fangs like steel hooks and when you have steel hooks embedded in your arm and a weight of ninety pounds suspended from them only one thing can happenthe skin and flesh start to tear and i havent any different skin or flesh from anyone else i could feel myself getting weak i could feel the waves of pain and nausea washing over me when in a moment of clarity my mind or what passes for it started working again id no trouble in getting the knife clear of my belt but it took almost ten interminable and painfilled seconds before i could free it onehanded from its cloth wrapping after that it was easy the stiletto point entered just below the breastbone and angled inwards and upwards for the heart meeting almost no resistance the beartrap grip on my arm loosened in a fraction of a second and the dog was dead before it reached the ground i didnt know what kind of dog it was and i didnt care i hauled him by his heavy studded collar till i came to the culvert id so recently crossed dragged him down the short bank to the stream and pulled him into the water where the bushes were thickest i thought he would be pretty well screened from sight above but i didnt dare use my torch to see i jammed him in place with some heavy stones so that no freshet after heavy rain could wash him into view then lay face down by the stream for almost five minutes till the sharpest of the pain the shock and nausea had worn off and my racing pulse and pounding heart returned to something like normal it had been a bad couple of minutes getting my shirt and singlet off was no pleasure at all the arm was already stiffening up but i managed it and washed my arm thoroughly in the running water i was glad it was fresh water and not salt washing my arm i thought was going to do me a great deal of good if that dog had been suffering from hydrophobia about the same effect as if i washed my arm after a king cobra had struck but there didnt seem to be much point in worrying about it so i bandaged up my arm as well as i could with strips torn from my singlet pulled on my shirt climbed out of the culvert and continued on my way still following the metal tracks i carried the knife in my right hand now and i hadnt any cloth wrapped round it either i felt chilled cold with the icecold of a vicious anger i wasnt kindly disposed towards anyone i was almost round to the south of the island now there were no trees just bushes and scattered low shrub that was no good for concealment at all unless you lay prone on the ground and i wasnt in the mood for lying prone on the ground but i hadnt altogether taken leave of my senses and when the moon suddenly broke through into a large patch quite free from cloud i dropped flat and peered out from the shelter of some bushes that wouldnt have given decent cover to a rabbit in the brilliant wash of the moonlight i could see now that my first impression of the island from the reef that morning hadnt been entirely accurate the early morning mists had obscured the true features to the south of the island true the narrow plain at the foot of the mountain did from where i lay seem to go all the way round the island but it was much narrower here than in the east moreover it didnt slope steadily towards the sea but seemed even to slope from the sea to the base of the mountain which meant only one thing that the island to the south must end in a very steep drop to the lagoon perhaps even a sheer cliffface and i hadnt been right about the mountain either although this new feature i couldnt have seen from the reef instead of having the continuously smooth steeply sloping surface of a cone the mountain seemed to be almost completely bisected down its southerly face by a gigantic cleft or ravine no doubt a relic of that catastrophic day when the northern half of the mountain had vanished into the sea what this entire physical configuration amounted to was that the only way from east to west on this island appeared to lie across the narrow connecting belt of plain to the south it couldnt have been more than a hundred and twenty yards wide fifteen minutes later that patch in the clouds was twice as large and the moon still in the middle of it so i decided to move in that bright moonlight a move backwards would have been just as conspicuous as a move forwards so i decided i might as well keep going on i cursed that moon pretty steadily i said things about that moon that the poets and the tin pan alley merchants wouldnt have approved of at all but they would have approved of the unreserved apology i made to the moon only a couple of minutes later i had been inching forward on what was left of my elbows and knees with my head about nine inches above the ground when suddenly i saw something else about nine inches above the ground and less than a couple of feet from my eyes it was a wire strung above the ground on little steel pins with looped heads and i hadnt seen it further away because it was painted black the paint its low height above the ground the presence of a dog wandering around and the fact that the wire wasnt strung on insulators made it pretty clear that it wasnt an electric circuit carrying some kind of lethal current it was an oldfashioned trip wire it would be connected up with some mechanical warning device i waited twenty minutes without moving until the moon had again gone behind the clouds rose stiffly to my feet crossed the wire and got down again the land had now quite a definite dip to my right towards the base of the mountain and the railway track had been raised and banked on one side to meet the angle of the ground it seemed like a good idea to crawl along beneath the raised edge of the embankment i would be in shadow if the moon broke through again or i hoped i would be i was after almost halfanhour more of this elbow and knees caper during which i saw nothing and heard nothing and thought with increasingly sympathetic admiration of the lower members of the animal kingdom who were doomed to spend their lives getting around in this fashion the moon broke through again and this time i really saw something less than thirty yards ahead of me i saw a fence i had seen such fences before and they werent the kind that surround an english meadow where id seen them before had been in korea round prisoner of war cages this one was a ninestranded barbedwire affair over six feet high and curving outwards at the top it emerged from the impenetrable darkness of the verticallywalled cleft in the mountain to my right and ran due south across the plain perhaps ten yards beyond that there was another fence a duplicate of the first but what occupied my attention was not either of the fences but a group of three men i could see beyond the second fence they were standing together talking i presumed but so softly that i couldnt hear what they were saying and one of them had just lit a cigarette they were dressed in white ducks round caps gaiters and cartridge belts and carried rifles slung over their shoulders they were without any doubt at all seamen of the royal navy by this time my mind had given up i was tired i was exhausted i couldnt think any more given time i could maybe have thought up a couple of good reasons why i should suddenly on this remote fijian island stumble across three seamen of the royal navy but that seemed a daft sort of thing to do when all i had to do was stand up and ask them i transferred the weight from my elbows to the palms of my hands and started to get to my feet three yards ahead of me a bush moved shock froze me into involuntary and lifesaving immobility no relic dug out by the professor was ever half so petrified as i was at that moment the bush leaned over gently towards another bush and murmured something in so low a voice that i couldnt have heard it another five feet away but surely they must be hearing me my heart was reverberating in my ears like a riveters hammer it was going about the same speed too and even if they couldnt hear me they must surely have felt the vibrations being transmitted through my body and ground i was as near to them as that a seismograph could have picked me up in suva but they heard nothing they felt nothing i lowered myself back to the ground like a gambler laying down the last card thats going to lose him his fortune i made a mental note that all this stuff about oxygen being necessary for life was a tale invented by the doctors i had completely stopped breathing my right hand ached in the moonlight i could see the knuckles of the fist clenched round the hilt of the knife gleaming like burnished ivory it took a conscious effort of will to relax the grip even slightly but even so i still clung on to the handle of that knife harder than id ever clung on to anything before seven or eight aeons passed by and by the three naval guards who had that liberal interpretation of their duties possessed by naval guards the world over disappeared at least they seemed to disappear until i realised that what i had taken for a dark patch in the ground behind them was really a hut a minute passed then i heard the metallic clacking and hissing of a primus stove being pumped into life the bush in front of me moved again i twisted the knife in my hand until the blade was pointing up not down but he didnt come my way he crawled off silently parallel to the wire heading for another bush about thirty yards away and i could see that other bush stir as he approached the place was full of moving bushes that night i changed my mind about asking the guards what they were doing there another night perhaps tonight the wise man went to bed and thought about things if i could get to my bed without being chewed to pieces by dogs or knifed by one of hewells chinese i would think about things i made it back to the house in one piece it took me ninety minutes altogether half of it to cover the first fifty yards but i made it it was coming on for five in the morning when i raised the corner of the seaward screen and slipped into the house marie was asleep and there seemed to be no point in waking her bad news could wait i washed off the bootblack in a basin in the corner of the room but i was too tired to do anything about rebandaging my arm i was too tired even to think about things i climbed into bed and have only the faintest recollection of my head touching the pillow even if i had had a dozen arms and each one throbbing with pain as was my left i dont think they would have kept me awake that night chapter six thursday noonfriday am it was after noon when i awoke only one wall screen had been pulled up the one that gave on the lagoon i could see the green shimmer of water the white glare of sand the washed out pastels of the coral and beyond the lagoon the darker line of the sea with a cloudless sky above with three sidescreens down there was no through draught and it was stiflingly hot under that thatched roof but at least it made for privacy my left arm throbbed savagely but i was still alive no hydrophobia marie hopeman was sitting on a chair by my bed she was dressed in white shorts and blouse her eyes were clear and rested she had colour in her cheeks and altogether just looking at her made me feel terrible she was smiling down at me and i could see that she had made up her mind not to be sore at me any more she had a nice face far nicer than the one she had worn in london i said you look fine how do you feel original that was me right as rain fever all gone sorry to wake you up like this but therell be lunch going in half an hour the professor had one of his boys make those so that you could get over there she pointed to where a pair of remarkably wellmade crutches lay against a chair or you can have it here you must be hungry but i didnt want to wake you up for breakfast i didnt turn in till about six oclock that explains it i took my hat off to her patience to her ability to suppress her curiosity how do you feel i feel awful you look it she said candidly just not tough at all im falling to pieces what have you been doing all morning been squired around by the professor i went swimming with him this morningi think the professor likes going swimming with methen after wed had breakfast he took me round a bit and into the mine she shivered mockearnest i dont care for the mine very much wheres your boyfriend now away looking for a dog they cant find it anywhere the professors very upset it seems that this was a particular pet and he was very attached to it ha a pet ive met the pet and he was very attached to me the clinging type i freed my left arm from the blanket and unwrapped the bloodstained strips of cloth you can see where he was clinging my god her eyes widened and the warm colour ebbed from her cheeks thatthat looks ghastly i examined my arm with a kind of doleful pride and had to admit that she wasnt exaggerating any from shoulder to elbow most of the arm was blue purple and black and swollen as much as fifty per cent above normal there were four or five deep triangular tears in the flesh and the blood was still oozing slowly from three of them the parts of my arm that didnt seem discoloured were probably just as bad as the rest only they were hidden under a thick crust of dark driedup blood i had seen pleasanter sights what happened to the dog she whispered i killed him i reached under the pillow and drew out the bloodstained knife with this where on earth did you get that wherei think youd better tell me everything from the beginning so i told her quickly and softly while she cleaned up my arm and bandaged it again she didnt like the job but she did it well when id finished speaking she said what lies on the other side of the island i dont know i said truthfully but im beginning to make all sorts of guesses and i dont like any of them she said nothing to this just finished tying up my arm and helping me into a longsleeved shirt after that she fixed up the splints and plaster again on my right ankle went to the cupboard and brought back her handbag i said sourly going to powder your nose for the boyfriend im going to powder yours she said before i was properly aware of what she was doing she had some kind of cream on my face and rubbed it in and was dusting powder over it after a bit she leaned back and surveyed her handiwork you look simply sweet she murmured and handed me her pocket mirror i looked awful one horrified glance at me would have had any life assurance salesman in the land jumping on his fountain pen with both feet the drawn features the bloodshot eyes with the blue under them were my own contributions but the ghastly and highly convincing pallor of the rest of my face was entirely due to marie wonderful i agreed and whats going to happen when the professor gets a good whiff of this face powder she drew a miniature scentspray from her bag after ive sprayed a couple of ounces of night of mystery on myself he wont be able to smell anything else within twenty yards i wrinkled my nose and said i see your point night of mystery was pretty powerful stuff at least in the quantities she was using what happens if i start sweating wont all this cream and powder stuff start to streak its guaranteed not to she smiled if it does well sue the makers sure i said heavily that should be interesting you know the shades of the late j bentall and m hopeman herewith propose to raise an action stop it she said sharply stop it will you i stopped it she was a very touchy girl on some subjects or maybe i was just clumsy and careless i said dont you think the halfhour is just about up she nodded yes wed better go it took me until i had got down the steps and moved six paces into the sunshine to realise that maries careful preparation with the cream and powder was probably just so much wasted effort the way i felt nothing could have made me look worse with only one foot in commission and the other shoeless foot swinging clear of the ground i was forced to throw much of my weight on the crutches and with every thud of the lefthand crutch on the hardbaked earth a violent jolt of pain stabbed clear through my arm from the fingertips all the way to the shoulder then across my back to the very top of my head i didnt see why an arm injury should give me a violent headache but it did this was something else to take up with the medical profession old witherspoon had either been watching or had heard the thud of my crutches for he opened the door and came hopping briskly down the steps to greet us the broad beam of welcome changed to a look of distress as he caught sight of my face god bless my soul bless my soul he came hurrying anxiously forward and took my arm you looki mean this has given you a terrible shake good god my boy the sweats pouring down your face he wasnt exaggerating it was pouring down my face it had started pouring at the precise instant that he had gripped me by the arm the left arm just above the elbow he was screwing my arm off at the shoulder socket he thought he was helping me ill be all right i gave him my wan smile just jarred my foot coming down our steps otherwise i hardly feel a thing you shouldnt have come out he scolded foolish terribly foolish we would have sent lunch across however now that youre here dear me dear me i feel so guilty about all this its not your fault i reassured him hed shifted his grip higher to assist me up the steps and i noted with faint surprise that his house was swaying from side to side you werent to know that the floor was unsafe but i did i did thats what vexes me so much unforgivable unforgivable he ushered me into a chair in his livingroom fussing and clucking around like an old hen by jove you do look ill brandy eh brandy nothing id like better i said honestly he did his usual testing to destruction act with the handbell brandy was brought and the patient revived he waited till id downed half my drink then said dont you think i should have another look at that ankle thank you but fortunately no need i said easily marie fixed it this morning i had the good sense to marry a fully qualified nurse i hear youve had a little trouble yourself did you find your dog no trace of him anywhere most vexing most disturbing a doberman you knowvery devoted to him yes very devoted i cant think what has happened he shook his head worriedly poured some sherry for himself and marie and sat beside her on the rattan couch i fear some misfortune has overtaken him misfortune marie gazed at him wideeyed on this peaceful little island snakes im afraid highly poisonous vipers they infest the southern part of the island and live in the rocks at the foot of the mountain carlmy dogmay have been bitten by one of those incidentally i meant to warn youon no account go near that part of the island extremely dangerous extremely vipers marie shuddered do theydo they come near the houses here oh dear me no the professor patted her hand in absentminded affection no need to worry my dear they hate this phosphate dust just remind yourself to confine your walks to this part of the island i certainly shall marie agreed but tell me professor if the vipers had got him wouldnt youor someonehave found his body not if he were in among the rocks at the foot of the mountain fearful jumble there of course he may come back yet or he may have taken a swim i suggested a swim the professor frowned i dont follow you my boy was he fond of water as a matter of fact he was by jove i believe youve hit on it lagoons full of tiger sharks monsters some of them up to eighteen feetand i do know they move close in at night that must have been it that must have been it poor carl one of those monsters could have bitten him clear in two what an end for a dog what an end witherspoon shook his head mournfully and cleared his throat dear me i shall miss him he was more than a dog he was a friend a faithful and a gentle friend we all sat around for a couple of minutes in silent sorrow paying our last respects to this departed pillar of canine benevolence and then we got on with the lunch it was still daylight but the sun had sunk beyond the shoulder of the mountain when i woke up i felt fresh and rested and while my arm was still stiff and sore the throbbing pain of the morning had gone as long as i didnt have to move around the discomfort was hardly worth mentioning marie had not yet returned she and the professor had gone out trolling for trevallywhatever trevally might be with the two fijian boys after lunch while i had returned to bed the professor had invited me also but it had obviously been only as a gesture of politeness i hadnt the strength to pull in a sardine that afternoon so theyd gone without me professor witherspoon had expressed regrets and apologies and hoped i didnt mind his taking my wife with him id told him not at all and hoped that they would enjoy themselves and hed given me a funny look that i couldnt quite figure out and id had the obscure uneasy feeling of having put a foot wrong somewhere but whatever it was he hadnt let it puzzle him long he was too interested in his trevally not to mention marie id washed and shaved and managed to make myself look more or less respectable by the time they returned it appeared that the trevally hadnt been biting that day neither of them seemed very upset about it the professor was in tremendous form at the table that evening a genial thoughtful host with a fund of good stories he really went out of his way to entertain us and it didnt require any great deductive powers to guess that the effort wasnt being made on my behalf or on the behalf of hewell who sat at the opposite end of the table from me brooding and silent and remote marie laughed and smiled and talked almost as much as the professor she seemed to find his charm and good humour infectious but it didnt infect me any id done a good solid hour of constructive thinking before id gone to sleep that afternoon and the thinking had led me to inevitable conclusions that i found very frightening indeed i dont scare easy but i know when to be scared and never a better time in my opinion than when youve made the discovery that youre under the sentence of death and i was under the sentence of death i had no doubt at all left in my mind about this dinner over i pulled myself to my feet reached for the crutches thanked the professor for the meal and said that we couldnt possibly trespass on his kindness and hospitality any more that night we knew i said that he was a busy man he protested but not too violently and asked if there were any books he could send across to our house i said we would be pleased but that id like to take a few steps down to the beach first and he clucked his tongue and wondered whether it would not be too much for me but when i said that he had only to look out of the window and see for himself how little i was exerting myself he supposed doubtfully it would be all right we said goodnight and left them id some difficulty in negotiating the steep bank overhanging the top of the beach but after that it was easy the sand was dry and hardpacked and the crutches scarcely sank in at all we went about a couple of hundred yards down and along the beach always keeping in line of sight of the professors windows till we came to the edge of the lagoon there we sat down the moon was as it had been the previous night one moment there the next vanished behind drifting cloud i could hear the distant murmur of the surf breaking on the reef of the lagoon and the faint rustling whisper of the night wind in the nodding palms there were no exotic tropical scents i supposed that suffocating grey phosphate dust had crushed the life out of all but the trees and the toughest plants all i could smell was the sea marie touched my arm with gentle fingers how does it feel improving enjoy your afternoon out no i didnt think so you were too happy by half learn anything that might be useful how could i she asked disgustedly he did nothing but babble and talk nonsense all afternoon its the night of mystery and those clothes you wear i pointed out kindly youre driving the man out of his mind i dont seem to be driving you out of your mind she said tartly no i agreed then after a few seconds added bitterly you cant drive me out of what i havent got what strange modesty is this look at this beach i said has it ever occurred to you that four or five days ago in london before we even took off that someone knew that we would be sitting here tonight my god if ever i get out of this im going to devote the rest of my life to tiddleywinks im out of my depth in this line i knew i was right about fleck i knew i was he was no killer youre hopping about too much marie protested sure he wasnt going to kill us not nice captain fleck he was just going to tap us on the head and push us over the side the sharks would have done the dirty work for him remember when we were sitting on that upper deck remember i told you that i felt there was something wrong but that i couldnt put my finger on it remember yes i remember good old bentall i said savagely never misses a thing the ventilatorthe ventilator we used as a hearing aid the one facing the radio room it shouldnt have been facing the radio shack it should have been facing forward remember we got no air down there no bloody wonder theres no need to sorry but you see it all now dont you he knew that even a fool like me would discover that voices from the radio room could be heard down that pipe ten gets one he had a concealed mike down in that hold which let him know whenever bentall the einstein of espionage made such shattering discoveries he knew there were rats there and he knew that the rats would discourage us from sleeping on a low bunk so henry pushes back some battens which coincidentally happen to be at the very spot where we can start searching for tinned food and drink after wed passed up that deliberately awful breakfast they gave us more coincidences behind the tinned food are battens with loose screws and behind them are lifebelts fleck didnt exactly hang up a sign saying lifebelts in this boxbut he came pretty close to it then fleck puts the wind up me good and proper without in any way appearing to do so and more or less lets us know that the decision to execute or not will be coming through at seven so we latch ourselves on to that ventilator and when the word comes through we leave complete with lifebelts what do you bet that fleck hadnt even loosened the screw on the hatch to make things easyi could probably have forced it with my little finger butbut we could still have drowned marie said slowly we might have missed the reef or lagoon whatmiss a sixmile wide target you said old fleck seemed to be changing course pretty often and you were right he wanted to make good and sure that when we jumped we did so opposite the middle of the reef where we couldnt miss he even slowed right down so that we couldnt hurt ourselves when we jumped overboard probably standing there killing himself laughing when bentall and hopeman two stooges in search of a comedian pussyfooted it down the stern and those voices i heard on the reef that night john and james out in their canoe seeing that we didnt even put a foot wrong and sprain an ankle god how much of a sucker can you be there was a long silence i lit a couple of cigarettes and gave her one the moon had gone behind a cloud and her face was only a pale blue in the darkness then she said fleck and the professorthey must be working hand in hand can you see any other possibility what do they want with us im not sure yet i was sure but this was one thing i couldnt tell her butbut why all the fake buildup why couldnt fleck have sailed right in and handed us over to the professor theres an answer to that too whoever is behind this is a very smart boy indeed theres a reason for everything he does youdo you think the professoris he the man behind i dont know what he is dont forget the barbed wire the navy is there they may have come to play skittles but i dont think so theres something big very big and something very secret going on on the other side of the island whoever is in charge there will be taking no chances they know witherspoon is there and that fence doesnt mean a thing thats just to discourage wandering employees theyll have investigated him down to the last nail in his shoes the services have some very clever investigators indeed and if theyre content to have him there that means hes got a clean bill of health and he knows the navy is there fleck and the professor in cahoots the professor and the navy in cahoots what kind of sense do you make out of it you trust the professor then youre saying in effect that he is on the level im not saying anything im just thinking out loud no youre not she insisted if hes accepted by the navy he must be on the level thats what you say if he is then why the chinese crouching in the darkness down by the fence why the mankilling dog why the tripwire im just guessing he may have warned his employees to keep clear of that place and they know of the dog and the wire im not saying those were his chinese employees i saw i only assumed it if theres something big and secret happening on the other side of the island dont forget that secrets can be lost by people breaking out as well as by people breaking in the navy may well have some top men on this side to see that no one breaks out maybe the professor knows all about iti think he does weve lost too many secrets to the communist world during the past decade through sheer bad security the government may have learned its lesson but where do we come in she said helplessly its soso terribly complicated and how can you explain away the attempt to cripple you i cant but the more i think of it the more convinced i am that im only a tiny pawn in this and that nearly always tiny pawns have to be sacrificed to win the chess game but why she insisted why and what reason can a harmless old duffer like professor witherspoon have for if that harmless old duffer is professor witherspoon i interrupted heavily then im the queen of the may for almost a minute there was only the faroff murmur of the surf the whisper of the night wind in the trees i cant stand much more of this she said at last wearily you said yourself youve seen him on television and and a very reasonable facsimile he is too i agreed his name may even be witherspoon but hes certainly no professor of archaeology hes the only person ive ever met who knows less about archaeology than i do believe me thats a feat but he knows so much about it he knows nothing about it hes boned up on a couple of books on archaeology and polynesia and never got quarter of the way through either he didnt get far enough to find out that there are neither vipers nor malaria in those parts both of which he claims to exist thats why he objected to your having his books you might find out more than he knows it wouldnt take long he talks about recovering pottery and wooden implements from basaltthe lava would have crushed the one and incinerated the other he talks about dating wooden relics by experience and knowledge and any schoolboy in physics will tell you that it can be done with a high degree of accuracy by measuring the extent of decay of radioactive carbon in those relics he gave me to understand that those relics were the deepest ever found at feet and i dont suppose there are more than ten million people who know that a ten million year old skeleton was dug out from the tuscany hills about three years ago at a depth of feetin a coalmine as for the idea of using high explosive in archaeology instead of prying away gently with pick and shovelwell dont mention it around the british museum youll have the old boys keeling over like ninepins butbut all those relics and curios they have around they may be genuine professor witherspoon may have made a genuine strike then the idea occurred to the navy that here would be the perfect setup for secrecy they could have all access to the island forbidden for perfectly legitimate reasons and that would give them the ideal coverup nothing to excite the suspicions of countries who would be very excited indeed if they knew what the navy was doing whatever that is the strike may be finished long ago and witherspoon kept under wraps with someone very like him to put up a front for accidental visitors or those relics may be fakes maybe there never was an archaeological find here maybe its a brilliant idea dreamed up by the navy again they would require witherspoons cooperation but not necessarily himself which accounts for the bogus prof maybe the story was fed to the newspapers and magazines maybe some newspaper and magazine proprietors were approached by the government and persuaded to help out in the fraud its been done before but there were also american papers american magazines maybe its an angloamerican project i still dont understand why they should try to cripple you she said doubtfully but maybe one or either of your suggestions goes some way towards an answer maybe i really dont know but ill have the answer tonight ill find it inside that mine are youare you really crazy she said quietly youre not fit to go anywhere its only a short walk ill manage theres nothing wrong with my legs im coming with you youll do nothing of the kind please johnny no she spread out her hands im of no use to you at all dont be silly weve got to have someone to hold the fort to see that no one comes snooping into our house to find two dummies so long as they can hear even one person breathing and see another form beside him theyll be happy im going back for a couple of hours sleep why dont you go and whoop it up with the old professor he cant keep his eyes off you and you may find out a great deal more in that way than i will in mine im not quite sure that i understand what you mean the old matahari act i said impatiently whisper sweet nothings in his silver beard youll have him gaga in no time who knows what tender secrets he might not whisper in return you think so sure why not hes at the dangerous stage as far as women are concerned somewhere between eighteen and eighty he might start getting ideas well let him what does it matter just so long as you get some information out of him duty before pleasure you know i see she said softly she rose to her feet and stretched out her hand come on up i got to my feet a couple of seconds later i was sitting on the sand again it hadnt been so much the unexpectedness of the openhanded blow across the face as the sheer weight of it i was still sitting there feeling for the dislocation and marvelling at the weird antics of the female members of the race when she scrambled over the high bank at the top of the beach and disappeared my jaw seemed all right it hurt but it was still a jaw i got to my feet swung the crutches under my arms and started for the head of the beach it was pretty dark now and i could have made it three times as fast without the crutches but i wouldnt have put it past the old boy to have nightglasses on me the bank at the top was only three feet high but it was still too high for me i finally solved it by sitting on the edge and pushing myself up with my crutches but when i got to my feet swung round and made to take off the crutches broke through the soft soil and i fell backwards over on to the sand it knocked the breath out of me but it wasnt much of a fall as falls go not enough to make me swear out loud just enough to make me swear softly i was trying to get enough breath to swear some more when i heard the quick light sound of approaching feet and someone slid over the edge of the bank a glimpse of white a whiff of night of mystery shed come back to finish me off i braced my jaw again then unbraced it she was bent low down peering at me in no position at all to haul off at me again ii saw you fall her voice was husky are you badly hurt im in agony hey careful of my sore arm but she wasnt being careful she was kissing me she gave her kisses like she gave her slaps without any holding back that i could notice shewasnt crying but her cheek was wet with tears after a minute maybe two she murmured im so ashamed im so sorry so am i i said im sorry too id no idea what either of us was talking about but it didnt seem to matter very much at the moment by and by she rose and helped me over the edge of the bank and i tiptapped my way back to the house her arm in mine we passed by the professors bungalow on the way but i didnt make any further suggestions about her going in to see him it was just after ten oclock when i slid out under a raised corner of the seawardfacing sidescreen i could still feel her kisses but i could also feel my sore jaw so i left in a pretty neutral frame of mind as far as she was concerned that is as far as the others were concernedthe others being the professor and his meni wasnt feeling neutral at all i carried the torch in one hand and the knife in the other and this time i didnt have any cloth wrapped round the knife if there werent more lethal things than dogs on the island of vardu i sadly missed my bet the moon was lost behind heavy cloud but i took no chances it was almost a quarter of a mile to where the mine shaft was sunk into the side of the mountain but i covered nearly all of it on hands and knees and it didnt do my sore arm any great deal of good on the other hand i got there safely i didnt know if the professor would have any good reason to have a guard at the entrance to the mine or not again it seemed like a good idea to err on the side of caution so when i stood up slowly and stiffly in the black shadow of a rock where the moon wouldnt get me when and if it broke through i just stayed there i stood there for fifteen minutes and all i could hear was the faroff murmur of the pacific on the distant reef and the slow thudding of my own heart any unsuspecting guard who could keep as still as that for fifteen minutes was asleep i wasnt scared of men who were asleep i went on into the mine my rubbersoled sandals heelandtoed it along the limestone rock without the slightest whisper of sound no one could have heard me coming and after i was clear of the faint luminescence of the cavemouth no one could have seen me coming my torch was off if there was anyone inside that mine id meet them soon enough without letting them know i was on the way in the dark all men are equal with that knife in my hand i was slightly more than equal there was plenty of room between the wall and the railway track in the middle to make it unnecessary for me to walk on the sleepers i couldnt risk a sudden variation of length between a couple of ties it was simple enough to guide myself by brushing the back of the fingers of my right hand against the tunnel wall from time to time i took care that the haft of the knife did not strike solid rock inside a minute the tunnel wall fell away sharply to the right i had reached the first hollowedout cavern i went straight across it to the tunnel opening directly opposite guiding myself by touching the side of my left foot against the sleepers it took me five minutes to cross the yards width of that cave nobody called out nobody switched on a light nobody jumped me i was all alone or i was being left alone which wasnt the same thing at all thirty seconds after leaving the first cavern id reached the next one this was the one where the professor had said the first archaeological discoveries had been made the cavern with the two shoredup entrances to the left the railway going straight ahead and to the right the tunnel where wed found hewell and his crew working id no interest in the tunnel where wed found hewell working the professor had given me to understand that that was the source of the explosions that had wakened me the previous afternoon but all the amount of loose rock id seen lying there could have been brought down by a couple of goodsized firecrackers i followed the railwayacross the chamber straight into the opposite tunnel this led to a third chamber and then a fourth neither of those had any exits to the north into the side of the mountain as i found by walking round a complete semicircle to my right before regaining the railway track again i completed the circle in both chambers and found two openings to the south in each but i went straight on after that there were no more caverns just the tunnel that went on and on and on i thought i would never come to the end of it there had been no archaeological excavations made here it was just a plain and straightforward tunnel quite unconcerned with what lay on either side of it it was a tunnel that was going someplace i was having to walk on the ties now the diameter had narrowed to half of what it had been at first and i noticed that the gradient was slightly upward all the time i noticed too that the air in the tunnel and this at least a mile and a half after id left the mine entrance was still fresh and i guess that that explained the upward slant of the tunnelit was being kept deliberately near the rising slope of the mountainside to facilitate the driving of vertical ventilation shafts i must have been at least halfway across to the western side of the island by then and it wasnt very hard to guess that it wouldnt be long before the tunnel floor levelled out and started to descend it wasnt the stretch of level floor when i came to it didnt extend more than a hundred yards and then it began to dip just as the descent began my right hand failed to find the tunnel wall i risked a quick snap of the torch and saw a thirtyfoot deep cavern to my right half full of rock and debris for one moment i thought this must be the scene of yesterdays blasting but a second look put that thought out of my mind there were a couple of hundred tons of loose rock lying there far too much for one days work and besides there was no percentage in driving suddenly north into the heart of the mountain this was just a storage dump one probably excavated some time ago to provide a convenient deposit for the rock blasted from the tunnel proper when the need arose to do that quickly less than three hundred yards further on i found the end of the tunnel i rubbed my forehead which had been the part of me that had done the finding then switched on the tiny pencilbeam of light there were two small boxes lying o the floor both nearly empty but still holding a few charges of blasting powder detonators and fuses this beyond doubt was the scene of yesterdays blasting i played the torch beam over the end of the tunnel and that was all it was just the end of a tunnel a sevenfoot high by fourfoot wide solid face of rock and then i saw that it wasnt all solid not quite just below eyelevel a roughly circular rock about a foot in diameter appeared to have been jammed into a hole in the wall i eased out this lump of limestone and peered into the hole behind it was maybe four feet long tapering inwards to perhaps two inches and at the far end i could see something faintly twinkling red and green and white a star i put the rock back in position and left it took me half an hour to get back to the first of the four caverns i investigated the two openings leading off to the south but they led only to two further caverns neither of them with exits i headed back along the railway till i came to the third of the caverns from the entrance examined the two openings in this one and achieved nothing apart from getting myself lost in a maze for almost half an hour and then i came to the second cavern of the two tunnels leading off to the north i passed up the one where hewell had been working id find nothing there i found nothing in the neighbouring one either and of course there would be nothing behind the timber baulks holding up the entrances to the two collapsed tunnels to the south i made for the exit leading to the outer cavern when the thought occurred to me that the only reason i had for believing that those baulks of timber supported the entrances to a couple of cavedin tunnels was that professor witherspoon himself had told me they did and apart from the fact that he knew nothing about archaeology the only certain fact that i had so far established about the professor was that he was a fluent liar but he hadnt been lying about the first of these two tunnels the heavy vertical threebysix timbers that blocked the entrance were jammed immovably in place and when i pressed my torch against a halfinch gap between two of the timbers and switched it on i could clearly see the solid mass of stone and rubble that completely blocked the passage behind all the way from the floor to the collapsed roof maybe id been doing the professor an injustice and then again maybe i hadnt two of the timber baulks guarding the entrance to the second barricaded tunnel were loose no pickpocket ever lifted a wallet with half the delicate care and soundless stealth that i used to lift one of these baulks out of position and lean it against its neighbour a brief pressure on the torch button showed no signs of a roof collapse anywhere just a dingy grey smoothfloored tunnel stretching and dwindling away into the darkness i lifted a second batten out of place and squeezed through the gap into the tunnel beyond it was then that i discovered that i couldnt replace the battens from the inside one yes but even then only roughly in place but it was impossible to manoeuvre the other through the sixinch gap that was left there was nothing i could do about it i left it as it was and went down the tunnel thirty yards and the tunnel turned abruptly to the left i was still guiding myself as i had done earlier on by brushing the back of my right hand against the wall and suddenly the wall fell away to the right i reached in cautiously and touched something cold and metallic a key hanging on a hook i reached beyond it and traced out the outlines of a low narrow wooden door hinged on a heavy vertical post of timber i took down the key located the keyhole softly turned the lock and opened the door a fraction of an inch at a time my nostrils twitched to the pungent combined smells of oil and sulphuric acid i eased the door another two inches the hinges creaked in sepulchral protest i had the sudden vision of a gibbet and a swaying corpse turning in the night wind and the corpse was myself then i snapped abruptly to my senses realised that the time for pussyfooting was over passed quickly round the door and closed it behind me as i switched on the torch there was no one there one quick traverse of the torch beam round a cave no more than twenty feet in diameter was enough to show me that there was no one there but there were signs that someone had been there and very recently i moved forward stubbed my toe heavily against something solid looked down and saw a large leadacid accumulator wires from this led to a switch on the wall i pressed the switch and the cave was flooded with light perhaps flooded is the wrong word it was just by comparison with the weak beam from my torch a naked lamp forty watts or thereabouts suspended from the middle of the roof but it gave all the illumination i wanted stacked in the middle of the chamber were two piles of oiled yellow boxes i was almost certain what they were before i crossed to examine them and as soon as i saw the stencils on top i was certain the last time i had seen those boxes with the legend champion spark plugs stencilled on them was in the hold of flecks schooner machinegun ammunition and ammonal explosive so perhaps i hadnt been imagining things after all when i thought i had seen lights that night wed been marooned on the reef i had seen lights captain fleck unloading cargo by the righthand wall were two wooden racks holding twenty machinepistols and automatic carbines of a type i had never seen before they were heavily coated with grease against the drippingly damp atmosphere of the cave stacked beside the racks were three squarish metal boxes for a certainty ammunition for the guns i looked at the racked guns and the boxes and for the first time in my life i could understand how a gourmet felt when he sat down to an eightcourse dinner prepared by a cordonbleu chef and then i opened the first box the second and the third and i knew exactly how the same gourmet would have felt if while still adjusting his napkin the maitre dhotel had come along and told him that the shop was shut for the night the boxes contained not a single round of carbine or machinepistol ammunition one box contained black blasting powder another beehive blocks of amatol explosive and a drum of shortgun ammunition the third primers fulminate of mercury detonators about a hundred yards rdx fuses and a flat tin case of chemical igniters most of it stuff presumably that hewell used in his blasting operations and that was all my pipe dreams about a loaded machinepistol and the radical difference it would make to the balance of power on the island were just that pipe dreams and no more ammunition without guns to fire them guns without ammunition to fit them useless all useless i switched out the light and left it would have taken me only five minutes to wreck the firing mechanisms on every carbine and machine pistol there i was going to spend the rest of my days bitterly regretting the fact that the thought had never even occurred to me twenty yards further on i came to a similar door on the right of the tunnel wall no key to this one it didnt need it for the door wasnt locked i laid a gentle hand on the knob turned it and eased the door open a couple of inches the stench of foetid air that issued through the narrow crack was an almost physical blow in my face a putrescent mephitis that wrinkled my nostrils in nauseated repugnance and lifted all the hairs on the back of my head i felt suddenly very cold i opened the door further passed inside and shut it behind me the switch was in the same place as it had been in the previous cavern i pressed it and looked round the cave but this was no cave this was a tomb chapter seven friday am am some freak in the atmosphere of the cave possibly a combination of the moisture and the phosphate of lime had maintained the bodies in a state of almost perfect preservation decomposition had set in but to a negligible extent only certainly not enough to mar any of the essential features of the nine corpses lying where they had been flung in a rough row at the far end of the cave the dark stains on white and khaki shirtfronts made it easy to see how they had died again the icechill hand of fear touched the back of my neck i looked quickly around as if expecting to see the old man with the scythe still waiting patiently in some dark corner of the cave waiting for bentall only there were no dark corners nothing except the round smooth dank walls the shabby stained bundles on the floor and the battery supplying feeble power to the dim yellow lamp barely more than head high that dangled from the centre of the lowvaulted roof with my hand to my nose and breathing through my mouth only i switched on my torch to give extra illumination and scanned the dead faces six of the dead men were complete strangers to me labourers by the looks of their clothes and hands and i knew i had never seen them before but the seventh i recognised immediately white hair white moustache white beard here was the real professor witherspoon even in death his resemblance to the impostor who had taken his place was startling in its closeness beside him lay a giant of a man a man with red hair and a great red handlebar moustache this beyond any doubt would be the dr red carstairs whose portrait i had been shown in a magazine the ninth man in a much better state of preservation than the others i identified without a second glance his presence there confirmed that the men who had advertised for a second fuel research specialist had indeed been in need of one it was dr charles fairfield my old chief in the hepworth and ordnance fuel research one of the eight scientists who had been lured out to australia sweat was pouring down my face but i was shivering with cold what was dr fairfield doing there why had he been killed old fairfield was the last man to stumble upon anything a brilliant man in his own field he was as shortsighted as a dodo and had a monumental incuriosity about everybody and everything except his own work and his consuming private passion for archaeology and the archaeological tieup between fairfield and witherspoon was so blindingly obvious that it just didnt make any sense at all whatever reason lay behind dr fairfields sudden disappearance from england nothing was more certain than that it was entirely unconnected with whatever pick and shovel expertise he might show in abandoned mineworkings but then what in the name of god was he doing here i felt as if i were in an icebox but the sweat was trickling more heavily than ever down the back of my neck still holding the torch in my right handthe knife was in my lefti worked a handkerchief out of my right trouser pocket and mopped the back of my neck to the left and front of me i caught a momentary flash of something glittering on the wall of the cave something metallic obviously reflecting the beam of the still burning torch but what what metallic object was there apart from the dead men the only other objects in that cave were the light fitting and the light switch and both were made of bakelite i held the torch and handkerchief both still over my shoulder perfectly steady the glimmer of light on the cave wall was still there i stood like a statue my eyes never leaving that gleam on the wall the light moved my heart stopped the medical profession can say what it likes but my heart stopped then slowly carefully i brought down both torch and handkerchief transferred the torch to my left hand as if to enable me to shove my handkerchief away with my right then dropped the handkerchief clutched the hilt of the knife in my right hand and whirled round all in one half second of time there were two of them no more than four feet inside the cave still fifteen feet distant from me two chinese already moving wide apart to encircle me one in dungaree trousers and cotton shirt the other in a pair of cotton shorts both big muscular men both in their bare feet their unwinking eyes the oriental immobility of the yellow faces served only to emphasize not mask the cold implacability of the expressions you didnt have to know your emily post to realise that they just werent paying a social call nor would emily have given them any medals for their calling cards two of the most lethallooking doubleedged throwing knives id ever seen the books on etiquette covered practically every possible situation in which strangers first made the others acquaintance but theyd missed out on this one it would be ridiculous to deny that i was frightened so i wont i was scared and badly scared two fit men against one semiinvalid four good arms against one two undoubtedly skilled and cunning knifefighters against a man whod never even carved up a lump of cooked dead meat far less a live human being and this wasnt the time to learn but it was the time to do something and do it very quickly indeed before one or other of them caught on to the idea that at five yards i was a target that could hardly be missed and changed over from a stabbing to a throwing grip on his knife i rushed at them right hand and knife over my shoulder as if i were wielding a club and both of them fell back an involuntary couple of paces maybe because of the foolhardy recklessness of it more likely because of the respectful fear which orientals habitually show in the presence of madness i brought the knife whistling forward over my shoulder and with the tinkling of glass from the smashed overhead light and the flick of my left thumb on the torch switch the cave became as pitchblack as the tomb it really was it was essential to move and move as fast as possible before they realised that i had the double advantage of having a torch and being in the position to lash out indiscriminately with my knife in the hundred per cent certainty that i would be stabbing an enemy whereas they had a fifty per cent chance of stabbing a friend reckless of the noise i made in that utterly silent chamber i pulled away the occluding plaster on the face of the torch slipped off my sandals ran three heavy steps in the direction of the entrance stopped abruptly and sent both sandals sliding along the ground to thud softly against the wooden door had they been given another ten seconds to take stock of their position to work out the possibilities probably the last thing they would have done would have been to rush headlong to the source of the sudden noise as it was they had been given barely five seconds altogether in which to think and the immediate and inevitable reaction must have been that i was trying to escape i heard the quick patter of bare feet the sound of a brief scuffle a soft thud and an explosive gasp of agony that was lost in the clatter of something metallic falling to the floor four swift soundless steps on my stockinged feet a flick of the left thumb and they were pinned in the white glare of the torch a tableau vivant but for their unnaturally petrified rigidity which gave them for all the world the appearance of a group sculpted from marble they stood face to face their chests almost but not quite touching the man on my right had his left hand twisted in his companions shirt front while his right hand was pressed against the others body just below waist level the man on the left his face averted from me was arched over backwards like an overstrung bow both hands locked over the right hand of his companion the ridged and straining tendons turned the hands into waxen claws the knuckles gleamed white like polished bone i could see the bloodstained point of a knife sticking out two inches from the small of his back for two seconds perhaps threeit seemed far longer than thatthe man on the right stared unbelievingly into the face of the dying man then the realisation of his lethal blunder and the awareness that death stood now at his own elbow broke the horrornumbed spell that had held him in thrall he struggled frantically to withdraw his knife but the last agonies of his friend had locked right hand and knife fast in an ironbound grip he swung round desperately on me his left arm flying upwards and outwards in a gesture that was half blow half an attempt to shield himself from the beam id now directed into his shrinking eyes and for a moment he had no guard left the moment was enough and to spare the blade of my knife was twelve inches long but for all that i jarred both wrist and knife as the hilt struck home against the breastbone he coughed once a brief convulsive choked sound and drew his thin lips far back from the fastclenched teeth in to a hideous and bloodflecked grin then the blade of my knife snapped and i was left with only the hilt and an inch of steel in my hand as the two men still locked together swayed over to my right and crashed heavily on to the limestone floor of the cave i shone the torch beam down on the faces at my feet but it was a superfluous precaution they would never trouble me again i recovered my sandals picked up the fallen knife and left closing the door behind me once outside i leaned my weight against the tunnel wall hands hanging by my side and drew in great deep lungfuls of pure fresh air i felt weak but put it down to my damaged arm and the foul air inside that tomb the brief and violent episode on the other side of that door had left me curiously unaffected or so i thought until i felt the pain in my cheek muscles and jaw and realised that my lips were strained back in involuntary imitation of the deaths head grin of the man i had just killed it took a conscious effort of will to relax the overstrained muscles of my face it was then that i heard the singing this was it bentalls tottering reason had gone at last the shock of what id just seen and done had overstrained more than the facial muscles bentall unhinged bentall round the bend bentall hearing noises in his head what would colonel raine have said if he knew his trusty servant had gone off his trolley he would probably have smiled his little invisible smile and said in his dry dusty voice that to hear singing in an abandoned mineworking even a mine under the control of murderous impostors and patrolled by equally murderous chinese was not necessarily evidence of insanity to which his trusty servant would have replied no it wasnt but to hear a choir of english women singing greensleeves most certainly was for that was what i was hearing womens voices and singing greensleeves not a recording for one of the voices was slightly offkey and another trying to harmonise with what i could only regard as a very limited degree of success english women singing greensleeves i shook my head violently but they still kept at it i clasped my hands over my ears and the singing stopped i took them away and the singing started again noises in the head dont stop when you put your hands over your ears maybe the fact that there were english women down in that mine was crazy but at least i wasnt still like a man in a trance but careful for all that to make not the slightest whisper of sound i pushed myself off the door and went padding down the tunnel to investigate the sound of the singing swelled abruptly as i followed a ninety degree turning to the left twenty yards away i could see a faint backwash of light against the left side of the tunnel where it seemed to make another abrupt turning this time to the right i drifted up to this corner like a falling snowflake and poked my head around with all the dead slow caution of an old hedgehog taking his first wary squint at the world after a winters hibernation twenty feet away the full width of the tunnel was blocked by vertical iron bars spaced about six inches apart with an inset grille door ten feet beyond that were a similar set of bars with a similar door halfway between the two doors suspended close to the roof a naked bulb threw a harsh light over the small table directly beneath it and the two overalled men who sat one on either side of the table between them were a pile of curiously shaped wooden blocks and i assumed that they were playing a game but it wasnt any game id ever seen but whatever it was it was obviously a game that called for concentration to judge by the irritated looks both men gave in the direction of the darkened space that lay behind the second set of bars the singing showed no sign of stopping why people should be singing after midnight struck me as inexplicable until i remembered that to people imprisoned in a darkened cave day and night must have no meaning why they should be singing at all i couldnt even begin to imagine after maybe twenty seconds more of this one of the men thumped his fist on the table jumped to his feet picked up one of two carbines that i could now see had been propped against a chair crossed to the faraway set of bars and rattled the butt of the gun against the metal at the same time shouting out something in an angry voice i didnt understand the words but it didnt need a linguist to understand the meaning he was asking for silence he didnt get it after a pause lasting maybe three seconds the singing came again louder and more offkey than ever give them time and theyd start in on therell always be an england the man with the carbine shook his head in disgust and disbelief and came wearily back to the table the situation was beyond him it was beyond me too maybe if i hadnt been so tired or maybe if id been someone else altogether someone say about twice as smart as i was i might have thought of a way to get past or even overpower the guards but right then all i could think of was that i had one little knife and they had two big guns and that anyway id used up all my luck for that night i left marie was sleeping peacefully when i finally got back to our hut and i didnt wake her at once let her sleep as long as she could she wouldnt get any more sleep this night maybe her dark fears of the future were justified after all maybe she wasnt going to have any more sleep ever mentally physically emotionally i was exhausted completely exhausted let down as id never been before on the way out from the mine id come to the conclusion that there was one thing and one thing only to do id screwed what little was left of my nerve up to the sticking point to do it and when the doing had proved impossible the reaction had been correspondingly great what i had planned to do had been to kill both witherspooni still thought of him as thatand hewell not kill them murder them murder them as they lay in their beds or maybe it was better to say execute them obviously from the tunnel that went clear through to the other side of the island and the armoury in the mine a fullscale attack was about to be launched on the naval establishment on the other side of the island with witherspoon and hewell dead it seemed unlikely that the leaderless chinese would go through with it and to me at that moment the prevention of the attack was the only thing that mattered it mattered even more than the welfare of the girl asleep beside me and i could no longer kid myself that my feelings towards her were the same as theyd been three short days ago but she still came second but i hadnt killed them in their beds for the sufficient reason that neither of them had been in their beds theyd both been across at the professors house drinking the chilled canned beer that the chinese boy brought in from time to time talking in soft voices as they pored over charts the general and his adc preparing for dday and dday was at hand the disappointment the bitterness of what had seemed the ultimate defeat had taken the last of the heart from me id withdrawn from the window of the professors house and just stood there dully unthinkingly careless of the risk of discovery until after maybe five minutes a few of my brain cells started trudging around again then id walked heavily back up to the mineit says much for my state of mind that the thought of repeating my earlier hands and knees crawl up there never entered my headpicked up some rdx fuses and chemical igniters in the armoury came out again rummaged around the generating plant until i found a can of petrol and then returned now i got pencil and paper hooded the torch light and started writing a message in block capitals it took me only three minutes and when i was finished i was far from satisfied with it but it would have to do i crossed the room and shook marie by the shoulder she woke slowly reluctantly murmuring something in a drowsy voice then sat up abruptly in bed i could see the pale gleam of her shoulders in the dark the movement as a hand came up to brush tousled hair away from her eyes johnny she whispered what is it whatwhat did you find too damn much just let me talk we have very little time left know anything about radio radio a brief pause i did the usual course i can send morse not fast but morse i can manage myself do you know what frequency ships radio operators use for sending distress messages soss you mean im not sure low frequency isnt it or long wave same thing you cant remember the waveband she thought for a few moments and i sensed rather than saw the shake of the head in the darkness im sorry johnny it doesnt matter it did matter it mattered a very great deal but id been crazy even to hope but youll know old raines private code though of course well code this message will you i thrust the paper pencil and torch into her hands as quickly as you can she didnt ask me the purpose of what must have struck her as an idiotic request she just hooded the torch under the blanket and read the message in a low voice ridex combon london stop imprisoned vardu island approx miles south vtti levu stop discovered murdered bodies dr charles fairfield archaeologists professor witherspoon dr carstairs six others stop bilex wives missing scientists held prisoner here stop men responsible planning allout assault dawn naval installation west side vardu stop situation grave stop imperative airborne assistance immediately bentall the faint glow of the light died as the torch was switched off for almost twenty seconds there was nothing to be heard but the faroff murmur of the surf on the reef and when she finally spoke her voice was unsteady you found all this out tonight johnny yes theyve driven a tunnel clear through to the other side of the island theyve a wellstocked armoury hidden away in one of the caves where they keep their blasting explosive and i heard womens voices singing singing i know it sounds crazy it must be the scientists wives who else could it be get busy on that code i have to go out again the codehow are you going to send this message she asked helplessly professors radio the professorsbut youre bound to wake him up he isnt asleep he and hewell are still talking ill have to draw them off id thought first of going up to the north for half a mile or so and setting some delayed action amatol blocks but that wouldnt work so im going to set the workers hut on fire ive got the petrol and fuses here youre crazy her voice was still unsteady but maybe she had something there the workers hut is only a hundred yards from the professors house you could let off those amatol blocks a mile away give yourself plenty of time and she broke off and then went on abruptly whats all the desperate hurry anyway what makes you so certain that theyre going to attack at dawn its the same answer to everything i said wearily letting off a few bombs to the north might draw them off all right but as soon as they came back theyd start wondering where all the fireworks came from it wouldnt take them any time at all to realise that they must have come from the armoury the first thing theyll find up there is that a couple of their chinese guards are missing it wont take them long to find out where they are even if i dont set off bombs their absence is bound to be noticed by dawn at the latest i imagine probably long before that but we wont be here if we are theyll kill us me at any rate you said two guards were missing she said carefully dead you killed them she whispered more or less oh god must you try to be facetious i wasnt trying to be i picked up the petrol can fuse and igniters please code that as quickly as possible youre a strange person she murmured i think you frighten me at times i know i said i should have stood there turning both cheeks at once and let our yellow friends carve me into little ribbons i just havent got it in me to be a christian thats all i dropped down under the back screen lugging the can with me lights still burned in the professors house i skirted hewells hut and brought up at the back of the long house at the point where the steeppitched thatch of the roof swept down to within four feet of the ground i had little hopes of and no interest in burning the house down completely the huge saltwater butts which stood to the rear of every house precluded any chance of that but the thatch should make a tidy enough blaze for all that slowly painstakingly careful to avoid even the faintest glugglug from the neck of the can i poured the petrol on a two foot wide strip of thatch over almost half the length of the roof stretched out a length of rdx fuse above this one end going into the saturated thatch the other into a chemical igniter i placed the igniter on a small stone held in my hand tapped it with the base of the knife held the fuse long enough to feel the sudden warmth of the ignited powder train through its braided cover then left at once the empty petrol can i left under the floor of hewells house marie was sitting at a table when i got back a blanket draped over her and the table from beneath the blanket came a dim yellow glow and even as i carefully lowered the sidescreen facing the sea the lamp went out she emerged from the blanket and said softly johnny me finished here it is she handed me a slip of paper thanks i folded it away in a breast pocket and went on the entertainment starts in about four minutes when hewell and witherspoon come ankling by be at the doorway wideeyed clutching your negligee or whatever and asking the usual daft questions appropriate to such occasions then youll turn round and speak into the darkness telling me to stay where i am that im not fit to go anywhere after that get dressed quickly slacks socks shirt or cardigan everything as dark as you can cover up as much as you can hardly the ideal bathing suit but in night waters youll look a less appetising snack to the inshore tiger sharks the professor told us about than if you were wearing a bikini then take the sharkrepellent canisters off the two spare lifebelts and fit them swimming she interrupted were going swimming why for our lives two canisters and one life belt apiece well make better time that way butbut your arm johnny and the sharks my arm wont be much good to me if im dead i said heavily and ill take the sharks before hewell any day two minutes i must go johnny what is it i said impatiently be careful johnny im sorry i touched her cheek in the darkness im pretty clumsy arent i clumsy is no word for it she reached up and pressed my hand against her cheek just come back thats all when i got round to the back window of the professors house he and hewell were still pressing on with arrangements for the second front the conference seemed to be going well the professor was talking in a low emphatic voice pointing towards a chart which seemed to be some section of the pacific while hewells gigantic features cracked into a cold little halfsmile from time to time they were busy but not too busy to drink their beer it didnt seem to have any effect on them but it did on me it suddenly made me realise how dry and parched my throat was i just stood there waiting and wishing for two things a beer and a gun a beer to do away with my thirst and a gun to do away with hewell and witherspoon good old bentall i thought bitterly nothing of the common touch about him whenever he wishes for something it has to be really unattainable which once more just showed how wrong i could be within thirty seconds one of those wishes was mine the chinese boy had just entered the room with fresh supplies for the strategists when the black oblong of window behind hewells head became no longer black a vivid yellow flash suddenly lit the darkness behind the hut of the chinese from the professors house the rear of the hut was invisible and within five seconds the yellow had given way to a bright orangey red as the flames leaped up fifteen even twenty feet overtopping the high ridgepole of the hut petrol and thatch made a combustible combination of some note the chinese boy and the professor saw it in the same instant for a man who had consumed the amount of beer he seemed to have done i must say the professor didnt spend much time on doubletakes he passed some comment which bore no resemblance to his usual dear mes and god bless my souls kicked over his chair and took off like a rocket the chinese boy had been even faster but as it had cost him a second to lay his tray down on the nearest flat surface which happened to be the blotter on the open rolltop desk he arrived at the door at the same instant as witherspoon for a moment they jammed in the doorway the professor made some other comment not very learned in its nature and then they were off hewell pounding along on their heels five seconds later i was seated at the rolltop desk i tore open the righthand door unhooked from its inside the earpieces and bakelitebonded transmitting key leads from both of which led to the back of the set clapped the earphones to my head and set the key on the table there were a knob and a switch placed close together on the set it seemed logical to suppose that they might be the onoff power switch and the transmitting switch i turned the one and pressed the other and i was right at least id guessed right for the power switch the earphones filled at once with a loud insistent crackling so obviously it drew the receiving antenna into circuit low frequency marie had said shed thought distress signals went out on low frequency i stared at the five semicircular calibrated tuning dials the middle one of which was already illuminated gazed at the names of east asiatic towns marked in english and chinese and wondered how the hell a man could find out which was long wave and which short whether i could also hear my own transmissions on the earphones i didnt know i tapped out a few experimental soss but heard nothing i shifted the switch on the set back to the position id found it tapped the transmitter again but still nothing it was then that i caught sight of the small pushpull switch just beyond the key on the bakelite transmitter i pulled it towards me made the signal again and this time i heard it come clearly through on the phone obviously i could either transmit and receive at the same time or transmit without receiving if i felt like it the tuning dials were calibrated in thin black lines to show wavebands but there were no figures to indicate which bands they were that would have made no difference to an expert operator but it made a crippling difference to me i peered even more closely saw that the top two bands were marked khz at their outer ends the lower three mhz for several seconds i failed to see their significance my head was tired now and aching almost as much as my arm and then miraculously i got it k for kilocycles m for megacycles the topmost of the five bands would be the longest wavelength lowestfrequency of the lot thats where i wanted to be or at least i hoped it was where i wanted to be i pushed the left hand knob of a group of what i took to be waveband selector buttons and the top dial came to life as the light behind the centre dial died away i turned the station selector dial knob as far left as it would go and started transmitting i would send out a group of three soss wait a second repeat listen for three or four seconds move a fraction up the dial and start transmitting again it was dull work but the beer helped me along ten minutes passed during which time i must have transmitted on at least thirty different frequencies nothing no acknowledgment at all nothing i glanced at the clock on the wall one minute to three i sent out another sos call the same answer as all the others i was jumping by this time i could still see the red glare of the fire reflected on the inside walls but there was no guarantee that hewell and the professor were going to stay there till the last dying ember turned to charcoal they might be back any second or anyone happening by either of the two windows or the open door would be bound to see me but i didnt see that it mattered very much now if i couldnt get through on this radio i was finished anyway what really worried me was whether anyone had yet discovered the two dead men in the mine that way i would be finished too only an awful lot quicker was somebody already conducting a search because the guards had failed to report was the professor checking to see if i really was in bed had anyone found the petrol can under hewells house the questions were endless and the answers to all of them held so high a degree of possibility of so high a degree of unpleasantness that i put it all out of my mind i drank some more beer and got on with the transmitting the phones crackled in my ears i bent right forward as if that would help to bring me into closer contact with the distant sender and sent out the distress signal again once more the morse started buzzing my ears i could make out the individual letters but not the words they spelled out akita maru akita mara four times repeated a japanese ship a japanese radio operator the bentall luck was running true to form i moved further across the waveband i wondered how marie was getting on she would be set to go by now and trying to figure out what on earth had happened to me she would be looking at the time and knowing that the dawn was only three hours to go that those three hours might be all the time we had left unless the dead men were discovered in which case the time would be less maybe a great deal less i kept on sending and composed a little speech i was going to make to colonel raine when i got back if i got back fast fluent morse started stuttering through the earphones first the acknowledgment signal followed by us frigate novair county position name a us frigate maybe only a hundred miles away god it would be the answer to everything a frigate guns machineguns armed men everything then my elation ebbed a trifle position name of course in a genuine sos position came first always miles south of fiji i tapped vardu lat and long the operator cut in he was sending so fast that i could hardly pick it up uncertain what ship no ship island island of vardu again he overrode my transmission island yes get off the air you damn fool and stay off it this is a distress frequency with that the transmission ended abruptly i could have kicked that damned transmitter all the way into the lagoon i could have done the same with the duty operator on the novair county i could have wept with frustration but it was far too late for tears besides i could hardly blame him i sent again on the same frequency but the operator on the novair countyit could have been no otherjust leaned on his transmitting button and kept on leaning till i gave up i twisted the selector dial again but only a fraction id learnt one invaluable thing i was on the distress frequency keep burning hut i beseeched it silently keep burning for old bentalls sake please dont go out which was quite a lot to ask considering what id done to the hut it kept burning and i kept transmitting within twenty seconds i got another reply the acknowledgment then ss annandale position australian registry i sent yes position repeat position getting testy and understandably so when a mans shouting for help he shouldnt first of all enquire into the pedigree of his rescuer i hesitated for a second before sending i had to make an immediate impact on the operator or id likely get as short shrift as id had from the us navy the distress frequency is sacrosanct to all nations special british government investigator john bentall requesting immediate relay coded message via portishead radio to admiralty whitehall london desperately urgent are you sinking i waited for a few assorted blood vessels to burst but when none did i sent yes in the circumstances it seemed that it might save a great deal of misunderstanding please prepare receive message i was almost certain that the glare outside was beginning to die down there wouldnt be much of the hut left by this time there was a long pause someone was taking time to make up his mind then came the single word priority it was a question telegraphic address carries overriding priority all signals to london that got him proceed with message i proceeded forcing myself to tap it out slowly and accurately the red glow was fading on the inside of the walls of the room the fierce roar of flames had died away to a lazy crackling and i thought i could hear voices my neck was stiff from glancing back over my shoulder through the window nearest the fire but i didnt need my eyes to transmit with and i got the message through i finished please dispatch immediately there was a pause of maybe thirty seconds then he came through again master authorises immediate transmission are you in danger vessel approaching i sent that would keep them quiet ok a sudden thought occurred to me what is your position two hundred miles due east newcastle for all the help that was they might as well have been orbiting the earth in a satellite so i sent thank you very much and signed off i replaced the transmitting key and headphones closed up the doors and went to the window poking a cautious head round the corner id been wrong about the value of these big saltwater butts where the workers hut had been there remained now only a fivefoot high pile of glowing red embers and ashes id get no oscars for counterespionage but as an arsonist i was neck and neck with the best at least i wasnt a complete failure hewell and the professor were standing together presumably talking as the chinese dumped buckets of water on the smouldering remains and as there didnt seem to be much that they would be able to do at this late stage theyd likely be along any minute time to be gone i went along the centre passage turned right to pass through the still lit kitchen and then halted in a way that would have made an observer think that i had run into an invisible brick wall what had brought me up so short was the sight of a pile of canned beer empties lying in a wicker basket my god the beer good old bentall never missed a thing not if you held it six inches from his nose and beat him over the head with a club to attract his attention id drained two full beer glasses back in the livingroom there and just left the empties standing even with all the excitement neither the professor nor hewell struck me as a man who would be liable to forget that he had left a full glass behind himcertainly the chinese houseboy wouldntand they wouldnt put it down to evaporation from the heat of the fire either i picked up another couple of cans from the crate on the floor opened them in four seconds flat with the steel opener lying on the sink unit ran back to the desk in the livingroom and filled up the two glasses again holding them at a shallow angle so that a head too suspiciously high wouldnt be formed on the beer back in the kitchen again i dropped the cans among the other emptiesin the pile that had been consumed that night another two were liable to go unnoticedand then left the house i wasnt any too soon for i could see the houseboy making for the front door but i got back to our house unobserved i entered under the seaward screen and saw the outline of marie against the front doorway where she was still watching what was left of the fire i whispered her name and she came tome johnny she seemed glad to see me in a way that no one i could ever remember had been glad to see me before ive died about a hundred times since you left here is that all i put my good arm around her and squeezed and said i got the message through marie the message i was pretty well worn out that night mentally as well as physically but even so it took a pretty slow type to miss the fact that hed just been paid the biggest compliment of his life but i missed it youyou got it through how wonderful johnny luck a sensible sparks on an aussie ship halfway to london by this time and then things will happen what i dont know if there are any british american or french naval craft near theyll be nearer still in a few hours or detachments of soldiers by flying boat maybe from sydney i dont know but what i do know is that they wont be here in time sshh she touched my lips with her finger someone coming i heard the two voices one quick and sharp the other like a cement truck grinding up a grade in low gear witherspoon and hewell maybe ten yards away maybe not even that through the interstices in the screen wall i could see the swinging of the lantern that one or other of them was carrying i leapt for the bed fumbled desperately for a pajama jacket found one shrugged into it and buttoned it up to the neck and dived under a blanket i landed on the elbow of my injured arm and when i propped myself up on the other as a knock came and the two men entered without benefit of invitation it was no difficulty at all to look sick and pale heaven knows i felt it you must excuse us mrs bentall the professor said with that nice mixture of smoothness concern and undiluted unctuousness that would have made me sick if i hadnt been that way already but i had to admire his terrific powers of dissimulation under any and all circumstances in the light of what i had seen heard and done it was difficult to remember that we were still playing games of makebelieve we were naturally anxious to see if you were all right most distressing this really most distressing he patted maries shoulder in a paternal fashion that i would have ignored a couple of days ago and brought his lantern closer to have a good look at me merciful heavens my boy you dont look well at all how do you feel its only during the night that it gives me a little trouble i said bravely i had my head halfturned away ostensibly because the bright beam from the lantern was hurting my halfclosed eyes but actually because in the circumstances it seemed hardly advisable to waft too many beer fumes in his direction ill be fine tomorrow that was a terrible fire professor i wish id been fit to give you a hand how on earth could it have started those damned chinks hewell growled he was looming massively just outside the direct radiance of the light and the deepsunk eyes were quite lost under the craggy overhang of his great tufted brows pipesmokers and always making tea on little spirit stoves ive warned them often enough and against all regulations the professor put in testily they know it very well still we wont be here so much longer and they can sleep in the drying shed until then hope you havent been too upset about this well leave you now nothing we can do for you my dear i didnt think he was talking to me so i lowered myself down to the pillow with a stifled moan marie thanked him and said no good night then incidentally come across for breakfast when it suits you in the morning and my boy will be there to serve you hewell and i will be up betimes tomorrow he chuckled ruefully this archaeology is like a mild poison in the bloodonce it gets there it never lets you go he patted maries shoulder a bit more and took off i waited till marie reported that theyd reached the professors house then said as i was saying before the interruption help will come but not in time to save our bacon not if we stay here got the lifebelts and sharkrepellent ready theyre a horrible pair arent they she murmured i wish that murderous old goat would keep his hands to himself yes theyre ready must we johnny damn it all cant you see that we must leave yes but we cant go by land sheer mountains on one side a cliff on the other and a couple of barbed wire fences and assorted chinese in between make that impossible we could go through the tunnel but though three or four fit men might pickaxe their way through the last few feet in an hour i couldnt do it in a week the way im feeling you could blast it down you know where the supplies heaven help us both i said youre just as ignorant as i am tunnelling is a skilled occupation if we didnt bring the roof down on top of us wed certainly completely seal off the end of the tunnel and then our pals could come along and nab us at their leisure and we cant go by boat for the simple reason that both boatmen sleep in the boathouse and anyway it would be no good if that simple method of approach was open to witherspoon and hewell and the doughty captain fleck available to them they wouldnt tunnel all that way through rock if the navy takes such precautions with fences and guards against imagined friends what are they going to take against the sea where anybody may turn up you can bet your life that they have two or three small interlocking radar positions capable of picking up a seagull swimming ashore with a few quickfiring guns to back them up the only thing im against is leaving the scientists and their wives here but i dont see you never mentioned that the scientists were there she said in quick surprise no maybe i thought it was obvious maybe its not maybe im wrong but why else in the name of heaven should the wives be there the navy is working on some project of clearly considerable importance and this damned murdering whitehaired old monster is just biding his time to pinch it from his last remark lying in his teeth to the end i gather hes biding no more hes going to get this thing whatever it is and use the wives as levers to make the backroom boys work on it and develop it further for what purposes i cant even guess except that theyre bound to be nefarious i climbed stiffly out of the bed and pulled off the pajama jacket what other alternative occurs to you eight missing wives ditto scientists witherspoons bound to be using those wives as a lever if they were of no use to him in that capacity he wouldnt even bother to feed them he wouldnt waste anything on them except for a few ounces of lead as he did for the genuine witherspoon and others the man is devoid of feeling to the point of insanity where the wives are there the husbands are you dont think colonel raine sent us out to the fijis just to do the hulahula dance do you thats hawaii she murmured not fiji my god i said women im only teasing you clown she put her arms round my neck and came close to me her hands were abnormally cold and she was trembling dont you see i have to i just cant go on talking about it i thought i was quite goodin this businessand so did colonel raine but i dont think so any longer theres too muchtheres too much calculated inhumanity such an absolute indifference to good or evil or morality just whats expedient theres all those men murdered for no reason theres us and i think youre crazy to hope for us theres all those poor women especially those poor women she broke off gave a long quivering sigh and whispered tell me again about you and me and the lights of london so i told her told her so that i half believed it myself and i thought she did too for by and by she grew still but when i kissed her her lips were like ice and she turned away and buried her face in my neck i held her so for all of a minute then on mutual impulse at the same moment we parted and started to fasten on the lifebelts the remains of the workers hut was now no more than an acridsmelling dark red glow under the blackness of an overcast sky the lights still burned in the professors window i would have taken odds that he had no intention of going to sleep that night i was beginning to know enough of his nature to suspect that the exhaustion of a sleepless night would be small price to pay for the endless delights of savouring to the full the delightful anticipations of the pleasures of the day that was to come it started to rain as we left the heavy drops sputtering to sibilant extinction in the dying fire it couldnt have been better for us nobody saw us go for nobody could have seen us unless they had been within ten feet we walked almost a mile and a half to the south along the seashore and then as we approached the area where hewells chinese might be loitering as theyd been the night before we took to the sea we went out about twentyfive yards to waist level halfwalking halfswimming along but when we came to the spot where i could just barely discern through the rain the dark overhang of the cliff that marked the beginning of the barbed wire we made for the deeper water until we were over two hundred yards out it didnt seem likely but the moon might just conceivably break through we inflated our lifebelts very slowly although i hardly thought the sound would carry to shore the water was cool but not cold i swam in the lead and as i did i turned the operating screw of the sharkrepellent canister and a darkish evilsmelling liquidit would probably have been yellow in daylightwith extraordinary dissolving and spreading qualities spread over the surface of the sea i dont know what the sharkrepellent did to the sharks but it certainly repelled me chapter eight friday am am the rain eased and finally stopped altogether but the night stayed dark and the sharks stayed away we made slow time because i couldnt use my left arm to help me along but we made time and after almost an hour when i calculated that we must be at least half a mile beyond the barbed wire fences we started angling in slowly for shore less than two hundred yards from land i discovered that our change in direction was premature the high wall of cliff extended further round the south of the island than i had imagined it would there was nothing for it but to trudge slowly onby this time swimming would have been a complete and flattering misnomer for our laboured and clumsy movements through the waterand hope that we wouldnt lose our sense of direction in the slight obscuring drizzle that had again begun to fall luck stayed with us and so did our sense of direction for when the drizzle finally lifted i could see that we were no more than a hundred and fifty yards from a thin ribbon of sand that marked the shoreline it felt more like a hundred and fifty miles at least it did to me i had the vague impression that an undertow was pulling us out into the lagoon all the time but i knew this couldnt be so otherwise we would have been swept far out long ago it was just sheer weakness but my awareness was not of effort or exhaustion but almost wholly of frustration the urgency so desperate the progress so infuriatingly slow my feet touched bottom and i staggered upright in less than three feet of water i swayed and would have fallen had not marie caught my arm she was in far better shape than i was side by side we waded slowly ashore and the way i felt no one ever looked less like venus emerging from the deeps than i did right then together we stumbled on to the shore then two minds with but one thought we sat down heavily on the damp sand god at last i gasped the breath was wheezing in and out of my lungs like air through the sides of a motheaten bellows i thought wed never make it neither did we a clipped drawling voice agreed we swung round only to be blinded by the bright white glare from a pair of torches you certainly took your time please dont trygood lord a female although biologically accurate enough it struck me as a singularly inept term to describe marie hopeman but i let it pass instead i scrambled painfully to my feet and said you saw us coming for the past twenty minutes he drawled we have radar and infrared that would pick up the head of a shrimp if it stuck itself above water my word a woman whats your name are you armed the grasshopper mind a clear cut case for pelmanism i have a knife i said tiredly right now i couldnt cut asparagus with it you can have it if you want the light was no longer directly in our eyes and i could make out the shape of three figures clad in white two of them with the vague blurs of guns cradled in their arms my name is bentall you are a naval officer anderson sublieutenant anderson where in all the world have you two come from what is your reason look i interrupted those things can wait please take me to your commanding officer now its very important at once now just a minute my friend the drawl was more pronounced than ever you dont seem to realise at once i said look anderson you sound like a naval officer who might have a very promising career in front of him but i can promise you that a career stops today violently if you dont cooperate fast dont be a fool man do you think id turn up like this unless there was something most desperately wrong im a british intelligence agent and so is miss hopeman here how far to your cos place maybe he was no fool or maybe it was the urgency in my voice because after a moments hesitation he said the better part of a couple of miles but theres a telephone at a radar post quarter a mile along that way he pointed in the direction of the twin barbed wire fences if its really urgent send one of your men there please tell your co whats his name by the way captain griffiths tell captain griffiths that an attempt will almost certainly be made to overpower you and seize your installation very shortly perhaps in only an hour or two i said quickly professor witherspoon and his assistants who worked on the archaeological excavations on the other side of the island have been murdered by criminals who have driven murdered he came close to me did you say murdered let me finish theyve driven this tunnel clear through the island and need breach only a few more feet of limestone to emerge on this side of the island where i dont know probably about a hundred feet above sealevel youll need patrols patrols to listen for their picks and shovels theyre unlikely to blast their way out good god i know how many men have you here eighteen civilian the rest navy about fifty all told armed rifles tommyguns about a dozen altogether look here mrahbentall are you absolutely sure abouti mean how am i to know im sure for heavens sake man hurry up another momentary hesitation then he turned to one of the halfseen men by his side did you get that johnston yes sir witherspoon and the others dead attack expected through tunnel very soon patrols listening yes sir right off you go johnston disappeared at a dead run and anderson turned to me i suggest we go straight to the captain you will forgive me if leading seaman allison walks behind us you have made an illegal entry into an officially protected area and i cant take chances not till i have clear proof of your bona fides just so long as he keeps his safety catch on i dont care what he does i said wearily havent come all this length just to be shot in the back if your man trips over his own ankles we went off in single file not talking anderson with a torch leading the way and allison with another bringing up the rear i was feeling dizzy and unwell the first greyish streaks of dawn were beginning to finger their way upwards from the eastern horizon after we had gone perhaps three hundred yards following an illdefined track that ran first through a scrubby belt of palms and then low bush i heard an exclamation from the sailor behind me he came up close to my back then called out sir anderson stopped turned what is it allison this mans hurt sir badly hurt i should say look at his left arm we all looked at my left arm no one with more interest than myself despite my attempts to favour it as we had been swimming the exertion seemed to have opened up the major wounds again and my left hand was completely covered with blood that had dripped down my arm the spreading effect of the intermingled salt water made it seem worse than it actually was but even so it was more than enough to account for the way i felt sublieutenant anderson went far up in my estimation he spent no time on exclamations or sympathies but said mind if i rip this sleeve off go ahead i said but mind you dont rip off the arm at the same time i dont think theres a great deal holding it in place they cut off the sleeve with the aid of allisons knife and i could see the tightening of andersons thin brown intelligent face as he studied the wounds your friends across at the phosphate camp thats it they had a dog this is either infected or gangrenous or both either way its pretty nasty lucky for you we have a naval surgeon here hold this miss will you he handed his torch to marie pulled off his shirt and tore it into several wide strips using them to bandage my arm tightly wont do the infection any good but it should cut down the bleeding the civilian quonset huts arent any more than half a mile from here think you can make it the reserved tone in the voice had vanished the sight of that left arm had been as good as a character reference from the first sea lord i can make it its not all that bad ten minutes later a long low building with a nissen type roof loomed up out of the greying dark anderson knocked at a door walked in and touched a switch that lit up a couple of overhead lights it was a long bare barnlike structure of a place with the first third of it given over to a kind of communal living venture while beyond that a narrow central passage bisected two rows of eight by eight cubicles each with its own door all of them open to the main roof in the foreground brown corticene on the floor a couple of small tables with writing materials seven or eight rattan and canvas chairs and that was it no home from home but good enough for something that would only be left there to rust and flake away when the navy was finished with it anderson nodded to a chair and i didnt need any second invitation he crossed to a small alcove picked up a phone i hadnt noticed and cranked a navaltype generator he listened for a few minutes then hung it back on its rest damn things gone dead he said irritably always when you need it most sorry allison more walking for you my apologies to surgeon lieutenant brookman ask him to bring his kit tell him why and tell the captain well be over as soon as possible allison left i looked at marie seated across the table from me and i smiled back the first impression of anderson had been a wrong one if only they were all as efficient as he was the temptation to relax to let go and close the eyes was temptation indeed but id only to think of those still prisoners in the hands of witherspoon and hewell and i didnt feel sleepy any more the door of the nearest cubicle on the left opened and a tall skinny youngish man with prematurely grey hair and a pair of hornrimmed glasses clad only in a pair of undershorts came out into the passage glasses raised half way up his forehead as he rubbed the sleep out of myopic eyes he caught sight of anderson opened his mouth to speak caught sight of marie dropped his jaw in astonishment gave a peculiar kind of yelp and hurriedly retreated he wasnt the only one who was astonished compared to my own reactions he was a sellingplater in the jawdropping field i rose slowly to my feet propping myself up on the table bentall giving his incomparable impression of a man who has seen a ghost i was still giving the impression when the man appeared a few minutes later dressinggown flapping about his lanky ankles and this time the first person he saw was me he stopped short peered at me with his head outthrust at the end of a long thin neck then walked slowly to where i was standing johnny bentall he reached out to touch my right shoulder maybe to make sure i was real johnny bentall i got my jaw closed far enough to speak no other bentall it is i didnt exactly look to find you here dr hargreaves the last time id seen him had been over a year previously when hed been the chief of hypersonics in the hepworth ordnance establishment and the young lady even in moments of stress hargreaves had always been the most punctilious of men your wife bentall off and on i said marie hopeman exmrs bentall id explain later what are you your shoulder he said sharply your arm youve hurt it i refrained from telling him that i knew all about my arm a dog bit me i said patiently it didnt sound right somehow ill tell you all you want but first one or two things quickly please its important are you working here dr hargreaves of course i am he answered the question as if he considered it mildly halfwitted and from his point of view i suppose it was he would be unlikely to be taking a holiday in a naval camp in the south pacific doing what doing what he paused and peered at me through his pebbles im not quite sure whether i mr bentall says he is a government intelligence officer anderson put in quietly i believe him government intelligence dr hargreaves was in a repetitive mood tonight he looked at me suspiciously you must forgive me if im a bit confused bentall what happened to that machine importexport business you inherited from your uncle a year or so ago nothing it never existed there had to be some coverup story to account for my departure im betraying official secrets but not really doing any harm in telling you that i was seconded to a government agency to investigate the leakage of information about the new solid fuels we were working on at the time um he thought a bit then made up his mind solid fuel eh thats why were out here testing the stuff very secret and all that you know a new type rocket precisely it had to be that you dont have to take off to the middle of nowhere to carry out experiments on new stuff unless its either explosives or rockets and heaven knows weve reached the limit in explosives without blowing ourselves into space by this time other cubicle doors had opened and a variety of sleepy men in a variety of clothes and underclothes were peering out to see what the matter was anderson went and spoke softly to them knocked on a couple of other doors then came back and smiled apologetically might as well have them all here mr bentall if your facts are right its time they were up anyway and itll save you having to tell the same story over again thanks lieutenant i sat down again and closed grateful fingers over a large glass of whisky that had mysteriously appeared from nowhere two or three tentative sips and the room seemed to be floating around me neither my thoughts nor my eyes were any too keen to be focussed on anything but after another few sips my vision seemed to clear again and the pain in my arm began to recede i supposed i was getting lightheaded well come on bentall hargreaves said impatiently were waiting i looked up they were waiting seven of them altogether not counting andersonand the late dr fairfield was the missing eighth im sorry i said ill keep it short but first i wonder if any of you gentlemen have any spare clothes miss hopeman here has just recovered from a rather bad chill and fever and im afraid this gave me another minutes grace and time for the glass to be emptied and refilled by anderson the competition to supply marie with clothes was brisk when shed given me a grateful and rather tired smile and disappeared into one of the cubicles i told them the story in two minutes quickly concisely missing out nothing but the fact that id heard women singing in the abandoned mine when id finished one of the scientists a tall floridfaced old bird who looked like an elderly retired butcher and was in fact as i later discovered the countrys leading expert in inertial and infrared guidance systems looked at me coldly and snapped fantastic absolutely fantastic imminent danger of attack bah i dont believe a word of it whats your theory of what happened to dr fairfield i asked my theory the retired butcher snapped we all know how poor old fairfield met his dreadful end no theory we heard from witherspoonfairfield used to visit him regularly they were great friendsthat theyd been out trolling for trevally and hed fallen overboard and the sharks got him i suppose the more intelligent the mind the more easily it falls for any old rubbish id sooner rely on the babes in the wood than a scientist outside the four walls of his lab dale carnegie wouldnt have approved of any part of this i can prove it gentlemen but only by giving you bad news your wives re being held prisoner in the mine on the other side of the island they looked at me then at each other then back at me again have you gone mad bentall hargreaves was staring at me through his pebble glasses his mouth tight it would be better for you if i had no doubt you gentlemen imagine your wives are still in sydney or melbourne or wherever no doubt you write to them regularly no doubt you hear from them regularly no doubt you keep their letters or some of them or am i wrong gentlemen no one said i was wrong so if your wives are all writing from different homes you would expect by the law of averages that most of them would use different paper different pens different inks and that the different postmarks on the envelopes would not all be printed in the same colours as scientists you will all have respect for the law of averages i suggest we compare your letters and envelopes no one wants to read any private correspondence just to make a superficial comparison of likenesses and differences would you like to cooperate ori glanced at the redfaced manare you scared to learn the truth five minutes later the redfaced man was no longer redfaced and he had learned the truth of the seven envelopes produced three had been of one brand two of another and two of a thirdenough not to make the incoming mail look suspiciously alike the postmarks on the envelopes so beautifully clearcut as to suggest they had been stolen not manufactured by unauthorised persons were all in the same colour only two pens a fountain and a ballpoint had been used for the seven letters and the last point was the final clincherevery letter but one had been written on exactly the same notepaper they must have thought themselves safe enough there middleaged and elderly scientists dont usually show their letters around after id finished and given the letters back to their owners they exchanged glances dazed glances where the lack of understanding was matched only by the increasing fear they believed me all right now i thought my wifes tone was rather strange in recent letters hargreaves said slowly shes always been so full of humour and poking fun at scientists and now ive noticed the same someone else murmured but i put it down to you can put it down to coercion i said brutally its not easy to be witty when a gun is pointing at your head i dont pretend to know how the letters were introduced into your incoming mail but it would be a simple matter to a mind as brilliant as that of the man who killed witherspoon for he is brilliant anyway you can introduce mail into mailbags for a hundred years and no one will ever notice its only when you start taking it out that eyebrows begin to lift fairfield the redfaced man said stupidly it wasnt sharks we were told i dont have to draw a diagram to explain what happened to fairfield do i an illmannered interruption on my part and one that made little allowance for their state of shock but i was feeling pretty low myself he knew witherspoon wellall those archaeologists amateurs included know each otherand you say yourselves he visited him often by boat i assume but fairfield made one trip too many to see his friend because by the time he made his last trip someone had killed witherspoon and taken his place someone who could imitate witherspoon well enough to deceive casual contacts but he wouldnt have deceived fairfield so fairfield had to die sharks made a convenient scapegoat and they dont leave any traces and so no need to produce a body butbut what does it all mean hargreaves voice had a shake in it and his hands were clenching and unclenching in involuntary nervousness what will theywhat are they going to do with our wives you must give me a minute i said tiredly its as big a shock for me to find you here as it is for you to find out where your wives are i think youre safe enough now and the rocket installation but i believe your wives to be in deadly danger theres no good blinking facts expediency is all that matters to the men were against and humanity not at all if you move wrongly you may never see them again let me think please they wandered off reluctantly to complete dressing i thought but the first part of my thinking was far from constructive i thought of that old fox colonel raine and i thought of him with something lessthan affection i supposed that after twentyfive years in the business it was impossible for him to let his right hand know what his left was doing but more than that he had made an extraordinarily accurate assessment of the bentall character what there was of it i hadnt even bothered to ask the scientists whether they bad been a party to those advertisements in the telegraph obviously they must have been the men for this job had been picked long before the advertisements had appeared and the adverts had merely been a device to have them removed from the country without raising any questions and the fact that their wives had accompanied them had merely lent colour to the belief that they had gone abroad permanently obviously too as it had been a government project raine had known all about it in fact he was probably the man who had made all the necessary undercover arrangements i thought of how i had completely swallowed the old colonels story and i cursed him for his devious and twisted mind but for raine it had been necessary because somehow or otherhis contacts his sources of information were legionhe had discovered or strongly suspected that the wives of the men who had gone to vardu island were no longer in their australian homes he would have come to the conclusion that they were being held captive or hostage he would have worked out why and come to the same conclusion as i recently had but he would never have guessed that they were on vardu for it was almost certainly colonel raine himself who had worked out with the now murdered witherspoon the scheme to have vardu used as a protected area based on archaeological discovery whether the discoveries were genuine or not was a matter of complete unimportance old witherspoon and his associates would have been screened with a toothcomb and the idea of associating any skullduggery with that part of the island would have been fantastic vardu would have been the last place raine would have thought of to look for them he had just no idea at all where they were so he had fed me this yarn about sending me out to find the missing scientists but what he had actually intended was that marie should find the missing scientists wives she would find them he reasoned by being seized as they had been and for the same reasons and all he could hope for was that she or i or both could do something about it but if he had let me think for a moment that that was what he had in mind he knew i would never have gone along with it he knew what i thought about throwing women to the wolves instead of marie coming along as local colour for me i was going as local colour little better than a stooge for her i remembered now what he had said about her being much more experienced than i was that it might end up with her looking after me not vice versa and i felt about six inches tall i wondered how much of all of this if any was known to marie herself at this moment marie made her appearance she had dried and combed her hair and fitted into slacks and tshirt that fitted only where they touched but they touched in enough places to show that it wasnt the original owner who was inside them she smiled at me and i smiled back but it was a pretty mechanical sort of effort on my part the more i thought of it the more i suspected she must have known just how the land lay with colonel raine maybe neither she nor raine regarded me as anything other than a lucky amateur and in this business amateurs werent trusted not even lucky ones but what hurt was not the lack of trust but the fact that if i were right then shed fooled me throughout and if she could fool me about that then she could fool me about many other things too i was tired and weak and the thought was acid in my mind she was looking at me with the kind of expression on her face with which id always dreamed that someone just like marie would look at me and i knew it was impossible that i was being fooled i knew it for all of two seconds which was all the time it took me to remember that she had survived five years in one of the most hazardous professions in the world simply through an extremely highlydeveloped gift of fooling everyone all the time i was about to ask her some leading questions when dr hargreaves came up to me the others trailed behind him they were now all dressed in their day clothes they were worried stiff all of them and they looked it weve been talking and weve no doubt left in our minds that our wives are captive and in great danger hargreaves began without preamble ourour wives are our sole concern at this moment what do you suggest we do he was holding himself well in check but the tight mouth the straining tendons of his clasped hands gave him away damn it all man the elderly butcher had the choler back in his face again we rescue them thats what we do sure i agreed we rescue them how well look friend you dont begin to know the score let me explain there are three things we can do we can let the chinese break through the tunnel into the open then a few of us nip smartly in there go through to the other end release your wives and then what hewells killers would be loose among the sailors here and with all due respect to the navy it would be wolves among chickens and after theyd gobbled up the chickens theyd find we were missing and come back to finish us offand your wives as well and they might take some time finishing off your wives or we can blockade the tunnel exit and prevent them from coming out we can prevent them for about an hour which is all the time it will take for them to go back and collect your wives and by either using them as shields or putting a gun to their heads force us to lay down our arms i paused a moment to let this sink in but one glance round the tense still faces let me see that it had already sunk they were looking at me as if they didnt like me very much but i suppose that it was what i was saying that they really didnt like you said there was a third alternative hargreaves pressed me yes i rose stiffly to my feet glanced at anderson sorry lieutenant cant wait any longer for your mo time enough wasted there is a third alternative gentlemen the only practicable one as soon as they break through the mountainsideor as soon as we hear them trying to break througha party of us three or four with sledges and crowbars to force locks and armed in case guards have been left behind to look after your wives will go round the south of the island by boat land and hope to get your wives clear before witherspoon and hewell get the idea of sending back for your wives to use as hostages in this day and age i assume the navy no longer depends on oars and sails a fast power boat should get us there in fifteen minutes ive no doubt it would anderson said unhappily there was an embarrassed silence then he went on reluctantly the fact is mr bentall we havent got any boats say that again no boats not even a rowing boat im sorry look i said heavily i know there have been some pretty drastic cutbacks in naval estimates but if youll tell me how a navy can function without we did have boats anderson interrupted four of them attached to the light cruiser neckar which has been anchored in the lagoon off and on for the past three months the neckar left two days ago with rearadmiral harrison who is in overall charge and dr davies who has been in charge of the development of the black shrike throughout the work on it the black shrike the name of the rocket not quite in firing readiness yet but we had an urgent cable from london fortyeight hours ago saying it was essential to complete the work at once and ordering the neckar to the firing range immediatelyabout miles southwest of here thats why this particular island was chosenall open water to the southeast if anything goes wrong with the rocket well well i said heavily what a lovely coincidence a cable all the way from london all the correct codes hidden identification figures and telegraphic addresses ill bet it wasnt the fault of your communication and coding boys that they fell for it im afraid i dont understand and why should the neckar leave if the rocket wasnt in complete readiness i interrupted it wasnt much hargreaves put in dr fairfield had all his part of the job finished before heahdisappeared all that was required was that someone with a knowledge of solid fuelsi admit there arent manyshould complete the wiring up and fusing of the firing circuitry the cable giving the sailing orders said that a solid fuel expert would arrive on the island today i refrained from introducing myself that cable must have been sent off within hours of witherspoons being told that bentall was spending a wet and uncomfortable night on a reef out in the lagoon there was no question but that the man was a criminal but there was equally no question but that he was a criminal genius i was no criminal but i was no genius either we belonged in different leaguesthe top and the bottom i felt the way david would have felt if he had happened across goliath and discovered that he had left his sling at home i became vaguely aware that anderson and the redfaced man whom he addressed as farley were talking together and then the vagueness vanished i heard a couple of words that caught and transfixed my attention the way a tarantula in my soup would have done did i hear someone mention captain fleck i asked carefully yes anderson nodded fleck chap who runs a schooner and transfers all our stores and mail from kandavu to here but hes not due again until this afternoon it was as well that i had risen to my feet had i still been sitting in my chair i would probably have fallen out of it i said stupidly transfers your stores and mail eh thats right it was farley speaking his voice impatient australian trader mainly in government surplus but hes also on charter to us rigorously investigated security clearance of course of course of course my mind was occupied with visions of heck busily transferring mail from one end of the island to the other and then back again does he know whats going on here of course not anderson said all work on the rockets there are two of themare carried on under cover anyway does it matter mr bentall it doesnt matter not any more it didnt i think anderson that wed better go and consult with your captain griffiths we have little time left im afraid we may have no time left i turned to the door and halted as knuckles rapped on the outside of it anderson said come in and the door opened leading seaman allison stood there blinking in the sudden glare of light the surgeonlieutenant is here sir ah good good come in brookman we he broke off and said sharply wheres your gun allison allison grunted in agony as something struck him from behind with tremendous force and sent him staggering into the room to crash heavily into farley both men were still reeling falling together against one of the cubicle walls when the massive form of hewell appeared in the doorway he loomed tall as everest the gaunt granitic face empty of all life the black eyes far back and hidden under the tufted browshe must have forced allison to go first to give his own eyes time to become accustomed to the lightand in his huge fist was a gun a gun fitted with a black cylindrical object screwed on to the barrel a silencer sublieutenant anderson made the last mistake of his life he had a navy colt strapped to his waist and the mistake he made was trying to reach for it i shouted out a warning tried to reach him to knock his arm down but he was on my left side and my crippled arm was far too slow i had a momentary glimpse of hewells face and i knew it was too late his face was as still and as motionless and as empty of life as ever as he squeezed the trigger a soft muffled thud a look of faint surprise in andersons eyes as he put both hands to his chest and started toppling slowly backwards i tried to catch him and break his fall which was a foolish thing to do it didnt help either of us all it did was to wrench my left shoulder violently and theres not much point in hurting yourself trying to cushion the fall of a man who will never feel anything again chapter nine friday am am hewell advanced into the room he didnt even look at the dead man on the floor he made a gesture with his left hand and two softfooted chinese each with a machinepistol in his hand came in through the doorway behind him they carried their guns as if they knew how to use them anybody here armed hewell asked in his deep gravelly voice anybody here with arms in this room if so tell me now if i find arms on any man or in any mans room and he hasnt told me ill kill him any arms here there were no arms there if any of them had toothpicks and thought hewell might have considered those as arms theyd have rushed to get them hewell had that effect on people also there was no doubt but that he meant what he said good he advanced another step and looked down at me you fooled us bentall didnt you that makes you very clever nothing wrong with your foot was there bentall but your arm isnt so good is iti suppose the doberman did that to you before you killed it and you killed two of my best men didnt you bentall im afraid you will have to pay for that there was nothing sinister or menacing about the slow sepulchral voice but then it didnt have to be the mans looming presence the craggy ruin of a face made any further menace completely superfluous i didnt doubt that i would pay but it will have to wait just a little we cant have you dying on us yet can we bentall he spoke a few quick words in a foreign language to the chinese on his right a tall sinewy intelligent looking man with a face as still as hewells own then turned back to me i have to leave you for a momentwe have the guards by the boundary fence to attend to the main compound and garrison are already in our hands and all telephone lines to the guardposts cut i am leaving hang here to look after you dont any of you try anything clever with hang you might think one man even with a tommygun cant hold nine men in a small room and if any of you think that and try to act on it thats as good a way as any to find out why hang was the sergeantmajor of a machinegun battalion in korea hewells thin lips cracked in a humourless smile no prizes for guessing what side he was on seconds later he and the other chinese were gone i looked at marie and she at me but her face was tired and somehow sad and the small smile she gave me hadnt much behind it everybody else was looking at the chinese guard he didnt appear to be looking at anybody farley cleared his throat and said conversationally i think we could rush him bentall one from each side you rush him i said im staying where i am damn it all man his voice was low and desperate it may be our last chance weve had our last chance your courage is admirable farley which is more than can be said for your intelligence dont be a damned idiot but you heard what bentall said the guard spoke in faultless english with a heavy american accent dont be a damned idiot farley subsided in a moment you could see the swift collapse of the stiffened sinews of his resolution the draining of the insular arrogance which had led to the bland assumption that the guard could speak no language other than his own you will all sit and cross your legs the guard went on that will be safer for yourselves i dont want to kill anyone he paused then added as an afterthought except bentall you killed two members of my long tonight bentall there didnt seem to be any suitable comment on that one so i let it pass you may smoke if you wish he continued you may talk but do not talk in whispers there was no hurry to take him up on his second offer there are some situations which make it difficult to choose an agreeable topic of conversation and this seemed to be one of them besides i didnt want to talk i wanted to think if i could do it without damaging myself i tried to figure out how hewell and company had got through so soon it had been more or less a certainty id known that they were going to break through that morning but it had come hours before i had expected it had they made a spot check to see if we were still in bed possible but unlikely theyd showed no signs of suspicion when wed seen them after the fire or had they found the dead chinese in the tomb that was more likely but even if true it was still damnably hard luck i suppose i ought to have been bent double under the weight of bitterness and chagrin but strangely enough it hardly crossed my mind the game was lost and that was all that was to it or the game up till now was lost which seemed to be about the same thing or maybe it wasnt it was as if marie had read my mind youre still figuring arent you johnny she gave me that smile again the smile that id never seen her give anyone not even witherspoon and ray heart started capering around like a court jester in the middle ages until i reminded it that this was a girl who could fool anyone its like the colonel said sitting in the electric chair the mans hand on the switch and youre still figuring sure im figuring i said sourly im figuring how long ive got to live i saw the quick hurt in her eyes and turned away hargreaves was regarding me thoughtfully he was still scared but he could still think and hargreaves had a good mind youre hardly a goner yet are you he asked from what i gather neither your friend hewell nor this man here would hesitate to kill you but they dont hewell said we cant have you dying on us yet and you used to work in the same department as dr fairfield could you be the fuel expert that weve been expecting i suppose i am there was no point in saying anything else i hadnt known the bogus witherspoon half an hour altogether before id told him that i wondered if anywhere along the line there was a mistake i could have made and hadnt looking back it seemed unlikely its a long story some other time could you do it do what fuse up the rocket i wouldnt even know how to go about it i said untruthfully but you worked with fairfield hargreaves persisted not on solid fuel but i dont know a single thing about his latest solid fuel development i said harshly and to think id thought he had a good mind would the damned fool never shut up didnt he know the guard was listening what did he want to doput a rope round my neck i could see marie staring at him her lips compressed her hazel eyes very far from friendly theyve been too damned secret about all this i finished theyve sent out the wrong expert well thats useful hargreaves muttered isnt it i never even knew of the existence of this black shrike of yours how about putting me in the picture about it im one of those characters who believe that a man should go on learning till the day he dies this looks like my last chance to collect some fresh information he hesitated then said slowly im afraid youre afraid its all very top secret i said impatiently sure its very secretbut not to anyone on this island not any longer i suppose not hargreaves said doubtfully he thought for a moment and then smiled you will remember the late and bitterly lamented blue streak rocket our one and only entrant in the intercontinental ballistic missiles stakes i nodded sure i remember it it could do everything a missile should do except fly everyone felt this was very awkward considerable heartburning when the government dropped it much talk about selling out to the americans being absolutely dependent for nuclear defence on the americans britain now a very secondrate power if you could call her a power at all i remember the government was vastly unpopular yes and they didnt deserve any of it they dropped the entire project because one or two of the better military and scientific minds in britainwe have one or twokindly pointed out to them that the blue streak was a hundred percent unsuitable for its purpose anyway it was based on american type models such as the atlas icbm which takes twenty minutes to count down and get under way from the moment of the first alarm which is all very well for the americans with their dewlines and advanced radar stations their infrared detectors and spiesintheskies to detect exhaust trails of launched icbms theyre counting on getting a half an hour when some maniac presses the wrong button all the warning we can expect is four minutes hargreaves took off his spectacles polished them carefully and blinked myopically which means that if the blue streak had worked and if the countdown had started the moment the warning had come through it would still have been wiped out of existence by a five megaton russian icbm sixteen minutes before it was due to take off i can count i said you dont have to spell it out for me we had to spell it out for the ministry of defence hargreaves replied took them three or four years to catch on which is about par for the military mind look at the admirals and their battleships the other great drawback of the blue streak of course is that it would have required a huge launching installation all the ramps gantries and blockhouses the enormous trailers of helium and liquid nitrogen to pump in the kerosene and liquid oxygen under pressure and finally the vast size of the rocket itself this meant a permanent and fixed installation and with all those hordes of british and american planes flying over russian territories russian planes flying over american and british territoriesand for all i know british and americans flying over one anothers territoriesthose locations have become so well known that practically every launching base in the us and russia has a corresponding icbm from the other country zeroed in on it what was wanted then was a rocket that could be fired instantaneouslyand a rocket that was completely mobile completely portable this was impossible with any known missile fuel certainly not with the kerosenekerosene in this day and agewhich along with liquid oxygen still powers most of the american rockets certainly either not with the liquid hydrogen engines the americans are working on today the boiling point of f makes them ten times as tricky to handle as anything yet known and theyre far too big they were working on cesium and ion fuels i said theyll be working on them for a long time to come theyve got a dozen separate firms working on those and you know the old saw about too many cooks and so the mobile rocket ready for instant firing was impossible with any known propellantuntil hargreaves came up with a brilliantly simple idea for solid fuel twenty times as powerful as used in the american minuteman its so brilliantly simple hargreaves admitted that i dont know how it works neither did i but id learnt enough from fairfield to learn how to make it work but here and now i never would youre sure it really does work i asked were sure all right on a small scale that is dr fairfield fitted a twentyeight pound charge to a specially constructed miniature rocket and fired it from an uninhabited island off the west coast of scotland it took off exactly as fairfield had predicted very slowly at first far more slowly than conventional missiles hargreaves smiled reminiscently and then it started accelerating wethe radar scanners lost it about feet it was still accelerating and doing close on miles an hour then more experiments scaled down charges till he got what he wanted then we multiplied the weight of the rocket fuel simulated warhead and brain by and thats the black shrike maybe multiplying by brings in some fresh factors thats what weve got to find out thats why were here the americans know about this no hargreaves smiled dreamily but we hope they will one day we hope to supply them with it in a year or two thats why its been designed far in excess of our own requirements designed to carry a twoton hydrogen bomb six thousand miles in fifteen minutes reaching a maximum speed of miles per hour sixteen tons compared to the tons of their own icbms feet high compared to a hundred can be carried and fired from any merchant ship coaster submarine train or heavy truck all that and instant firing he smiled again and this time the dreaminess was suffused with a certain complacency the yanks are just going to love the black shrike i looked at him youre not seriously suggesting that witherspoon and hewell are working for the americans are you working for the he pulled the spectacles down his nose and peered at me over the thick hornrims eyes wide in myopic astonishment what on earth do you mean i just mean that if they arent i dont see how the americans are going to have a chance to look at the shrike far less love it he looked at me nodded looked away and said nothing it seemed a shame to destroy his scientific enthusiasm the dawn was in the sky now even with the lamps still burning inside the quonset we could see the lightening grey patches where the windows lay my arm felt as if the doberman were still clinging to it i remembered the halffinished glass of whisky on the table reached up for it and said cheers no one said cheers back to me but i disregarded their unmannerly attitude and downed it all the same it didnt do me any good that i could feel farley the infrared guidance expert gradually recovered his colour courage and indignation and carried on a long and bitter monologue in which the two words damnable and outrage were the recurring theme he didnt say anything about writing his mp nobody else said anything at all nobody looked at the dead man on the floor i wished that someone would give me some more whisky or even that i knew where anderson had found the bottle it seemed all wrong that i should be thinking more about the bottle than the dead man whod given me my first drink from it but then everything was wrong that morning and besides the past was past the futurewhat remained of itwas to come and while the whisky might help nothing was surer than that anderson would never help anyone again hewell returned at the dawn he returned at the dawn and he returned alone and it didnt need the sight of his bloodstained left forearm to tell me why he had returned alone the three guards by the wire must have been more watchful and more capable than he had imagined but they hadnt been capable enough if hewell was worried by his wound the death of yet another of his men or the murder of three seamen he hid his worry well i looked round the faces of the men in the quonset faces grey and strained and afraid and i knew i didnt need to spell out for them what had happened in different circumstancesin very different circumstancesit would have been funny to watch the play of expression on their faces the utter disbelief that this could be happening to them struggling with the frightening knowledge that it was indeed happening to them but right there and then it wasnt any strain at all not to laugh hewell wasnt in a wordwasting mood he pulled out his gun gestured to hang to leave the hut looked us over without expression and said the single word out we went out apart from a sprinkling of palms down by the waters edge there werent any more trees or vegetation on this side of the island than there had been on the other the central mountain was much steeper on this side and the great gash that bisected its southward side was well in sight with one of the spurs running down from the northeast obscuring our view to the west and north hewell didnt give us any time to admire the view he formed us into a rough column of two ordered us to clasp our hands above our headsi paid no attention i doubt whether i could have done it anyway and he didnt press the matterand marched us off to the northwest over the low spur of rock three hundred yards on just over the first spuranother still lay ahead of usi noticed about fifty yards away on my right a pile of broken rock of very recent origin from my lower elevation i couldnt see what was behind that pile but i didnt have to see to know it was the exit of the tunnel where witherspoon and hewell had broken through in the early hours of the morning i looked carefully all around me plotting and remembering its position against every topographical feature i could see until i felt fairly certain that i could find it without trouble even on the darkest night i marvelled at my incurable penchant for assimilating and storing away information of the most useless character five minutes later we were over the low crest of the second spur and could see the whole of the plain on the west side of the island stretched out in front of us it was still in the shadow of the mountain but it was full daylight now and easy to make out every feature the plain was bigger than the one to the east but not much maybe a mile long from north to south and four hundred yards wide between the sea and the first slopes of the mountain there wasnt a single tree to be seen in the southwest corner of the plain a long wide pier stretched far out into the glittering lagoon at our distance of four or five hundred yards this jetty seemed to be made of concrete but was more likely of coral blocks at the far end of the pier mounted on rails with its supporting legs set very far apart was a heavy crane of the type id seen in graving yards for ship repair work the entire superstructure and jibthere was no counterbalancewere mounted on a ring of live rollers this was the crane the phosphate company would have used to load its shipsand it was also the crane that must have formed one of the deciding factors in the navys decision to set up its rocket installation on the island it wasnt often i thought that you would find readymade unloading facilities with a pier and crane that looked as if it might be good for thirty tons in a deserted island in the south pacific two other much narrower sets of rails ran up the pier a few years ago i supposed one of those would have brought loaded phosphate wagons down to the pierhead while the other took the empty ones away today one could still see one of the original sets of lines as it left the pier curving away to the south rusted and overgrown towards the phosphate mine but the other set had been removed and replaced by new lengths of fresh shining rail that led straight inland for a distance of perhaps two hundred yards halfway along its length it passed over a curious circular pad of concrete about twentyfive yards in diameter and finally ended in front of a hangarshaped building about thirty feet high forty wide and a hundred in length from where we stood almost directly behind the hangar it was impossible to see either its doors or where the rails ended but it was a safe guess that the latter went all the way inside the hangar itself was dazzling it appeared to have been painted m pure white but it was covered not in paint but in a painted white canvas a measure i supposed designed to reflect the suns rays and make work possible inside a building made of corrugated iron some little distance north of this stood what were clearly the livingquarters a group of haphazardly placed buildings squat ugly and obviously prefabricated further to the north again at a distance of almost threequarters of a mile from the hangar was what seemed to be a solid square of concrete set into the ground at that distance it was hard to tell but it didnt look to be any more than two or three feet high at least half a dozen tall steel poles rose from this concrete each pole topped with a meshed scanner or radio antenna all different in design hang led us straight to the nearest and largest of the prefabricated huts there were two men outside chinese both with automatic carbines one of them nodded and hang stood aside to let us pass through the open door the room beyond was obviously the ratings mess fifteen feet wide by forty long it had threetiered bunks arranged the full length of both walls with walls and bunks liberally decorated with pinups in every shape and form between each pair of vertical trios of bunks was a three part locker more art four mess tables joined end to end to make one table and scrubbed as snowy white as the floor they stood on ran the full length of the room set in the far wall of the room was a door the sign above it read p os mess on the benches round the two most distant tables sat about twenty men petty officers and ratings some were fully dressed others hardly dressed at all one was slumped across the table like a man asleep his head pillowed on his bare forearms and his forearms and the table below covered with clotted blood none of the men looked shocked or scared or worried they just sat there with tight and angry faces they didnt look the type to scare easily there were no kids among them the navy would have picked its best its most experienced men for this operation which probably explained why hewell and his men even with the elements of surprise and ambush on their side had run into trouble four men sat side by side on a bench by the top table like the men at the lower tables they had their hands clasped in front of them resting on the wood each man had his epaulettes of rank on his shoulders the big greyhaired man on the left with the puffed and bleeding mouth the grey watchful eyes and the four gold bars would be captain griffiths beside him a thin balding hooknosed man with three bars spaced by purple an engineer commander next to him a blond young man with red between his two gold bars that would be surgeonlieutenant brookman and finally another lieutenant a redhaired youngster with bitter eyes and a white compressed line where his mouth should have been five chinese guards were spaced round the walls of the room each carried an automatic carbine by the head of the first table smoking a cheroot with a malacca caneno gunin his hand and looking more benign and scholastic than ever was the man i had known as professor witherspoon or so i thought until he turned and looked directly at me and then i saw even although there was no particular expression on his face that i could be wrong about the benign part of it for the first time ever i saw him without the tinted glasses and i didnt like what i saw eyes with the lightest pupils i had ever seen but misted eyes with the flat dull look of inferior coloured marbles they were almost the eyes you sometimes see on men who are completely blind he glanced at hewell and said well well hewell said every man in the room except the redhaired lieutenant was staring at him id forgotten the impact that the first sight of this moving neanderthalic mountain could make we got them they were suspicious and waiting but we got them i lost one man so witherspoon turned to the captain that accounts for everyone you murdering fiends the greyhaired man whispered you fiends ten of my men killed witherspoon gave a slight signal with his cane and one of his guards stepped forward and placed his carbine barrel against the back of the neck of the rating next to the one who lay with his head pillowed on his arms thats all captain griffiths said quickly i swear that is all witherspoon gave another signal and the man stepped back i could see the white mark where the gun had been dressing in the mans neck the slow droop of the shoulders as he exhaled in a long soundless breath hewell nodded at the dead man beside him what happened i asked this young fool herewitherspoon pointed at the redhaired lieutenantwhere all the guns and ammunition were stored the young fool wouldnt tell me i had that man there shot next time i asked he told me hewell nodded absently as if it were the most right and natural thing in the world to shoot a man if another withheld information but i wasnt interested in hewell i was interested in witherspoon the absence of spectacles apart he hadnt changed externally at all but for all that the change was complete the quick birdlike movements the falsetto affected voice the repetitive habit of speech had vanished here now was a calm assured ruthless man absolute master of himself and all around him a man who never wasted an action or a word those the scientists witherspoon went on hewell nodded and witherspoon waved his cane towards the far end of the room theyre in there hewell and a guard started to shepherd the seven men towards the p os mess as they passed by witherspoon farley stopped and stood before him with clenched hands you monster he said thickly you damned witherspoon didnt seem even to look at him his malacca cane whistled through the air and farley screamed in agony and staggered back against the bunks clutching his face with both hands hewell caught him by the collar and sent him staggering and stumbling the length of the room witherspoon never even looked at him i had the vague idea that witherspoon and i werent going to get along very well in the near future the door at the far end opened the men were bundled inside and then the door was closed again but not before we all heard the highpitched excited disbelieving voices of women so you kept them under wraps while the navy was doing your work for you i said slowly to witherspoon now that you no longer need the navy but do need the scientistsno doubt to supervise and develop the building of fresh rockets wherever youre goingwell you need the wives too how else could you make their husbands work for you he turned to face me the long thin whippy cane swinging gently in his hand who asked you to speak you hit me with that cane i said and ill choke out your life with it everything was suddenly peculiarly still hewell on his way back halted in midstride everybody for some reason best known to himself had stopped breathing the thunder of a feather falling on the floor would have had them all airborne ten seconds each second about five minutes long passed everyone was still holding his breath then witherspoon laughed softly and turned to captain griffiths im afraid bentall here is of a rather different calibre from your men and our scientists he said as if in explanation bentall is for instance an excellent actor no other man has ever fooled me so long or so successfully bentall allows himself to be savaged by wild dogs and never shows a sign bentall with one arm out of commission meets up with two experienced knifefighters in a darkened cave and kills them both he is also for good measure highly skilled in burning down houses he shrugged almost apologetically but then of course it requires a very special man to become a member of britains secret service another peculiar silence even more peculiar than the one that had gone before everybody was looking at their first secret service man and they couldnt have been unduly impressed with a drawn haggard face like that of a cadaver and a body that looked even more so i wouldnt have done at all as a subject for a poster to attract fresh recruits to the service not of course that they used posters i wondered how on earth witherspoon had known the chinese guard hang had heard us of course but he hadnt yet spoken to witherspoon you are a government agent bentall arent you witherspoon asked softly im a scientist i said just to see how it would go a fuel research technician liquid fuel i added pointedly a sign that i didnt see and a guard advanced and pressed his gunbarrel against captain griffiths neck counterespionage i said thank you the guard fell back honest to goodness plain scientists arent expert in codes wireless telegraphy and morse you appear to be well versed in all of them dont you bentall i looked at lieutenant brookman i wonder if you would be kind enough to fix up this arm of mine witherspoon took a long step towards me his mouth was as white as the knuckles of the hand that held the malacca cane but his voice was as unperturbed as ever when im finished it may interest you to know that within two minutes of my returning home tonight after the fire a message started coming through on our radio transmitter from a vessel by the name of the pelican in which i have a considerable interest if it wasnt for the fact that my nervous system seemed to have completely stopped working id probably have jumped a foot if id the strength for any gymnastics like that which i hadnt as it was i didnt move a muscle of my face the pelican that had been the first name id seen on that list under the blotter the copied list that now lay between my sock and the sole of my right foot the pelican was listening in on a certain frequency he continued it had instructions to do so you may imagine the radio operators astonishment when an sos started coming through on that frequency a frequency far removed from the distress channels i still didnt move any facial muscles but it called for no willpower this time the shock of realization was enough the shock of appreciating the enormity of my blunder but it wasnt really my fault i had had no means of knowing that the in the list i had picked up meant that the pelican and the other shipsprobably all the other names were ships names toowere to begin listening in to keep a radio watch at fortysix minutes past every hour and as nearly as i could remember i had begun to transmit my first experimental sos when i was trying to line up the receiver and transmitter at almost exactly that time and on the preset wavelength of foochow which just happened to be the transmitting wavelength they were using he was a clever man this operator witherspoon continued he lost you and guessed it was because you had dropped down to the distress frequencies he found you there and followed you he heard the name vardu mentioned twice and knew something was far wrong he copied down letter for letter your signal to the annandale and then he waited ten minutes and called back i was still giving my impression of one of the statues on easter island carved from stone and badly battered this wasnt the end this wasnt necessarily the end but it was the end i knew it was combo ridex londonthe telegraphic address of the chief of your service wasnt it bentall he asked it seemed unlikely that i could convince him that all i had been doing was sending a birthday message to my aunt myrtle in putney so i nodded i guessed so and i thought it might be rather useful if i sent a message myself while hewellwho bad now discovered you were missingand his men were already pickaxeing away what was left of the tunnel i composed a second message i had no idea of course what your coded message had been but the one i sent to combo ridex london should meet the case i sent please disregard previous message everything under control essential you do not attempt to contact me forty eight hours no time code and took the liberty of adding your name do you think that will meet the case bentall i said nothing there was nothing i could say i looked round the faces at the table but no one was looking at me any more they were almost all staring down at their hands i glanced in maries direction but even she wasnt looking at me id been born in the wrong time and place i should have been in rome two thousand years ago and toppling slowly forward on to my sword i thought of the nasty big hole a sword would make and then by association of ideas of the nasty big holes in my upper left arm so i said to witherspoon would you permit surgeonlieutenant brookman to fix up my arm now he looked at me long and consideringly then said quietly i could almost regret that life has placed us on opposite sides of the fence i can well understand why your chief sent you on this mission you are a highly dangerous man im better than that i said im a lucky man ill carry your coffin yet he looked at me for a brief moment then turned to brookman fix this mans arm thank you professor witherspoon i said politely leclerc he said indifferently not witherspoon that babbling old idiot has served his purpose brookman made a good job he opened and cleaned the wounds with something that felt like a wire brush stitched them up neatly covered them all with aluminium foil and bandage fed me a variety of pills then for good measure jabbed me a couple of times with a hypodermic syringe had i been alone id have put any dancing dervish to shame but i felt id done damage enough to future secret service recruitment so i kept reasonably still by the time he was finished the room itself was beginning to go into a dancing dervish routine so i thanked brookman and without a byyourleave made shakily for the table and sat down heavily opposite captain griffiths witherspoonor leclerc as i had to think of him nowsat beside me you feel better bentall i couldnt feel worse if theres a hell for dogs i hope that damned hound of yours is roasting quite who is the senior scientist among those present captain griffiths what damnable evil are you up to now the greyhaired man demanded i wont repeat the question captain griffiths leclerc said mildly his misted white eyes flickered for a moment in the direction of the dead man collapsed on the table hargreaves griffiths said wearily he glanced in the direction of the sound of the voices behind the closed doors of the pos mess must you leclerc hes only just met his wife for the first time in many months he wont be fit to answer anything theres not much going on that i dont know im the man in overall charge you understand not hargreaves leclerc considered then said very well in what state of readiness is the black shrike is that all you want to know thats all the black shrike is completely ready in every respect except for the wiring up and fusing of the firing circuitry why wasnt this done because of the disappearance of dr fairfield i tried to focus on captain griffiths face among the kaleidoscopic whirl of people and furniture and dimly realised that it was only now that griffiths was beginning to understand why fairfield had disappeared he stared at leclerc for long moments then whispered huskily my god of course of course yes of course leclerc snapped but i didnt mean that why was the circuitry and fusing not finished earlier i understand that the loading of the propellant charge was completed over a month ago howhow in heavens name do you know that answer my question fairfield feared that the propellant mixture might show inherent instability in very hot weather and regarded that as sufficient risk in itself without the additional risk of fusing it griffiths rubbed a suntanned hand across his damp and bleeding face you should know that no projectile or missile from a twopounder to a hydrogen bomb is ever fused until the last possible moment how long did fairfield say the fusing would take i once heard him mention a period of forty minutes leclerc said softly youre lying captain i know the great virtue of the shrike is that it can be fired instantaneously that is so in time of war or tension it would be permanently fused but we are as yet not quite certain as to the inherent stability of the propellant forty minutes forty minutes leclerc turned to me you heard forty minutes i heard bits of it i mumbled im not hearing very well you are feeling sick sick i tried to stare at him in vast surprise but i couldnt find his face anywhere why should i be feeling sick you could fuse this bentall im a specialist in liquid fuel i said with difficulty i know differently i could see his face now because hed stuck it within three inches of mine you were fairfields assistant at the hepworth ordnance branch you worked on solid fuel i know you know an awful lot can you fuse this he persisted quietly whisky i said i need a drink of whisky oh my god he followed this up with some more language most of which i fortunately couldnt catch then called to one of his men i suppose lie chinese must have gone to the officers mess for a few moments later someone was putting a glass in my hand i gazed blearily at it a hefty three fingers in a tumbler and put it all away in a couple of gulps when id stopped coughing and wiped the tears away from my eyes i found i could see almost as good as ever leclerc touched my arm well whats the answer can you fuse up the shrike i wouldnt even know how to start youre ill leclerc said kindly you dont know what youre saying what you need is some sleep chapter ten friday am pm i slept for two hours when i awoke the sun was high in the sky and dr hargreaves the hypersonics specialist was shaking me gently by the shoulder at least he thought he was shaking me gently it was probably the fact that i had a blanket drawn over me that caused him to forget that he shouldnt have been shaking me by the left shoulder i told him to be more careful he looked hurt maybe it was the way i said it and then i pushed back the blanket and sat up i felt stiff and sore practically everywhere my shoulder and arm throbbed savagely but much of the tiredness was gone and my head was clear again which of course was what leclerc had wanted you cant have a man fusing and wiring up the complicated circuitry on a propellant with the disruptive potential of a hundred tons of high explosive if hes peering fumbling and staggering around with exhaustion like a drunken man from time to time i have cherished my share of illusions but one which i didnt cherish was that leclerc had finished with me hargreaves looked pale and distressed and unhappy i didnt wonder his reunion with his wife couldnt have been a very happy one the circumstances hadnt been very favourable and the immediate prospects even less so i wondered what they had done with marie whether they had put her in with the other women and when i asked him he said they had i looked around the tiny hut it was no more than eight by eight with racks along the walls and a tiny steelmeshed window above my head i seemed to remember vaguely that someone had mentioned that it used to be the small arms and ammunition storage shed but i couldnt be sure id just dropped on to the canvas cot theyd brought in and gone to sleep instantly i looked at hargreaves again whats been going on since this morning i mean questions he said tiredly questions all the time they interviewed my colleagues myself and the naval officers separately then they splitus up and separated us from our wives were all over the place now two or three to a hut leclercs psychology was easy to understand with the scientists and naval officers broken into tiny groups agreement on a concerted plan of resistance or revolt would be impossible and with the scientists separated from their wives and in a consequent and continuous state of fear and anxiety over their welfare their cooperation with leclerc would be absolute what did he want to see you about i asked lots of things he hesitated and looked away mainly about the rocket how much did any of us know about the fusing at least thats what he asked me i cant speak for the others do youdo any of them know anything about it only the general principles each one of us knows the general principles of the various components we have to but that doesnt even begin to be enough when it comes to the complex particulars he smiled wanly any of us could probably blow the whole thing to kingdom come theres a chance of that no one has ever given a guarantee on an experimental rocket hence the blockhousethat sunken concrete shelter to the north the test firing was to have been carried out from there just a firsttime precaution its also why they placed the scientists quonset so far away from the hangar the sailors are expendable but not the scientists is that it he didnt answer so i went on have you any idea where theyre intending to take this rocket the scientists and their wives the naval officers and ratings of course wont be taken anywhere what do you mean you know damn well what i mean theyre of no further use to leclerc and will be eliminated he shook his head in what was more an involuntary shudder than a shake and buried his face in his hands did leclerc make no mention of his ultimate destination he shook his head again and turned away he seemed badly upset about something unwilling to meet my eye but i couldnt find it in my heart to blame him russia perhaps not russia he stared at the floor wherever it is its not russia they wouldnt look at this old steamengine affair they wouldnt it was my turn to stare i thought this was the most advanced in the western world yes but in the last few months its been an open secret among our scientists but one theyre all frightened to talk about that russia has developedor is developingthe ultimate rocket the photon rocket hints dropped by professor stanyukovich the leading soviet expert on the dynamics of gases dont leave much room for doubt im afraid somehow or other theyve discovered the secret of harnessing and storing antiprotons we know about this antimatter but have no conception of how to store it but the russians have a couple of ounces of it would take the black shrike to the moon the implications of this were beyond me but i agreed that it was unlikely that the soviets would want the rocket red china japan the presence of chinese workers and leclercs sinojapanese transmitting set seemed to point that way but the possibility was that those pointers were far too obvious there were other countries in asiaand outside asiawho would dearly love to lay hands on the black shrike but even more important than the question of what nation could or would want such a rocket was the answer to the question how any nation in the world had known that we were building such a rocket far back in my mind the first beginnings of an answer were beginning to shape themselves towards an impossible solution i became gradually aware that hargreaves was speaking again i want to apologise for my stupidity this morning he was saying hesitantly damn silly of me to persist in saying you were a solid fuel expert i might have been putting a rope round your neck im afraid i was too upset to think at all far less think clearly but i dont think the guard noticed its all right i dont think either that the guard noticed youre not going to cooperate with leclerc hargreaves asked his hands were clasping and unclasping all the time his nerves were no match for his brains i know you could do it if you wanted sure i could a couple of hours with fairfields notes diagrams coding symbols and examining the actual layout and i think i could but time is on our side hargreaves god knows its the only thing on our side as far as leclerc is concerned the fusing is the key he wont leave till he gets the key london knows im here the neckar may get suspicious over the delay anything can happen and anything that can happen can only be to our advantage i tried to think of anything that could be to our advantage but failed so i sit tight leclerc suspects im an expert on solid fuels he cannot possibly know of course hargreaves muttered of course time is on our side he sat down on an empty ammunition box and stared down silently at the floor he seemed to have lost all inclination to talk i didnt much feel like talking myself a key turned in the door and leclerc and hewell came in leclerc said feeling better what do you want just wondering whether you might have changed your mind about your alleged ignorance on the subject of solid fuel i dont know what youre talking about of course not hewell the giant came forward and laid a squat leathercovered box on the floora tape recorder perhaps you would care to hear the playback of a recent recording we made i rose slowly to my feet and stared down at hargreaves his gaze was still fixed on the floor thank you hargreaves i said thank you very much indeed i had to do it he said dully leclerc said he would shoot my wife through the back of the head im sorry i touched him on the shoulder it wasnt your fault what now leclerc its time you saw the black shrikes he stood to one side to let me pass the doors of the hangar were wide open the lights burning high up near the roof the rails ran all the way to the back of the hangar they were there all right the black shrikes stubby pencilshaped cylinders with highlypolished steel sides and watercooled porcelain noses above great scalloped airscoops the height of a twostorey house and perhaps four feet in diameter they rested on flat eightwheeled steel bogies and on either side of each rocket was a gantry crane almost as high as the rocket itself each crane mounted on a fourwheeled bogie from the top and bottom of the gantries protruding clamps reached out to hold the rockets firmly in position both rockets and all four gantries were resting on the same set of rails leclerc wasted no time no words he led me straight to the nearest rocket and mounted an opensided lift fitted to the inner side of the nearest gantry hewell jabbed me painfully in the spine with his gun i got the idea and climbed up beside leclerc hewell stayed where he was leclerc pressed a button an electric motor whined and the lift slid easily upward for about five feet leclerc took a key from his pocket slid it into a tiny hole in the side of the rocket pulled out a flushfitting handle and swung out a sevenfoot high door in the casing of the black shrike the door had been so meticulously machined so beautifully fitted that i hadnt even noticed its existence take a good look leclerc said thats all youre here forto take a good look i took a good look the outer hardened steel casing of the rocket was just that and no morean outer case inside was another casing and the gap between the two was at least five inches directly opposite me welded on to the inner casing were two flat steel boxes about six niches apart and each six inches square the one to the left greenpainted bore the legend propellant and below that the words onoff the one to the right was a bright pillarbox red in colour with the words safe and armed stencilled in white on the left and right side of the box respectively on both boxes just below the top was a knobhandled switch from the foot of both boxes issued flexible armoured cables with plastic sheathing below the armoura measure almost certainly designed to protect the underlying electric cables from the tremendous heat which would be generated in flight the cable to the left coming from the box marked propellant was almost an inch and a half in diameter the other was half an inch in diameter the former ran down the inner casing and about three feet away from the box split into seven separate cables each one covered in the same plastic and armour the latter crossed the gap to the outer casing and disappeared upwards out of sight there were two other cables one a small halfinch cable joined the two boxes the second two inches in diameter bridged the gap between the propellant box and a third box larger than either of the other two which was fitted to the inside of the outer wall this third box had a hinged door facing me secured by a couple of butterfly nuts no other electric cables led either to or from it and that was all that was to be seen i saw it all in ten seconds leclerc looked at me and said got it i nodded and said nothing the photographic memory he murmured cryptically he closed the door locked it pressed the lift button and we hummed upwards again for about six feet once more the routine with the key the opening of a doormuch smaller this time barely two feet in height the invitation to inspect this time there was even less to see a circular gap in the inner casing a view beyond the gap of what appeared to be fifteen or twenty round pipes narrowing towards their tips and in the centre of those pipes the top of some cylindrical object about six inches in diameter which vanished down among the tubes in the centre of the top of this cylinder was a small hole less than half an inch across attached to the outer casing was an armoured cable of the same dimensions as the one which had issued from the box marked safe and armed and it seemed a pretty fair guess that it was the same cable the end of this cable which was tipped with a solid copper plug bent right over and hung slackly downwards in the gap between the outer and inner casings it seemed logical to suppose that this copper plug was intended to fit into the hole in the central cylinder but here it would seem logic would have been in error the hole in the cylinder was at least four times the size of the narrow copper plug leclerc closed the door pressed the button and the lift dropped down to the foot of the gantry another door another key and this time a view of the very base of the rocket a foot below where the last of the pipes in the inner casing ended there was no impression of a confusion of pipes here as there had been at the top everything was mathematically neat and completely symmetrical nineteen cylinders all of which seemed to be sealed with a heavy plastic compound each cylinder about seven inches in diameter eighteen of them arranged in two concentric circles about an inner core the cylinders which completely filled the inner casing were not entirely smoothsided at various distances above their lower ends they were smoothly indented in their sides and those indentations it was no trick at all to guess were for the purpose of introducing the leads which hung in an untidy bunch between the two casings i counted the leads nineteen in all breaking out from the seven armoured cables leading from the propellant box above a pair of leads from each of three cables three leads from each of the other three cables and four leads from the remaining cable you have it all bentall leclerc asked i have it all i nodded it seemed simple enough good he closed the door led the way towards the hangar entrance now to have a look at fairfields notebooks codes and references at least we were able to save those i raised an eyebrowit was one of the few muscular exercises i could perform without causing myself pain there were some things you couldnt save the complete set of blueprints for the rocket i must confess we did not think that the british would have had the intelligence to take such precautions they were in the lower half of a sealed metal boxa standard wartune device much faster and more foolproof than burningthe top half of which was a glass tank of concentrated hydrochloric with a metal plunger the plunger was depressed the glass broken and the acid released before we realised what was happening i remembered the captains bleeding and battered face good old captain griffiths so now youre completely dependent on having a working model of the rocket eh thats so if leclerc was worried he didnt show it dont forget we still have the scientists he led me to a hut just beyond the armoury a hut rather primitively fitted out as an office with filing cabinets a typewriter and a plain wooden desk leclerc opened the cabinet pulled out the top drawer and dumped a pile of papers on the table i understand that those are fairfields papers all of them ill come back in an hour two hours at least probably more i said an hour all right i rose from the chair where id just seated myself and pushed the papers to one side get someone else to work the damn thing out he looked at me for a long moment the slaty milky eyes without expression then said evenly you take very many chances bentall dont talk rubbish if i couldnt do anything else i could at least sneer at him when a man takes chances he can either win or lose i cant possibly win anything now and god knows ive nothing to lose youre wrong you know he said pleasantly there is something you can lose i can take your life away from you have it and welcome i tried to ease the burning pain in my shoulder and arm the way i feel right now im just about finished with it anyway you have a remarkable sense of humour he said acidly then he was gone banging the door shut behind him he didnt forget to turn the key in the lock half an hour passed before i even bothered looking at fairfields papers id more important things to think about than those it was not the most pleasant halfhour of my life the evidence was all before me now bentall with the bunkers offat lastand i knew the truth also at last counterespionage i thought bitterly they should never have let me out of the kindergarten the wicked world and its wicked ways were far too much for bentall if he could put one foot in front of the other without breaking an ankle in the process that was all you could reasonably expect of him on flat ground of course by the time id finished thinking my morale and selfrespect had shrunk so much youd have required an electronic microscope to find them so i reviewed all that had happened in the hope of discovering one instance where i had been right but no id a perfect and completely unmarred record one hundred per cent wrong all along the line it was a feat that not many people could have matched the one redeeming feature about being utterly wrong of course was that id also been wrong about marie hopeman she had had no special instructions from colonel raine she had never fooled me once this was no mere hunch or opinion it was a provable certainty it was i knew rather late in the day to arrive at this knowledge i couldnt see that it was going to alter anything now but in different circumstances i gave myself up to the very pleasant contemplation of what things might have been like in different circumstances and was just finishing off the towers and battlements of a particularly enchanting dream castle in the air when a key turned in the lock id barely time to open the folder and scatter a few papers around before leclerc and a chinese guard came in he glanced down at the table malacca cane swinging idly in his hand how is it coming bentall very difficult and very complicated and continual interruptions by you dont help me any dont make it too difficult bentall i want this test rocket wired and fused and ready to take off in two and a half hours your wants are a matter of complete indifference to me i said nastily whats the hurry anyway the navy is waiting bentall we mustnt keep the navy waiting must we i thought this one over then said do you mean to tell me that you have the colossal effrontery to keep in radio touch with the neckar dont be so naive of course were in touch theres no one more interested than myself to have the black shrike land on time on target apart from which the one sure way to rouse their suspicions and send them steaming back at high speed to vardu is not to keep in touch with them so hurry it up im doing my best i said coldly when he left i got down to working out the firing circuits apart from the fact that they were coded the instructions for the wiring were such as could have been carried out by any reasonably competent electrician what could not have been done by the electrician was the calculation of the settings on the time clockpart of the mechanism in the box attached to the inside of the outer casingwhich regulated the ignition of the nineteen propellant cylinders in their proper sequence from his notes it appeared that even fairfield himself had been doubtful about the accuracy of his own recommendations as to firing sequences and times they had been worked out on a purely theoretical basis but theory and practise werent the same things at all the trouble lay in the nature of the solid fuel propellant itself a completely stable mixture in limited quantities and at normal temperatures it became highly unstable under extremes of heat and pressure and beyond a certain unknown critical mass the trouble was that no one knew the precise limits of any of those factors nor even more worrying did they know how they reacted upon one another what was known was the highly lethal results of instability when the safety limit was passed the fuel changed from a relatively slow burning propellant to an instantaneously explosive disruptive estimated weight for weight at five times the power of tnt it was to reduce the danger of mass that the propellant had been fitted in nineteen separate charges and it was to reduce the danger of too suddenly applied pressure that the charges had been arranged to ignite in seven consecutive stages but unfortunately no one could do anything about the danger of heat the propellant had its own inbuilt oxidising agent but not nearly enough to ensure complete combustion two highspeed turbine fans which started up two seconds before the ignition of the first four cylinders supplied air in quantity and under high pressure for the first fifteen seconds until the missile reached a high enough speed to supply itself with sufficient air through its giant airscoops but as the black shrike was absolutely dependent on its air supply it meant that it had to leave the earth on a very flat trajectory indeed in order not to run out of atmosphere before the propellant burnt out it was not until all the fuel was consumed that the missiles automatic brain lifted it sharply out of the atmosphere but the need for even half a minutes supply of air meant a tremendous air resistance generating extremely high temperatures and while it was hoped that the watercooled porcelain nose would cope with part of the heat no one knew what temperature would be generated in the heart of the rocket all in all i thought it looked like a very dicey deal indeed the two switchboxes id seen attached to the inner casing had both to be set before firingthe on switch closed the firing circuits the armed switch closed the circuit for the suicide box if anything went wrong with the rocket in flight such as a deviation to land or shipping lanes it could be electronically instructed to commit suicide in normal missiles fuelled by lox and kerosene the flight could be stopped simply by sending out a radio message that automatically cut off the fuel supply but there was no way of shutting off a solid fuel already in combustion the cylinder i had seen in the middle of the propellant at the top of the rocket had been a sixty pound charge of tnt fitted with a primer and the hole i had seen in the centre of the primer was to accommodate a grain electrically fired fulminate of mercury detonator which was connected to the cable id seen dangling in the vicinity the circuit for this was triggered as were all controls in the rocket by radio a certain signal on a certain wavelength activating an electrical circuit in the same box as the one that contained the timing mechanism for the firing circuits this current passed through a coil which in turn activated a solenoid switcha soft iron core in the centre of the coiland this completed the circuit which fired the detonator in the tnt charge again fairfield had been very doubtful of the outcome what was intended was that the explosion of the tnt should disintegrate the rocket but it was just as likely he had thought that the instantaneous change in heat and pressure would cause the whole rocket to blow up in sympathetic detonation if i was picked as the first man to go to the moon i thought id just as soon not travel on the black shrike let someone else go first while bentall remained earthbound and watched for the explosion i reached for the typewriter made a list of which coloured and numbered firing cables marked which fuel cylinders worked out an average of fairfields suggested figures for the timing sequences and stuck the paper in my pocket id just done this when hewell appeared no im damned well not finished i said before he could open his mouth why dont you leave me alone to get on with it how much longer he asked in his rumbling gravelly voice were getting impatient bentall im worried stiff maybe fifteen minutes leave one of your men outside and ill knock when im finished he nodded and left i got to thinking some more mainly about myself and my life expectancy and then i started thinking of the psychologists who speak of the tremendous power of the human mind the power of positive thinking and if you say to yourself a thousand times a day to be cheerful and optimistic and healthy then you will end up that way i tried it with a slight variation i tried to see bentall as a bent old man with silver hair but somehow the positive thinking didnt seem to work in my case i couldnt see anything of the kind all i could see was bentall with a hole in the back of his head tonight it would probably come tonight but the one certain thing i knew was that it would come the other scientists could live but not me i had to die and i knew why i got up and tore the cord from the window blind but not with the idea of hanging myself before leclerc and hewell got round to torturing me to death or shooting me i rolled the cord into a coil stuck it in my hip pocket and knocked on the door i heard the footsteps of the guard walking away a few minutes later the door opened again this time both leclerc and hewell were there accompanied by a couple of chinese finished leclerc asked abruptly finished right start wiring up right away no thankyous no congratulations for bentalls keenwitted intelligence in solving an abstruse problem just get started right away i shook my head not that easy leclerc i must go to the blockhouse first the blockhouse the blindseeming eyes looked at me for a long moment why you have the launch console there thats why the launch console the little box with all the knobs and buttons for remote radio control of the various circuits in the rocket i explained patiently i know it he said coldly you dont have to examine that before fusing up the rocket youre not the best judge of that i said loftily hed no option but to give in which he might have done with better grace he sent a guard to the captains office for the keys while we walked in silence across the intervening halfmile and not a very companionable silence either but it didnt worry me i didnt feel like talking i felt like looking looking at the white glitter of the sands the shimmering greenblue of the lagoon the cloudless blue of the sky above i took a long long look at all of them the look of a man who suspects that that look is going to have to last him for a long long time the blockhouse had all the strength and solidity of a medieval fortress with the notable difference that it was so deeply sunk in the ground that only the top two feet were visible there were three radar scanners mounted on the top and three radio aerials and what i hadnt seen before the tops of four periscopes which could be tilted on a vertical axis and swung on a horizontal axis the entrance was at the back at the foot of a short flight of steps the door was a massive steel affair mounted on equally massive hinges and must have weighed close on half a ton it was designed to keep more than the flies out the possibility of the shock of the equivalent of tons of high explosive detonating just over yards away was something that made such a door very essential indeed even although it was at the back the chinese arrived with two keys heavy chromed flatsided jobs like enormous yale keys he inserted one turned it twice and shoved the door slowly open on smooth oiled hinges he passed inside my god i muttered what a dungeon it looked exactly like that a ten by twenty room concrete floor concrete walls concrete roof the heavy door through which wed just come and another only just less heavy door in the opposite wall and that was all except for wooden benches round the wall and the tiny glowworm of a lamp near the ceiling nobody took me up on my conversational gambit the chinese crossed the dungeon and opened the other door withthe second key this part of the blockhouse was about the same size as the other but brilliantly lit one corner of the room about five by five was partitioned off with plywood and it was an easy guess that the idea was to screen radar scopes from the bright light outside in the other corner was a softlyhumming petrolpowered generator with its exhaust pipe disappearing upwards through the roof there were two tiny ventilators one high up on either side and in the middle between the radar cabin and the generator was the launch console i crossed and looked down at it it wasnt much just a sloping metallic box backed by a radio transmitter with a number of labelled buttons set in a straight line each button with a telltale lamp above it the first button bore the legend hydraulics and the second auxiliarythose would be for the lastminute testing of the oil and electricity circuits the third said powerdisconnect that would be for cutting off the batteryfeeding external electricity sources the fourth read flightcontrol a radio signal to alert the guiding mechanism in the shrikes electronic brain the fifth with the legend clamps would when pressed show by lighting up the telltale that the gantry clamps supporting the missile were ready for instantaneous withdrawal when the missile took off the sixth gantryex would move back the gantries leaving only the extension arms of the clamps in place the seventh the commit button started up the power intake fans two seconds after that i knew the revolving clock drum would trigger off the first four of the nineteen cylinders ten seconds after that another circuit would close and the suicide circuit would be ready and waiting waiting only for the moment when something went wrong and the launch console operator pushed the eighth and last button the last button it was set well away from the other seven there was no possibility of mistaking it for it was a square white push set in the middle of a six inch square patch of red and labelled egads in steel letterselectronic ground automatic destruct system and there was no possibility of triggering it by mistake for it was covered by a heavy wire mesh that had to be unclipped at two sides and even then the button had to be turned on its axis before it could be depressed i gazed at this for some time fiddled about with the radio behind took out my notes and consulted them hewell loomed over me which would have made it very difficult for me to concentrate if i had had to which fortunately i hadnt leclerc just stood there looking at me with those blind white eyes of his until one of the guards murmured something to him and pointed in the direction of the back door leclerc left and was back in thirty seconds all right bentall he said curtly hurry it up will you the neckar has just reported that she is running into gale conditions which will make observations of the test impossible when and if the weather deteriorates any further seen all you want to ive seen all i want to you can do it sure i can do it how long fifteen minutes twenty at the most fifteen he paused dr fairfield said it would take forty minutes i dont care what dr fairfield said right you can start now start what now wiring up the firing circuits you fool there must be some mistake somewhere i said i never said anything about wiring up those circuits can you recall my saying i would ive no intention of touching the damned circuits the gentle swinging of his malacca cane stopped leclerc took a step nearer me you wont do it his voice was harsh blurred with anger then what the devil was the idea of wasting the past two and a half hours pretending you were figuring out how to do it thats it i said thats the whole point of it wasting time you heard what i said to hargreaves time is on our side you made a recording of it i knew it was coming and i saw it coming but i felt about ninety that day and my reactions were correspondingly slow and the vicious lash of that cane with all leclercs fury and weight behind it across my left cheek and eye was a razoredged sword splitting my face in half i choked in agony staggered back a couple of paces then flung myself at the blurred figure before me i hadnt recovered a foot when hewells two great hands closed over my bad arm and tore it off at the shoulderlater inspection showed it was still there he must have stuck it back on againand i swung round lashing out with all the power of my good right arm but i was blind with agony and missed him completely before i could regain my balance one of the guards had me by the right arm and the cane was whistling towards me again i somehow sensed it was coming ducked and took the full weight of the blow on the top of my head the cane swung back for a third blow but this time it didnt reach me hewell released my left arm jumped forward and caught leclercs wrist as it started on its downward swing leclercs arm stopped short as abruptly as if it had come to the limit of a chain attached to the roof he struggled to free himself throwing the whole weight of his body on hewells hand neither hewell nor his hand moved an inch damn you hewell let me go leclercs voice was hardly more than a whisper the trembling whisper of anger out of control take your hand away i tell you stop it boss the deep authoritative boom brought normalcy everyday sanity back into the blockhouse cant you see the guys halfdead already do you want to kill him whos going to fuse up the rocket then there was a few seconds silence then leclerc in a completely changed tone said thank you hewell youre quite right of course but i had provocation yeah hewell said in his gravelly voice you had at that a cleverclever alec id like to break his goddamned neck myself i wasnt among friends that was clear enough but i wasnt worrying about them at that moment i wasnt even thinking about them i was too busy worrying and thinking about myself my left arm and the left side of my face were engaged in a competition to see which could make me jump more and the competition was fierce but after a while they gave it up and joined forces and the whole left side of my body seemed to merge into one vast agonising pain i was staring down at the launch console and the various buttons were swimming into focus and out again one moment gone the next hopping around like a trayful of jumping beans hewell hadnt exaggerated any if there was one thing that was certain it was that i couldnt take much more of this i was just slowly coming to pieces or perhaps not so slowly i heard voices but whether the voices were directed at me or not i didnt know i stumbled against a stool and sat down heavily clinging to the launch console to keep myself from falling the voices came again and this time i could distinguish leclercs he had advanced to within a couple of feet of me the cane held in both hands the backs of his thumbs gleaming white as if he were holding himself in check with an effort as though he were trying to snap the cane in half do you hear me bentall he said in a low cold voice that i liked even less than his hysterical outburst of a moment ago do you understand what im saying to you i stared down at the blood dripping to the concrete floor i want the doctor i mumbled my jaws my mouth were swelling stiffening up already and i found speech difficult my wounds have opened up again the hell with your wounds the good samaritan to the life youre going to start on that rocket and youre going to start on it now ah i said i forced myself to sit straight and halfshut my eyes until i had him more or less in focus like an image and six ghosts on a badlyadjusted tv screen how are you going to make me because youll have to make me you know how torture bring out the old thumb screws and see if bentall cares i was half out of my mind with pain i didnt know what i was saying one turn of the rack and bentall is in a better world besides i wouldnt feel it anyway and a hand like mine trembling like a leaf i held it up to let him see it trembling like a leaf how do you expect me to fuse a tricky he gave me the back of his hand across my mouth not lightly shut up he said coldly florence nightingale would have loved him hed exactly the right touch with sick men there are other ways remember when i asked that stupid young lieutenant a question and he refused to answer remember yes it seemed about a month ago but it had been only a few hours i remember you shot a man through the back of the head the next time the lieutenant did what you wanted just like youre going to im having a sailor brought here and im going to ask you to fuse that rocket if you wont ill have him shot he snapped his fingers like that you will eh he didnt answer just summoned and spoke to one of the men the chinese nodded turned away and hadnt gone five steps when i said to leclerc call him back thats better leclerc nodded youre going to cooperate tell him to bring all the other ratings with him and all the officers you can shoot the lot of them through the head see if i care leclerc stared at me are you quite mad bentall he demanded at last dont you realise that i mean what i say and i mean what i say i answered tiredly you forget what i am leclerc im a counterespionage agent and humanitarian principles dont matter a damn to me you should know that better than anyone besides i know damn well that youre going to murder them all before you leave here if they shuffle off twentyfour hours ahead of schedule then what the hell go ahead and waste your ammunition he looked at me in silence while the seconds passed while my heart thudded heavily painfully in my chest while the palms of my hands grew moist then turned away he believed me all right it was so exactly the way his own ruthless criminal mind would work he spoke quietly to hewell who left with a guard then turned back to me everybody has their achilles heel bentall he said conversationally i believe you love your wife the heat inside that reinforced concrete blockhouse was sweltering overhot but i felt myself turn as cold as if i had just stepped into an icebox for a moment all the fierceness of the pain left me and all i could feel were goosepimples running down my arms and back my mouth was suddenly dry and i could feel deep in my stomach that hellish incapacitating nausea that can spring only from fear and i was afraid afraid with a fear i had not before known i could feel this fear i could feel it in my hands i could taste it in my mouth and the taste was the taste of all the unpleasant things i had ever tasted i could smell it in the air and the smell was an amalgam of all the evil odours i had ever known god i should have known this was coming i thought of her face twisted in pain the hazel eyes dark in agony it was the most obvious thing in the world only bentall could have missed it you poor fool i said contemptuously it was hard to get the words past my dry mouth and swollen lips far less inform them with the appropriately scornful tones but managed it shes not my wife her name is marie hopeman and i met her for the first time exactly six days ago not your wife eh he didnt seem vastly surprised a fellowemployee of yours one assumes one assumes correctly miss hopeman is fully aware of the risks involved she has been a professional government agent for many years dont threaten me with miss hopeman or shell laugh in your face quite so quite so an agent you say the british government is to be congratulated the level of pulchritude among female agents is apt to be dismally low and miss hopeman does much to correct the balance an astonishingly lovely young lady and one whom i personally find quite charming he paused fractionally since she is not your wife you will not mind so much if she accompanies the other ladies towards our destination he was watching me closely to get my reaction he didnt have to spell it out for me but he didnt get the reaction he had a pistol in his right hand now and what with that and the guards automatic carbine pointing at my middle there was nothing to be gained by reacting in the only way i felt like so i said instead destination what destination would that be leclerc asia that should be obvious i thought and the rocket prototype for a few hundreds more exactly he seemed ready to talk as all men are ready to talk about their obsessions like many asiatic nations my adopted country has a genius more shall we say for refined imitation than original invention in six months we shall be turning them out in quantity rockets bentall are todays bargaining counters at the table of world politics we need lebensraum for what the papers of the world are pleased to call our teeming millions the desert of australia could be made to blossom like a rose we should like to move in there peacefully if possible i stared at him hed gone off his rocker lebensraum australia my god youre mad australia you couldnt catch up with the military potential of russia or america in a lifetime by which you mean do you think either of those countries would stand by and let you run wild in the pacific you are mad they wouldnt leclerc said calmly i quite agree but we can deal with russia and america the black shrike will do it for us its great virtues as you are well aware are its complete mobility and the fact that it requires no special launching site we fit out a dozen vesselsnot our own oh dear me no but flags of convenience ships from panama or liberia or honduraswith two or three rockets apiece three dozen missiles will be enough more than enough we dispatch those vessels to the baltic and the kamchatka peninsula off the russian coast and off alaska and the eastern seaboard of the united states those off the russian coasts will have their rockets zeroed in on icbm launching sites in america those off the american coasts zeroed in on the corresponding sites in the ussr then they fire more or less simultaneously hydrogen bombs rain down on america and russia the advanced radar stations their longrange infrared scanners their electronically relayed satellite photographs of intercontinental missile exhaust trails will show beyond dispute that those rocketborne hydrogen bombs come from russia and america any doubts left in their minds will be resolved by moscow and washington receiving radio messages apparently from each other each calling upon the other to surrender the two great world powers then proceed to devastate each other twentyfour hours later there will be nothing to prevent us from doing exactly as we wish in the world or do you see a serious flaw in my reasoning youre insane my voice was strained and hoarse even in my own ears youre completely insane if we were to do exactly as i have outlined i would tend to agree with you although it may come in the last resort but it would be most foolish most illadvised apart from the cloud of radioactive dust that would make the northern hemisphere rather unpleasant for some time we wish to trade with those two rich and powerful nations no no bentall the mere threat the very possibility will be more than enough both american and russian observers will be asked to attend highly convincing tests of the shrikeswe shall probably rename itpower payload accuracy and range then we shall leak the information that those dozen vessels are strategically placed and also leak our intention of triggering off a war in which the two nations will devastate each other then we move on australia note then the extremely interesting and delicate situation that will develop one or other of the two great powers may move against us immediately it does hydrogen bombs will fall on that countrys territory say it was america that moved against us bombs devastate their cbm launching sites their strategic air command airfields but where do those bombs come from do they come from us because america has moved against us or do they come from russia who sees in this the heavensent moment to destroy the united states without the possibility of immediate retaliation against it knowing that the americans have no proof that the hydrogen bombs came from russia and assuming that the americans will think that the bombs really did come from those strategically placed vessels of ours of which they have heard but note this further whether america really believed the hydrogen bombs came from us or not they would be forced to launch an allout assault against the soviet union for the bombs might just as possibly be coming from there and if they are and the americans wait too long before launching their counter nuclear assault the united states will be wiped out of existence the same would happen even more certainly if we launched the missiles against russia what it comes to in effect bentall is that both the great countries will know that if either of them moves against us they will be forced to engage in a nuclear holocaust that may destroy them both neither of them will move an inch against us instead they will combine to use their power to stop other countries like britain or france moving against us or once again do you see a serious flaw in my reasoning youre insane i repeated completely hopelessly insane but they were only words all conviction had left my voice he didnt look like a man who was insane he didnt talk like man who was insane it was only what he said that sounded insane but it only sounded insane because it was so preposterous and it was only preposterous because of the gigantic the unprecedented scale of the blackmail and bluff involved of the unparalleled deadliness of the threat that backed up the blackmail but there was nothing insane about blackmail and bluffs and threats and if a thing is not insane on a normal scale there is no necessary element of insanity introduced when the normal is multiplied to unimaginable proportions maybe he wasnt insane after all we shall see bentall we shall see he turned as the outer door of the blockhouse opened and quickly switched off all the lights except a small bulb burning above the console marie with hewell by her side came into the semidarkness she caught sight of me standing there with my back to the light smiled took a step towards me then stopped abruptly as leclerc lifted his cane to bar her passage sorry to bring you across mrs bentall he said or should it be miss hopeman i understand you are not married marie gave him the sort of look i hoped id never see coming my way and said nothing shy leclerc asked or just uncooperative like bentall here hes refusing to cooperate he wont agree to fuse the black shrike good for him marie said i wonder he may be sorry would you like to persuade him miss hopeman no no but we might persuade him through you if not by you youre wasting your time she said contemptuously im afraid you dont know either of us and we hardly know each other im nothing to him nor is he anything to me i see he turned to me the stiff upper lip the best traditions of the secret service what do you say bentall the same as miss hopeman youre wasting your time very well he shrugged turned to hewell take her away marie gave me another smile clear enough proof that she couldnt see my battered face in the shadow and left her head was high leclerc paced up and down head bent like a man lost in thought and after a time he gave some order to the guard and left two minutes later the door opened and i saw marie with hewell and leclerc on either side of her she had to have them there because she couldnt walk her feet trailed on the floor her head lay far across her left shoulder and she was moaning softly her eyes shut the frightening thing was that she bore no mark of violence not a hair of her head was out of place i tried to get to leclerc there were two carbines and hewells pistol on me i never knew they were there i tried to get to leclerc to smash his face in to lash out to maim to kill to destroy but i couldnt even do that right on my second step one of the guards tripped me with his carbine and i crashed heavily and fulllength on the stone floor i lay there for some time dazed the guards hauled me to my feet waiting one on either side of me hewell and leclerc stood as they had done maries head had now fallen forward so far forward that i could see where the fair hair parted on the nape of the neck she was no longer moaning do you fuse the shrike leclerc asked softly someday ill kill you leclerc i said do you fuse the shrike i fuse the shrike i nodded then someday ill kill you if i could carry out even half my promise i thought bitterly it would be a change for me chapter eleven friday pm pm id said to leclerc that i could close up the wiring circuitry and fuse the black shrike in fifteen minutes in point of fact it took me exactly an hour bentall wrong as usual but this time it wasnt bentalls fault it wasnt my fault because my arm and face hurt so violently that it was impossible to concentrate on the job it wasnt my fault that i was mad with anger that my vision was so blurred and indistinct that i could scarcely decipher my own notes that my right handi did practically everything with my right handwas shaking so badly that i had great difficulty in adjusting the time clock in feeding cables through their allotted grooves in fitting the fuses into place in the bases of the solid fuel cylinders it wasnt my fault that when arming the sixty pound disruptive charge my sweating hand dropped a fulminate of mercury detonator that went up with so white a flash and so loud an explosion that it was touch and go whether hewell who was supervising the operation pressed the trigger of the pistol he had lined up on me and it wasnt my fault that leclerc had insisted that i work on both rockets at once or that i was hindered by the fact that he had appointed hargreaves and another scientist by the name of williams to check on every move and write it down in their notebooks one on either side of me on the narrow gantry platforms they got in my way with nearly every move i made i could see the logic of leclercs insistence on the simultaneous wiring hed certainly warned hargreaves and williams that if they as much as spoke to each other they would be shot and probably warned that the same thing would happen to their wives if their notes did not compare exactly at the end of the day thus if the first firing of the shrike was a success and the compared notes for the wiring up of both rockets were absolutely the same then he would have a guarantee that the second rocket would also be perfectly wired the simultaneous wiring of course also served notice of sentence of death on me had he been intending to take me with him along with the others he would hardly have had me wire up both rockets at once especially in view of the urgency the most recent message from the neckar spoke of seas so high that there was a possibility of having to abandon the test not that i needed any notice of this sentence i wondered when i was slated to die immediately after i had finished the wiring or later along with captain griffiths and his men after the scientists and their wives had been embarked later i thought even leclerc wasnt likely to embark on a blood bath with so many witnesses watching but i wouldnt have spent a penny to gamble on it a few minutes before two oclock i said to hewell where are the keys for the destruct box are you all ready to go he asked the last move before the rockets were in final firing order was to make the switches in both the propellant and destruction systems but the switch for the latter that completed the circuit to the ib tnt charge couldnt be made without a key which operated a safety lock on the handle of the switch not quite the switch in the suicide box is sticking i want to have a look at it wait ill get leclerc he left leaving a watchful chinese in charge and was back with leclerc inside a minute whats the holdup now leclerc demanded impatiently two minutes have you the key he signalled for the lift to be lowered told the two scientists with their notebooks to get off then climbed up beside me when we regained working height he said suspiciously whats the trouble thinking of pulling the last minute fast one of a desperate man try the switch yourself i snapped it wont move across its not supposed to move more than halfway before the key is turned he said angrily it wont even move at all try it for yourself and see he tried it moved it less than a quarter inch nodded and handed me the key i unlocked the switch undid the four butterfly nuts that held the switchcover in position and as i eased the switchcover off over the switch i managed to dislodge with the tip of my screwdriver the copper core of a piece of flex which id forced in between switch and cover to make the former stick the switch itself was of the common type with the springloaded rocker arm where when the switch handle was pushed over to the right the two copper lugs jumped over from the two dead terminals on the right to the live terminals on the left as quickly as my blurred vision and shaky right hand would permit i unscrewed the central rocker arm lifted out the switch pretended to straighten out the copper lugs and then screwed the switch back in place fault in design i said briefly probably the same in the other leclerc nodded said nothing just watched carefully as i replaced the cover and nicked the switch from side to side several times to demonstrate how easily it worked all finished leclerc asked not yet ive got to set the timing clock on the other one that can wait i want this one on its waynow he looked up to where farley and an assistant were fussing around with the automatic guidance and target location systems what the hells keeping him nothings keeping him i said farley and i made a pair both of us with great red and purple welts down the left hand sides of our faces his was even more angrylooking and rainbow hued than mine but that was only because it had had more time to develop give me twentyfour hours and nobody would even notice his twentyfour hours i wondered who would give me twentyfour hours he finished days ago i went on hes just a last minute fusser wondering if he turned all the taps off before he left home if i pushed leclerc hard enough i mused he might break his neck on the concrete floor ten feet beneath on the other hand he might not and then i wouldnt have twentyfour seconds left me far less twentyfour hours besides hewell had his cannon pointing at me good then we are ready to go leclerc turned the key in the switch cover pushed the switch to the armed position withdrew the key and closed and locked the door of the rocket the lift sunk down to the ground and leclerc beckoned to one of the guards go tell the wireless operator to send a message firing in twenty minutes so where now leclerc i asked the blockhouse he looked at me coldly so that you can hide there in safety while the rocket blows itself up because of some fix you made on it what are you talking about im talking about you bentall i have no illusions you are a highly dangerous man sure i was dangerous but only to my friends and myself you have the ability to jinx the firing mechanism so that only you would know surely you were not so naive as to imagine that i would overlook the possibility you the scientists and naval men will remain out here in the open while the rocket is being fired they are already assembled we shall go to the blockhouse i swore at him violently and viciously he smiled so you had overlooked the possibility that i would take precaution leave men out in the open you damned murderer you cant do that leclerc cant i now the slaty milky eyes stared into mine as he went on softly perhaps you have jinxed it bentall ive done damn all of the kind i shouted its just that this solid fuel is inherently unstable read dr fairfields notes and youll see that no one really knows whats going to happen the fuel has never been tried before on this scale damn you to hell leclerc if that thing goes up not a single man within half a mile has the ghost of a chance of survival exactly he smiled he smiled but i became gradually aware that he wasnt feeling like smiling his hands were out of sight in his pockets but i could see they were knotted into fists he had a nervous tic at the corner of his mouth and he was sweating more than the heat of the sun justified this for leclerc was the most crucial moment of all the moment when all could be won or all could be lost he didnt know just how ruthless i could be he suspected id go to the limit and stick at nothing that id even sacrifice innocent lives to stop him after all id already told him that he could shoot every officer and seaman on the base as far as i was concerned maybe he thought i wouldnt be so willing to sacrifice my own life but he wouldnt lay too much stress on that he knew that i knew that i was going to die anyway all his staggering plans his hopes and his fears depended on the next few moments would the black shrike take off or would it blow itself to bits and all his schemes and dreams along with it he had no means of knowing he had to gamble he just had to gamble but if he gambled and was wrong at least he wasnt going to let me know the satisfaction of winning we walked round the corner of the hangar a hundred yards away sitting in two ragged rows on the ground were the naval and scientific personnel of the base but no women i couldnt see any women two chinese were standing guard with automatic carbines at the ready i said how do the guards feel about having to stay there when the rocket is fired they dont they come to the blockhouse and do you seriously imagine were just going to keep on sitting there like good little boys once the guards are gone youll sit there he said indifferently i have seven women in the blockhouse if one of you stirs they get it i mean it the last three words were completely superfluous he meant it all right i said seven women where is miss hopeman in the armoury i didnt ask why he hadnt shifted her alsoi knew the bitter answer to that she was probably either still unconscious or too unwell to be movedand i didnt ask that she should be moved if the black shrike exploded she would have no more chance than we had the armoury was less than a hundred yards from the hangar but better that way than to survive in the blockhouse i sat down at the end of one of the rows of men farley beside me nobody looked at me everyone was staring fixedly at the doors of the hangar waiting for the black shrike to emerge they hadnt long to wait thirty seconds after leclerc and hewell had left us the two big gantry cranes with the black shrike between them rumbled slowly into view two of the technicians were at the controls of the gantries the bogies of the gantries were spanned by two connecting bars that spanned the rocket bogie so ensuring that the gantry clamps holding the black shrike remained in exactly the same relative positions after about thirty seconds the bogies stopped leaving the black shrike planted exactly in the centre of the concrete launching pad the two technicians jumped down removed the connecting bars and at a gesture from one of the chinese came and sat beside us everything was now radiocontrolled the guards themselves left for the blockhouse at a dead run well farley said heavily a grandstand seat the murderous devil wheres your scientific spirit i asked dont you want to see if the damn thing works he glared at me and turned away after a moment he said significantly my part of it will work anyway its not that im worried about dont blame me if it blows up i said im only the electrician around here we can discuss it later on a higher plane he said with heavy humour what are the chances you think dr fairfield thought it would work thats good enough for me i just hope you havent crossed any wires and that it doesnt come down straight on top of us it wont he seemed glad to talk as everybody around seemed glad to talk the strain of just sitting and waiting in silence was too much worked before often never a failure our latest infrared guidance system is foolproof locks on a star and stays there i cant see any stars its broad daylight no farley said patiently but the infrared cell can heat detection wait and see bentall miles and it will be bang on target to a yard to a yard i tell you yes hows anybody going to pinpoint a yard in the south pacific well eight foot by six he conceded magnanimously a magnesium raft when the rocket reenters the atmosphere the stellar navigation unit is switched off and an infrared homer in the nose takes over the rocket is designed to home in on a heat source a ship of course especially a ships funnel is also a heat source so a magnesium raft a source of tremendous heat will be ignited by the neckars radio ninety seconds before the missile arrives the rocket will make for the greater source of heat i hope so for the neckars sake just too bad if theyre ninety seconds late in igniting the raft they wont be a radio signal is sent from here when the rocket leaves he paused well if it leaves the shrike will take exactly three and a half minutes for the flight so they ignite two minutes after receiving the signal but i was hardly listening to him any more leclerc hewell and the last of the guards had disappeared behind the blockhouse i looked away over the shining sands and the green gleam of the glasssmooth lagoon and stiffened abruptly as i saw a vessel about four miles out heading for a break in the reef i didnt stay stiff long this wasnt any knighterrant naval vessel coming to the rescue it was that intrepid navigator captain fleck coming to collect his wages hargreaves had mentioned that he was expected that afternoon i thought about captain fleck and i thought that if i were in his shoes id be steering my schooner in the diametrically opposite direction and putting as many seamiles as possible between myself and leclerc but then captain fleck didnt know what i knew or i was reasonably certain he didnt captain fleck i thought a shock awaits you i twisted round as the rumble of bogie wheels came to my ears the two gantry cranes weirdly unmanned and controlled by radio were moving slowly away in opposite directions withdrawing their top clamps and leaving the shrike supported only by the extensible clamps still gripping its base ten seconds to go perhaps less no one was talking any more finding a suitable conversational topic when youve perhaps only eight seconds left to live isnt a thing that many people have had practice in the big highspeed turbine induction fans near the nose of the shrike whined abruptly into life two seconds to go one everybody rigid as stone and with eyes halfclosed against the shattering shock they would never feel the base clamps leapt apart a single thunderclap of sound and a great seething ball of orange flame appeared at the foot of the shrike completely enveloping the bogie slowly incredibly slowly the shrike lifted off the ground the ball of orange flame riding up with it and now the echoes of the thunderclap were replaced by a steady continuous roar terrifying in its intensity battering at our shrinking eardrums like the closeup thunder of giant jet engines as a fiftyfoot long brilliant red tongue of flame pierced the flaming sphere at the base of the rocket and lifted the black shrike on its way still it climbed slowly unbelievably slowly it seemed that it must topple over at any moment then at feet another violent explosion as the second set of fuel cylinders ignited the shrike doubled its rate of climb a third explosion about feet and then it began to accelerate at fantastic speed at about five or six thousand feet it turned over abruptly and headed southeast on a trajectory that seemed almost to parallel the surface of the sea and within eight seconds was completely lost to sight with nothing to show that it had ever been except the acrid stink of the burnt fuel the flameblackened bogie and the thick white trail of its exhaust which stretched barstraight across the hot blue sky by this time my chest was hurting me so i started breathing again well it works farley smacked a fist into a palm in grinning exultation he gave a long tremulous sigh of satisfaction hed been without oxygen even longer than i had it works bentall it works of course it works i never expected anything else i rose stiffly to my feet rubbing the wet palms of my hands against my drills and crossed over to where captain griffiths sat with his officers enjoy the show captain he studied me coldly not bothering to hide the dislike the contempt in his eyes and glanced at the left side of my face leclerc seems to like using his cane doesnt he he asked its just an addiction hes got and so you collaborated with him he looked me up and down with all the enthusiasm of an art collector whos been promised a cezanne and finds a comic coloured postcard in front of him i didnt think you would bentall sure i collaborated with them i agreed no moral fibre at all but the courtmartial can wait captain griffiths i sat down pulled off shoe and sock removed a paper from its plastic cover smoothed out the creases and handed it to him what do you make of this quickly please i found it in leclercs office and im certain its in some way connected with his plans for shipping the second shrike to its destination nautical stuff isnt in my line he took the paper reluctantly as i said the pelicans a ship we know that because leclerc himself told us i suspect the others are too pelicantakishamaru captain griffiths read takishamaru is a japanese ship name no doubt about that linkianghawetta probably all ships names all paired now what would that be for the numbers always eight numbers he was getting interested times could they be times could be pm none of the first four numbers go higher than twentyfour but the second four do references of some kind ships eh now what kind of references his voice trailed off i could see his lips moving then he said slowly i think i have it no i know i have it is twenty point ohoh latitude twenty degrees south stands for degrees east together they give a position less than fifty miles west of here he studied the paper in silence for almost a minute while i looked over my shoulder to see if there was any sign of leclerc approaching there was none he would be waiting to hear from the neckar about the success of the firing theyre all lat and long positions griffiths said finally its difficult to be sure without a chart but i could be fairly certain that if those positions were plotted they would represent a northeast curve from here to some position off the chinese or formosan coasts i should imagine those ships pairs of ships ratherwill be located on those positions i should also imagine they would have the duty of escorting the vessel carrying the rocket or keeping a lookout or seeing that the road is clear leclerc would have taken precautions i imagine against the premature discovery of the fact that the rocket had been stolen they would be armed those ships you think i said slowly highly unlikely he was an intelligent incisive old bird with a mind that matched his sharp speech it would have to be concealed arms and no amount of concealed arms would be a match for any searching warship which would be the only thing they would have to fear they might be radarequipped vessels searching the sea and air for fifty a hundred miles round they might they probably would be but wouldnt this ship carrying the rocket be equipped with its own radar captain griffiths handed me back the paper it wont be he said positively leclerc is the kind of man who will always succeed because he takes precautions elaborate to the point almost of the ridiculous almost i say this paper is of no use to you even if you could act on the information enclosed those vessels are almost certainly screen vessels which will travel some miles in advance and in the rear of the vessel carrying the rocket at various points they will turn this vessel over to another pair if air searchers saw the same two ships going in the same direction the same distance apart for days on end theyd start getting suspicious butwait a moment captain my mindits just about stopped i wasnt joking at that the heat of the sun and the fact that my wounds hadnt been treated since id been knocked about in the blockhouse made my head reel dizzily yes but what happens if some warship or aircraft does come on the scene you can detect them with radar but you cant shoot them down with radar what does the vessel with the black shrike do then it submerges griffiths said simply it will be a submarine its bound to be a submarine enlarge the loading hatch and practically any submarine in service could carry the shrike in its forard torpedo room the screen vessels will enable it to travel on the surface at top speed if anything happens it just submerges and proceeds at much lower speeds but itll get there a hundred naval ships equipped with asdic could search for a year and never locate just one solitary sub loose in the pacific i think you can take it for granted bentall that if that rocket leaves the island we will never see it again thank you very much captain griffiths no question he had the final truth of it i pushed myself wearily to my feet like an old old man making his final attempt to leave his deathbed tore the paper into pieces and let them fall on the thin sunbrowned grass i looked in the direction of the blockhouse and could see several figures just appearing from the back out at sea fleck was coming in through the gap in the reef one more request captain griffiths when leclerc returns ask him if you and your men can remain out in the open for the remainder of the day in the fresh air instead of baking in those corrugated iron huts its likely theyll soon start encasing the other rocketi pointed to the two twentyfoot steel boxes with the built in cradles in the hangar ready for shipment and point out the fact that it would then need only one guard to look after you instead of the four or five required to watch the doors and windows if youre locked up in the huts so releasing more of his men for the work give him your word there will be no trouble if the test went well hell be in a good mood and likely to grant your request why do you want this bentall the dislike was back in his voice i dont want leclerc to see me talking to you if you want to live do as i say i wandered aimlessly off to inspect the extent of the damage caused by the rocket leaving the launching pad two minutes later out of the corner of my eye i saw leclerc and griffiths speaking to one another and then leclerc and hewell came towards me leclerc was looking almost jovial the way a man is apt to look when he sees his greatest dream coming true so you didnt jinx it after all did you bentall he obviously didnt want to embarrass me by showing too much gratitude for the job id done no i didnt jinx it but ill jinx the other one mr leclerc oh brother how jinx the other one successful completely absolutely on targetafter a thousand miles right bentall finish off the other one i want to see miss hopeman first he stopped being jovial i said finish it off i mean finish it off i want to see miss hopeman first five minutes no more i promise you either that or wire up your own damn rocket see how long it takes you why do you want to see her mind your own damned business he looked at hewell who gave an all but imperceptible nod very well but five minutes five minutes only you understand he handed a guard the key and gestured us on our way the guard unlocked the door of the armoury and let me in i closed the door behind me not worrying whether i was hurting his feelings the room was in near darkness with its shutters drawn marie was lying in a cot in the corner the same cot as i had slept in that morning i crossed over and sunk to my knees by the side of the cot marie i said softly i shook her shoulder with a gentle hand marie its me johnny she must have been in deep sleep and she took some time to come out of it finally she stirred and twisted round under the blanket all i could see was the pale blur of the face the sheen of the eyes whowho is it its me marieits johnny she didnt answer so i repeated my words my face and mouth and jaws were so stiff and sore that perhaps she couldnt catch my thick mumble im tired she murmured im so very tired please leave me im terribly sorry marie honest to god i could shoot myself i thought they were bluffing marie i really thought they were bluffing again no answer so i went on what did they do to you marie for gods sake tell me what they did to you she murmured something i couldnt catch it then said in a low voice im all right please go away marie look at me she gave no sign that she had heard marie look at me johnny bentall on his knees i tried to laugh but it was only a froglike croak a frog with bronchitis at that i love you marie thats why i fused up their damned rocket thats why id fuse up a hundred rockets thats why id do anything in the world anything thats right anything thats wrong just so no harm would ever come to you again i love you marie ive been so long in seeing it but you should know by now what to expect from a fool like me i love you and if we ever come home again i want to marry you would you marry me marie when we get home there was a long silence then she said softly marry you after you let themplease leave me johnny please leave me now ill marry someone who loves me not someone she broke off and then finished huskily please now i rose heavily to my feet and went to the door i opened it and let the light flood into the room a shaft of light from the westering sun illuminated the bed the fair shining hair spread on the rolledup coat that serves as a pillow the great hazel eyes in the pale and exhausted face i looked at her for a long long moment i looked until i couldnt bear to look any longer id never more shed tears for the martyrs who went to the stake it was all too easy i looked at the only person id ever loved and as i turned away bentall the tough guy to the end not wanting even his marie to see the tears in his eyes i heard her shocked whisper dear god oh dear god your face itll do i said it wont have to last me a great deal longer im sorry marie im sorry i closed the door behind me the guard took me straight to the hangar and luck was with me and leclerc for i did not meet him on the way hewell was waiting for me with hargreaves and williams both with their notebooks at the ready i got onto the lift without being told the other two followed and we started work first i opened the junction box on the inside of the outer casing and adjusted the timing devices on the rotary clock then checking that the handoperated switch on the destruct box was locked at safe i took a quick look at the second break in the suicide circuit the solenoid switch directly above the timing device the solenoid normally activated when its enveloping coil was energised was held back by a fairly stout spring which required as a quick tug informed me about a pound and a half of pressure to close i left the box open the lid hanging downwards and secured by a couple of butterfly nuts then again turned my attention to the destruct box when pretending to check the action of the switch i did the same as i had done on the first shrike forced a small piece of wire between switch and cover then i called down to hewell have you the key for the destruct box switch stuck i neednt have bothered with the wire he said yeah i have it boss said we might expect trouble with this one too here catch i opened the cover unscrewed the switch pretended to adjust it replaced it and screwed home the rocker arm but before id replaced it id turned it through so that the brass lugs were in a reversed position the switch was so small my hands so completely covered it that neither hargreaves nor williams saw what i was doing nor had they any reason to expect anything amiss this was exactly they thought the same as they had seen me doing on the destruct box in the other rocket i replaced the cover shoved the lever to the safe position and now the destruct box was armed and it only awaited the closing of the solenoid switch to complete the suicide circuit normally the switch would be closed by radio signal by pressing the egads button in the launch console but it could also be done by hand i said to hewell right heres the key not quite so fast he growled he signalled for the lift to be brought down for him rode up to the open door and took the key from me then he tried the destruct box switch checked that it was impossible to move it more than halfway towards armed let it spring back to the safe position nodded pocketed the key and said how much longer couple of minutes final clock settings and buttoning up the lift whined downwards again hewell stepped off and on the way up i murmured to hargreaves and williams stop writing both of you the hum of the electric motor covered my words and it wasnt any trick to speak without moving my lips the left hand side of my mouth was now so puffed and swollen that movement was almost impossible anyway i leaned inside the door the cord id torn from the blind concealed in my hand to fasten one end of the cord to the solenoid should have taken maybe ten seconds but my hand was shaking so badly my vision and coordination so poor that it took me almost two minutes then i straightened and started to close the door with my left hand while the cord ran out through the fingers of my right when only a fourinch crack remained between the door and the outer casing of the rocket i peered insidethe watching hewell must have had the impression that i had one hand on either side of the door handle trying to ease its stiffness it took only three seconds for my right hand to drop a round turn and two half hitches round the inner handle men the door was shut the key turned and the job finished the first man to open that door more than four inches with a pressure of more than a pound and a half would trigger off the suicide charge and blow the rocket to pieces if the solid fuel went up in sympathetic detonation as dr fairfield had suspected it would he would also blow himself to pieces and everything within half a mile in either case i hoped the man who would open it would be leclerc himself the lift sank down and i climbed wearily to the ground through the open doors of the hangar i could see the scientists and some of the sailors sitting and lying about the shore an armed guard walking up and down about fifty yards from them giving the condemned boys their last few hours of sunshine eh i asked hewell yeah everything buttoned up all fixed i nodded towards the group mind if i join them i could do with some fresh air and sunshine myself you wouldnt be thinking of starting something what the hell could i start i demanded wearily do i look fit to start anything its gods truth you dont he admitted you can go you twothis to hargreaves and williamsthe boss wants to compare your notes i made my way down to the shore some of the chinese were manhandling the metal casing for the rocket on to a couple of bogies with about a dozen sailors helping them under gunpoint reck was just tying up at the end of the pier his schooner looked even more filthy than i remembered it on the sands captain griffiths was sitting some little way apart from the others i lay on the sand not six feet away from him face down on the sand my head pillowed on my right forearm i felt awful griffiths was the first to speak well bentall i suppose youve just wired up the other rocket for them he wouldnt win many friends talking to people in that tone of voice yes captain griffiths ive wired it up ive boobytrapped it so that the first man to open the door of the black shrike will blow the rocket out of existence thats why i did so good a job on the other rocket this is now the only one left they were also going to shoot you and every other sailor on the base through the back of the head and torture miss hopeman i was too late to stop them from getting at miss hopeman there was a long pause i wondered if he had managed to understand my slurred speech then he said quietly im so damnably sorry my boy ill never forgive myself put a couple of your men on watch i said tell them to warn us if leclerc or hewell or any of the guards approach then you just sit there staring out at sea speak to me as little as possible no one will see me speaking in this position five minutes later id finished telling griffiths exactly what leclerc had told me he planned to do after they had the black shrike in production when i was finished he was quiet for almost a minute well i asked fantastic he murmured its utterly unbelievable isnt it its fantastic but is it feasible captain griffiths its feasible he said heavily dear god its feasible thats what i thought so you think boobytrapping this rocketwell its justifiable you think how do you mean bentall when they get the black shrike to wherever its going i said still talking into the sand theyre not going to take it out to any remote launching field theyre going to take it to some factory almost certainly in some heavily populated industrial area to strip it down for examination if this solid fuel goes up with the tnt i dont like to think how many hundreds of people mainly innocent people will be killed i dont like to think how many millions would be killed in a nuclear war griffiths said quietly the question of justification doesnt enter into it the only question iswill the batteries powering the suicide circuit last nickel cadmium nife cells theyre good for six months maybe even a year look captain griffiths im not just telling you all this just to put you in the picture or to hear myself talking it hurts me even to open my mouth im telling you because i want you to tell it all to captain fleck he should be coming ashore any minute now captain fleck that damned renegade keep your voice down for heavens sake tell me captain do you know whats going to happen to you and me and all your men when our friend leclerc departs i dont have to tell you flecks our only hope youre out of your mind man listen carefully captain flecks a crook a scoundrel and an accomplished rogue but hes no megalomaniac monster fleck would do anything for moneyexcept one thing he wouldnt kill hes not the type hes told me so and i believe him flecks our only hope i waited for comment but there was none so i went on hell be coming ashore any moment now speak to him shout and wave your arms and curse him for the damned renegade you say he is the way you would be expected to do nobody will pay any attention except leclerc and hewell and all theyll do is laugh theyll think it highly amusing tell him what ive told you tell him he hasnt long to live that leclerc will leave no one behind to talk youll find that leclerc has spun him some cockandbull yarn about what he intended to do here one thing you can be certain of leclerc never told him of the rocket or what he intended to do with the rocket he would never have dared with fleck and his crew calling so often at suva and other fijian harbours where one careless word in a bar would have ruined everything do you think leclerc would have told him the truth captain he wouldnt youre right he couldnt have afforded to has fleck ever seen the rockets before of course not hangar doors were always closed when he called and he was allowed to speak only to the officers and the petty officer who supervised the unloading of the boat he knew of course that it was something big the neckar was often anchored in the lagoon here so but hell see the black shrike now he cant help seeing it from where hes berthed at the end of the pier hell have every justification for asking leclerc questions about it and im much mistaken if leclerc will be reluctant to talk about it its the dream of his life and he knows that fleck wont live to talk about it fleck might even then still have some doubts left as to whats in store for him so just that he can understand exactly what kind of man hes dealing with tell him to gono better tell him to send henry his mate he himself better not be seen to be missingto see what leclerc really is capable of i told griffiths exactly how to find the spot where hewell and his men had broken through the hillside told him where to find the cave with all the dead men i wouldnt be surprised if there are two more dead men there now fijian boys and ask him to find out if the radio in leclercs cabin is still there after henry comes back fleck will have no more doubts griffiths said nothing i only hoped id convinced him if i had i couldnt leave it in better hands he was a wily old bird and sharp as they came by and by i heard a movement as he got to his feet i peered out of the corner of one eye and saw him walking slowly away i twisted round till i saw the pier fleck and henry dressed in their best offwhites were just leaving the schooner i closed my eyes incredibly i went to sleep or perhaps not so incredibly i was exhausted beyond belief the aches in my head and face and shoulder and body merging into one vast gulf of pain i slept when i woke up id yet another ache to add to my lists someone was kicking me in the lower ribs and he wasnt trying to tickle me either i twisted my head leclerc too late in the day for leclerc to learn the more rudimentary rules of courtesy blinking against the sun i turned round till i was propped up on my good elbow then blinked again as something soft struck me in the face and fell on my chest i looked down a hank of cordwindow cordneatly rolled up and tied we thought you might like to have it back bentall weve no further use for it no fury in that face not the vindictive anger i would have expected but something approaching satisfaction he looked at me consideringly tell me bentall did you really think that id overlook so obvious a possibilityto me the certainty ratherthat you wouldnt hesitate to jinx the second shrike when you knew there would be no further danger to yourself you sadly underrate me which is why you find yourself where you are now you werent as smart as all that i said slowly i felt sick i dont think you did suspect what i did overlook was the certainty that you would take hargreaves and williams apart and threaten to kill their wives if they didnt tell you everything that happened separate huts and the usual menaces if their stories didnt tally exactly maybe i do underestimate you so now you take me away somewhere quietly and shoot me i dont really think ill mind nobodys going to shoot you bentall nobodys going to shoot anybody were leaving tomorrow and i can promise that when we do we will leave you all alive of course i sneered how many years practice does it take leclerc to get that ring of conviction into your voice when you tell your damned lies youll see tomorrow always tomorrow and how do you propose to keep forty of us under control until then i hoped his mind worked as mine did or id probably wasted my time in sending griffiths to fleck you gave us the idea yourself bentall the blockhouse you said it would make a fine dungeon escape proof besides i want all my men for the job of crating the shrike tonight and i dont need guards for anyone inside the blockhouse he looked at hewell and smiled incidentally bentall i believe there is no love lost between yourself and captain griffiths he was saying some pretty hard things about you for fusing up that first rocket i said nothing i waited for it youll be pleased to hear hes met with a little trouble nothing serious i gather he took it into his head to berate captain fleckas one englishman to anotherfor his treasonable activities fleck one gathers took exception to griffiths taking exception in age height and weight the two master mariners were pretty evenly matched and if captain griffiths was a bit fitter fleck knew more dirty tricks it was a fight to see had to stop it eventually distracting my men i hope they beat each other to death i growled leclerc smiled and walked away with hewell the world was going well for them it wasnt for me the boobytrap sprung griffiths and fleck at blows the last hope gone marie finished with me leclerc winning all along the line and a bullet in the head for bentall any hour now i felt sick and weak and exhausted and beaten maybe it was time to give up i rolled over on my face again saw griffiths approaching he sat where he had been sitting before his shirt was dirty and torn his forehead grazed and a trickle of blood at the corner of his mouth congratulations i said bitterly they are in order he said calmly fleck believes me it wasnt difficult to convince him he was on the other side of the island this morning and found a dead manor what was left of hima fijian i think floating out near the reef he thought it was sharks he doesnt now his mate has gone to investigate butbut the fight leclerc came out of the hangar he was watching us closely much too closely it was the only way to kill suspicion i looked up and he was smiling we managed to exchange quite a bit of information as we were rolling around captain griffiths i said you deserve a battleship for this the sun sunk down towards the sea two chinese brought us some food mostly tinned and beer i saw another couple take some across to the blockhouse where the seven women were still held probably as additional security against our making trouble lieutenant brookman fixed my arm again and he didnt seem too happy with its condition all afternoon the chinese and about half the sailors closely supervised by hewell were dismantling two gantries and setting them up one on either side of the railway track in preparation for lifting the shrike into its metal crate which was already in position on a pair of bogies and all the time i wondered about marie in her loneliness whether she was asleep or awake how she felt whether she thought about me whether her despair was half as deep as mine shortly before sunset fleck and henry came strolling along the sands from the other side of the pier they stopped directly opposite me fleck with his legs spread and arms akimbo griffiths shook his fist at him there would be no doubt in any watchers mind that another violent argument verbal or otherwise was about to begin i rolled over on my right elbow the most natural thing in the world if one heard two people arguing over ones head flecks brown hard face was set and grim henry found them all right his voice was husky with anger eleven dead the rotten lying murderous devil he swore bitterly and went on god knows i play rough but not that rough he told me they were prisoners that i was to find them by accident tomorrow and take them back to fiji i said do you think theres going to be any tomorrow for you fleck dont you see the armed sentry on the pier waiting to see you dont make a break for it with your ship dont you see youll have to go the same way as the rest he cant leave anyone behind wholl talk i know but im all right tonight anyway i can sleep on my schooner tonight a coaster from fiji by the name of grasshopper and manned by the most murderous crew of asiatics in the pacific is coming here at dawn ive got to pilot them through the reefs for all his anger fleck was playing his part well gesticulating violently with every second word whats the coaster for i asked surely its obvious it was griffiths who replied a big vessel couldnt approach the pier theres only ten feet or so of water and though they could load the rocket on to flecks after deck he hasnt anything in the crane line big enough to transship it to a submarine ill bet this coaster has a jumbo derrick eh heck yes it has submarine what it can wait i interrupted did henry find the radio no henry himself replied lugubrious as ever theyve blasted down the roof at the other end of the tunnel and sealed it off and tomorrow i thought theyll shove us all inside this end of the tunnel and seal that off maybe leclerc hadnt been lying when he said he wouldnt shoot us starvation wasnt as quick as shooting but it was just as effective well fleck i said how do you like it youve got a daughter in the university of california in santa barbara right next to one of the biggest intercontinental ballistic missile bases in the world the vanderberry air force base a number one target for a hydrogen bomb the asiatics sweeping down on your adopted country of australia all those dead men for gods sake shut up he snarled his fists were tightly clenched and fear and desperation and anger fought in his face what do you want me to do i told him what i wanted him to do the sun touched the rim of the sea the guards came for us and we were marched away to the blockhouse as we went in i looked back and saw the floodlight going up outside the hangar leclerc and his men would be working all through the night let them work if fleck came through there was an even chance the black shrike would never reach its destination if fleck came through chapter twelve saturday am am i awoke in the darkness of the night id been asleep four hours maybe six i didnt know all i knew was that i didnt feel any the better for it the heat in that sealed antechamber of the blockhouse was oppressive the air was stuffy and foul and the mattressmaking companies had little to fear from the manufacturers of concrete i sat up stiffly and because the only thing i had left me were my few remaining shreds of pride i didnt shout out at the top of my voice when i inadvertently put some weight on my left hand it was near as a toucher though i leaned my good shoulder against the wall and someone stirred beside me you awake bentall it was captain griffiths uhhuh whats the time just after three oclock in the morning three oclock captain fleck had promised to make it by midnight at the latest three oclock why didnt you wake me captain why why indeed just so that i could go round the bend with worry that was why if there was one thing certain it was that there was nothing i or anyone else could do about getting out of that place for thirty minutes after wed been locked in griffiths brookman and myself had searched with matches for one weak spot in either the walls or the door or that antechamber a hopelessly optimistic undertaking when you consider that those walls had been built of reinforced concrete designed to withstand the sudden and violent impact of many tons of air pressure but we had to do it we had found what we expected nothing no sound no movement outside i asked nothing just nothing at all well i said bitterly it would have been a pity to spoil the fine record ive set up what do you mean i mean that every damned thing ive touched on this damned job has gone completely wrong when it comes to sheer consistency bentalls your man too much to hope for a change at this late hour i shook my head in the dark three hours overdue at least three hours hes either tried and been caught or theyve locked him up as a precaution not that it matters now i think theres still a chance griffiths said every fifteen minutes or so one of my men has stood on anothers shoulders and looked through the ventilation grill cant see anything of interest of course just the hill on one side and the sea on the other the point is that there has been brilliant moonlight nearly all night make it impossible for fleck to get away unobserved from his ship he might get the chance yet nearly all night you said nearly well there was a dark patch lasting maybe half an hour round about one oclock he admitted reluctantly he wouldnt want half an hour fifteen minutes would be all he needed i said heavily theres no future in kidding ourselves there was no future anyway id expected far too much to expect him to slip away unobserved from his ship in clear moonlight with a guard on the pier and a working party with brilliant floodlamps not a hundred yards away was to expect a little bit too much and to expect him afterwards to reach unseen the captains hut where the keyboard was not fifty yards from the hangar steal the keys free marie from the armoury and then free uswell it had been expecting far too much altogether but it had been the only shadow of hope that we had had and the clutch of a drowning man is pretty fierce the time dragged on a night that could never end but for all that a night that would end all too soon i dont think anyone slept there would be time and to spare for rest later on the scientists and their wives murmured away softly most of the time it occurred to me with a sense of shock that i wouldnt have been able to identify any of those women had i met them again i had never yet seen one in daylight the air became more and more vitiated breathing in that foul usedup atmosphere was becoming painful the heat became steadily worse and sweat dripped from my face ran down my arms and back every now and then a seaman would be hoisted up to look through the grill and every time he had the same report bright moonlight every time that was until four oclock the seaman had no sooner reached eyelevel to the grill than he called out the moons gone its pitch dark outside i cant see but i never did hear what he couldnt see there came from outside in quick succession the sounds of a quick rush of feet a scuffle a heavy blow and then a metallic scratching as someone fumbled for the keyhole then a solid click the door swung open and the cool sweet night air flooded into the room fleck griffiths said softly fleck it is sorry to be late but miss hopeman i interrupted she there afraid not armoury key wasnt on the board i spoke to her through the window bars she told me to give you this he thrust a paper into my hand anyone with a match i asked i want its not urgent fleck said she wrote it this afternoon been waiting for a chance to he broke off come on no time to waste that damn moon isnt going to stay behind a cloud all night hes right you know griffiths said he called softly outside all of you no talking straight up the face of the hill and then cut across thats best eh bentall thats best i stuck the note into my shirt pocket stood to one side to let the others file quietly out i peered at fleck what you got there a rifle he turned and spoke softly and two men came round the corner of the blockhouse dragging a third leclerc had a man on guard gun belongs to him everybody out all right krishna inside with him dead i dont think so fleck didnt sound worried one way or the other there came the sound of something heavy being dumped unceremoniously on the concrete floor inside and the two indians came out fleck pulled the door quietly to and locked it come on come on griffiths whispered impatiently time we were off you go off i said im going to get miss hopeman out of the armoury he was already ten feet away but he stopped turned and came back to me are you mad he said fleck said theres no key that moon comes out any minute now youll be bound to be seen you wont have a chance come on and dont be so damned stupid ill take the chance leave me you know youre almost certain to be seen griffiths said softly if youre out theyll know were all out they will know that theres only one place we could go we have women with us its a mile and a half to that cave entrance we would be bound to be intercepted and cut off what it amounts to bentall is that you are prepared to risk the almost certain loss of all our lives on the selfish one in a thousand chance of doing something for miss hopeman is that it bentall is that how selfish you are im selfish all right i said at last but im not all that bad i just hadnt thought of it i come with you to the point where there is no further possibility of interception then i turn back dont make the mistake of trying to stop me youre quite crazy bentall there was anger and worry both in griffiths voice all youll do is lose your life and lose it to no purpose its my life we moved straight towards the face of the hill all in a closely bunched group no one talked not even in whispers though leclerc and his men were then well over half a mile away after wed gone about three hundred yards the hill started to rise steeply wed made as much offing as we could so now we turned south and began to skirt the base of the mountain this was where things began to become dangerous we had to pass by the hangar and the buildings to get to the cave entrance and just behind the hangar a sharp spur of the mountain rose above the surrounding level and would force us to come within two hundred yards of where leclerc and his men were working things went well in the first ten minutes the moon stayed behind the cloud longer than we had any right to hope but it wasnt going to stay there all night eighty per cent of the sky was quite free from cloud and in those latitudes even the starlight was a factor to be reckoned with i touched griffiths on the arm moons coming out any second now theres a slight fold in the mountain about a hundred yards further on if we hurry we might make it we made it just as the moon broke through bathing the mountain and the plain below in a harsh white glare but we were safe for the moment at least the ridge that blocked us off from the view of the hangar was only three feet high but it was enough heck and his two indians i could now see were dressed in clothes that were completely sodden i looked at him and said did you have to take a bath before you came damn guard sat on the pier all night with a rifle in his hands fleck growled checking us checking to see we didnt go near the radio we had to slip over the far side about one oclock when the moon went in and swim for it maybe a quarter mile along the beach henry and the boy of course went the other way i had asked that henry would make straight for the cave hurry through the chamber that had served as an armoury and bring back amatol blocks primers rdx chemical fuses anything he could find if they were still there that was there would certainly be neither arms nor ammunition left now and though the explosives would be a poor substitute for arms at least they would be better than nothing getting the keys was dicey fleck went on and there were only the twothe inner and outer blockhouse doors then we tried to force the door and window on the armoury to get miss hopeman out it was hopeless he paused i dont feel so good about that bentall but we tried honest to god we tried but we couldnt make a noise you understand that its not your fault fleck i know you tried well anyway we came to the blockhouse just as the moon came out lucky for us it did leclerc had left a guard we had to hide there two solid hours waiting till it got dark so we could rush him ive a pistol so has krishna here but the water got through the wrappings couldnt have used them anyway you did damn well captain fleck and we have a gun any good with it havent the eyes for it want it hell no i couldnt fire a popgun tonight i turned and located griffiths any good shots among your men captain as it happens i have chalmers herehe gestured towards the redhaired lieutenant over whose refusal to answer a question a seaman had been shotis one of the best shots in the royal navy would you care to have a go at them chalmers if the need arises yes sir chalmers said softly i would like that a cloud was approaching the moon it wasnt much of a cloud as clouds go it wasnt half as big as i would have liked it to be but it was going to have to do there wasnt another anywhere near the moon half a minute captain griffiths i said then were off well have to hurry he said worriedly single file is best i think fleck to lead the way then the women and the scientists so that they can make a break for the cave if anything happens my men and i will bring up the rear chalmers and i will do that so that you fade away and go down to the armoury when the moment comes is that it bentall come on i said its time to go we almost made it but bentall was around and nothing ever went right with bentall around we had safely passed the hangar where the two gantry cranes were slowly lowering the black shrike into its cradle and were a good two hundred yards clear when one of the women gave a highpitched cry of pain we found later that shed slipped and sprained a wrist i glanced back saw every man in the brightly illuminated space before the hangar stop what they had been doing and whirl round within three seconds as many men started running in our direction while others raced for their parked guns run for it griffiths shouted go like hell not you chalmers i said not me he said softly no not me he sunk down on one knee lifted cocked and fired the rifle all in one smooth motion i saw a puff of white jump up from the concrete two yards ahead of the nearest chinese chalmers adjusted the sights with one quick turn shooting low he said unhurriedly it wont be low the next time it wasnt with his second shot the leading guard flung his rifle into the air then pitched forward on his face a second died a third rolled over and over like a man in agony and then suddenly all the lights in the front of the hangar went out someone had just got on to the fact that they made a perfect target silhouetted against the floodlit concrete thats enough griffiths shouted get back theyll be fanning out coming towards us get back it was time to get back nothing surer a dozen guns some of them automatic carbines had opened up on us now they couldnt see us it was too dark for that but they had us roughly located from chalmers gunflashes and bullets were beginning to smash into the solid rock all around us half of them lifting in screaming ricochet griffiths and chalmers turned and ran and so did i but in the opposite direction back the way wed come i didnt see id any chance of getting back to the armoury the moonlight was beginning to filter through the ragged edges of the cloud but if i did get back the diversion made a perfect coverup for smashing my way into the armoury i took four steps then pitched my length on the rock as something smashed into my knee with tremendous force dazed i pushed myself shakily to my feet took one step and fell heavily again i wasnt conscious of any great pain it was just that my leg refused to support me you bloody fool oh you bloody fool griffiths was by my side chalmers close behind him whats happened my leg they got my leg i wasnt thinking about my leg i wasnt caring about my leg all i was caring about was that my last chance to get to the armoury was gone marie was there alone she was in the armoury waiting for me marie would know i would come for her she knew johnny bentall was every kind of fool there was but she knew i wouldnt leave her to leclerc i was on my feet again griffiths supporting me but it was no good the leg was paralysed completely without power are you deaf griffiths shouted im asking if you can walk no im all right leave me im going down to the armoury i didnt know what i was saying i was too dazed to express the difference between a wish and an intention im really all right you must hurry oh god griffiths took me by one arm chalmers by the other and they halfhustled halfdragged me along the flank of the mountain the others were already out of sight but after a minute brookman and a seaman came hurrying back to see what had happened and lent a hand with the job of dragging me along i was a great help to everyone jonah bentall come with me and you come a cropper i wondered vaguely what id ever done to deserve luck like this we arrived at the cave almost three minutes after the last of the others were safely inside i was told this but i dont remember it i dont remember anything about the last half mile i was told later that we wouldnt have made it had the moon not broken through and chalmers held up the chinese by picking off two of them as they came over the last ridge i was told too that i talked to myself all the way and when they begged me to be quiet in case the pursuers caught us i kept saying who me but i wasnt talking very hurt and indignant or so they told me i dont remember anything what i do remember was coming to inside the cave very close to the entrance i was lying against the wall and the first thing i saw was another man lying beside me face down one of the chinese he was dead i lifted my eyes and saw griffiths brookman fleck henry and some petty officer i didnt know on the other side pressed close against the wall at least i thought it was them it was still dark inside the tunnel there was room enough for them to shelter although the tunnel had been four feet wide and seven high all the way to the end when id followed it the last few feet where hewell and his men had broken through was no more than three feet high and barely eighteen inches in width i looked around to see where the others were but i could see nothing they would be a hundred yards back in the cavern hewell had excavated for the temporary storage of the tunnelledout limestone i looked out again through the tiny opening of the tunnel the dawn was in the sky how long have i been lying here i asked suddenly my voice sounded in my ears like the husky quivering of an old old man but maybe it was just the echo inside the cave about an hour funny griffiths voice didnt sound a bit like an old mans brookman says youll be all right chipped kneecap thats all youll be walking again in a week did wedid we all get here all right everyone made it sure everyone made it marie hopeman didnt make it why should they care what was all the world to me was only a name to them marie hopeman was down there alone in the armoury and i would never see her again but she was only a name it didnt really matter if you were only a name and i would never see her again never never was a long time even in this last thing this most important thing id ever know id failed id failed marie and now it was never never was going to be for always bentall griffiths voice was sharp are you all right im all right youre talking to yourself again am i i reached out and touched the dead man what happened leclerc sent him in i dont know whether he thought wed retreated to the other end of the cave or whether it was a kind of suicide mission chalmers waited till he was all the way in and then we had two guns and what else an hour is a long time they tried firing into the cave after that but they had to stand in front if they werent going to do it blindly they soon gave it up then they tried to blow up the entrance to seal it off they would try that i said it wouldnt have made much difference we could have got out what they meant to do if things had gone their way would have been to blow in the tunnel roof for a hundred yards or so that would really have finished us i wondered vaguely why i was saying this none of it mattered anymore they set off one charge above the entrance griffiths was continuing nothing much happened then we heard them working just outside using picks to make holes for more charges we flung out a couple of fused amatol blocks i think they lost some men they didnt try anything like that again the note i said didnt you tell them about the note of course griffiths said impatiently i had told fleck to leave a copy of a faked radio message on the wireless table saying message acknowledged hms kandahar proceeding high speed suvavardu expect arrive am the inference would be that fleck had sent an sos by radio we told leclerc a naval vessel was coming he wouldnt believe us saying it was impossible the sentry had been there to prevent messages from being sent but fleck said hed been asleep maybe the sentry was one of those killed i dont know we told him hed find the message on the schooner he sent someone to fetch it leclerc couldnt afford to ignore it it might mean he had only three hours left less for fleck says the captain of the grasshopper without him to pilot it in wouldnt attempt the gap in the reef before daybreak leclerc would be pleased he was mad he was out there talking to us and we could hear his voice shaking with fury he kept asking for you but we told him you were unconscious he said he would shoot miss hopeman if you didnt come out so i told him you were dying that would cheer him up i said drearily it seemed to griffiths admitted then he went away perhaps he took his men with him we dont know yes fleck said heavily and the first man to stick his head out the entrance gets it blown off time passed the light at the mouth of the tunnel steadily brightened through all stages of dawn until finally we could see a washedout patch of blue the sun was up griffiths it was leclercs voice from outside and it had us all jumping do you hear me i hear you is bentall there griffiths waved a cautionary hand to silence me but i ignored it im here leclerc i thought you were dying bentall his voice held a vicious overtone the first time id heard anything of the kind from him what do you want i want you bentall im here come in and take me out listen bentall dont you want to save miss hopemans life this was it i should have expected this last desperate move to force my hand leclerc wanted me badly he wanted me very badly indeed and then youve got us both is that it leclerc id no doubt that was it i give you my word ill send her in dont listen captain griffiths warned me in an urgent whisper once hes got you hell use you as bait to get someone like me out and so on or hell just kill you both i knew which it would be hed just kill us both he wasnt interested in the others but he had to kill us both me at any rate but it was a chance i had to take maybe he wouldnt dispose of us straight away he might take us aboard the ship with him it was one last chance it wasnt a chance in a million but it was a chance that was all i asked a chance i might save us both yet and as the thought came i knew i never could it wasnt even that million to one chance but it was like what marie had said sitting in the electric chair and the man pulling the switch and still hoping i said all right leclerc im coming out i hadnt seen the signal fleck henry and griffiths reached me in the same instant pinning me to the ground for a few seconds i struggled like a madman but i hadnt the strength left to struggle any longer let me go i whispered for gods sake let me go were not letting you go griffiths said he raised his voice all right leclerc you can leave weve got bentall and were keeping him you know why then i shall have to kill miss hopeman leclerc said savagely im going to kill her do you hear bentall im going to kill her but not today not for some time yet or perhaps shell kill herself first goodbye bentall thank you for the black shrike we heard the sound of departing footsteps and then there was only the silence the three men took their hands away and fleck said im sorry boy im more sorry than i can say i didnt answer i just sat there wondering why the world didnt come to an end by and by i heaved myself painfully on to my hands and one knee and said im going out dont be so damn stupid i could see by the expression on griffiths face that he was regaining his first impression of me one that had been far from favourable theyll be waiting he cant afford to wait any longer its what time now almost seven hell be on his way he wouldnt risk the black shrike for a chance at my life dont try to stop me please ive something to do i crawled out through the narrow mouth of the tunnel and looked around for a few seconds i couldnt see anything the shooting stabs from my kneecap blurred my eyes and put everything out of focus then the focus came back there was no one there no living person that was there were three dead men lying outside the entrance two chinese and hewell of course it would have been hewell who would have been supervising the placing of the charges to blow in the mouth of the tunnel and the exploding blocks of amatol had torn half the giants chest away anything less than that would never have taken his life i saw the metallic snout of a gun barrel sticking out from under his body i bent and pulled it clear with difficulty it was fully loaded its all right i said theyve gone ten minutes later we were all making our way slowly down to the hangar brookman was right i thought dully it would be a week or more before i could walk properly again but the navy boys took turns at helping me along taking almost half my weight we came over the last ridge that separated us from the plain the area round the hangar seemed deserted a small coasting vessel was just clearing the reef i heard fleck curse bitterly and then saw why fifty yards out from the pier all you could see of his schooner was her masts and the top of her superstructure leclerc thought of everything everyone was talking talking and trying to joke and laughing a nervous hysterical kind of laughter but laughter all the same you couldnt blame them when youve been under the shadow of certain death and it suddenly lifts it has that effect on nearly everybody the strain of the long night for the women the long weeks were over the fear and the horror and the suspense lay behind the world theyd thought was ended was just beginning again i looked at the seven scientists and their wives seeing the wives for the first time ever and they were smiling and gazing into each others eyes each pair linked arm in arm i couldnt look at them i had to look away no more gazing for me into maries eyes but id walked arm in arm with her though once once for about two minutes it hadnt been much we might have been given more only fleck seemed depressed and heavy only reck out of all of them and i didnt think it was because of what had happened to his schooner not primarily anyway he had been the only one of them who had ever known marie and when hed called her a nice girl id gratuitously insulted him and he had a daughter of about the same age fleck was sad he was sad for marie fleck was all right hed pay no price for his earlier activities hed cleared the slate over and over again we came to the hangar i cocked the gun in my hands and prayed that leclerc had left an ambush partyor himself behind to get us when the disappearing vessel had tricked us into thinking they had all gone but there was no one there nor was there in any of the other huts nothing but every radio set and transmitter smashed beyond repair we came to the armoury and i walked in through the open door and looked at the empty cot i felt the crumpled coat that had served as a pillow and it was still warm some instinct made me lift it and under there was a ring a plain golden ring shed worn on the fourth finger of her left hand the wedding ring i slipped it over my little finger and left griffiths gave instructions for the burial of the dead and then he and fleck and i made our way slowly to the blockhouse fleck halfcarrying me two armed sailors followed us the coaster was beyond the reef now steering due west the black shrike and marie the black shrike carrying with it the threat of millions of ruined lives of scores of great cities lying in the dust of more carnage and sorrow and heartbreak than the world had known since time began the black shrike and marie the marie who had looked into the future and found nothing there the marie who had said that one day i would meet up with a situation where my selfbelief would be no help to me at all and the day had come fleck turned the key in the blockhouse door pushed the chinese back at the point of his gun then turned him over to the sailors we passed inside the second door and switched on the lights leclerc had smashed every other transmitting mechanism on the base but he hadnt smashed the launch console because he hadnt been able to get at it he wouldnt have wanted to smash it anyway for leclerc did not know that the suicide circuit in the black shrike was armed we crossed the room i bent down to switch on the generator and as i did my shirt pocket fell open and i saw for the first time and remembered for the first time the little note fleck had given me i picked it up and smoothed the creases there were only a few words altogether it said please forgive me johnny ive changed my mind about not marrying yousomeone has to or youll be in trouble all your life ps maybe i love you a little too then at the foot tps you and me and the lights of london i folded the note and put it away i adjusted the periscope above my head and could clearly see the grasshopper low down on the horizon a plume of dark smoke trailing behind her steaming steadily west i removed the mesh cover over the egads destruct button turned the white square knob degrees then reached over and pushed the commit button the light glowed green the safety clock in the black shrike was running out twelve seconds twelve seconds it took from the moment of pressing the button until the suicide circuit was fully armed twelve seconds i stared down at my wristwatch seeing the sweep second hand jerking steadily forward wondering vaguely whether the charge would only merely blow the shrike apart or whether as fairfield had suspected there would be a sympathetic detonation of the solid fuel and the black shrike blow itself out of existence not that it mattered now two seconds i stared blindly into the eyepiece of the periscope all i could see was a misted blur then leaned on the destruct button with all the weight of my arm the black shrike blew itself out of existence even at that distance the violence of the explosion was terrifying a huge spouting volcano of seething boiling white water that drowned the shattered vessel in a moment of time then a great fiery column of smoketipped flame that reached up a thousand feet into the blue of the morning and vanished with the moment of seeing the end of the black shrike the end of everything i turned away flecks arm round me and stumbled out into the sparkling brightness of a new day and as i did i heard the heavy rumble of the explosion rolling in from the sea and echoing back from the silent hill beyond epilogue a small dusty man in a small dusty room thats how i always thought of him just a small dusty man in a small dusty room hed jumped to his feet when id entered and now he was hurrying round the desk coming towards me taking me by my good arm and helping me towards the chair in front of his desk the royal treatment for the returned hero id have taken long odds that hed never done anything like this before he hadnt even bothered to rise from his chair the first time id seen marie hopeman walk into that room sit down sit down my boy the grey lined face was alive with concern the steady watchful green eyes mirrored the worry that this man almost never showed my god bentall you look awful there was a mirror behind his desk small flyblown and covered with dust like everything else in that room and he wasnt exaggerating any that i could see left arm in a black linen sling right hand holding the heavy stick that helped me along bloodshot eyes and pale sunken cheeks with the great livid weal that ran from temple to chin if i could get into the market quick i could make a fortune hiring myself out to haunt houses i look worse than i really am sir im just tired thats all god only knew how tired i was i hadnt slept a couple of hours in the two days it had taken me to fly home from suva have you had anything to eat bentall i wondered drily when this room had last seen such a display of solicitude not since old raine had taken over the chair behind that desk id bet no sir i came straight here after id phoned from the airport im not hungry i see he crossed over to the window and stood there for a few moments shoulders bent thin fingers laced behind his back gazing down at the blurred reflection of the lights on the wet glistening street below then he sighed drew the curtains across the stained and dusty windows went and sat down hands lightly clasped on the desk before him he said without any preamble so marie hopeman is dead yes i said shes dead its always the best who go he murmured always the best why couldnt an old useless man like myself have gone instead but its never that way is it if it had been my own daughter i couldnt he broke off and stared down at his hands well never see a marie hopeman again no sir we wont see a marie hopeman again how did she die bentall i killed her sir i had to you killed her he said it as if it were the most natural thing in the world i had your cable from the neckar ive had a rough outline from the admiralty about what happened on vardu island i know you have done a magnificent job but i know nothing please tell me everything that happened i told him everything that had happened it was a long story but he heard me out without question or interruption when i was finished he screwed the heels of his palms into his eyes then pushed both hands slowly up and back across the high lined forehead the sparse grey hair fantastic he murmured i have heard some strange tales in this office but he broke off reached for his pipe and penknife and started up his excavations again a great job a great jobbut what a price all the speeches all the thanks in the world can never repay you for what youve done my boy and no medals in a job like ours though i have already arranged that you shall have a very special umreward for what you have done and have it very soon a little tic at the corner of the mouth i was supposed to guess from that that he was smiling you will i think find it positivelyahstaggering i said nothing and he continued i have of course a hundred and one questions to ask you and you no doubt have one or two pointed questions for a small deception i was forced to practice but that can all wait for the morning he glanced at his watch good heavens its halfpast ten ive kept you too long far too long you look almost dead its all right i said its not all right he laid down pipe and knife and gave me the up from under look with those iceberg eyes of his i have more than a vague idea of what you have suffered not only physically what youve been through after all this bentall do you still wish to continue in the service more than ever sir i tried to smile but it wasnt worth the pain it cost so i gave it up remember what you said about that chair of yours before i leftid still like to sit in it some day and im determined you shall he said quietly so am i sir i put my right hand into the sling to ease my arm but thats not the only determination we share no a millimetric lift of the grey eyebrows no were both of us determined on something else were both of us determined that the other will never leave this room alive i took my hand from the sling and showed him my gun that luger under your seat leave it where it is he stared at me his mouth slowly tightening have you taken leave of your senses bentall no i just found them again four days ago i rose awkwardly to my feet and hobbled round to his side of the desk my eye and my gun never left him get out of that chair youre overstrained he said quietly youve been through too much i struck him across the face with the barrel of my gun get out of that chair he wiped some blood from his cheek and rose slowly to his feet lay the chair on its side he did as he was told the luger was there all right held by a spring clip lift it out with the forefinger and thumb of the left hand by the point of the barrel and lay it on the desk once more he did as he was directed get back to the window and turn round what in the name of god is i took a step towards him gun swinging he moved quickly backward four steps till he felt the curtains behind him and turned round i glanced down at the luger heavy silencer safety catch off loading indicator registering full i pocketed my own gun picked up the luger and told him to turn round i hefted the luger in my hand the staggering reward i was to get very soon eh i asked a slug in the middle of the guts from a luger would make anyone stagger only i wasnt quite as unsuspecting as the last poor devil you murdered when he was sitting in that chair was i he exhaled his breath in a long silent sigh and shook his head very slowly i suppose you know what youre talking about bentall unfortunately for you i do sit down i waited till he had straightened the chair and seated himself then leaned against a corner of the desk how long have you been playing this double game raine whatever on earth are you talking about he demanded wearily i suppose you know im going to kill you i said with this nice silenced luger nobody will hear a thing the building is deserted no one saw me come in and no one will see me go out theyll find you in the morning raine dead suicide theyll say your responsibilities were too heavy raine licked his lips he wasnt saying i was mad any more i suppose youve been engaged in treason all your life raine god knows how you got off with it for so long i suppose you must be brilliant or theyd have caught on to you years ago do you want to tell me about it raine the green eyes blazed into mine i had never before seen such concentrated malignity in a human face he said nothing very well i said ill tell you ill tell it as a little short story a bedtime story before you go to sleep listen well raine for its the last story youll ever hear before the last sleep youll ever have twentyfive years you spent in the far east raine the last ten as chief of counterespionage running with the hare and chasing with the hounds all the time i suppose god alone knows how much tragedy and suffering you caused out there how many people died because of you then two years ago you came home but before you came you were approached by one of the powers for whom you were working while you were supposed to be our counterespionage chief they told you they had heard rumours that english scientists were making preliminary investigations into solid fuel as a power source for missiles and rockets they asked you to find out what you could you agreed i dont pretend to know what they promised you power money heaven only knows nor do i pretend to know how exactly you set up your spying organisation contacts across europe were easy for you to arrange and the actual clearinghouse was istanbul where my investigations finally took me i suspect that the way you acquired your information was by introducing into the hepworth ordnance and research establishment the place with the highest security rating in britain men whom you yourself in your official capacity had thoroughly screened the months passed and information was gradually acquired sent to istanbul and retransmitted to the far east but your predecessor got wind of what was happening suspected a security leak and told the government they instructed him i imagine that the business of investigating this leakage was to be given the highest priority he started getting too close to the truth and his plane crashed into the irish sea and was never traced he was seen off on that flight at london airport he was seen off by you some timebomb in his luggage i suspectour luggage is immune from customs examination it was a pity that there were thirty others in that plane but that wasnt really important was it raine you were then promoted the obvious choice a brilliant and devoted man who had given a lifetime to serving his country you then found yourself in the fantastic position of having to send out agents to track down yourself and of course you had to one man you sent found out too much he came back here and into this room with a gun in his hand to confront you with this evidence he didnt know about the hidden luger did he raine and then you spread this story about how hed been subverted and ordered to kill you how am i doing colonel raine he had no comment to make on how i was doing now the government was getting really anxious you persuaded them that the difficulty lay in the complex nature of the technical information that was being passed that only a scientist could really understand it your own agents the honest ones were all right in their own way but there was one great objection to themthey were too damn good at finding things out so having kidded the government you shopped around until you found the most stupid scientist you could the one least likely to succeed you picked me i can understand your reasons and you picked marie hopeman you tried to convince me that she was a firstclass agent tough capable and highlyexperienced she was nothing of the sort she was just a nice girl with a beautiful face and figure and a considerable capacity for acting which made her ideal for the passive and undemanding position of receiving and passing on information without arousing suspicions but that was all she had no great intelligence no marked degree of inventiveness certainly not the mental ruthlessness and physical toughness essential for success in this job so you sent the two of us into europe to find out what we could about this fuel leak you must have been convinced that if there was any pair in the world who could never find anything it was marie hopeman and i but you made a mistake colonel raine you checked up on my intelligence and inventiveness and thought youd nothing to fear on that score but you forgot to check on other things toughness and ruthlessness i am tough and i can be completely ruthless youll see that when i pull this trigger ill stop at nothing to finish something ive started i began finding out things far too many things you panicked and called us back to london colonel raine showed no reaction to any of this his green unblinking eyes never left my face he was waiting waiting for a chance he knew i was a sick man and very tired one false move one slow reaction and hed be on to me like an express train and the way i felt that night i couldnt have fought off a teddy bear because of my activities i went on the fuel leak had practically stopped your eastern friends were getting worried but you had another string to your bow hadnt you colonel raine some months before that the government had set up a testing station for the black shrike on vardu security was essential and you of course were the man responsible for all the security arrangements you arranged the setup with professor witherspoon to have the island barred to visitors for a perfectly good and innocuous reason you arranged for the scientists and their wives to go to australia without arousing suspicion you arranged for a security clearance for captain fleckmy god who else but you could ever have given that rogue a clearanceand then you told your eastern friends under the leadership of leclerc to move in eliminate and replace witherspoon finally probably by telling them that they were going to see their husbands and emphasising to all of them the need for complete secrecy you arranged for the transport of the scientists wives to vardu but they were landed on the wrong side of the island werent they raine so now you had the two strings to your bow if you couldnt give your friends every detail of the new fuel you could give them the fuel itself only there was one snag dr fairfield got himself killed and you had to have someone to arm the rocket it was brilliant i admit it two birds with one stone i had already found out too much in europe and you knew now i was the type who wouldnt stop till the answer was there you told marie hopeman that i was the one man you could be afraid of and maybe for once you werent lying i knew too much and i had to be eliminated so did marie hopeman but before my elimination a duty youd arranged that your friend leclerc would carry out i had a job to do i was to arm the shrike you could have sent me direct to the rocket installation in a perfectly straightforward fashion while the navy was still there but you knew id be as suspicious as hell if i was pulled off a security job and put on a civilian job id be doubly suspicious because there are more qualified men in the country than i am and of course there would then be no reason for marie hopeman to accompany me and you wanted her killed too so you inserted this final and phoney advert in the telegraph showed it to me spun us this cockandbull story and sent us off to the pacific there was only one potential snag one vital matter on which everything else depended and your psychological handling of this was perfect the snagand if you couldnt find an answer to it everything would have been lostwas how to get me to wire up the firing circuitry and fuses of the black shrike the lamb youd thought youd caught had turned out to be a tiger you knew by that time how stubborn and ruthless i could be you guessed that threats of torture or torture itself wouldnt make me do it you knew if i thought it important enough that i could stand by and watch others being tortured or threatened with death as captain griffiths and his men were and still not do it but you knew a man in love will do anything to protect the one he loves and so you arranged it that i fall in love with marie hopeman you reckoned that no one could sit side by side in planes with marie hopeman for two days spend a night in the same room spend a night and a day in the hold of a ship a night huddled together on a reef and two more days side by side in the same hut without falling in love with her my god even going to the length of having the bogus witherspoon trying to make me jealous damn your black heart raine you gave us the time the situation and every opportunity to fall in love and so we did they tortured her and let me see her they threatened to do it again and so god help me i armed the black shrike and god help you too colonel raine for its because of marie that youre going to die not because of all the deaths youve caused the misery the heartbreak the suffering but for marie i pushed myself painfully off the table and limped round till i was within three feet of him you cant prove any of this raine said hoarsely thats why i have to kill you here i agreed indifferently no court in the country would look at my case no proof but there were many things that pointed to your guilt raine things that i didnt see till it was too late how did fleck know that marie had a gun in the false bottom of her bagscientists wives dont usually carry guns why did leclercwitherspoon as i knew him thensay we werent long married we didnt behave that way later why did he show no surprise when i told him we werent married he said id a photographic memoryhow the hell did he know that unless you told him why did leclerc and hewell try to cripple me with a heavy safethey knew i was an intelligence agent you told them and they didnt want me snooping around who gave fleck security clearance from london how did they know the shrike was about to be tested if the word hadnt been relayed from london why was no attention paid to the sos cable i sent to london no action taken leclerc spun a yarn about sending a second message cancelling the first but you know every message to this office coded or plain must have my identification word bilex in the middle why were no enquiries made at the grand pacific hotel after our disappearance i checked on the way home and neither the government house nor the police had been asked to investigate the observer who was supposed to accompany us on the plane never reported our disappearancefor there was no observer was there colonel raine pointers only not proof youre right i couldnt prove a thing raine smiled the man seemed to have no nerves at all how would you feel bentall if you killed me and found out you were completely wrong he leaned forward and said softly how would you feel if i gave you absolute proof here and now that youre completely terribly wrong youre wasting your time colonel raine here it comes but damn it man ive got the proof he shouted ive got it right
