 the makebelieve man i i had made up my mind that when my vacation came i would spend it seeking adventures i have always wished for adventures but though i am old enough i was twentyfive last october and have always gone halfway to meet them adventures avoid me kinney says it is my fault he holds that if you want adventures you must go after them kinney sits next to me at joyce carboys the woollen manufacturers where i am a stenographer and kinney is a clerk and we both have rooms at mrs shaws boardinghouse kinney is only a year older than myself but he is always meeting with adventures at night when i have sat up late reading law so that i may fit myself for court reporting and in the hope that some day i may become a member of the bar he will knock at my door and tell me some surprising thing that has just happened to him sometimes he has followed a fireengine and helped people from a fireescape or he has pulled the shield off a policeman or at the bar of the hotel knickerbocker has made friends with a stranger who turns out to be no less than a nobleman or an actor and women especially beautiful women are always pursuing kinney in taxicabs and calling upon him for assistance just to look at kinney without knowing how clever he is at getting people out of their difficulties he does not appear to be a man to whom you would turn in time of trouble you would think women in distress would appeal to some one bigger and stronger would sooner ask a policeman but on the contrary it is to kinney that women always run especially as i have said beautiful women nothing of the sort ever happens to me i suppose as kinney says it is because he was born and brought up in new york city and looks and acts like a new york man while i until a year ago have always lived at fairport fairport is a very pretty harbor but it does not train one for adventures we arranged to take our vacation at the same time and together at least kinney so arranged it i see a good deal of him and in looking forward to my vacation not the least pleasant feature of it was that everything connected with joyce carboy and mrs shaws boardinghouse would be left behind me but when kinney proposed we should go together i could not see how without being rude i could refuse his company and when he pointed out that for an expedition in search of adventure i could not select a better guide i felt that he was right sometimes he said i can see you dont believe that half the things i tell you have happened to me really have happened now isnt that so to find the answer that would not hurt his feelings i hesitated but he did not wait for my answer he seldom does well on this trip he went on you will see kinney on the job you wont have to take my word for it you will see adventures walk up and eat out of my hand our vacation came on the first of september but we began to plan for it in april and up to the night before we left new york we never ceased planning our difficulty was that having been brought up at fairport which is on the sound north of new london i was homesick for a smell of salt marshes and for the sight of water and ships though they were only schooners carrying cement i wanted to sit in the sun on the stringpiece of a wharf and watch them i wanted to beat about the harbor in a catboat and feel the tug and pull of the tiller kinney protested that that was no way to spend a vacation or to invite adventure his face was set against fairport the conversation of clamdiggers he said did not appeal to him and he complained that at fairport our only chance of adventure would be my capsizing the catboat or robbing a lobsterpot he insisted we should go to the mountains where we would meet what he always calls our best people in september he explained everybody goes to the mountains to recuperate after the enervating atmosphere of the seashore to this i objected that the little sea air we had inhaled at mrs shaws basement diningroom and in the subway need cause us no anxiety and so along these lines throughout the sleepless sultry nights of june july and august we fought it out there was not a summer resort within five hundred miles of new york city we did not consider from the information bureaus and passenger agents of every railroad leaving new york kinney procured a library of timetables maps folders and pamphlets illustrated with the most attractive pictures of summer hotels golf links tennis courts and boathouses for two months he carried on a correspondence with the proprietors of these hotels and in comparing the different prices they asked him for suites of rooms and sun parlors derived constant satisfaction the outlook house he would announce wants twentyfour dollars a day for bedroom parlor and private bath while for the same accommodations the carteret arms asks only twenty but the carteret has no tennis court and then again the outlook has no garage nor are dogs allowed in the bedrooms as kinney could not play lawn tennis and as neither of us owned an automobile or a dog or twentyfour dollars these details to me seemed superfluous but there was no health in pointing that out to kinney because as he himself says he has so vivid an imagination that what he lacks he can make believe he has and the pleasure of possession is his kinney gives a great deal of thought to his clothes and the question of what he should wear on his vacation was upon his mind when i said i thought it was nothing to worry about he snorted indignantly you wouldnt he said if id been brought up in a catboat and had a tan like a red indian and hair like a broadway blonde i wouldnt worry either mrs shaw says you look exactly like a british peer in disguise i had never seen a british peer with or without his disguise and i admit i was interested why are the girls in this house demanded kinney always running to your room to borrow matches because they admire your clothes if theyre crazy about clothes why dont they come to me for matches you are always out at night i said you know thats not the answer he protested why do the typewriter girls at the office always go to you to sharpen their pencils and tell them how to spell the hard words why do the girls in the lunchrooms serve you first because theyre hypnotized by your clothes is that it do they i asked i hadnt noticed kinney snorted and tossed up his arms he hadnt noticed he kept repeating he hadnt noticed for his vacation kinney bought a secondhand suitcase it was covered with labels of hotels in france and switzerland joe i said if you carry that bag you will be a walking falsehood kinneys name is joseph forbes kinney he dropped the joseph because he said it did not appear often enough in the social register and could be found only in the old testament and he has asked me to call him forbes having first known him as joe i occasionally forget my name is not joe he said sternly and i have as much right to carry a secondhand bag as a new one the bag says it has been to europe it does not say that i have been there but you probably will i pointed out and then some one who has really visited those places listen commanded kinney if you want adventures you must be somebody of importance no one will go shares in an adventure with joe kinney a twentydollaraweek clerk the human adding machine the hallroom boy but forbes kinney esq with a bag from europe and a harvard ribbon round his hat is that a harvard ribbon round your hat i asked it is declared kinney and i have a yale ribbon and a turf club ribbon too they come on hooks and you hook em on to match your clothes or the company you keep and whats more he continued with some heat ive borrowed a tennis racket and a golf bag full of sticks and you take care you dont give me away i see i returned that you are going to get us into a lot of trouble i was thinking said kinney looking at me rather doubtfully it might help a lot if for the first week you acted as my secretary and during the second week i was your secretary sometimes when mr joyce goes on a business trip he takes me with him as his private stenographer and the change from office work is very pleasant but i could not see why i should spend one week of my holiday writing letters for kinney you wouldnt write any letters he explained but if i could tell people you were my private secretary it would naturally give me a certain importance if it will make you any happier i said you can tell people i am a british peer in disguise there is no use in being nasty about it protested kinney i am only trying to show you a way that would lead to adventure it surely would i assented it would lead us to jail the last week in august came and as to where we were to go we still were undecided i suggested we leave it to chance the first thing i pointed out is to get away from this awful city the second thing is to get away cheaply let us write down the names of the summer resorts to which we can travel by rail or by boat for two dollars and put them in a hat the name of the place we draw will be the one for which we start saturday afternoon the idea i urged is in itself full of adventure kinney agreed but reluctantly what chiefly disturbed him was the thought that the places near new york to which one could travel for so little money were not likely to be fashionable i have a terrible fear he declared that with this limit of yours we will wake up in asbury park friday night came and found us prepared for departure and at midnight we held our lottery in a pillowcase we placed twenty slips of paper on each of which was written the name of a summer resort ten of these places were selected by kinney and ten by myself kinney dramatically rolled up his sleeve and plunging his bared arm into our grabbag drew out a slip of paper and read aloud new bedford via new bedford steamboat line the choice was one of mine new bedford shouted kinney his tone expressed the keenest disappointment its a mill town he exclaimed its full of cotton mills that may be i protested but its also a most picturesque old seaport one of the oldest in america you can see whaling vessels at the wharfs there and wooden figureheads and harpoons is this an expedition to dig up buried cities interrupted kinney or a pleasure trip i dont want to see harpoons i wouldnt know a harpoon if you stuck one into me i prefer to see hatpins the patience did not sail until six oclock but we were so anxious to put new york behind us that at five we were on board our cabin was an outside one with two berths after placing our suitcases in it we collected campchairs and settled ourselves in a cool place on the boat deck kinney had bought all the afternoon papers and as later i had reason to remember was greatly interested over the fact that the young earl of ivy had at last arrived in this country for some weeks the papers had been giving more space than seemed necessary to that young irishman and to the young lady he was coming over to marry there had been pictures of his different country houses pictures of himself in uniform in the robes he wore at the coronation on a polo pony as master of foxhounds and there had been pictures of miss aldrich and of her country places at newport and on the hudson from the afternoon papers kinney learned that having sailed under his family name of meehan the young man and lady moya his sister had that morning landed in new york but before the reporters had discovered them had escaped from the wharf and disappeared inquiries at the different hotels read kinney impressively failed to establish the whereabouts of his lordship and lady moya and it is believed they at once left by train for newport with awe kinney pointed at the red funnels of the mauretania there is the boat that brought them to america he said i see he added that in this picture of him playing golf he wears one of those knit jackets the eiselbaum has just marked down to three dollars and seventyfive cents i wish he added regretfully you can get one at new bedford i suggested i wish he continued we had gone to newport all of our best people will be there for the wedding it is the most important social event of the season you might almost call it an alliance i went forward to watch them take on the freight and kinney stationed himself at the rail above the passengers gangway where he could see the other passengers arrive he had dressed himself with much care and was wearing his yale hatband but when a very smartlooking youth came up the gangplank wearing a harvard ribbon kinney hastily retired to our cabin and returned with one like it a few minutes later i found him and the young man seated in campchairs side by side engaged in a conversation in which kinney seemed to bear the greater part indeed to what kinney was saying the young man paid not the slightest attention instead his eyes were fastened on the gangplank below and when a young man of his own age accompanied by a girl in a dress of rough tweed appeared upon it he leaped from his seat then with a conscious look at kinney sank back the girl in the tweed suit was sufficiently beautiful to cause any man to rise and to remain standing she was the most beautiful girl i had ever seen she had gray eyes and hair like goldenrod worn in a fashion with which i was not familiar and her face was so lovely that in my surprise at the sight of it i felt a sudden catch at my throat and my heart stopped with awe and wonder and gratitude after a brief moment the young man in the real harvard hatband rose restlessly and with a nod to kinney went below i also rose and followed him i had an uncontrollable desire to again look at the girl with the goldenrod hair i did not mean that she should see me never before had i done such a thing but never before had i seen any one who had moved me so strangely seeking her i walked the length of the main saloon and back again but could not find her the delay gave me time to see that my conduct was impertinent the very fact that she was so lovely to look upon should have been her protection it afforded me no excuse to follow and spy upon her with this thought i hastily returned to the upper deck to bury myself in my book if it did not serve to keep my mind from the young lady at least i would prevent my eyes from causing her annoyance i was about to take the chair that the young man had left vacant when kinney objected he was very much interested in our conversation kinney said and he may return i had not noticed any eagerness on the part of the young man to talk to kinney or to listen to him but i did not sit down i should not be surprised a bit said kinney if that young man is no end of a swell he is a harvard man and his manner was most polite that explained kinney is one way you can always tell a real swell theyre not high and mighty with you their social position is so secure that they can do as they like for instance did you notice that he smoked a pipe i said i had not noticed it for his holiday kinney had purchased a box of cigars of a quality more expensive than those he can usually afford he was smoking one of them at the moment and as it grew less had been carefully moving the gold band with which it was encircled from the lighted end but as he spoke he regarded it apparently with distaste and then dropped it overboard keep my chair he said rising i am going to my cabin to get my pipe i sat down and fastened my eyes upon my book but neither did i understand what i was reading nor see the printed page instead before my eyes confusing and blinding me was the lovely radiant face of the beautiful lady in perplexity i looked up and found her standing not two feet from me something pulled me out of my chair something made me move it toward her i lifted my hat and backed away but the eyes of the lovely lady halted me to my perplexity her face expressed both surprise and pleasure it was as though either she thought she knew me or that i reminded her of some man she did know were the latter the case he must have been a friend for the way in which she looked at me was kind and there was besides the expression of surprise and as though something she saw pleased her maybe it was the quickness with which i had offered my chair still looking at me she pointed to one of the skyscrapers could you tell me she asked the name of that building had her question not proved it her voice would have told me not only that she was a stranger but that she was irish it was particularly soft low and vibrant it made the commonplace question she asked sound as though she had sung it i told her the name of the building and that farther uptown as she would see when we moved into midstream there was another still taller she listened regarding me brightly as though interested but before her i was embarrassed and fearing i intruded i again made a movement to go away with another question she stopped me i could see no reason for her doing so but it was almost as though she had asked the question only to detain me what is that odd boat she said pumping water into the river i explained that it was a fireboat testing her hoselines and then as we moved into the channel i gained courage and found myself pointing out the statue of liberty governors island and the brooklyn bridge the fact that it was a stranger who was talking did not seem to disturb her i cannot tell how she conveyed the idea but i soon felt that she felt no matter what unconventional thing she chose to do people would not be rude or misunderstand i considered telling her my name at first it seemed that that would be more polite then i saw to do so would be forcing myself upon her that she was interested in me only as a guide to new york harbor when we passed the brooklyn navy yard i talked so much and so eagerly of the battleships at anchor there that the lady must have thought i had followed the sea for she asked are you a sailorman it was the first question that was in any way personal i used to sail a catboat i said my answer seemed to puzzle her and she frowned then she laughed delightedly like one having made a discovery you dont say sailorman she said what do you ask over here when you want to know if a man is in the navy she spoke as though we were talking a different language we ask if he is in the navy i answered she laughed again at that quite as though i had said something clever and you are not no i said i am in joyce carboys office i am a stenographer again my answer seemed both to puzzle and to surprise her she regarded me doubtfully i could see that she thought for some reason i was misleading her in an office she repeated then as though she had caught me she said how do you keep so fit she asked the question directly as a man would have asked it and as she spoke i was conscious that her eyes were measuring me and my shoulders as though she were wondering to what weight i could strip its only lately ive worked in an office i said before that i always worked outofdoors oystering and clamming and in the fall scalloping and in the summer i played ball on a hotel nine i saw that to the beautiful lady my explanation carried no meaning whatsoever but before i could explain the young man with whom she had come on board walked toward us neither did he appear to find in her talking to a stranger anything embarrassing he halted and smiled his smile was pleasant but entirely vague in the few minutes i was with him i learned that it was no sign that he was secretly pleased it was merely his expression it was as though a photographer had said smile please and he had smiled when he joined us out of deference to the young lady i raised my hat but the youth did not seem to think that outward show of respect was necessary and kept his hands in his pockets neither did he cease smoking his first remark to the lovely lady somewhat startled me have you got a brass bed in your room he asked the beautiful lady said she had sove i said the young man they do you rather well dont they and its only three dollars how much is that four times three would be twelve said the lady twelve shillings the young man was smoking a cigarette in a long amber cigaretteholder i never had seen one so long he examined the end of his cigaretteholder and apparently surprised and relieved at finding a cigarette there again smiled contentedly the lovely lady pointed at the marble shaft rising above madison square that is the tallest skyscraper she said in new york i had just informed her of that fact the young man smiled as though he were being introduced to the building but exhibited no interest is it he remarked his tone seemed to show that had she said that is a rabbit he would have been equally gratified some day he stated with the same startling abruptness with which he had made his first remark our warships will lift the roofs off those skyscrapers the remark struck me in the wrong place it was unnecessary already i resented the manner of the young man toward the lovely lady it seemed to me lacking in courtesy he knew her and yet treated her with no deference while i a stranger felt so grateful to her for being what i knew one with such a face must be that i could have knelt at her feet so i rather resented the remark if the warships you send over here i said doubtfully arent more successful in lifting things than your yachts youd better keep them at home and save coal seldom have i made so long a speech or so rude a speech and as soon as i had spoken on account of the lovely lady i was sorry but after a pause of half a second she laughed delightedly i see she cried as though it were a sort of a game he means lipton we cant lift the cup we cant lift the roofs dont you see stumps she urged in spite of my rude remark the young man she called stumps had continued to smile happily now his expression changed to one of discomfort and utter gloom and then broke out into a radiant smile i say he cried thats awfully good if your warships arent any better at lifting things oh i say really he protested thats awfully good he seemed to be afraid i would not appreciate the rare excellence of my speech you know really he pleaded it is awfully good we were interrupted by the sudden appearance in opposite directions of kinney and the young man with the real hatband both were excited and disturbed at the sight of the young man stumps turned appealingly to the goldenrod girl he groaned aloud and his expression was that of a boy who had been caught playing truant oh lord he exclaimed whats he huffy about now he told me i could come on deck as soon as we started the girl turned upon me a sweet and lovely smile and nodded then with stumps at her side she moved to meet the young man when he saw them coming he halted and when they joined him began talking earnestly almost angrily as he did so much to my bewilderment he glared at me at the same moment kinney grabbed me by the arm come below he commanded his tone was hoarse and thrilling with excitement our adventures he whispered have begun ii i felt for me adventures had already begun for my meeting with the beautiful lady was the event of my life and though kinney and i had agreed to share our adventures of this one i knew i could not even speak to him i wanted to be alone where i could delight in it where i could go over what she had said what i had said i would share it with no one it was too wonderful too sacred but kinney would not be denied he led me to our cabin and locked the door i am sorry he began but this adventure is one i cannot share with you the remark was so in keeping with my own thoughts that with sudden unhappy doubt i wondered if kinney too had felt the charm of the beautiful lady but he quickly undeceived me i have been doing a little detective work he said his voice was low and sepulchral and i have come upon a real adventure there are reasons why i cannot share it with you but as it develops you can follow it about half an hour ago he explained i came here to get my pipe the window was open the lattice was only partly closed outside was that young man from harvard who tried to make my acquaintance and the young englishman who came on board with that blonde kinney suddenly interrupted himself you were talking to her just now he said i hated to hear him speak of the irish lady as that blonde i hated to hear him speak of her at all so to shut him off i answered briefly she asked me about the singer building i see said kinney well these two men were just outside my window and while i was searching for my pipe i heard the american speaking he was very excited and angry i tell you he said every boat and railroad station is watched you wont be safe till we get away from new york you must go to your cabin and stay there and the other one answered i am sick of hiding and dodging kinney paused dramatically and frowned well i asked what of it what of it he cried he exclaimed aloud with pity and impatience no wonder he cried you never have adventures why its plain as print they are criminals escaping the englishman certainly is escaping i was concerned only for the lovely lady but i asked you mean the irishman called stumps stumps exclaimed kinney what a strange name too strange to be true its an alias i was incensed that kinney should charge the friends of the lovely lady with being criminals had it been any one else i would have at once resented it but to be angry with kinney is difficult i could not help but remember that he is the slave of his own imagination it plays tricks and runs away with him and if it leads him to believe innocent people are criminals it also leads him to believe that every woman in the subway to whom he gives his seat is a great lady a leader of society on her way to work in the slums joe i protested those men arent criminals i talked to that irishman and he hasnt sense enough to be a criminal the railroads are watched repeated kinney do honest men care a darn whether the railroad is watched or not do you care do i care and did you notice how angry the american got when he found stumps talking with you i had noticed it and i also recalled the fact that stumps had said to the lovely lady he told me i could come on deck as soon as we started the words seemed to bear out what kinney claimed he had overheard but not wishing to encourage him of what i had heard i said nothing he may be dodging a summons i suggested he is wanted probably only as a witness it might be a civil suit or his chauffeur may have hit somebody kinney shook his head sadly excuse me he said but i fear you lack imagination those men are rascals dangerous rascals and the woman is their accomplice what they have done i dont know but i have already learned enough to arrest them as suspicious characters listen each of them has a separate stateroom forward the window of the americans room was open and his suitcase was on the bed on it were the initials h p a the stateroom is number twentyfour but when i examined the pursers list pretending i wished to find out if a friend of mine was on board i found that the man in twentyfour had given his name as james preston now he demanded why should one of them hide under an alias and the other be afraid to show himself until we leave the wharf he did not wait for my answer i have been talking to mr h p a alias preston he continued i pretended i was a person of some importance i hinted i was rich my object kinney added hastily was to encourage him to try some of his tricks on me to try to rob me so that i could obtain evidence i also he went on with some embarrassment told him that you too were wealthy and of some importance i thought of the lovely lady and i felt myself blushing indignantly you did very wrong i cried you had no right you may involve us both most unpleasantly you are not involved in any way protested kinney as soon as we reach new bedford you can slip on shore and wait for me at the hotel when ive finished with these gentlemen ill join you finished with them i exclaimed what do you mean to do to them arrest them cried kinney sternly as soon as they step upon the wharf you cant do it i gasped i have done it answered kinney its good as done i have notified the chief of police at new bedford he declared proudly to meet me at the wharf i used the wireless here is my message from his pocket he produced a paper and with great importance read aloud meet me at wharf on arrival steamer patience two wellknown criminals on board escaping new york police will personally lay charges against them forbes kinney as soon as i could recover from my surprise i made violent protest i pointed out to kinney that his conduct was outrageous that in making such serious charges on such evidence he would lay himself open to punishment he was not in the least dismayed i take it then he said importantly that you do not wish to appear against them i dont wish to appear in it at all i cried youve no right to annoy that young lady you must wire the police you are mistaken i have no desire to arrest the woman said kinney stiffly in my message i did not mention her if you want an adventure of your own you might help her to escape while i arrest her accomplices i object i cried to your applying the word accomplice to that young lady and suppose they are criminals i demanded how will arresting them help you kinneys eyes flashed with excitement think of the newspapers he cried theyll be full of it already in imagination he saw the headlines a clever haul he quoted noted band of crooks elude new york police but are captured by forbes kinney he sighed contentedly and theyll probably print my picture too he added i knew i should be angry with him but instead i could only feel sorry i have known kinney for a year and i have learned that his makebelieve is always innocent i suppose that he is what is called a snob but with him snobbishness is not an unpleasant weakness in his case it takes the form of thinking that people who have certain things he does not possess are better than himself and that therefore they must be worth knowing and he tries to make their acquaintance but he does not think that he himself is better than any one his life is very bare and narrow in consequence on many things he places false values as for example his desire to see his name in the newspapers even as an amateur detective so while i was indignant i also was sorry joe i said youre going to get yourself into an awful lot of trouble and though i am not in this adventure you know if i can help you i will he thanked me and we went to the diningsaloon there at a table near ours we saw the lovely lady and stumps and the american she again smiled at me but this time so it seemed a little doubtfully in the mind of the american on the contrary there was no doubt he glared both at kinney and myself as though he would like to boil us in oil after dinner in spite of my protests kinney set forth to interview him and as he described it to lead him on to commit himself i feared kinney was much more likely to commit himself than the other and when i saw them seated together i watched from a distance with much anxiety an hour later while i was alone a steward told me the purser would like to see me i went to his office and found gathered there stumps his american friend the night watchman of the boat and the purser as though inviting him to speak the purser nodded to the american that gentleman addressed me in an excited and belligerent manner my name is aldrich he said i want to know what your name is i did not quite like his tone nor did i like being summoned to the pursers office to be questioned by a stranger why i asked because said aldrich it seems you have several names as one of them belongs to this gentleman he pointed at stumps he wants to know why you are using it i looked at stumps and he greeted me with the vague and genial smile that was habitual to him but on being caught in the act by aldrich he hurriedly frowned i have never used any name but my own i said and i added pleasantly if i were choosing a name i wouldnt choose stumps aldrich fairly gasped his name is not stumps he cried indignantly he is the earl of ivy he evidently expected me to be surprised at this and i was surprised i stared at the muchadvertised young irishman with interest aldrich misunderstood my silence and in a triumphant tone which was far from pleasant continued so you see he sneered when you chose to pass yourself off as ivy you should have picked out another boat the thing was too absurd for me to be angry and i demanded with patience but why should i pass myself off as lord ivy thats what we intend to find out snapped aldrich anyway weve stopped your game for tonight and tomorrow you can explain to the police your pal he taunted has told every one on this boat that you are lord ivy and hes told me lies enough about himself to prove hes an impostor too i saw what had happened and that if i were to protect poor kinney i must not as i felt inclined use my fists but my head i laughed with apparent unconcern and turned to the purser oh thats it is it i cried i might have known it was kinney hes always playing practical jokes on me i turned to aldrich my friend has been playing a joke on you too i said he didnt know who you were but he saw you were an anglomaniac and hes been having fun with you has he roared aldrich he reached down into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper this he cried shaking it at me is a copy of a wireless that ive just sent to the chief of police at new bedford with great satisfaction he read it in a loud and threatening voice two impostors on this boat representing themselves to be lord ivy my future brotherinlaw and his secretary lord ivy himself on board send police to meet boat we will make charges henry philip aldrich it occurred to me that after receiving two such sensational telegrams and getting out of bed to meet the boat at six in the morning the chief of police would be in a state of mind to arrest almost anybody and that his choice would certainly fall on kinney and myself it was ridiculous but it also was likely to prove extremely humiliating so i said speaking to lord ivy theres been a mistake all around send for mr kinney and i will explain it to you lord ivy who was looking extremely bored smiled and nodded but young aldrich laughed ironically mr kinney is in his stateroom he said with a steward guarding the door and window you can explain tomorrow to the police i rounded indignantly upon the purser are you keeping mr kinney a prisoner in his stateroom i demanded if you are he doesnt have to stay there protested the purser sulkily when he found the stewards were following him he went to his cabin i will see him at once i said and if i catch any of your stewards following me ill drop them overboard no one tried to stop me indeed knowing i could not escape they seemed pleased at my departure and i went to my cabin kinney seated on the edge of the berth greeted me with a hollow groan his expression was one of utter misery as though begging me not to be angry he threw out his arms appealingly how the devil he began was i to know that a little redheaded shrimp like that was the earl of ivy and that that tall blonde girl he added indignantly that i thought was an accomplice is lady moya his sister what happened i asked kinney was wearing his hat he took it off and hurled it to the floor it was that damned hat he cried its a harvard ribbon all right but only men on the crew can wear it how was i to know that i saw aldrich looking at it in a puzzled way and when he said i see you are on the crew i guessed what it meant and said i was on last years crew unfortunately he was on last years crew thats what made him suspect me and after dinner he put me through a third degree i must have given the wrong answers for suddenly he jumped up and called me a swindler and an impostor i got back by telling him he was a crook and that i was a detective and that i had sent a wireless to have him arrested at new bedford he challenged me to prove i was a detective and of course i couldnt and he called up two stewards and told them to watch me while he went after the purser i didnt fancy being watched so i came here when did you tell him i was the earl of ivy kinney ran his fingers through his hair and groaned dismally that was before the boat started he said it was only a joke he didnt seem to be interested in my conversation so i thought id liven it up a bit by saying i was a friend of lord ivys and you happened to pass and i happened to remember mrs shaw saying you looked like a british peer so i said that is my friend lord ivy i said i was your secretary and he seemed greatly interested and kinney added dismally i talked too much i am so sorry he begged its going to be awful for you his eyes suddenly lit with hope unless he whispered we can escape the same thought was in my mind but the idea was absurd and impracticable i knew there was no escape i knew we were sentenced at sunrise to a most humiliating and disgraceful experience the newspapers would regard anything that concerned lord ivy as news in my turn i also saw the hideous headlines what would my father and mother at fairport think what would my old friends there think and what was of even greater importance how would joyce carboy act what chance was there left me after i had been arrested as an impostor to become a stenographer in the law courts in time a member of the bar but i found that what for the moment distressed me most was that the lovely lady would consider me a knave or a fool the thought made me exclaim with exasperation had it been possible to abandon kinney i would have dropped overboard and made for shore the night was warm and foggy and the short journey to land to one who had been brought up like a duck meant nothing more than a wetting but i did not see how i could desert kinney can you swim i asked of course not he answered gloomily and besides he added our names are on our suitcases we couldnt take them with us and theyd find out who we are if we could only steal a boat he exclaimed eagerly one of those on the davits he urged we could put our suitcases in it and then after every one is asleep we could lower it into the water the smallest boat on board was certified to hold twentyfive persons and without waking the entire ships company we could as easily have moved the chartroom this i pointed out dont make objections kinney cried petulantly he was rapidly recovering his spirits the imminence of danger seemed to inspire him think he commanded think of some way by which we can get off this boat before she reaches new bedford we must we must not be arrested it would be too awful he interrupted himself with an excited exclamation i have it he whispered hoarsely i will ring in the firealarm the crew will run to quarters the boats will be lowered we will cut one of them adrift in the confusion what was to happen in the confusion that his imagination had conjured up i was not to know for what actually happened was so confused that of nothing am i quite certain first from the water of the sound that was lapping pleasantly against the side i heard the voice of a man raised in terror then came a rush of feet oaths and yells then a shock that threw us to our knees and a crunching ripping and tearing roar like that made by the roof of a burning building when it plunges to the cellar and the next instant a large bowsprit entered our cabin window there was left me just space enough to wrench the door open and grabbing kinney who was still on his knees i dragged him into the alleyway he scrambled upright and clasped his hands to his head wheres my hat he cried i could hear the water pouring into the lower deck and sweeping the freight and trunks before it a horse in a box stall was squealing like a human being and many human beings were screaming and shrieking like animals my first intelligent thought was of the lovely lady i shook kinney by the arm the uproar was so great that to make him hear i was forced to shout where is lord ivys cabin i cried you said its next to his sisters take me there kinney nodded and ran down the corridor and into an alleyway on which opened three cabins the doors were ajar and as i looked into each i saw that the beds had not been touched and that the cabins were empty i knew then that she was still on deck i felt that i must find her we ran toward the companionway women and children first kinney was yelling women and children first as we raced down the slanting floor of the saloon he kept repeating this mechanically at that moment the electric lights went out and except for the oil lamps the ship was in darkness many of the passengers had already gone to bed these now burst from the staterooms in strange garments carrying lifepreservers handbags their arms full of clothing one man in one hand clutched a sponge in the other an umbrella with this he beat at those who blocked his flight he hit a woman over the head and i hit him and he went down finding himself on his knees be began to pray volubly when we reached the upper deck we pushed out of the crush at the gangway and to keep our footing for there was a strong list to port clung to the big flagstaff at the stern at each rail the crew were swinging the boats over the side and around each boat was a crazy fighting mob above our starboard rail towered the foremast of a schooner she had rammed us fair amidships and in her bows was a hole through which you could have rowed a boat into this the water was rushing and sucking her down she was already settling at the stern by the light of a swinging lantern i saw three of her crew lift a yawl from her deck and lower it into the water into it they hurled oars and a sail and one of them had already started to slide down the painter when the schooner lurched drunkenly and in a panic all three of the men ran forward and leaped to our lower deck the yawl abandoned swung idly between the patience and the schooner kinney seeing what i saw grabbed me by the arm there he whispered pointing theres our chance i saw that with safety the yawl could hold a third person and as to who the third passenger would be i had already made up my mind wait here i said on the patience there were many immigrants only that afternoon released from ellis island they had swarmed into the lifeboats even before they were swung clear and when the ships officers drove them off the poor souls not being able to understand believed they were being sacrificed for the safety of the other passengers so each was fighting as he thought for his life and for the lives of his wife and children at the edge of the scrimmage i dragged out two women who had been knocked off their feet and who were in danger of being trampled but neither was the woman i sought in the halfdarkness i saw one of the immigrants a girl with a kerchief on her head struggling with her lifebelt a stoker as he raced past seized it and made for the rail in my turn i took it from him and he fought for it shouting its every man for himself now all right i said for i was excited and angry look out for yourself then i hit him on the chin and he let go of the lifebelt and dropped i heard at my elbow a low excited laugh and a voice said well bowled you never learned that in an office i turned and saw the lovely lady i tossed the immigrant girl her lifebelt and as though i had known lady moya all my life i took her by the hand and dragged her after me down the deck you come with me i commanded i found that i was trembling and that a weight of anxiety of which i had not been conscious had been lifted i found i was still holding her hand and pressing it in my own thank god i said i thought i had lost you lost me repeated lady moya but she made no comment i must find my brother she said you must come with me i ordered go with mr kinney to the lower deck i will bring that rowboat under the stern you will jump into it i cannot leave my brother said lady moya upon the word as though shot from a cannon the human whirlpool that was sweeping the deck amidships cast out stumps and hurled him toward us his sister gave a little cry of relief stumps recovered his balance and shook himself like a dog that has been in the water thought id never get out of it alive he remarked complacently in the darkness i could not see his face but i was sure he was still vaguely smiling worse than a football night he exclaimed worse than mafeking night his sister pointed to the yawl this gentleman is going to bring that boat here and take us away in it she told him we had better go when we can right ho assented stumps cheerfully how about phil hes just behind me as he spoke only a few yards from us a peevish voice pierced the tumult i tell you it cried you must find lord ivy if lord ivy a voice with a strong and brutal american accent yelled in answer to hell with lord ivy lady moya chuckled get to the lower deck i commanded i am going for the yawl as i slipped my leg over the rail i heard lord ivy say ill find phil and meet you i dropped and caught the rail of the deck below and hanging from it shoved with my knees and fell into the water two strokes brought me to the yawl and scrambling into her and casting her off i paddled back to the steamer as i lay under the stern i heard from the lower deck the voice of kinney raised importantly ladies first he cried her ladyship first i mean he corrected even on leaving what he believed to be a sinking ship kinney could not forget his manners but mr aldrich had evidently forgotten his i heard him shout indignantly ill be damned if i do the voice of lady moya laughed youll be drowned if you dont she answered i saw a black shadow poised upon the rail steady below there her voice called and the next moment as lightly as a squirrel she dropped to the thwart and stumbled into my arms the voice of aldrich was again raised in anger id rather drown he cried lord ivy responded with unexpected spirit well then drown the water is warm and its a pleasing death at that with a bump he fell in a heap at my feet easy kinney i shouted dont swamp us ill be careful he called and the next instant hit my shoulders and i shook him off on top of lord ivy get off my head shouted his lordship kinney apologized to every one profusely lady moya raised her voice for the last time phil she called are you coming or are you not not with those swindlers im not he shouted i think you two are mad i prefer to drown there was an uncomfortable silence my position was a difficult one and not knowing what to say i said nothing if one must drown exclaimed lady moya briskly i cant see it matters who one drowns with in his strangely explosive manner lord ivy shouted suddenly phil youre a silly ass push off commanded lady moya i think from her tone the order was given more for the benefit of aldrich than for myself certainly it was effective for on the instant there was a heavy splash lord ivy sniffed scornfully and manifested no interest ah he exclaimed he prefers to drown sputtering and gasping aldrich rose out of the water and while we balanced the boat climbed over the side understand he cried even while he was still gasping i am here under protest i am here to protect you and stumps i am under obligation to no one im can you row i asked why dont you ask your pal he demanded savagely he rowed on last years crew phil cried lady moya her voice suggested a temper i had not suspected you will row or you can get out and walk take the oars she commanded and be civil lady moya with the tiller in her hand sat in the stern stumps with kinney huddled at his knees was stowed away forward i took the stroke and aldrich the bow oars we will make for the connecticut shore i said and pulled from under the stern of the patience in a few minutes we had lost all sight and except for her whistle all sound of her and we ourselves were lost in the fog there was another eloquent and embarrassing silence unless in the panic they trampled upon each other i had no real fear for the safety of those on board the steamer before we had abandoned her i had heard the wireless frantically sputtering the standby call and i was certain that already the big boats of the fall river providence and joy lines and launches from every wireless station between bridgeport and newport were making toward her but the margin of safety which to my thinking was broad enough for all the other passengers for the lovely lady was in no way sufficient that mobswept deck was no place for her i was happy that on her account i had not waited for a possible rescue in the yawl she was safe the water was smooth and the connecticut shore was i judged not more than three miles distant in an hour unless the fog confused us i felt sure the lovely lady would again walk safely upon dry land selfishly on kinneys account and my own i was delighted to find myself free of the steamer and from any chance of her landing us where police waited with open arms the avenging angel in the person of aldrich was still near us so near that i could hear the water dripping from his clothes but his power to harm was gone i was congratulating myself on this when suddenly he undeceived me apparently he had been considering his position toward kinney and myself and having arrived at a conclusion was anxious to announce it i wish to repeat he exclaimed suddenly that im under obligations to nobody just because my friends he went on defiantly choose to trust themselves with persons who ought to be in jail i cant desert them its all the more reason why i shouldnt desert them thats why im here and i want it understood as soon as i get on shore im going to a police station and have those persons arrested rising out of the fog that had rendered each of us invisible to the other his words sounded fantastic and unreal in the dripping silence broken only by hoarse warnings that came from no direction and within the mind of each the conviction that we were lost police stations did not immediately concern us so no one spoke and in the fog the words died away and were drowned but i was glad he had spoken at least i was forewarned i now knew that i had not escaped that kinney and i were still in danger i determined that so far as it lay with me our yawl would be beached at that point on the coast of connecticut farthest removed not only from police stations but from all human habitation as soon as we were out of hearing of the patience and her whistle we completely lost our bearings it may be that lady moya was not a skilled coxswain or it may be that aldrich understands a racing scull better than a yawl and pulled too heavily on his right but whatever the cause we soon were hopelessly lost in this predicament we were not alone the night was filled with foghorns whistles bells and the throb of engines but we never were near enough to hail the vessels from which the sounds came and when we rowed toward them they invariably sank into silence after two hours stumps and kinney insisted on taking a turn at the oars and lady moya moved to the bow we gave her our coats and making cushions of these she announced that she was going to sleep whether she slept or not i do not know but she remained silent for three more dreary hours we took turns at the oars or dozed at the bottom of the boat while we continued aimlessly to drift upon the face of the waters it was now five oclock and the fog had so far lightened that we could see each other and a stretch of open water at intervals the foghorns of vessels passing us but hidden from us tormented aldrich to a state of extreme exasperation he hailed them with frantic shrieks and shouts and stumps and the lady moya shouted with him i fear kinney and myself did not contribute any great volume of sound to the general chorus to be rescued was the last thing we desired the yacht or tug that would receive us on board would also put us on shore where the vindictive aldrich would have us at his mercy we preferred the freedom of our yawl and the shelter of the fog our silence was not lost upon aldrich for some time he had been crouching in the bow whispering indignantly to lady moya now he exclaimed aloud what did i tell you he cried contemptuously they got away in this boat because they were afraid of me not because they were afraid of being drowned if theyve nothing to be afraid of why are they so anxious to keep us drifting around all night in this fog why dont they help us stop one of those tugs lord ivy exploded suddenly rot he exclaimed if theyre afraid of you why did they ask you to go with them they didnt cried aldrich truthfully and triumphantly they kidnapped you and moya because they thought they could square themselves with you but they didnt want me the issue had been fairly stated and no longer with selfrespect could i remain silent we dont want you now i said cant you understand i went on with as much selfrestraint as i could muster we are willing and anxious to explain ourselves to lord ivy or even to you but we dont want to explain to the police my friend thought you and lord ivy were crooks escaping you think we are crooks escaping you both aldrich snorted contemptuously thats a likely story he cried no wonder you dont want to tell that to the police from the bow came an exclamation and lady moya rose to her feet phil she said you bore me she picked her way across the thwart to where kinney sat at the stroke oar my brother and i often row together she said i will take your place when she had seated herself we were so near that her eyes looked directly into mine drawing in the oars she leaned upon them and smiled now then she commanded tell us all about it before i could speak there came from behind her a sudden radiance and as though a curtain had been snatched aside the fog flew apart and the sun dripping crimson and gorgeous sprang from the waters from the others there was a cry of wonder and delight and from lord ivy a shriek of incredulous laughter lady moya clapped her hands joyfully and pointed past me i turned and looked directly behind me not fifty feet from us was a shelving beach and a stone wharf and above it a vinecovered cottage from the chimney of which smoke curled cheerily had the yawl while lady moya was taking the oars not swung in a circle and had the sun not risen in three minutes more we would have bumped ourselves into the state of connecticut the cottage stood on one horn of a tiny harbor beyond it weatherbeaten shingled houses saillofts and wharfs stretched cosily in a halfcircle back of them rose splendid elms and the delicate spire of a church and from the unruffled surface of the harbor the masts of many fishingboats across the water on a grassgrown point a whitewashed lighthouse blushed in the crimson glory of the sun except for an oysterman in his boat at the end of the wharf and the smoke from the chimney of his cottage the little village slept the harbor slept it was a picture of perfect content confidence and peace oh cried the lady moya how pretty how pretty lord ivy swung the bow about and raced toward the wharf the others stood up and cheered hysterically at the sound and at the sight of us emerging so mysteriously from the fog the man in the fishingboat raised himself to his full height and stared as incredulously as though he beheld a mermaid he was an old man but straight and tall and the oystermans boots stretching to his hips made him appear even taller than he was he had a bristling white beard and his face was tanned to a fierce copper color but his eyes were blue and young and gentle they lit suddenly with excitement and sympathy are you from the patience he shouted in chorus we answered that we were and ivy pulled the yawl alongside the fishermans boat but already the old man had turned and making a megaphone of his hands was shouting to the cottage mother he cried mother here are folks from the wreck get coffee and blankets and and bacon and eggs may the lord bless him exclaimed the lady moya devoutly but aldrich excited and eager pulled out a roll of bills and shook them at the man do you want to earn ten dollars he demanded then chase yourself to the village and bring the constable lady moya exclaimed bitterly lord ivy swore kinney in despair uttered a dismal howl and dropped his head in his hands its no use mr aldrich i said seated in the stern the others had hidden me from the fisherman now i stood up and he saw me i laid one hand on his and pointed to the tin badge on his suspender he is the village constable himself i explained i turned to the lovely lady lady moya i said i want to introduce you to my father i pointed to the vinecovered cottage thats my home i said i pointed to the sleeping town that i told her is the village of fairport most of it belongs to father you are all very welcome
