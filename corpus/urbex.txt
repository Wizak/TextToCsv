urbex edgar million the door slams hard on one of the lower levels of the block and i can make out heavy footsteps in the gloomy dusty hallways below i shouldnt be here not allowed but i mean who the hell is that i thought i locked up i edge along the green vinyl flooring tiles browned and peeling at the edges dirty oily grime in the gaps composed of dirt and spit and blood years of neglect congealed and prising back the floors and walls i creep along like a cornered rodent praying my trainers dont betray me with a rubbery highpitched squeak i need to escape from my location on the second floor i judge that if the footsteps make their way out onto either the ground floor of the hospital or the first i can creep past and make it out unnoticed nothing to worry about my escape route is clear been here before i tell myself keep it steady its just some caretakers overzealous sunday afternoon checkup nothing to see here move along please i listen to the thump thump thump of slow steady footsteps until they stop abruptly replaced by a dragging sound and clanging doors then restart closer on a higher floor in the derelict building where i stand i was never a bad boy what was i thinking of the shame of being caught like this i could lose my job or anything i could i suppose go to prison even quiet rebellion was always my limit before all this snidey comments and occasional sarcasm my memory of childhood is tinged with the fear authority figures might suddenly tick me off i tended to keep my head down in my notebooks and adventure novels sketching beautiful coloured illustrations of enid blyton characters camped out beneath castles or tolkien characters in fantastic magical peril my style was technical and probably a little dull but i was a creative dynamo in my own way producing a ton of detailed illustrations damn it theyre coming up the stairs what idiot would be here on a sunday afternoon i mean aside from me and i dont count do i im not even meant to be here padding silently down the hall i hold close to the walls losing myself in the shadows seeking hiding places beneath broken beds and hospital furniture shattered and rusting a twisted memory of the asylum which had once occupied this space no cosy dvdinyourbedroom mental care unit this place no day release care in the community pleasantries or pretty little smartie happy pills but a proper bedlamstyle paupers asylum the pain and longing and suffering once experienced in this space is tangible and draws me back again and again i hear screams and moans in my imagination when i photography the empty spaces where men and women judged to be mad had once stood in my mind i see cowed beaten inmates scamper and scream in the distant shadows crouched low fingers dragging along the wall i hear the creak of leather restraints and cries of muffled pain when i first discovered urbex urban exploration it was thrilling dangerous well outside the bounds of what i considered acceptable behaviour and quickly became a compulsion for me my latest obsession my wife maddy called it it was more than that though it has become who i am an artist a creator it has echoes of the young man i used to be before career became the badge of me the identifier of who i am back before i went sloping off to uni a young man who after lengthy discussions and debates with mum and dad opted to do business studies at northumbria university instead of art regrets i have loads and that is the biggest there is a shallow groove etched into the wall a smooth channel running the length of the hall all these halls and i have been told this groove this absence was made by the fingers of the patients marching in an endless pageant up and down round and round each with a single finger on the wall gradually wearing it away a smooth channel of madness or what they called madness not so clear these days noones mad now were all broken or unwell many of the residents would have been female ordinary women broken by the strains and pressure of life menstrual pain post natal depression or even good old fashioned nymphomania the definition of which had a far broader spectrum for diagnosis than in modern medicine any woman with sexual desire of any kind could be at risk now i am the one trapped here by my obsessions my heart beats frantically closer to mouseheart than human and this cardiac drumblast of fear fills my head as i reach the end of the corridor and peek my fearful mouse nose round the corner im crouched low peering hard through the bent shattered remnants of an abandoned asylum bed the smell of latex mattress and disinfectant clogging my nostrils as a blackhooded figure emerges not hooded like death more like some lanky council estate teenager but with the confident bearing of a strong powerful man i remain low my mousy posture unaltered and i wonder how on earth i find myself in this bind how did i get here back in my creative days id been considering doing art fine art or possibly something more practical like graphic design as id been a fairly talented scribe but it seemed that many years of parental encouragement of my artistic endeavours wasnt about to extend to my grownup life and if i wanted any support through the uni years it was time to put those childish creative things away for good eventually i became a professional bureaucrat in a small central government department which wasnt really the travesty i had feared slightly unsatisfying and insubstantial creatively yes but straightforward and uncomplicated particularly once i discovered the aphrodisiac quality of a good living wage and found previously outofmyleague girls were mysteriously interested in me my car and my apartment flat in hammersmith so i forgot all about the arty stuff the imaginative life which existed from then on only as doodles on my red n black notebooks and which didnt begin to resurface until i began taking my own kids to galleries to give them a bit of culture in the same way my mum used to with me just another small cog in the joinerfamily cycle of artistic delusion until one day i would be there to disavow them of the foolishness of the artistic life come on be realistic son time to get a proper job now the creative life has led me astray now though my mum was quite arty herself an endless series of eveningclasses at the local school churning out bogstandard water colours or misshapenpottery and for the last five years handmade humorous decoupage greetings cards formed the core of her journey mum signed up for a term of lifedrawing lessons once and they had this overweight bankclerk turn to model but she got embarrassed and wouldnt take her clothes off so they found some sort of pink body sock for her to wear instead as i recall my mum seemed quite relieved probably more terrified than the model at the thought of so much bare flesh yet mums charcoal and chalk scribbles had a quiet beauty a poor fat bank administrator staring with deep sadness into the middledistance wishing she could have been brave the hooded figure at the end of the hall is tall six foot plus maybe as tall as me even which few people are although i feel tiny now i cant see a face beneath the dark green cloth of the hood and he throws a large heavy sack down on the floor slips back through the doors then reemerges with a rucksack the bag on the floor seems to be shifting alive some kind of being inside an animal possibly odd odd what a woefully inadequate word for my situation but i find i cant put into words how alarmed i am at the twitches and jerks twisting the textured nylon bag the man stooping grabs hold of it shakes then kicks it viciously groaning as he strains to pull it along the chequered floor towards me forcing the decision upon me hide and hide quickly absent myself quick in one of the abandoned treatment rooms or cells urbex wasnt the thing which reawakened the artistic bug the real trigger clicked about a yearandhalf ago on my fortieth when maddy bought me a decent camera to the replace my old pointandshoot which one of the boys had dropped into the bath ostensibly for shooting pretty portraits of the kids and sunsets closeups of flowers the detailed texturing of nature the usual nice stuff the rubbish everyone shoots with varying degrees of banal success or failure but with this new model easier to shoot successfully than with the old one i checked on flickr this morning and there are over million photos of flowers million sunsets and billion images of cats and kittens something like that anyway the vast majority of these look almost exactly identical to everyone elses attempt at the same subject not too many budding ansel adams or cindy shermans on there some are fantastic but theres a lot of dross so many people trying to define and describe their world badly sure but still trying i cant make out whether its amazing or amazingly sad this was what i sought to do though to join this community i began to document my own existence with careful precision i discovered crazy abstract textures when zooming at high magnification into a rusty screw which had i found on the path leading up to my lime green front door which itself made a loving backdrop for my wife staring accusingly into my camera lens i snapped sunsets galore including a scottish loch aflame with colour and east london terraced houses lined up in the midst of a nuclear explosion my contribution to the billions sunsets online i shot and i shot beginning to accept that what i was creating was art no art that would get me nominated for the turner prize nothing to bring shame upon my clan no pictures of my bed dirty with a list of my secret nonexistent i might add lovers there are only clean beds in my house crisp laundered sheets changed often and absolutely no mistresses we kissed with dry lips like in that blur song and discovered although it wasnt everything it wasnt nothing and the photographs were pretty good as far as that sort of thing went better than most if i say so myself i discovered i possessed the beginnings of actual talent for photography a decent eye for composition took me a while to consider that what i was creating was art not the done thing for a man in workingclass mile end to be creating art often i drew stares from strangers certain i must be a lunatic or a paedophile or a terrorist as sullenfaced police support officers regularly cornered me wanting an explanation as to why i was photographing some railings or a wall as if by paying the world so much attention i must surely be planning to do it some harm now the one at risk of harm is me why is that man here and what is in the bag i quietly try the handle of the nearest cell but for the first time since i started visiting the site i find a door which wont budge its jammed shut a locked door no need in the decadesempty ward but despite this it remains obstinately resistant to my escape attempt who has locked it when this was a working asylum all these doors would have been sealed many inmates were detained for years without reprieve although i was intrigued to discover recorded cases where patients gained their freedom by escaping and spending fourteen days free from capture these days the only security in place is to stop vandals and vagrants breaking in no need to lock the doors inside but still the man lumbers dangerously backwards towards my location slowed by the weight of his bundle i try another door again locked and another and another finding them all jammed this is new if all the doors are locked im stuffed the guys going to find me i feel like a teenager whos vandalised a bus shelter and is running from the police frantically trying to escape my own foolishness his progress is as slow as the shadow on a sundial but without an open door the shadow will eventually crush me i could try to hide crouched on the floor behind one of the old plastic mattresses but i reject this as too exposed too risky and try more doors before finally looking over my shoulder i find unlocked the last room i want to be in right now but it is the only way my only choice the handle turns and reveals a dark broad space and i tell myself this ghastly chamber of all rooms is my only option i step silently through the darkened frame and survey the space for a place to hide before remembering the observation cubicle wedged into the rear of the theatre and i secrete myself behind the grimy battered wall and grayed oneway glass i crouch in silence in the shadows listening to him enter the sound of dragging treacherous in the darkness the click of the closing door is like a gun hammer pulled into place ready for the shot then the figure begins moving with stealth about the room this goes on for an age as my eyes adjust to my surroundings surroundings which in happier circumstances i have visited many times i arch myself to peer through the glass watch what hes doing praying im not met with eyes staring back at me through the reflective glass back in the day theyd have used this as their main treatment space for general medical examinations operations and experimental psychiatric treatments hydrotherapy electricshocks lobotomization all the really good stuff much of the machinery of the treatments still decorate the room including an ages past defunct electroshock machine a massive cabinet full of broken glass medicine jars and what i suspect is a lobotomy kit all sorts of rigid clamps and lethal looking spikes the centrepiece of the operation theatre is a large leather covered oak table with straps dangling in readiness down the sides lit only by a single grimecovered skylight high in the ceiling how on earth did i end up here how i wish heartily that i was still that other man naively snapping sunsets for strangers to like i had began uploading my shots onto flickr and with minimal effort on my part people began commenting on them nothing too in depth but people seemed to like what i did leaving uncomplicated praise wow nice cool thats great excellent i loved my art gallery on the web and the feedback was addictive provided me with renewed purpose and made me want to shoot more and more i even sold a couple of prints and was paid cash for a closeup shot of some garlic for use in a cookbook published in the states fifty quid and a copy of the book to sit proudly on the bookshelf through this outlet my whole perspective shifted i wanted to challenge myself to explore the world and myself now here in front of me was the world brutal and real i peered nervously through the darkened glass terrified at what i might see how did i get to this place there is a photograph i took of a girl a young woman in a nurses uniform a bit too skimpy ripped and covered in dirt carrying a large blood stained axe and looking menacing ive got a couple of flashes set up strategically which fire as she makes her way down the hallway of the asylum stumbling over broken furniture as she edges towards me kicking a porcelain doll out of her path as she stumbles whose head shatters as it crashes into a wheelchair as she menacingly walks blankeyed towards me you cracked the dolls head already i said to my pretend nurse with a smile whoops sorry she grins though a makeup ravaged face did it look good though i was really into it i could see very menacing much better than i could do when im on my own really dramatic id met anna online playing call of duty and really hit it off twentyone years my junior and up for anything even that probably but since i didnt want to be that sort of a man i had decided this was one narrative which was not going to unfold we stood alone in the princes bridge asylum for the mentally unsound in the middle of my canvas closed and sold onto developers in the midnineties who went bust in the recession i was free to play most weekends the building continued to sit there glowering at the neighbourhood darkly growing an increasing number of broken windows over the years as a tangle of weeds obscured the old concrete pathways a jungle of grasses and bushes usurping the once tailored lawn now i brought it to life again id been taking shots from outside this building for an age when i came across urban exploration sites at first i took this to mean the thing id started doing already wondering around industrial areas and photographing the buildings and the objects i found but i soon realised from the discussions in the groups that urbex was something else again photographing not just the easy to find and the accessible but the underground the unseen world which lingers in the city my goal was to create a portrait of decaying industrial london one of many but only ever portrayed from the outside of these crumbling structures show me a keep out sign and i would indeed keep out it never occurred to me not to it turned out these guys were actually breaking into or finding ways into the abandoned buildings warehouses hospitals factories anything if a building had been abandoned long enough they went for it recording long unseen worlds some of their photographs were stunning a glimmer of light cutting through the broken ceiling of an old print mill a decrepit rotting bed in the great london epileptic colony corridors strewn with the detritus of lives lived in pain or joy buildings soak it up i think the lives lived there in the walls and the rotted floorboards and these shots capture this we must document these worlds i think before its gone before we forget to remember that sunset i used to shoot beautiful as it is has nothing to do with us and will be there either way burning brilliantly beautifully without giving us a moments consideration but what we do to each other to the cities and buildings where we work and live is all that we have so i began skipping passed the no entry signs eagleeyed for bored middleaged security guards and rampaging halfstarved rottweilers to seek out the unseen world the nooks and crannies hidden from view the beauty in the darkness of the halflight now i know there are monsters in the darkness the man has changed his attire no hoodie now white doctor robes a green surgical mask and hat and rubber gloves stretched tightly over long bony fingers artistic fingers anna would have probably said jeez what the hell for a brief moment i view a familiar scene a surgeon standing in silent readiness but the setting is all wrong a decaying long abandoned operating theatre coated in plastic sheeting of the kind my decorators use joined together with masking tape to prevent any mess any leakage or spillage despoiling the already filthy floor he looks over at the glass watching his reflection and i wonder momentarily if he knows im here but no he appears to be admiring himself in the glass on the operating table in front of him a fat naked figure squirms bound tight by dark leather straps gaffer tape stifling muffled cries ive seen this so many times i have read this moment and seen this moment variations of it in so many films and books the reality is less exciting appalling a man is about to die a grim brutal death hunched unseen at the back of the grim poorly lit operating theatre i watch the tall whitecoated surgeon arrange his apparatus on the small metal trolley beside the naked figure bound to the table he stood alone no anaesthetist needed in this hospital no painkillers here oldschool not even a bottle of gin to ease the pain of the bound rotund patient held in place by the leather straps which strained as he lay squirming under his torturers gaze as the surgeon lifts a heavy machete and appeared to weigh it thoughtfully in his hand before striking the mans chest with intense forcefulness his ribs cracking audibly something classical shostakovich possibly plaintive mournful plays upon a small battery powered stereo and he talks with quiet menace to his victim as he works again he glances over at me but im certain he doesnt know im here and im not about to advertise my presence in a hurry im no weakling but im not sure that a lack of weakness is going to be much use against a heavily armed machetewielding psychopath i should be able to see this out i just pray he doesnt know i am here all i ever wanted was one immortal image that would be remembered forever one image that would make me live forever a kiss in paris a fireman carrying a child from a wreck of a building soldiers raising a flag on some distant island i wanted one shot which could last an eternity the guy on the gurney screams through his bindings as the blade again cracks his chest the crazy surgeon guy seems to still be talking in subdued tones through the surgical mask and i can almost imagine from the friendly eyes peering over the green but now blood splattered surgical mask that hes trying to practise his bedside manner just make the patient better i cant hear what hes saying his voice low particularly when measured against agonised gagged screams and even when the screaming turns to whimpering and traumatized shudders i still cant hear what hes telling his victim i want to confront him but i cant move i should save the man be a hero but im so terrified by this strange situation we all wonder how we will react when faced with the situation where we should be brave today i know who i am i think of the boys at home waiting for me with mummy my madeline wondering where ive got to preparing to serve sunday roast beef this week i like it pink but maddie cant stand it like that so it will be well done nuked i toy with the idea of trying to take a shot in the low light to show to the police later what an amazing photo that would be the murderer in action but as i look down at my hands which hold the dimpled body of the camera they are immovable the powerful lens as heavy as a cannon now the surgeon pulls a wetwipe from a tub wipes his hands and mask and studies his digits intently until assured they are clean the patient is still quivering in shock now presumably hopefully wearing his defensive shield against the unimaginable the surgeon pulls open the rucksack a camera bag much like my own to reveal a substantial looking canon camera with a beige professional lens and then sets up a number of flashes and umbrellas despite myself i nod appreciatively at his kit not the time but i cant help it he moves round to the head of the man camera close to his ruined face finding his shot his immortal image and the flashes split the gloom with a thunderclap of light and again and again then a tripod which he sets next to the glass in front of me he fiddles with the settings on the camera and then walks briskly to the other side of the man he has a miniature remote in his hand which he points at the camera presses before the camera counts down to the shot flash flash nice family snap for the album an image to remember forever i have watched a clear demonstration of just how far from the fringes i am or not since this guy was so far beyond the fringes hed gone to the outside staring in this guy had gone way past normal boundaries and there was no coming back for him hes using proper surgical gear it seems some sort of a hacksaw and a multitude of scalpels used to brutal effect on the trembling snowy torso with which he extracted organs from the patient in gay abandon reminding me of a visit to the london dungeon with rubber innards and fake blood and number two son having to depart in terror taking a secret exit route to the gift shop but this was all too genuine no escape route here for the young or the squeamish briefly the thought flickers across my mind that this was a setup a staged performance not unlike the setups anna and i had created but no i knew that wasnt right this was real the viscous purplish organs soaked in blood so much blood now all around him and then repeatedly flash flash flash as he triggered the camera via the remote there was a final gasp from the bound figure as life drained from him a last explosion of light as the surgeon caught the moment of death and then it was over they tell you in the forums not to break in but there were many who did some people touched upon the moral issues around opening up buildings to vandals and squatters and the like but one user ednamillioninadropdeaddress had a different way of dealing with this concern crowbar off the old rusty lock and stick your own one on instead she wrote the advantage is that its easy to get back into if you want to take more shots but youre not letting vandals in even makes you look respectable if observed returning because youve got keys this was how i got into princes gate i sent anna a link to some of my asylum shots and she enthused over them but suggested a new path set the scene up like a film set stage our own dramatic scenarios layer our concept across the existing gloom our own scenes i want to play came the voice in my headset and a new game was born we both shared a solid horrorfilm sensibility and the thought of being able to create perfect little horror stills was electrifying korean gore and computer gaming survival horror providing much of our inspiration but it was strange how much of that otherworldly terror was just there waiting for us to draw it out she was meant to be here today but she cant be here now for some reason i cant recall why she texted me go in ahead without me she wrote take some good shots i looked at the gurney and imagined her lying where the surgeon was now sawing limbs and putting them into binbags we did that once dressed respectably for a change in a business suit but with her face whitened in a mask of death that image flickers now and is replaced by reality hes cleaning up the remains the segmented body packed away into laundry bags and heavy duty bin liners the plastic sheeting which had covered the floor wrapped up and also folded into bin liners i shiver as i realise hes about to remove the mask and i know i must look be brave see the monster behind the disguise so i can describe him the police though it frightens me to think of incurring the wrath of such a man of the lunatic who has taken charge of the asylum i watch him fixedly knowing its not possible for him to see me but terrified no less at the thought as he approaches the glass and unhooks the bloodied mask from behind his ears i gasp silently as i gaze with booming realisation at the face at those crinkled familiar features smiling with the whole face now not just the eyes the face i see every morning in my shaving mirror and i remember i remember the real reason why anna couldnt show today poor anna but she discovered the creation of true art requires sacrifice i feel very hungry now time for roast beef well done not pink because maddie doesnt like it bloody served with stuffing steamed veg and yorkshire puddings all drowned in thick onion gravy later i will unlock my camera and polish my lifes work burn in the shadows pick out the light and the details of the horror nobody but me ever gets to see the good stuff hidden away on encrypted hard drives maybe after my death then they will be released and will last eternally on the black museum of the web not now though ive met many other online playmates in the asylum and they join me in the creation of my art then i put glimpses online of my true body of work the stuff that looks slightly faked but not totally and people tell me its cool and dark and interesting and amazing and i thank them for it whilst alone i treasure the immortal images i can never show them
