out of a bedroom dont shout like that im not deaf you know whats the matter ive a letter here from that old friend of mine professor hayling said mr kirrin you remember him dont you do you mean the

want to be quite undisturbed he and i have to confer about some new invention of his dont look like that my dear this may be very very important well its important to the five that their plans

the day they were due home quentin you must ring up your professor friend and say he cant come very well my dear very well said mr kirrin but he wont like it he wont like it at all he went off to his study to use the telephone and mrs kirrin hurried up the stairs to get ready the rooms for the four cousins anne can sleep with george as usual she said to joan and the two boys can sleep in the guestroom it will be nice to have all the five back again said joan pushing the carpetsweeper up and down the landing i miss them and you should see the cakes i made yesterday maam two whole tins full youre too good to those children joan said mrs kirrin no wonder theyre so fond of you now well oh dear theres mr kirrin calling me again all right dear im coming im coming she ran downstairs to the hall and into the study mr kirrin was standing there holding the telephone receiver what shall i do he almost shouted professor hayling has left and is already on his way here i cant stop him coming and hes bringing his son with him so there are two of them his son well really said mrs kirrin there isnt room for them here with the four cousins as well quentin you know that well ring up george and tell her not to come back for a week but to stay with her cousins said mr kirrin crossly theres no reason why they should all come here but quentin you know perfectly well that georges aunt and uncle are shutting up the house today and going on a cruise somewhere said mrs kirrin oh dear oh dear well ill ring up george and try to stop them all coming so once more the telephone was used and mrs kirrin tried anxiously to get in touch with george for a long time nobody answered and then at last a voice came hallo whos there mrs kirrin here may i speak to george please oh im sorry all the five have already left on their bicycles said the voice and the house is empty except for me im a neighbour come in to lock everything up im so sorry i cant get george for you oh thank you never mind said mrs kirrin and put back the receiver she gave a heavy sigh now what what was to be done professor hayling and his son were on their way to kirrin cottage and so were the five and none of them could be stopped what a household it would be quentin she said going into the study where her husband was tidying up enormous piles of papers quentin listen george and all the others are on their way here and how i am going to put everyone up i do not know it looks as if somebody will have to sleep in timmys kennel and ive a good mind to make a bed up for you in the coalhouse im busy said mr kirrin hardly listening ive all these papers to get in order before professor hayling comes and by the way my dear will you please tell the children to be quiet while the professor is here hes rather shorttempered and quentin im beginning to feel rather shorttempered too said mrs kirrin and if she stopped very suddenly and gazed through the study window in horror then she pointed her finger at it look whats that at the window her husband turned and stared in amazement it looks like a monkey he said where on earth did it come from a voice called down the stairs it was joan maam theres a car at the door i think its the masters visitors a man and a boy mrs kirrin was still staring in astonishment at the monkey who was now scratching at the windowpane chattering in a funny little prattle he pressed his nose to the glass just like a child dont tell me that your friend owns a monkey and has brought him to stay too groaned poor mrs kirrin slie jumped as a loud bang came from the front door and went to open it yes there stood professor hayling the man who had so often forgotten to come in for meals when he had stayed at kirrin cottage years before and by him was a boy of about nine with a face a little like that of the monkey now on his shoulder the professor strode in calling to the chauffeur behind bring the luggage in man hallo mrs kirrin nice to see you again wheres your husband my word ive some interesting news to tell him ah quentin there you are got your papers all ready for me my dear old friend said mr kirrin shaking hands warmly fine to see you so glad you could come this is tinker my son said professor hayling clapping the boy on the back and almost knocking him over i always forget what his real name is we call him tinker because hes always tinkering with cars mad on them you know shake hands tinker wheres mischief poor mrs kirrin hadnt been able to get in a word the professor was now in the hall still talking the monkey had leapt off the boys shoulder and was on the hallstand swinging on a hatpeg really its like a circus thought poor mrs kirrin and the rooms not prepared yet and what about lunch oh my goodness and all the cousins coming as well what is that monkey doing now making faces at himself in the hall mirror somehow or other the visitors were pushed into the livingroom and they sat down mr kirrin was so anxious to discuss some mighty problems with the professor that he actually fetched a great sheaf of papers and immediately spread them over the table not in here dear in your study please said mrs kirrin firmly joan will you take the bags up to the guestroom and make up a bed there on the couch for the little boy there wont be room anywhere else what about the monkey asked joan eyeing it warily is he to have a bed too he sleeps with me said tinker in an astonishingly loud voice and leapt suddenly up the stairs making a most extraordinary purring noise as he went mrs kirrin stared after him in amazement is he in pain or something she said no no hes just being a car said his father i told you he was mad about cars he cant help pretending to be one now and again im a car a jaguar car yelled tinker from the top of the stairs cant you hear my engine rrrrrrr hey mischief come and have a ride the little monkey scampered up the stairs and leapt on to the boys shoulder chattering in its funny little voice the jaguar car then apparently made a tour of all the bedrooms occasionally giving a very loud honk does your boy always behave like that asked mr kirrin amazed how do you manage to do any work oh i have a soundproof workroom in my garden said the professor i hope your workroom is soundproof too no it isnt said poor mr kirrin still hearing the car upstairs what a boy how could anyone bear him for more than two minutes and to think he had come to stay he shut the study door after the professor but no door could shut out the sound of the small boy honking upstairs poor mrs kirrin was eyeing all the luggage brought in why hadnt the professor gone to a hotel what was life going to be like with the five here and the professor and a small boy who apparently thought he was some kind of car all the time to say nothing of a monkey called mischief and where were they all going to sleep chapter two a little excitement george and her three cousins were already on their way back to kirrin they cycled along the lanes with timmy georges dog loping easily beside them wont it be fun to be at kirrin cottage again said anne its so lovely to look out of a window and see kirrin bay blue as the sky i vote we go over to the island for a picnic youll like to have your own kennel again wont you timmy said george and timmy gave her ankle a quick lick and barked its always so peaceful at kirrin cottage said dick and your mothers so kind and jolly george i hope we shant upset uncle quentin with our talk and fun i dont think father has any very important work on hand said george anyway hell only have you for a week its a pity that professor friend of his is coming in a weeks time or you could have stayed longer well a week is quite a nice long time said julian hallo theres our first glimpse of kirrin bay look as blue as ever they were all glad to see the little blue bay and to catch sight of kirrin island lying there peacefully in the sun youre lucky george to have an island all of your own said anne one that is really and truly yours yes i am lucky said george i was never so pleased in all my life as the day mother gave it to me its belonged to our family for years of course and now its mine well go over there tomorrow at last they came to the end of their journey i can see the chimneys of kirrin cottage said julian standing up on the pedals of his bicycle and the kitchen fire is going i can see smoke the dinner must be cooking i can smell it said dick sniffing i think its sausages ass said the other three together and laughed they rode up to the back gate and leapt off their bicycles they put them into the shed and george gave a shout mother were home where are you she had hardly finished yelling when anne suddenly clutched her arm george whats that look peeping out of the window there they all looked and george shouted in astonishment its a monkey a monkey no timmy no come back timmy but timmy too had seen the quaint little face peering out of the window and had shot off to investigate was it a small dog or a queer sort of cat anyway whatever it was he was going to chase it away he barked at the top of his voice as he galloped indoors and almost knocked over a small boy there the monkey terrified at once leapt on to the picturerail that ran round the room you leave my monkey alone you big bully you cried a furious voice and through the open door george saw a small boy give timmy a sharp smack she raced indoors and gave the small boy a smack as sharp as the one he had given timmy then she glared at him angrily what are you doing here how dare you hit my dog its a good thing he didnt eat you up and whats that creature doing up there the little monkey was terrified it sat clinging to the picturerail trembling making a piteous chattering noise julian came in just as joan and cook arrived from upstairs whats all this she said youll have your father racing out of his study in a minute george stop barking at the little monkey timmy for goodness sake and stop crying tinker and take your monkey away before timmy eats him im not crying said tinker fiercely rubbing his eyes come here mischief i wont let that dog hurt you ill ill you take your monkey away old son said julian gently thinking that the small boy was very brave to imagine he could fight old timmy run along tinker made a clicking sound and the monkey dropped at once on to his shoulder and nuzzled there it put its tiny arms round the boys neck and made a little choking noise oh poor little mite its crying said anne i didnt know monkeys could cry timmy dont frighten it again please dont you mustnt bully tiny things timmy never bullies anything said george at once frowning at anne but after all what do you expect him to do when he comes home and finds a strange boy and a monkey here who are you boy i shant tell you said tinker and marched out of the room the monkey still whimpering into his neck joan who on earth is he asked dick and what is he doing here i thought you wouldnt like it said joan its that professor friend of your fathers george the one who was coming to stay next week he telephoned this morning to say he was coming this week insteacl and bringing his boy as well he didnt say anything about a monkey though are they staging here said george in horror how can mother let them she knew we were all coming today how mean of her how be quiet george said julian let joan go on well they arrived before anything could be done to stop them said joan and now your father is shut up in his study with professor hayling the boys father and your mother and i are at our wits end to know where to put you all the boy and his father and i suppose the monkey too are sharing the guestroom but thats where julian and dick were going to sleep said george losing her temper again ill go and tell mother that boy cant stay ill dont be an ass george said julian well manage somehow we cant go back home because our house will be all shut up now you could sleep up in the loft said joan sounding rather doubtful but its very dusty and terribly draughty i could put a couple of mattresses up there for you all right said julian well make do up in the loft thanks joan wheres aunt fanny does she mind all this well shes a bit rushed said joan but you know what your aunt is always so kind never thinks of herself that professor hayling just walked into the house as if he owned it bringing luggage and that most peculiar little boy and a monkey though the monkey seems a nice enough little thing it came and watched me wash up and bless me if it didnt try to dry the plates for me the kitchen door swung open and georges mother came in hallo dears she said smiling i thought i heard timmy barking dear timmy wait till you see the monkey hes seen him already said george scowling mother how could you take people in when you knew we were coming home today thats enough george said julian who saw how worried his aunt looked aunt fanny we wont be any trouble well keep out of the house as much as we can well do the shopping for you well go across to kirrin island and keep out of your way well youre kind julian said his aunt and smiled at him things will be rather difficult especially as professor hayling never can remember to come to meals in time and you know what your uncle is he could forget breakfast dinner and supper for a whole year and then wonder why he felt hungry that made everyone laugh julian slipped his arm round his aunt and gave her a hug well sleep in the loft he said and enjoy it too the girls will help with the housework and dick and i will do the odd jobs youve no idea how fine i look with an apron round my waist and a broom in my hand even george smiled at the idea of julian wearing an apron then timmy went suddenly to the halfopen door and barked he could smell that monkey again he heard a high chattering noise and pushed the door open at once what was that monkey calling him rude names he saw the little creature sitting on the top of the rail at the foot of the stairs it saw timmy and danced up and down sounding as if it were laughing timmy raced to the rail and leapt up barking fiercely the study door flew open and out marched not one angry professor but two wiiats all this noise cant we have a moments peace oh dear said mrs kirrin foreseeing this kind of thing happening twenty times a day now that timmy and the others were here she shushed the two angry men now now timmy just isnt used to the monkey yet go back please and shut the door ill see you arent disturbed again woofwoof shouted timmy using his very loudest bark and professor hayling shot back into the study at top speed any more rudeness from timmy and ill have him sent away roared mr kirrin and he too disappeared well said george her face red with anger what does he mean by that mother if timmy goes i go too oh look at that monkey hes sitting on top of the grandfather clock now he ought to be sent away horrid little mischievous thing not old timmy chapter three mischief tinker and timmy julian and dick set to work to take a couple of old mattresses up to the loft and some rugs and a couple of cushions for pillows it was rather draughty but what else was to be done it was still too cold to sleep outside in a tent george was very sulky that scowl will grow on your face george if you arent careful said dick cheer up for goodness sake its worse for your mother than it is for any of us shes going to be very busy this week she certainly was meals for nine people five of them very hungry children were not easy to provide joan did an enormous amount of cooking the girls helped with the housework and the boys cycled off to kirrin village in the mornings to do the shopping why cant that boy tinker help demanded george on the second day they were at home what on earth does he think hes doing now look at him out in the garden rushing all round making a frightful noise tinker shut up youll disturb your father and mine you shut up yourself called back tinker rudely cant you see im a bentley car with a very powerful engine and see how well it stops when i put on the brakes no jerk at all and hear the horn marvellous he gave a remarkably good imitation of a powerful carhorn at once the study window shot up and two very angry men shouted together tinker what do you think youre doing making that noise youve been told to be quiet tinker began to explain about the bentley but as this didnt seem to satisfy either of the angry men he offered to be a little minicar you see it goes like this said tinker beginning to move off making a low purring noise and it but the window was slammed shut so the little minicar drove itself into the kitchen and said it was very hungry could it have a bun i dont feed cars said joan i have no petrol go away the minicar purred out of the kitchen on its two legs and went to look for passengers mischief the monkey scampered up and ran up tinkers body to his shoulder youre my passenger said tinker and mischief held on to his hair as he drove all round the garden at top speed honking every now and again but very quietly indeed hes a funny child said joan to mrs kirrin wlien she came into the kitchen not bad really him and his cars ive never seen a child so mad on them in my life one of these days hell turn into one it began to rain next day and tinker couldnt go out he nearly drove everyone mad rushing about all over the house hooting and purring like a car engine now look joan said to him when for the twentieth time he drove himself all round her kitchen i dont care if youre a morris minor or an austin or a consul or even a rolls you just keep out of my kitchen its a funny thing to think that a fine car like a rolls can steal a bun out of my tin it ought to be ashamed of itself well if i cant get petrol ive got to get something to run on havent i demanded tinker look at mischief hes helping himself to apples in the larder but you dont say anything to him oh lands sakes is that creature in the larder again cried poor joan rushing across the kitchen who left it open id like to know timmy did said tinker you little fibber said joan as she shooed mischief out of the larder timmy would never do a thing like that hes as honest as the day not like that little thief of a monkey of yours dont you like him said tinker sorrowfully he likes you joan glanced across at the tiny monkey he sat huddled in a corner his arms over his face looking very small and sad one small brown eye peeped out at joan youre a humbug you are said joan looking as if youre the unhappiest monkey in the world when all the time youre thinking what mischief to do next here come and get this biscuit you rascal and dont you dare to go near timmy this morning hes very very angry with you what did mischief do to timmy asked tinker surprised he went to timmys dish and stole one of the bones there said joan timmy growled like a roll of thunder i really thought he would bite off the monkeys tail my word you should have seen mischief skedaddle mischief had now crept up cautiously to joan eyeing the biscuit she held he had had one or two slaps from her for stealing and he was rather wary of her quick right hand here you are take the biscuit for goodness sake said joan and dont look such a little misery or i might suddenly find myself giving you another biscuit hallo wheres he gone the monkey had snatched the biscuit with one of his tiny paws and had scampered away to the door it was shut so tinker opened it for him at once timmy came in he had been lying outside the door sniffing the good smell of soup cooking on the stove mischief leapt to the top of a chairback and made a strange little whinnying sound rather apologetic and sad timmy stood still and pricked up his ears he understood animal language very well mischief still held the biscuit he leapt down to the seat of the chair and then to joans enormous surprise he held out the biscuit to timmy he chattered in a very small voice and timmy listened gravely then the big dog took the biscuit gently threw it up into the air chewed it once and swallowed it well did you ever see anything like that before said joan marvelling for all the world as if mischief was apologizing to timmy for stealing his bone and offering him his biscuit to make up well whatever will george say when she hears timmy licked his lips to see if any biscuit crumbs were left and then put his big head forward and gave the monkey a sudden lick on the tip of his funny little nose timmys saying thank you cried tinker in delight now theyll be friends you see if they wont joan was astonished and pleased well well to think of that monkey being clever enough to present timmy with a biscuit that he very much wanted to eat himself he wasnt a bad little thing she went upstairs to find george and tell her but george didnt believe her timmy would never take a biscuit from that silly little monkey she said never you made all that up joan just because youre getting fond of mischief you wait till he runs off with your toastingfork again all the same george went down with joan curious to see if the two animals were becoming friendly and she saw a very strange sight indeed mischief was on timmys back and timmy was solemnly trotting round the kitchen giving him a ride the monkey was chattering in delight and tinker was shouting in glee go faster tim go faster youre a very fine horse youd easily win the derby go on gallop i dont want timmy to give rides to the monkey said george stop it timmy you look silly the monkey suddenly leaned forward and hugged timmy round the neck then he slid off and looked at george as if to say all right i wont make your dog look silly timmy knew that george was cross and he went to lie down on the rug at once mischief came sidling across to him and settled himself between timmys big front paws cuddling there without fear timmy bent his big head and licked him very gently tears came suddenly to joans eyes that timmy he was just about the nicest dog in the whole world see that she said to george bighearted and kind that dog of yours is dont you scold him now for being great enough to make friends with a little creature who stole his bone im not going to scold him said george astonished and proud hes a marvel the best dog in the kingdom arent you timmy darling and she went over to timmy and stroked his big soft head he whined lovingly and licked her looking up as if to say well everythings all right now were all friends tinker had been watching from a corner of the kitchen saying nothing he was rather afraid of george and her quick temper he was delighted when he saw her go over and pat timmy without even disturbing the monkey in his joy he began to honk like a lorry and startled everyone so much that they yelled at him stop it tinker be quiet you little nuisance woof that was from timmy youll have mr kirrin in here if you honk like that said joan cant you be something quiet for a change a bicycle for instance tinker thought that was quite a good idea he ran round the kitchen and out into the hall making a hissing noise like the sound of a bicycles wheels on the road then he decided to make a noise like a bicycle bell and produced a very loud ringing noise indeed it was so like the ringing of a bell that mrs kirrin ran out of the livingroom thinking there was someone at the front door then the study door flew open and out came mr kirrin and tinkers father poor tinker was caught and his father shook him so hard that two pencils shot out of his pocket and rolled over the floor tinker began to yell and how he could yell george came out of the kitchen to see what was happening and dick julian and anne raced down the stairs joan rushed out into the hall too and almost sent mr kirrin flying then george did a very silly thing she began to laugh and when george laughed properly her laugh was wonderful to hear but neither mr kirrin nor professor hayling thought it wonderful they merely thought it rude george was laughing at them and that wouldnt do at all this is absolutely the last straw shouted mr kirrin his face red with rage first this boy ringing bells all over the place and george encouraging him by laughing i wont have it dont you know that very very important work is going on here in kirrin cottage work that may bring great benefits to the world fanny send these children away somewhere i wont have them in the house disturbing us when we are doing such important work do you hear send them away and thats my last word and he and the professor stalked back to the study and banged the door well now what was to be done chapter four tinker has a wonderful idea mrs kirrin had appeared during the row and sighed when she heard her husband shouting oh dear dear these scientists who liked to do wonderful things for the world and yet often made their own families unhappy she smiled at georges angry face and took her arm come into the livingroom dear and bring the others with you well have to decide what can be done your father really is doing wonderful work you know and i must say that tinker and mischief and timmy dont help very much all right all right george i know it isnt timmys fault but he does have a very loud bark you know she took the five children and timmy into the living room the monkey scared at the shouting had gone into hiding and was nowhere to be seen mrs kirrin called to joan joan come and help us to discuss whats to be done this kind of thing cant go on they all sat down looking rather solemn timmy flopped down under the table and put his nose on his paws where was that little monkey who had given him his biscuit the discussion began george spoke first most indignantly mother this is our home why do we have to go away just because father wants this scientist friend to stay with him i have to do holiday homework and i dont make a row every time father bangs a door when im studying but if i so much as that will do george said her mother you ought to understand your father better than you seem to you are both exactly the same impatient shorttempered bangersofdoors and yet both so kind too now lets see if we can find a way out i only wish we could stay at my home said julian feeling awkward but its all shut up now that my parents have gone away cant we take tents over to kirrin island said george yes mother yes i know what youre going to say its only the beginning of april and its far too cold and all the rest of it and the forecast for the weather is very bad said her mother rain rain nothing but rain you cant possibly go and camp in the pouring rain and row to and fro getting drenched each day id have you all in bed with bronchitis before three days had gone and then what should we do all right mother have you any good suggestions said george still cross hey whats that monkey doing said dick suddenly stop him hes only poking the fire said tinker he thinks its cold in here well what next said joan and took the poker firmly from the monkeys little paw do you want to set the house on fire you you little monkey finished dick with a grin i must say that mischief is always up to mischief cant keep your eye off him for a moment well now if we cant go to kirrin island or back home or stay here where can we go said julian looking serious hotels are too expensive and which of our friends would like to have five of us to stay plus a wicked little monkey and a big dog with an enormous appetite there was a silence what a problem then suddenly tinker spoke up i know where we could go and wed jolly well have some fun too he said oh and where is this wonderful place asked george disbelievingly well i was thinking of my lighthouse said tinker most surprisingly and then as no one said anything but merely stared at him in astonishment he nodded at them i said my lighthouse dont you know what a lighthouse is dont be silly please said dick this is not time for jokes its not a joke said tinker indignantly its perfectly true you ask my father but tinker dear you cant possibly own a lighthouse said mrs kirrin smiling well i do said tinker quite fiercely you see my father had some very special work to do that couldnt be done on land so he bought an old empty lighthouse and did his work there i went to stay with him my it was grand there with the wind and the waves crashing about all the time but surely he didnt give it to you did he said julian disbelievingly yes he did why shouldnt he if i wanted it badly demanded tinker he didnt want it any more and nobody would buy it and i wanted it terribly so he gave it to me on my last birthday and its mine i tell you well im blessed said julian heres old george owning an island given to her by her mother and tinker owning a lighthouse given to him by his father i wish my parents would present me with a volcano or something really thrilling georges eyes shone as she looked at the surprising tinker a lighthouse of your very own where is it about ten miles along this coast to the west said tinker its not an awfully big one you know but its smashing the old lamp is still there but its not used now why not asked dick well because a big new lighthouse was built farther along the coast in a better position for warning ships explained tinker thats how it was this old one was put up for sale it was fine for my father to work in nobody ever disturbed him there though he did get very angry with the seagulls sometimes he said they mewed like great cats all the time and made him feel he ought to put out milk for them this made everyone burst into loud laughter and tinker sat beaming round proudly how clever he must be to make these children laugh like that yes and even joan and mrs kirrin too he broke into their laughter by banging on the table you do believe me now dont you he said its quite true that the lighthouse is mine you ask my father do lets all go and stay in it till our two fathers have finished their work we could take timmy and mischief too theres plenty of room this proposal was so astonishing that no one answered for a few moments then george gave him a friendly dig in the chest ill come fancy living in a lighthouse i bet the girls at school wont believe that aunt fanny may we go said anne her eyes shining too well i dont know said her aunt it really is a most extraordinary idea i shall have to discuss it with your uncle and with tinkers father too my father will say yes i know he will said tinker we left some stores there and some blankets i say wouldnt it be grand to run a lighthouse ourselves the idea certainly appealed to all the five even timmy thumped his tail on the floor as if he had understood every word he probably had he never missed anything that was going on ive a map that shows where my lighthouse is said tinker scrabbling in one of his pockets its rather crumpled and dirty because ive looked at it so often look heres a map of the coastline and just there built on rocks is my lighthouse its marked by a round dot look everyone pored over the grubby map nobody had the least doubt but that this was the answer to all their problems dick stared at the excited tinker how lucky he was to own a lighthouse dick had never before met a lighthouse owner and to think it should be this funny little tinker the rocks that the lighthouse is built on used to wreck many ships said tinker wreckers used to work along that coast you know they would shine a light as if to guide ships along the coast and make them go on the rocks crash theyd be broken to pieces and everyone drowned and the wreckers would wait till the ship was washed up on the shore and then take everything they could from her the wicked wretches said dick horrified theres a wreckers cave there too where the wreckers stored the things they stole from the wrecked ships said tinker i havent been very far into it im too scared to they do say theres an old wrecker or two there still oh nonsense said mrs kirrin laughing thats probably just a tale to keep children away from dangerous caves and rocks well dears i really dont see any reason why you shouldnt go to tinkers lighthouse if his father agrees mother thank you cried george and gave her mother a hug that made her gasp i sap living in an old lighthouse its too good to be true i shall take my binoculars and keep watch for ships well julian had better take his recordplayer as well said mrs kirrin if its stormy weather it may be a bit duller than you think mewed up in a lonely lighthouse it will be marvellous cried tinker and he suddenly became a racingcar tearing round the room at top speed making a most extraordinary noise timmy barked and mischief began to chatter loudly sh said mrs kirrin youll make your father cross tinker and that will be the end of your fine idea switch your engine off please and sit down quietly ill talk to your father as soon as i can chapter five tinkers lighthouse mrs kirrin thought that she might as well go immediately to the study and see if her husband and professor hayling could talk about the children going away to this lighthouse of tinkers could it really be true she knocked discreetly at the closed door she could hear voices inside the room but nobody called come in she knocked again what is it now shouted mr kirrin if its you george go away and keep away and if its tinker tell him to go to the garage and park himself there i suppose its he who has been making all that row this morning mrs kirrin smiled to herself well well if all scientists were like her husband and professor hayling it was a wonder they were ever calm enough to get any work done she went away perhaps she could bring up the subject of the lighthouse at dinnertime what a relief it would be to have a peaceful house for a few days she went into the kitchen to find joan the monkey was there helping her he had slipped away from tinker and gone to see if there were any titbits about joan was talking away to him as she rolled out pastry see i roll it like this and like that and i pick off a tiny bit for you and she gave mischief a snippet for himself he was very pleased and leapt on joans shoulder he lifted a piece of her hair and whispered in her ear joan pretended to understand yes mischief if youre good ill give you another titbit in a minute now get off my shoulder and stop whispering it tickles well joan i never thought to see you rolling pastry with a monkey on your shoulder said mrs kirrin joan what do you think about this lighthouse idea i havent been able to get into the study yet mr kirrin thought i was tinker and told me to go and park myself in the garage and a very good idea too said joan rolling her pastry vigorously isnt that tinker out in the hall now sounds like a car of some sort well maam id say that if the lighthouse is habitable why shouldnt the five go there with tinker and the monkey theyd enjoy themselves all right and timmy would look after them sort of thing that they love rushing off to a lighthouse ugh nasty lonely place with waves crashing round and a wind fit to blow your head off yes but do you think theyd be all right all alone there joan said mrs kirrrin well julian and dick are old enough to look after the others though i must say i wouldnt like the job of being in charge of that tinker said joan all i hope is that he doesnt imagine hes an aeroplane all of a sudden and take off from the top of the lighthouse mrs kirrin laughed dont say that to him she said his idea of being a car is bad enough well joan i feel very mean sending george and the others away immediately they come here but with two excitable scientists in the house i dont see that theres anything else to do look out for that monkey hes found your bag of raisins oh you little mischief said joan and made a grab at the monkey he shot off to the top of a cupboard with the bag of raisins firmly held in one paw he made a tiny chattering noise as if he were scolding joan you come down with those raisins said joan advancing to the cupboard else ill tie you to a chair with that long tail of yours you little monkey mischief said something in his funny little voice that sounded rather cheeky then he put his paw into the paper bag and took out a raisin but he didnt eat it he threw it straight at joan it hit her on the cheek and she stared at mischief in astonishment what youd pelt me with my own raisins well that i will not have she went to the sink and filled a cup with water while mischief pelted both her and mrs kirrin with raisin after raisin he danced about on the top of the cupboard screeching loudly in glee a bowl on the top of the cupboard fell off as the monkey danced about and crashed to the ground the noise scared him and with a flying leap he shot off the cupboard and landed on the top of the halfopen door he pelted the two women from there making the most extraordinary noises the study door was flung open and out came mr kirrin followed by the professor what was that crash whats happening here how can we w it was most unfortunate that joan should have thrown the cup of water at mischief at that moment he sat there on the top of the door and the water fell all over him splashed over the top of the door and down on to mr kirrins head as he pushed the door open joan was horrified she disappeared into the scullery at once not knowing whether to laugh or to make her apologies mr kirrin was astounded to find himself dripping wet he stared angrily up at mischief absolutely certain that it was the monkey who had emptied the water over him by this time the five had come out of the livingroom wondering what the noise was its old mischief said tinker throwing water i should think well actually i threw the water began joan apologetically peeping out of the scullery because you threw it said mr kirrin amazed what is happening in this house things have come to a pretty pass if you start flinging water at people joan you ought to be ashamed of yourself are you mad listen quentin said his wife nobodys mad at present but pretty soon we all shall be if this sort of thing goes on quentin are you listening ive something important to say to you and to you too professor the professor remembered his manners he gave a slight bow to mrs kirrin please go on he said politely and then flinched as a raisin hit him squarely on the head mischief had found one on the floor and had taken a potshot at the professor dick looked at the monkey admiringly he really was a very good shot whats that little fathead of a monkey throwing said mr kirrin fiercely and at once knew when a raisin hit him smartly on the nose get rid of him put him in the dustbin why have i to put up with monkeys that throw things and boys that chug about the house like cars gone mad i tell you fanny i will not have it mrs kirrin looked at him very sternly listen quentin i have something to say listen tinker says his father gave him a lighthouse for his own and he suggests that he and all the others should leave here and go and stay in the lighthouse quentin are you listening a lighthouse are you mad what that little monkey of a boy says he owns a lighthouse and you believed him said mr kirrin amazed tinkers quite right as it happens said professor hayling i bought a lighthouse to work in when i wanted to get right away from everywhere and concentrate and when id finished i couldnt sell it so as tinker pestered me for it i gave it to him but not to live in a lighthouse to work in said mr kirrin thinking what a truly marvellous idea this was ill buy it from you ill no quentin you wont do anything of the sort said his wife firmly will you please listen to me both of you professor hayling is the lighthouse fit for these five to stay in and if so they want to know if they can go there until you two have finished your work here theyre a nuisance to you and to be quite honest youre a nuisance to them fanny said her husband astonished and angry father listen well all get out of your way as soon as possible if youll say we can go to tinkers lighthouse said george planting herself firmly in front of her father say one word yes thats all we want yes shouted mr kirrin suddenly tired of all the argument and longing to get back to his papers with the professor yes go to the lighthouse go to the tower of london go and live at the zoo if you like the monkeys will welcome that mischievous little creature sitting grinning up there on the cupboard but go somewhere oh thank you father said george joyfully well go off to the lighthouse as soon as we can hurray three ch but before she could continue the study door shut with a bang behind the two exasperated men george bent down took timmys two front legs and proceeded to dance all round the livingroom with him shouting hurray three cheers over and over again mrs kirrin sat down suddenly in a chair and began to laugh joan laughed too if we dont laugh we shall cry she said what a hullabaloo well its a good thing theyll soon be off maam that loft is much too draughty for the boys you know look at poor julian hes got such a stiff neck he can hardly turn it this morning who cares said julian well soon be off again together all the five and two more to keep us company it will be quite an adventure an adventure said tinker surprised but you cant have adventures in a lighthouse its out on the rocks all by itself as lonely as can be there arent any adventures to be found there ah you wait and see tinker you dont know the five if theres any adventure about theyre bound to be right in the middle of it chapter six making plans it was very exciting making plans to go to the lighthouse tinker told them all about it time and time again its very tall and theres an iron stairway a spiral one going from the bottom up to the top and at the top is a little room for the lamp that used to flash to warn ships away it sounds smashing said george what about timmy though can he climb up a spiral stairway well he can live down at the bottom cant he if its too difficult for him to climb up said tinker mischief can climb it easily he simply races up if timmy has to live at the bottom i shall live there with him said george why not wait and see the lighthouse before you arrange the sleeping places said julian giving lier a friendly punch now first we must find out exactly where it is and the way to get there its a pity tinker cant turn into a real car he could run us there in no time tinker at once imagined himself to be a large van taking the five and all their luggage along the road he raced round the room making his usual car noise and hooting so loudly that he made everyone jump julian caught him as he raced round the table and sat him down firmly any more of that and we leave you behind he said now wheres that map of yours lets have a look at it and then well get aunt fannys big map of the coast and track down the road to your lighthouse soon tinker and the five were studying a largescale map of the coast mischief sitting on dicks shoulder and tickling his neck see thats the way to go said julian it really wouldnt be far by sea look round the coast here cut across this bay round the headland and just there are the rocks on which the old lighthouse stands but by road its a very long way better go by car though said dick weve a good bit of luggage to take not only our clothes but crockery and things like that and food there are still some stores there said tinker eagerly dad left some when we went away from the lighthouse theyll probably have gone bad said julian well dont take too much said tinker its a pretty rough way over the rocks to the lighthouse there isnt a road that runs right up to it you know we shall have to carry everything ourselves once we get to the place we can always get fresh food if we want it the village isnt all that far away but there are some days when you cant even leave the lighthouse you see the waves splash househigh over the rocks when theres a rough wind wed have to get across by boat if the tides in the rocks are covered then this sounds too exciting for words said dick his eyes shining what do you think about it anne you havent said a word well i do feel just a bit scared said anne it sounds so lonely i do hope no ships will be wrecked on those awful rocks while were there tinker said there was a fine new lighthouse farther along the coast said julian its light will keep every ship away from that wicked stretch of rocks look anne you would like to come wouldnt you if not aunt fanny wouldnt mind just you staying here youre a little mouse you wouldnt bother uncle quentin or the professor at all i shouldnt dream of not coming with you said anne indignantly julian you dont think there are still wreckers about do you i should hate that they belong to years gone by said julian cheer up anne this is just a little visit were going to pay to tinkers seaside house he is kindly taking in visitors this spring well lets get on with our plans said dick we go there by car er what was that you just said tinker i said ill drive you if you like said tinker i could dr you havent a driving licence so dont talk nonsense said george crossly i know i havent but all the same i can drive said tinker ive driven my fathers car round and round our garden see and oh do shut up said dick you and your pretend cars julian when shall we go to his lighthouse well why not tomorrow morning said julian im sure everyone would be glad if we left as soon as possible its hard on aunt fanny and joan to have so many here well see about a car and someone to drive us and then well pack and make our getaway hurray said george in delight and pounded on the table making mischief leap up to the top of a bookcase in fright oh sorry mischief did i scare you timmy tell him im sorry i didnt mean it he probably understands your doggy language timmy looked up at mischief gave two little whines and a comforting wuff mischief listened with his head on one side and then leapt down landing neatly on timmys back thanks for giving him my messsage tim said george and everyone laughed good old timmy he wagged his long tail and put his head on georges knee looking up at her beseechingly all right old thing i understand your language whether you talk with your voice or your eyes said george patting him you want a walk dont you woof said timmy joyfully and tore to the door lets walk down to the garage and see if they have a car or a van to hire out to us said julian well have to have a driver too because someone has to take back the car come on timmydog they all set off to the garage in the village the rain held off for a while and the sun came out making kirrin bay sparkle and shine i wish we could have gone to stay on my island said george but it really is too damp to camp out anyway a lighthouse will be nice for a change the man at the garage listened to julians tale of wanting a car to go to the lighthouse its the old lighthouse at demons rocks not the new one at high cliffs he said were going to stay there stay at a lighthouse said the man this isnt a joke is it no it happens to belong to one of us said julian we have a few things to take there of course and we hoped youd have a car and a driver tomorrow for us wed let you know somehow when we are ready to come back from the lighthouse and you can send the same car for us then right said the man and youre staying at kirrin cottage now you say oh your uncle is mr kirrin well i know master george here of course but i wasnt certain who you were some queer people order cars you know george was pleased to be called master george it was nice to be thought a boy she dug her hands deep down in the pockets of her jeans wed better take a few rugs and cushions said julian and some sweaters and windcheaters i cant imagine its very warm in the lighthouse theres an oilheater there said tinker i think it was for the lighthouse lamp when it was in use we can use that for warmth if were cold what sort of stores did you and your father leave there asked dick wed better order some foodstuffs at the grocers and some gingerbeer or something and take it all in the car well theres plenty of tinned food i think said tinker trying to remember we left it there in case my father wanted to come back at any time and work again in peace and quiet hm its a pity he didnt fix up with uncle quentin to have him there with him said julian then everyone would have been happy they went to the grocers and anne tried her best to order what she thought they would need outside of tinned food sugar butter eggs oh dear help me george how much shall i order dont forget we can go shopping in demons rocks village said tinker only its a bit of a nuisance if theres windy weather the path over the rocks isnt very safe then we might have to stay in the lighthouse for a day or two without leaving it even a boat might be too risky it sounds thrilling said george picturing them all marooned by fierce storms waiting to be rescued from peril and starvation get some biscuits anne and bars of chocolate and lots of gingerbeer and a big bottle of lemonade and a wait a minute do you know whos paying for all this said julian i am so dont ruin me completely he took out his wallet heres a pound he said thats all i can spare at present dick can buy the next lot of food we want well ive plenty of money too said tinker taking out a handful from his pocket you would have said george i suppose your father just hands out money whenever you ask him hes so vague he wouldnt know if he paid you three times a day well yours seems pretty vague too said tinker smartly he poured the coffee over his porridge this morning instead of the milk i saw him and whats more he ate it without even noticing it was coffee thats enough said julian we dont tell tales about our parents in public tinker dont you want to take anything for mischief to eat while were in the lighthouse george has bought biscuits for timmy and were going to lay in a supply of bones too ill buy mischiefs food myself thank you said tinker not very pleased at being ticked off by julian he gave an order for a packet of raisins a packet of currants a pound of apple rings and some oranges mischief eyed all these with very great pleasure paws off said george sharply as the little monkey slyly slid his paw into the bag of biscuits put ready for timmy mischief jumped on to tinkers shoulder and hid his face in his tiny paws as if he were ashamed well just buy some more fruit said julian and then i think well have enough well have it all sent to the garage and put in the car ready to take away tomorrow tomorrow said george her eyes shining oh i hope it comes soon i cant wait for it chapter seven off at last it was very exciting that evening to talk about the next day the car coming to fetch them the drive round the coast to demons rocks exploring the lighthouse looking out over the endless sea and watching the great waves coming in to pound on the rocks what im looking forward to is our first night there said george all alone high up in that old lighthouse nothing but wind and waves around snuggling down in our rugs and waking up to hear the wind and waves again and the gulls put in tinker they cry all the time you can watch them from the lighthouse top i wish i had wings like a gull spread out wide sitting on the wind as they glide sitting on the wind yes thats exactly what they do said anne i just wish their cry didnt sound so mournful though mrs kirrin was halfinclined not to let the children go after all the weather forecast was bad and she pictured them sitting halffrozen and perhaps very scared in the old deserted lighthouse but no sooner did she begin to wonder out loud if she ought to let them go than the children raised their voices in indignant chorus but weve ordered the car and heaps of food and joan has packed up a big tin of all kinds of things she even baked a special cake for us mother how could you think of saying no when youve already said yes all right all right dears said mrs kirrin i wouldnt really stop you going but do send me a card or two will you thats if theres anywhere to post one oh theres a tiny postoffice in the village said tinker well send a card every day then youll know were all right very well but if a card doesnt come ill be very worried said mrs kirrin so please do keep your word you wont forget your anoraks will you and your rubber boots and mother i feel as if youre going to mention umbrellas next said george but honestly wed be blown out to sea if we put an umbrella up on demons rocks tinker says theres always a gale blowing round the coast there you can think of us playing slap bang with our packs of cards and having a fine time in the lighthouse while storms rage round and howl like demons said dick well be sitting snug in our rugs with gingerbeer beside us and chocolate biscuits all round woof said timmy at once pricking his ears up at words he knew so well ha you think youre going to feed on chocolate biscuits do you tim said dick ruffling the dogs hairy head and please dont interrupt the conversation its not good manners woof said timmy apologetically and licked dicks nose i think youd all better go to bed early tonight said mrs kirrin youve still some packing to do tomorrow and you say youve ordered the car for half past nine well be down to breakfast at eight oclock sharp said julian i bet the professor wont be down till about eleven and forget all about his bacon and eggs tinker does your father ever have a really hot meal i mean it seems to me he either forgets them altogether or wanders in hours late and then doesnt know if hes having breakfast dinner or supper well i can always eat up everything thats there if i think hes forgotten to come said tinker sensibly mischief helps too youd be surprised how fond mischief is of fat bacon im not a bit surprised at anything mischief does said julian im just wondering how we are going to put up with his tricks when were all cooped up in the lighthouse together we cant send him out into the garden then to work off some of his high spirits aunt fanny do you know he took my pencil this morning and scribbled monkeywords all over my wallpaper its a good thing i cant read monkeylanguage for im sure he wasnt scribbling anything polite youre not to say things like that about mischief said tinker offended hes very goodmannered for a monkey you should see some monkeys i know id rather not thanks said julian tinker was cross he picked up mischief and went out of the room soon there was the noise of a car out in the hall one that needed repairing by the sound of it rrrrrrrrrrrrrr ooooooph rrrrrrr parp mrs kirrin rushed to the door you know youve been told not to be a car out in the hall come back before your father hears you tinker my goodness me this house will be an entirely different place once it is rid of all the cars that have driven about in it since you came i was only being a tractor said tinker surprised i always feel as if i must go and be a car when people are horrid to me or mischief oh be your age said george i shall go up to bed said tinker offended again well thats not a bad idea seeing that you have to be punctual tomorrow morning said mrs kirrin good night then tinker dear good night mischief tinker found himself gently propelled to the door he went up the stairs grumbling mischief on his shoulder but he soon stopped frowning as he undressed and thought of the next day off to the lighthouse his lighthouse ha that would make george and the others sit up he snuggled down in bed with mischief nestling beside him one little paw down the front of tinkers pyjama jacket next morning george awoke first she sat up afraid that the weather forecast might be right and that it would be pouring with rain no it was wrong for once the sun shone down and she could not hear the sound of the sea that meant that there was not much wind to blow up big waves that pounded on the shore she awoke anne lighthouse day she said buck up its half past seven they were all down very punctually to breakfast except professor hayling as usual he did not appear until breakfast was over and then he sauntered in at the front door oh you are up then said mrs kirrin i thought you were still asleep in bed no tinker woke me up at some very early hour complained the professor or else it was the monkey i really dont know they both look alike to me in the early morning mr kirrin was already down but hadnt come into breakfast he was in his study as usual george go and fetch your father said mrs kirrin his breakfast will soon be uneatable george went to the study door and knocked father dont you want your breakfast ive had it said a surprised voice very nice couple of boiled eggs father that was your yesterdays breakfast said george impatiently its bacon and fried eggs today youve forgotten as usual do come were leaving for the lighthouse soon lighthouse what lighthouse said mr kirrin in tones of great astonishment but he had no answer george had gone back to the diningroom not knowing whether to laugh or frown really father was so forgetful that he would forget where he lived next there was great excitement after breakfast rugs coats nightclothes the warmest that could be found tins of cakes and mincepies packed by joan sandwiches to eat on the way books games as george said anyone would think they were going away for a month the cars late said dick impatiently or else my watch is fast here it comes said anne excited oh aunt fanny i wish you were coming too were going to have such fun wheres mischief oh there he is and timmy timmy were going to live in a lighthouse you dont even know what that is do you the car came up to the front gate of kirrin cottage and the driver blew his horn making mr kirrin almost jump out of his skin he turned on poor tinker at once was that you up to your silly tricks of pretending to be a car and hooting again own up now no sir it wasnt on my honour it wasnt said tinker indignantly hopping out of the way of what looked as if it might be a very powerful slap see its that car ill just ask the driver what he means by driving up here and hooting fit to scare us all said mr kirrin indignantly whats he come here for anyway father its the car thats come to take us to the lighthouse said george not knowing whether to laugh or be cross ah yes said mr kirrin why didnt you tell me before well goodbye goodbye have a good time and dont forget to dry yourselves well after a bathe they piled into the car and the man put their luggage into the big boot he stared as timmy and mischief leapt in sure youve all got enough room he said what a carful then to the accompaniment of a loud rrrrrrrr from the cars engine and an equally loud one from the delighted tinker the car turned and drove away down the sandy lane were off said george in a happy voice off all by ourselves again its the thing i like best of all do you like it too tim woof said timmy agreeing heartily and lay down with his head on georges foot ah now for a lovely holiday with george timmy didnt mind where he went even to the end of the world so long as he was with george chapter eight theres the lighthouse once they were out on the main road tinker began to talk to the driver asking him questions about all kinds of cars the others listened amused well i dont think much of the new cars said tinker all gadgets some of the new gadgets are very good said the driver amused with the cocky little boy and he touched a little lever beside him at once the window next to tinker went down smoothly with a curious low moan tinker was extremely startled oh dont open that window said anne as a rough wind swooped in for goodness sake shut it tinker tinker shut it and began to talk about cars again once more the driver touched the lever beside him and once more tinkers window slid mournfully down and a cold draught came in tinker dont mess about with the windows ordered julian i never touched the thing said tinker eyeing the window with suspicion it suddenly shut itself sliding upwards very smoothly tinker began to feel uncomfortable he watched the window closely afraid that it might play tricks again the others knowing perfectly well that the driver could open and shut any of the windows automatically from his own seat nudged one another and giggled that shut up poor old tinker murmured dick it had not another word about new cars or old came from tinker during the whole drive it was a very pleasant one mostly round the coast and very little inland the views were magnificent that dog of yours seems to like the views said the driver his head has been out of the window all the time well i always thought it was because he liked the fresh air said george timmy is it because you enjoy the views woof said timey and withdrew his head to give george a lick he also gave the little monkey a lick poor mischief didnt much like the motion of the car he sat very still indeed afraid that he might be sick the car purred along sounding just like tinkers usual imitation they stopped for an early lunch and ate their sandwiches hungrily sitting on a cliff the driver had brought his own and once mischief had discovered that half the mans sandwiches were made of tomato he sat on his knee in a very friendly manner sharing his sandwiches in delight well be there in another hour or so said the man where are you staying at demons rocks the garage didnt tell me at the lighthouse said julian do you know it yes but people dont stay there said the driver thinking that julian was pulling his leg what hotel are you going to or are you staying with friends no we really are going to the lighthouse said tinker its mine my very own well youve certainly got a place with a fine view said the driver i was born at demons rocks my old greatgrandad is still in the same cottage where i was born my word the stories he used to tell me of that old lighthouse and how the wreckers got into it one night and grabbed the keeper there and doused the light so that a great ship might go on the rocks how horrible and did it get wrecked asked dick yes smashed to bits said the driver absolutely smashed to bits and then they waited for the tide to wash up the wreckage you ought to look up my old greatgrandad and get him to tell you his tales he might even show you the wreckers cave oh we heard about that said george is it really true can we see it and is there someone in there still no no all the old wreckers are gone long ago said the driver as soon as the new lighthouse was built the wreckers day was done its so powerful you see its beams can be seen even in the fiercest storm the beam from the lighthouse youre going to wasnt very good but it saved a good many ships all the same whats your grandads name asked george making up her mind to look him up as soon as she could where does he live ask for jeremiah boogie said the driver carefully skirting a herd of cows youll find him sitting some where on the quay smoking a long pipe and scowling at anyone that comes nigh him but he likes children so dont you be afraid of his scowl hell tell you a few tales will my old greatgrandad well bless us all if there isnt another herd of cows coming round the corner hoot at them said tinker ever heard the rhyme about the cow that jumped over the moon boy said the driver well someone hooted when it came by see and thats what it did jumped over the moon no good driver hoots at cows it scares them silly and they jump like hares look see that cliff round the curve of the coast there well thats the first bit of demons rocks well soon be there now why is it called that asked george well the rocks there are so wicked that it was reckoned they could only have been put there by some kind of savage demon said the driver some are just below the water so that they catch the keel of a boat and rip it others stick up sharp as sharks teeth and theres a great ledge of rocks where a boat can be pounded to bits by the waves ah theyre demons rocks all right when shall we see the lighthouse asked tinker we ought to see it soon wait till another bit of the coast comes in sight as soon as we get to the top of this hill said the driver and just tell that monkey of yours to take his paw out of my coatpocket ive no more tomatoes there behave yourself mischief said tinker so sternly that the little creature hid its face in its paws and whimpered little humbug said george theres not a tear in his eye oh look is that the lighthouse yes thats it said the driver you get a good view of it now from this hill fine one isnt it for an old one ah they could build well in those days that ones made of stone its waveswept so it has to be fairly tall or the shining of the lamp would have been hidden by the spray falling on the windows where did the lighthouse keeper live asked dick oh theres a cosy enough room just under the lamp room said the driver my grandad took me up there once i never saw such a view of a stormy sea in my life my father lived there all one summer boasted tinker i was with him most of the time it was grand why did your father want to live in a lighthouse asked the driver curiously was he hiding or something of course not hes a scientist and he said he wanted peace and quiet with no telephones ringing and no one coming to see him said tinker and do you mean to say he had peace and quiet with you there said the driver teasingly well well its not so quiet there really said tinker the waves make such a noise and so does the wind but my father didnt really notice those he only notices things like bells ringing or people talking or somebody knocking at the door things like that drive him mad he loved the lighthouse well i hope you enjoy yourselves there said the driver its not my cup of tea hearing nothing but waves and gulls crying better you than me they descended the other side of the hill and the lighthouse was no longer to be seen soon be there now said tinker mischief will you like to be at the lighthouse again my word how quickly you could go up the spiral staircase and down do you remember the car swept down almost to the edge of the sea the lighthouse was now plainly to be seen a good way out from the shore a small boat bobbed at a stone jetty and tinker pointed it out with a scream of joy thats the boat we had the one that took us to and from the lighthouse when the tide was in its called bobabout and my word it does bob about too is it yours asked george rather jealously well it was sold with the lighthouse so i suppose it is said tinker anyway its the one well use when we cant wade over the rocks well see you dont get stormbound in the lighthouse said the driver bringing the car to a stop the sea between demons rocks and the jetty will be too rough for that little boat in stormy weather i can manage boats all right said george ive had one since i was small yes youre pretty good with them that i do know said the driver well here we are are you going to go straight to the lighthouse in that boat shall i help you to carry your things to it well thanks said julian and between them they carried everything to the little boat an old man sat nearby and he touched his cap to them message came through from kirrin to say i was to get the old boat out for you he said which of yous master hayling i am said tinker and thats my boat and thats my lighthouse come on everyone lets row to the lighthouse come on i can hardly wait to get there chapter nine inside the lighthouse the five children jumped down into the boat which was certainly acting up to its name of bobabout timmy leapt in after george but mischief the monkey cried in terror when tinker took him into the bobbing boat and sat down holding him firmly its all right mischief said tinker dont you remember this little boat of mine you never did like going in a boat though did you there were two pairs of oars julian took one pair and george was going to take the other when dick quietly took them himself grinning at georges angry face sorry theres a good old swell on the sea and weve to row through some pretty good waves im just a bit stronger than you george i row just as well as you do said george the boat gave a great roll to one side just then and she just managed to save one of their suitcases from toppling overboard well saved said julian and only just in time too my word what a swell there is just here are you going to row right over the rocks asked anne peering down into the water they are covered by the water now we shant scrape the bottom of the boat at all these are the rocks that we can walk over when the tides out said tinker lovely pools there are in them too i used to wallow in a nice warm one that was so wellheated by the sun that i wished i had a cold tap to turn on when the water felt too hot anne chuckled i wish it was warm enough to bathe now she said my word look down and see what horrible rocks there are just beneath the boat yes i bet they ripped up many a poor ship in the old days said julian no wonder they called them demons rocks its a bit of a pull over them isnt it dick let me have a turn said george grabbing at one of dicks oars nothing doing said dick with a grin you just look after those bags old thing is it a very old lighthouse asked anne as they swung over the hidden rocks and the lighthouse came nearer and nearer it looks old yes it is said tinker its an odd little lighthouse really built by a rich man years and years ago his daughter was drowned in a ship that was wrecked on these rocks so he built a lighthouse partly as a memorial to the girl and partly to prevent other shipwrecks anne gazed at it it was sturdily built and seemed very tall to her its base was firmly embedded in the rocks below it dick thought that the foundations must go very deep down into the rocks to hold the lighthouse firmly in the great gales that must blow in bad weather a gallery rather like a verandah ran round the top just below the windows through which the lighthouse lamp once shone what a view there would be from that gallery thought anne they came near to the lighthouse which had stone steps running from the rocks up to a doorway built some way above the crashing waves will the door be locked asked dick suddenly i wouldnt want to row all this way and then find we cant get into the place of course the door will be locked said tinker anyone got the key oh dont be a donkey said julian resting his oars and glaring at tinker do you mean to say we cant get in after all this its all right said tinker grinning at julians dismayed face i just wanted to pull your leg heres the key its my lighthouse you see so dad gave me the key and i always carry it about with me its very precious it was an extremely large key and george marvelled that tinker could keep it in his pocket he flourished it at them grinning again im looking forward to unlocking my lighthouse with my key he said i bet you wish you had a lighthouse of your own george well yes i do said george gazing up at the towering lighthouse now so near to them youd better be a bit careful now said tinker to the boys wait till a big wave swells up then ride over it and make for that rock over there the one standing out of the water theres a calm bit beyond it for some reason and you can row up to the steps quite safely look out for a stone post there and chuck the rope round it george youre in a better position than i am for that it was all done much more easily than the five hoped the boat swung into a stretch of fairly calm water and the two boys rowed hard for the steps george neatly threw the loop of rope over the post and there they were at the foot of the lighthouse with only a few rocks to climb over to reach the steps these rocks were not under water and one by one the children and timmy jumped out and stared up at the lighthouse it seemed much bigger now that they were just at the bottom ill unlock the door said tinker proudly and climbed up the steep stone steps look at the enormous great stones that my lighthouse is made of no wonder it has stood so long he thrust the great key into the lock of the stout wooden door and tried to turn it he struggled for a minute and then turned to the others with a scared face i cant open the door he said now what do we do ill have a try said julian its probably stuck he took hold of the key gave it a strong twist and opened the door everyone was most relieved julian pushed the others in out of the wind and the spray and shut the door firmly well here we are he said isnt it dark good thing i brought a torch he shone the torch round but all that was to be seen was a steep iron staircase spiralling up the middle of the lighthouse the staircase goes right up to the top to the lamproom explained tinker it passes through a few rooms on the way ill show you hang on to the railing of the staircase you may feel giddy going up round and round so steeply tinker proudly led the way up the steep little staircase that went round and round and round they came to a hole through which the stairway passed into a little dark room one of the storerooms said tinker and flashed his torch round see there are tins of food that i told you my father and i left here now we go on up to the oilroom thats not very big whats the oilroom asked anne oh it was just where tins of paraffin oil used to be kept the oil they used for the light at the top of the lighthouse the old lamp had to burn oil you see there wasnt electricity in those days look heres the oilroom the oilroom had a very low ceiling no window and was packed with old tins it had a nasty smell and anne held her nose with her fingers i dont like this room she said it has a horrid smell and a horrid feel about it lets go on up the staircase the next room had one of the few little windows in the lighthouse and as the sun came through it it was much lighter and more cheerful this was where my father and i slept said tinker my word look we forgot to take that old mattress away with us what a bit of luck we can use it up the spiral staircase they went once more and this time came to a room with a higher ceiling than the others and a good window though small the sun came through this one too and it looked quite homely it had a table and three chairs and a box it also had an old desk and a little paraffin stove for boiling water or frying food theres my old fryingpan said tinker well find that jolly useful and a kettle and a saucepan and we left spoons and forks and knives behind though not enough for all five of us im afraid and theres crockery too though not as much as there ought to be i broke rather a lot but there are some tin cups and plates i used just to wipe them clean with a cloth waters precious in a lighthouse you know where is the watertank asked george well have to have some water my father arranged a catchtank on the west side of the lighthouse said tinker proudly it catches rainwater and runs into a pipe that goes through one of the windows and fills a little tank over a sink i forgot to show you that theres a tap to turn the water on and off my fathers very clever you know and a thing like that is as simple as abc he didnt want to have to fetch water every day for washing in gosh we did have fun here well it looks as if youll have some more fun said dick youve plenty of company this time you must have been jolly lonely before oh well i had mischief said tinker and when he heard his name the little monkey came scampering over to him and leapt into the boys arms cuddling into him lovingly and whats the next room in this marvellous little lighthouse asked julian theres only one more and thats the lamproom ill show you that it used to be the most important room in the place but now its lonely never used quite forgotten come and see and up the last spiral of the stairway went tinker how very very proud he was of his lighthouse chapter ten settling in once more they all climbed up the spiral stairway timmy rather slowly for he found the winding stairs difficult mischief shot up in front of them almost as if he were the owner of the lighthouse and was showing off his home the lamproom was a high room with big windows all round it it was very bright for the sun shone steadily into it the view was magnificent anne gave a shout of wonder the lighthouse was so high that the children could see for miles and miles over the heaving dark blue sea they went all round the lamproom looking in every direction i say theres a door here cried dick does it open on to that little balcony or gallery or whatever it is that runs all round this room yes the gallery goes completely round the lamproom said tinker my word you should see it sometimes when the weathers rough and the gulls go seeking somewhere out of the storm they perch on that gallery by the dozen but you cant go out there except in calm weather you might be blown right off youve no idea what its like when theres a storm honestly one night when my father and i were here i thought i felt the lighthouse rocking this is about the most exciting place ive ever stayed in said anne her eyes shining tinker i think you are the luckiest boy in the world do you really said tinker pleased he gave anne a little pat i hoped youd like it mischief loves it dont you mischief mischief was up on top of the great lamp he chattered down to timmy as if he were telling him all about it timmy listened his ears cocked his head on one side he looks just as if he understood that monkeygabble said george tinker this lamp is never lighted now is it no never said tinker i told you there is a fine new lighthouse a bit farther down the coast it has a terrific lamp run by electricity we shall see its beam sweeping the sea at night why dont people build lighthouses and live in them wondered george as she gazed out over the wide blue sea anyone feeling hungry asked tinker rubbing his tummy i feel jolly empty oh gosh we havent taken the things out of my boat said tinker come on lets carry them all indoors and have a meal whats the time past four oclock no wonder i feel empty come on mischief to work you can carry some of the things in too they ran down the spiral stairway through room after room and came to the great door i suppose it had to be built as thickly and strongly as possible because of the sea dashing against it in storms said julian pulling it open the wind rushed in and almost knocked him over they pushed their way out and climbed back over the rocks to where they had left the boat it was bobbing gently up and down in the little stretch of calm water hallo bobabout said tinker did you think we were never coming got all our goods safely good little boat ass said dick grinning come on ju ill take half the heavy things you take the rest the girls and tinker can manage the smaller things hey mischief what do you think youre doing mischief had picked up a parcel or two and was bounding off with them its all right hes used to helping shouted tinker he often goes shopping with me and carries bags and things let him help he likes it the monkey certainly was very useful he scampered to and fro with all kinds of little things and chattered happily timmy stood staring at him his tail down wishing he could use his paws as nimbly as mischief could george gave him a loving pat its all right timmy darling here take this basket timmy took the basket in his mouth by the handle and leapt happily up the steps of the lighthouse he might not be able to pick up the little things that mischief so easily managed but at least he could carry baskets well leave the boat bobbing up and down said tinker it will be quite all right there tied to the post unless the sea gets terribly rough then well have to pull it halfway up the steps lets have our meal and unpack before we arrange our things said anne i really do feel very hungry now what sort of a meal shall we have i feel as if i want something more than a teatime meal thats the worst of living in a lighthouse said tinker quite seriously youre awfully hungry nearly all the time i used to have five or six meals a day when i stayed here with my father sounds all right to me said dick with a grin lets have a teasup meal shall we a mixture of tea and supper teasup some of the things were put into the bedroom and some into the livingroom soon tinker popped a saucepan of water on the stove to boil because of the rainy weather the little raincatch tank had provided plenty of water for the small inside tank set over the sink which was most conveniently put in the livingroom when tinker turned on the tap out came clear rainwater magic said anne delighted i feel as if im in a dream eggs were put into the saucepan and were soon boiled exactly three minutes and a half said anne ladling out each one with a spoon two eggs each at this rate we shall have to go shopping every day george you cut some breadandbutter the breads in that bag but goodness knows where the butter is i know we bought some what about having a few of joans famous mincepies too said dick taking the lid off a bigs square tin whew dozens and cherry buns as well and homemade macaroons joans speciality i say what a meal what shall we have to drink said julian gingerbeer lemonade or shall we make some tea everyone voted for gingerbeer it was a very pleasant and cheery meal that the five had in the old lighthouse with mischief and tinker the gulls called outside the wind gave the lighthouse an occasional buffet and the sound of the sea was mixed with all the other noises lovely anne hugged her knees as she waited for her gingerbeer to think they were going to stay here for days and days all by themselves when the meal was over anne and george washed up in the little sink oh dont wash up just give the things a quick wipeover said tinker like this oh no said anne thats just like a boy youd better leave this side of things to me i like doing jobs like this see just like a girl said tinker with a grin no it isnt said george i hate doing them and im a girl though i wish i wasnt never mind you look like a boy and youre often as rude as a boy and you havent an awful lot of manners said tinker quite thinking that he was comforting george ive more manners than you said george and stalked off in a huff to look out of the windows but nobody could be in a huff for long with that wonderful view sea for miles and miles tipped here and there with white breakers george gave a sigh of pleasure she forgot that she was annoyed with tinker and turned to him with a smile if i could own this view id feel i was the richest person in all the world she said youre very lucky tinker am i said tinker thinking it over well you can have half the view if you like i dont want it all julian laughed and clapped the boy on the back well all share it while were here he said come on lets unpack and arrange everything girls you had better sleep here in this livingroom and we three boys will sleep down in the bedroom that all right by you tinker fine so long as you dont mind mischief sleeping with us said tinker anyway i expect timmy will sleep with the girls woof said timmy agreeing he was certainly not going to sleep anywhere without george they all had fun unpacking and putting the things in the diferent places storeroom for that julian said and livingroom for this and this and bedroom for these rugs thought these two had better go to the livingroom because the girls will sleep there cards for the livingroom said dick handing them to anne and books and papers gosh we mustnt forget to send a card each day to aunt fanny we promised we would well shell know we arrived safely today because the cardriver will be sure to send a message to her said george but tomorrow well go down to the village and buy a stock of postcards and well send one every single day i know mother will worry if we dont all mothers are worriers said dick its a nuisance but on the other hand its one of the nice things about them now then what about a game of cards and there they all are in the lighthouse playing cards with shouts and laughter timmy and mischief watching you do have fun together five dont you chapter eleven jeremiah boogle when it began to get dark tinker left the cardtable and fetched an oldfashioned oillamp he shook it its still got some oil in he said good ill light it then we can see properly what a pity we cant light the great oillamp at the top of the lighthouse said george that must have been the lighthouse keepers great moment lighting up the lamp to warn ships away i wonder who first thought of a lighthouse someone whose folk sailed and might be wrecked on rocks i suppose one of the first great lighthouses was built ages ago on an island called pharos at the mouth of the nile not far from the great port of alexandria said julian what was it built of stone like this one asked tinker no it was built of white marble said julian i thought of it today when we went up the spiral staircase here because the pharos lighthouse had one too much much bigger than ours what was their lamp like asked tinker i dont know if it had a lamp said julian its said that an enormous fire was built each night on the top of the lighthouse whose flames could be seen by ships a hundred miles away goodness it must have been a pretty high lighthouse then this pharos said dick well it was supposed to be feet high said julian whew i wonder the wind didnt blow it down said dick lets go and see it one day if its still there ass said julian its gone long since after all it was built over twentytwo hundred years ago an earthquake came along one day and the magnificent lighthouse was shaken to bits completely destroyed there was a shocked silence everyone looked round at the walls of the lighthouse they were in an earthquake what a catastrophe that would be for even a little lighthouse cheer up anne said julian with a laugh were not likely to visited by an earthquake tonight that old lighthouse on pharos island was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world no dont ask me the others im getting too sleepy to remember i wish we could light the lamp in this lighthouse said anne it cant like being a blind lighthouse after shining brightly for so many years could the lamp be lighted tinker or is it broken now anne if you think were going to scramble round that lamproom and light the lamp just because you feel sorry about it youre mistaken said dick firmly anyway its sure to be out of order after all these years i dont see why it should be objected tinker the lamps never been interfered with look are we going to go on with our game or are we not said julian l may as well remind you that i have won practically every game so far unless someone else wins a game soon i shall consider that im playing with a set of nitwits that was quite enough to make everyone pick up their cards and see if they couldnt possibly beat julian well jolly well play till youre well and truly beaten said dick but no nobody could beat julian that night luck went his way all the time at the end of the fifth game anne yawned loudly oh sorry she said dont think im bored that yawn came too suddenly for me to stop it well i feel decidedly yawny too said dick what about a snack of something and then well go to bed we had such an enormous teasup that i feel i cant manage another meal but a chocolate biscuit or two would be quite welcome woof said timmy at once agreeing heartily and mischief said something in his little chattering voice and tugged at tinkers sleeve ill bring you a snack or two said anne getting up she soon came back with a tray on which she had put lemonade large slices of joans new cake and a chocolate biscuit for everyone including timmy and mischief they ate with enjoyment feeling lazy and comfortable and now to bed said julian girls do you want any help with your mattress or rugs or anything no thanks said anne do you boys want to wash and clean your teeth at the sink here because if so do it now before a quarter of an hour had gone everyone was bedded down comfortably the three boys curled up in rugs in the bedroom below with mischief cuddled into tinkers neck the two girls and timmy lay on a mattress with a blanket over them timmy lay beside george occasionally licking her ear with his big tongue dear timmy said george sleepily i love you but do please keep your tongue to yourself and soon they were all asleep boys girls and animals too outside the sea sighed and splashed and swirled and the wind cried like the daytime gulls but all was peace and quiet inside the old lighthouse not even mischief the monkey stirrred in his sleep it was fun to wake up in the morning and hear the gulls screaming round fun to have breakfast of eggs and breadandbutter and apples to crunch afterwards fun to plan what to do that day i vote we do a bit of shopping and buy some more eggs and fresh bread and a bottle or two of creamy milk said anne and we might try and find that cardrivers greatgrandad and ask him a few things about the lighthouse and the wreckers that came in the old days said dick yes and he might show us the wreckers cave said julian id like to see that buck up with whatever jobs there are to do anne and george and well go over the rocks to the jetty the tide should be out so we ought to be able to walk over well we must be back before the tide comes in then said tinker because if we leave the boat tied up here by the lighthouse we shant be able to get back once the sea sweeps over the rocks and cuts us off right said julian be ready as soon as you can girls the girls were ready very quickly and the little party set off over the rocks that at low tide lay between the lighthouse and the shore wicked rocks they were too with sharp edges and points that would hole a ship at once soon the children were on the little stone jetty what was the name of old greatgrandad said dick frowning jeremiah boogie said anne and he smokes a long pipe and scowls at people well he should be easy to find said julian come along hes probably somewhere on the quay there he is said george spotting an old man with a long pipe in his mouth thats jeremiah im sure yes there he was sitting with his legs stretched out in front of him an old old man smoking a very long pipe he had a fine beard a yachting cap askew on his head and such enormous shaggy eyebrows that it was difficult to see his eyes beneath them the five went up to him with timmy trotting behind and mischief on tinkers shoulder the old man spotted mischief at once well well a monkey he said manys the little monkey ive brought home from my voyages he snapped his fingers and made a curious noise in his throat mischief stared at him listening then he leapt from tinkers shoulder on to the old mans and rubbed his head against the old sailors hairy ear mischief said tinker amazed look at that george he never goes to a stranger well maybe i knew his great grandfather said the old sailor laughing and scratching mischiefs neck all monkeys like me and i like them er are you mr jeremiah boogie asked julian jeremiah boogie thats me said the old fellow and touched his cap how do you know my name well jackson the cardriver told us he was your greatgrandson said julian you see were staying at the old lighthouse and jackson said you could tell us a few things about it its history you know and about the wreckers that lived here before the lighthouse was built oh i can tell you tales all right said jeremiah puffing out a cloud of smoke and making mischief cough thats more than that silly young greatgrandson of mine can he dont know nothing nothing at all except about cars well who wants cars nasty smelly noisy things pah that young george jackson is a ninny hes not hes the cleverest mechanic in the place said george at once theres not a thing he doesnt know about cars cars there now what did i say nasty noisy smelly things said jacksons greatgrandad with a snort well look we dont want to talk about cars said julian you tell us about the old days the wreckers and all that ah them old days said greatgrandad well i knew some wreckers myself once there was oneear bill now and then old jeremiah told a story that the five could hardly believe chapter twelve jeremiahs tale now when i were a boy began the old man a boy not much older than this here youngster and he poked tinker with his horny forefinger there wasnt no lighthouse out there but there was always them wicked rocks and manys the time in a stormy season when ships have been caught by their teeth aglittering there waiting you know what theyre called dont you yes demons rocks said tinker well up on that high cliff there lived a wicked old man said jeremiah and he had a son as bad as himself and a nephew too the three wreckers they was called and ill tell you how they came by their name did you know them asked dick that i did and if i was hidden behind a bush when they came marching by id send a stone skedaddling after them said the old man mean and cruel and wicked they were and everyone was skeered of them right down afraid there was oneear the old man they say his left ear was chewed off by a monkey but do i blame that monkey no i do not no more than id blame your monkey for chewing off the ear of somebody else i know but i wont mention no names he might hear me the old fellow looked over his shoulder as if the man he was thinking of might be about well there was oneear the old man and there was nosey the son and bart his nephew and not a pin to choose between them for meanness there was only one thing they was after and that was money and a mighty wicked way they chose to get it the old man stopped and spat in disgust on the pavement pah ill tell you how they got rich oh yes ill tell you and ill tell you what happened to them in the end too be a lesson to you and to everyone well now you see that high cliff away down the coast there the one with the flagpost and the flag awaving in the wind yes said everyone looking at the waving flag now ships mustnt hug the coast beyond that point said grandad it they do theyll be forced inland by the current and thrown on them rocks down there demons rocks and thats the end of them no ship has ever been able to escape the sharp teeth of them wicked rocks once shes caught in that current well now to stop the ships going near to the cliff in those days they flew a flag in the daytime and lighted a lamp up there at night and both said as plain as could be beware keep out danger of course all sailors knew the flag and the lamp too and many a one blessed them and took their ships out to sea away from demons rocks but that didnt suit old oneear bill he didnt mind a wreck or two hed be down on the beach picking up what he could if a ship came smashing down on the rocks and would he save a single soul not he there was some people said he was the demon of demons rocks himself what a wicked old man said anne horrified aye youre right missie said the old fellow well the wrecks didnt come often enough for him and nosey and bart so they put their ugly heads together and thought up as wicked a plan as any man could think of what was it said tinker his eyes almost falling out of his head well on a stormy night he put out the lamp ashining brightly on the far cliff and he and nosey carried it to that bit of cliff over yonder see and the old man pointed to a juttingout piece nearby and you know whats just below that cliff dont you all round the lighthouse rocks sharp horrible rocks the demons rocks said george horrified do you mean to say that oneear bill and the others deliberately shone the lamp there on stormy nights to guide ships straight on to the rocks said julian aye thats what i do mean said jeremiah boogie and whats more i met old oneear bill meself one dark night when the storms were on and what was he carrying between himself and nosey the lamp theyd doused the light of course but id my own little lantern with me and i saw the lamp plain enough aye that i did and when they saw me they set bart on to me to push me over the cliff sos i wouldnt tell on them but i got away and i did tell on em ho yes i told all right and oneear bill went to prison and serve him right the wicked man but he didnt care and why should he he was rich rich but how was he rich asked dick well young sir the ships that came sailing round this coast in those days came from faroff countries and many of them carried treasure said jeremiah and oneear bill stole so much gold and silver and pearls and other things from the wrecks that he knew he wouldnt need to do another days work when he came out of prison a rich man he would be he wouldnt even need to wreck a ship again but why werent the stolen goods taken from him said julian hed hidden them said the old man ah hed hidden them well too not even nosey his son nor bart his nephew knew where hed put them they were sure hed got everything hidden in one of the caves in the cliff but search as they might they never found the treasure they went to prison too but they came out long afore old oneear bill was due out and how they hunted for the gold and silver and all that oneear had hidden away did oneear bill get it when he came out of prison asked dick thinking this was a much more exciting story than he had ever read in a book and a true one too no no he didnt get it said jeremiah puffing out a cloud of smoke and glad i am to say that he died in prison the wicked old man well then what happened to the treasure from the wrecked ships asked george who found it no one said the old man no one at all its still there hidden wherever that old rascal put it his secret went with him bart looked for it and nosey too ho ive seen em in those caves day after day and with a lamp night after night but they never found even a pearl necklace ho that was a good joke that was theyre dead and gone now but theres relatives of theirs still living in demons rocks who could do with a bit of that treasure poor as church mice they are with two children as skinny as ever youd see doesnt anyone even have an idea where the loot from the wrecked ships is asked julian what about the cave weve been hearing about the wreckers cave oh aye weve a wreckers cave all right said the old man knocking out his pipe and i reckon about five thousand people have been in it scouting round looking into holes and corners hoping to find what bart and nosey never did find or maybe ten thousand who knows i dont mind telling you ive been there meself but not a smell of a little gold coin did i ever see ill take you there meself some day if you like but mind dont you hope to find anything its my belief that oneear bill never did hide his treasure there he just said it was there to fool nosey and bart wed love to go and see the cave said dick and george nodded her head in delight not to hunt for treasure of course its pretty obvious its not there now maybe somebody did find it and took it away secretly maybe said jeremiah all right young sir you come and tell me when youre ready im sitting here most days and if youve a nice bit of baccy you dont have no use for you think of me see well go and buy you some straightaway said julian he couldnt help laughing what tobacco do you smoke oh you tell tom the tobacconist its for old jeremiah boogie hell give you what i like said the old man and mind now dont you go snooping round them old caves by yourselves you might get lost its a proper laby laby labyrinth said julian smiling right well be careful the five went off timmy glad to be on the move again he couldnt understand the old mans story of course and he wondered why george hadnt taken him for his usual afterbreakfast walk he gave a little whine and she patted his big head sorry timmy she said that old man told such an interesting story that i quite forgot you were longing for a walk well go for one now lets call in at the tobacconists first shall we said julian that old chap deserves an extra smoke for his tale goodness knows how much was true but he certainly told it well of course it was true said george why ever should he tell lies well he might have to get extra tobacco you know said julian smiling i dont blame him its a jolly good story but please dont think theres any treasure still hidden somewhere george its no use believing that well i do believe it said george defiantly i think he was telling the truth tobacco or no tobacco dont you tinker oh yes said tinker you wait till you see the caves round about here hoo there might be any amount of treasure there and no one would ever know i did hunt round a bit myself but those caves are scary and when i coughed once my cough came echoing back to me a hundred times and i was so scared i ran for my life and fell splash into a pool everyone laughed lets buck up and do our shopping said dick and then what about going for a good long walk well i dont want to carry eggs and bread and milk for miles said george i say a walk first and then well come back have icecreams do our shopping and go back to the lighthouse right said julian come on timmy were off for a walk a walk ha thats the word to set your tail wagging isnt it look at it mischief dont you wish you could wag your tail like that chapter thirteen a pleasant morning and a shock where shall we go for our walk said george as they wandered through the village oh look theres a tiny little shop with tom the tobacconist written over the door lets get the tobacco while we remember so in went julian and rapped on the counter a very small man appeared like a hobgoblin out of a dark corner i want some tobacco for jeremiah boogie please said julian i think you know the kind he wants i do that said tom scrabbling about on a shelf the amount that old jeremiah has smoked since ive been here would keep a bonfire going for years there you are young sir he tells a fine story said julian putting down the money for the tobacco tom laughed hes been going on about bart and nosey and all them old folk i suppose he said hes a queer one is old jeremiah never forgets a thing even if it happened eighty or more years ago never forgives neither theres two folk in this village that he spits at when he passes by them naughty old man he is what have they done to earn his spite asked dick in surprise well they be some kin of his old enemy oneear bill said tom i reckon he told you about him all right didnt he yes he did said julian but all that business about the wrecking happened years and years ago surely jeremiah doesnt visit his anger on any descendants of the wicked one ear bill oh but he do said tom you see these two fellows he spits at have the job of showing people round the caves here especially the wreckers cave and i reckon old jeremiah still broods about oneears hidden treasure and is scared in case these two chaps ever find it find it its nigh on seventy years since all that happened why that lighthouse yonder was built over sixty years ago after that wrecking business went on no one will come across any treasure now but surely they might said george it depends where it was hidden if it was in some dry watertight place it should still be all right after all gold and silver dont decay do they wherever it was hidden it must still be there thats what all you visitors say said tom and thats what ebenezer and jacob say theyre the two chaps who show people round the caves but they only say that to make a bit of a thrill for the visitors you know same as old jeremiah does takes them in properly well you believe what you like youngsters but you wont find any treasure i reckon the sea took that years ago goodday to you ill give jeremiah the baccy when he calls in well said dick as soon as they were outside the shop this is all very interesting i think probably old toms right the reason why the treasure was never found is because it was probably hidden where the sea managed to get at it in some waterhole or somewhere like that i still believe its somewhere safe said george so does tinker oh well i should think probably timmy believes it as well said dick he has a childlike mind too dick at once received a hard punch on the back from george he laughed all right well give you a chance to hunt for the treasure wont we ju well visit the wreckers cave as soon as we can lets go up on the cliffs for our walk and see if we can spot where the first old lamp used to be that warned ships to swing out to sea and avoid demons rocks it was a lovely walk along the cliffs the celandines and tiny dog violets were out and clumps of pale yellow primroses were everywhere the breeze blew strongly and mischief held tightly to tinkers right ear afraid of being blown off his shoulder timmy enjoyed himself thoroughly bounding along tail flourishing happily sniffing at everything they came to the flagpost set high on the cliff its great red flag waving vigorously in the breeze a noticeboard was beside it george read it this flag warns ships off demons rocks by day by night the great lighthouse at high cliffs farther along the coast gives warning in the old days a lamp shone from this spot to give the ships warning and later a small lighthouse was built out on demons rocks it is still in existence but is no longer in use ha theyre wrong there said tinker pointing to the last sentence were using it ill alter the notice and tinker actually took a pencil to scratch out the last six words julian took it from him dont be an ass you cant mess about with public notices dont say youre one of the fatheads who like to scribble all over the place tinker held out his hand for the pencil all right it was just that i thought it wanted correcting im not the kind of idiot who scribbles on walls or public notices right said julian tinker can we see demons rocks the rocks themselves i mean with our lighthouse from these cliffs no said tinker the cliff swings away to the left look and the demons rocks are away right round the corner if you see what i mean so no ship should follow the coastline here but should keep well out at sea or itd be on the rocks you can quite well see that if the wreckers took the lamp from its warningplace here and put it much farther back along the way weve come the ships would swing too far inland and find themselves wrecked i think i should have hated old oneear bill as much as old jeremiah does said george imagining the beautiful ships being ground to pieces all those years ago just because of a greedy man who liked the pickings from wrecks well wed better go back said julian looking at his watch weve some shopping to do remember better buck up too it looks like rain all of a sudden he was right it was pouring by the time they reached the village they crowded into a little shop that said morning coffee and ordered a cup each and buns the buns were so nice that they bought some to take back to the lighthouse with them then anne remembered postcards we must buy some she said and send one off today better get some now and write one and post it while were here dick slipped out of the coffeeshop and returned with a packet of very gaudily coloured cards some of them show the lighthouse he said well send one of those and you choose a card to send to your father too tinker it would be a waste said tinker he wouldnt even bother to read it well send one to your mother said anne i havent one said tinker shes dead she died when i was born thats why my father and i always go about together im very very sorry tinker said anne shocked the others were sorry too no wonder tinker hadnt very good manners and was all on his own no mother to teach him anything poor tinker anne felt as if she wanted to buy him every bun in the shop have another bun tinker she said or an icecream ill pay mischief can have one too were all going to have another bun each and an icecream said julian timmy and mischief too then well do our shopping and go home home to the lighthouse that sounds grand doesnt it they wrote three cards one to mr and mrs kirrin one to joan and one to the professor now theyll know we are safe and happy said anne sticking on the stamps the rain had stopped so they went to do their shopping fresh bread more butter and eggs two bottles of milk some fruit and a few other things then off they went down to the little jetty tide will soon turn said julian as they jumped down from the jetty to the rocky little beach come on well just have time to walk over the rocks to the lighthouse please dont drop the eggs tinker they made their way over the rocks jumping over little pools here and there and avoiding the slimy strands of seaweed that in places covered the rocks the lighthouse seemed very tall as they came up to it its tiny compared to the great new one away at high cliff said tinker you ought to go over that the revolving lamp at the top is magnificent its light is so powerful that ships can see it for miles well this little lighthouse looks nice enough to me at the moment said dick climbing up the stone steps to the strong wooden door hallo look two bottles of milk at the top step dont tell me the milkmans been he used to call when my father and i were here said tinker only when the tide was out in the morning though because he hasnt a boat i suppose he heard we were all staying here and came to see if we wanted milk and left two bottles when he found we were out he probably yelled through the letterbox and when we didnt answer he just left the milk on chance sensible fellow said dick get out your key tinker and unlock the door i dont remember locking it behind us when we went out this morning said tinker feeling frantically in all his pockets i must have left it in the lock on the inside of the door lets see now we locked the door last night and left the key in the lock so i must have unlocked it this morning for us all to go out thats right but after you unlocked it you ran straight down the steps with george and the rest of us followed said julian anne was last did you lock the door after you anne no i never thought of it said anne i just shut the door with a bang and raced after you all so the key must still be on the other side of the door well if we push the door it should open said julian with a grin and the key will be on the inside waiting for us lets go in he pushed hard for the door shut very tightly and sure enough it swung open julian put his hand round to the inside lock to feel for the key it wasnt there julian looked at the others frowning someones been here and found the door unlocked taken the key and probably plenty of other things as well he said wed better go and look come on wait theres something on the doormat said dick picking up a letter the postman has visited the lighthouse too heres a letter forwarded from kirrin so at least two people came while we were out but surely neither of them would take the key or anything else either well well soon see said julian grimly and up the first bend of the spiral stairway he went at top speed chapter fourteen the old old map julian and dick went into each room of the lighthouse racing up the spiral stairway from one to the other why oh why hadnt they watched to see that tinker locked the door and took the key yes a few things had been taken my rug said george thats gone and my purse said anne i left it here on the table thats been taken too so has my little travelling clock groaned julian why did i bring it i could have used my watch there were a few other things gone all small horrible fellow whoever he is to creep into the lighthouse while we were out and take our things said anne almost crying who would come here they would surely be seen from the quay wouldnt they yes youre right there said julian though probably the thief slipped in when it was pouring with rain and the quay was deserted i think well have to tell the police you know lets have our dinner and then ill take the boat and slip across to the village the tide will be in then and i shant be able to walk over the rocks blow that thief i was looking forward to a nice quiet read this afternoon after their meal julian took the boat and rowed across to the jetty he went straight to the policestation where a stolidlooking policeman listened to him and wrote slowly in a book have you any idea sir who the thief might be asked the policeman or if anyone came to the lighthouse while you were out well two people seem to have come said julian the milkman because we were surprised to find milkbottles on the steps and the postman there was a letter for us on the mat inside the door i dont know of anyone else well as far as i can tell you both willy the milkman and postie are as honest as the day said the policeman scratching his chin with his pencil there may have been a third visitor one who didnt leave milk or a letter ill see if anyone was on the quay this morning who saw the thief going over the demons rocks er do you suspect anyone sir good gracious no said julian i dont know anyone here unless you can count jeremiah boogie or tom the tobacconist no no sir i think we can rule both of them out said the policeman smiling well ill do what i can and let you know if i hear of anything good afternoon sir and by the way as you cant lock that lighthouse door now and its plain there are thieves about i shouldnt leave the lighthouse empty see yes yes id already thought of that said julian i can jam the door all right with something when were in the lighthouse but i cant do that when were out well it looks as if were in for a wet spell said the policeman so maybe it wont be much hardship to keep indoors i hope youre comfortable in the lighthouse seems a funny place to stay really oh were very comfortable constable said julian smiling why not pay us a call sometime and see us thanks sir said the policeman and took julian to the door the constable was right in forecasting a wet spell it poured all that afternoon and the little company in the lighthouse whiled away the time playing cards julian and dick had managed to find a heavy piece of wood in the storeroom to jam the door from the inside they all felt much safer when they knew that had been done now no one could get in without making a terrific noise im stiff said george at last i want to stretch my legs ive a good mind to run up and down the stairway half a dozen times well go on then said dick nobodys stopping you how far down does the lighthouse go tinker asked george we always scoot up the first bit of the spiral stairway and never think about the lighthouse foundations deep down in the rock are they deep down oh they are said tinker looking up from his book my father told me that when the lighthouse was built they drilled right down into the rock for a long way made a kind of shaft and he said that under these rocks there are all kinds of queer holes and tunnels the drill kept shooting downwards when it came to a sudden space really said dick interested i hadnt thought of what would have to be done to make a high lighthouse safe from the gales and storms it would have to have deep foundations of course my father found an old map somewhere said tinker a sort of plan made when the lighthouse was first built like architects draw when they plan how to build a house said anne yes something like that said tinker i cant remember much about it i know it showed all the rooms in the lighthouse connected by the spiral stairway and it showed the big lamproom at the top and at the bottom of the map the foundation shaft was drawn can you go down the shaft asked dick is there a ladder or anything i dont know said tinker ive never been down there i never thought about it do you know where the old map is the one made by the architect who drew up plans for the lighthouse builder to followsaid julian where did your father put it oh i expect he threw it away said tinker wait a minute though it may be in the lamproom i remember him taking it up there because it had a drawing of how the lamp worked well id rather like to go and see if i can find it said julian interested come up with me tinker thank goodness you dont keep turning into some sort of car now you must be growing up so the two of them went up the spiral stairway to the lamproom at the very top of the tower again julian marvelled at the magnificent views all around the rain had stopped for a time and the sea swept by strong winds was a swirling tumult of angry waters tinker scrabbled about in a little dark space under the lamp he at last brought up a roll of something white and waved it at julian heres the map i thought it would be in the lamproom julian took it down to the others and they spread it out it showed the plan of the lighthouse and was very clearly and beautifully drawn how is it that architects draw so marvellously said george are they architects because they can do this kind of thing so well or do they draw beautifully because they are architects a bit of both probably said julian bending over the finelydrawn plan ah here are the foundations look my word they do go down a long way into the rock great tall buildings like this always have deep strong foundations said dick last term at school we studied how lets not talk of school said anne its already looming in the distance tinker can anyone get down into this foundation place l told you i dont know said tinker anyway i should think it would be a horrible place down there dark and smelly and narrow and lets go and see said george getting up im so bored at the moment that if i dont do something ill fall asleep for a hundred years ass said dick still quite a good idea of yours wed have a bit of peace while you were sleeping oooooch dont jab me like that george come on said george lets trot down and find out whats down the shaft anne didnt want to go down the shaft but the others ran down the stairway timmy too and soon came to the bottom opposite the entrance door of the lighthouse tinker showed them a large round trapdoor in the floor there if we open that well be looking down into the foundation shaft he said so they pulled up the large round wooden trapdoor and gazed downwards they could see nothing at all except darkness wheres my torch said julian ill fetch it soon his torch was lighting up the round shaft and they saw an iron ladder going down it on one side julian climbed down a few steps and examined the walls of the shaft theyre cement he called and they must be enormously thick i should think im going on down so down he went and down marvelling at the sturdy cement lining of the enormous shaft he wondered why it had not been filled in perhaps a hollow cementlined shaft was stronger than a filledin one he didnt know he came almost to the bottom but he didnt go down the last steps of the iron ladder a peculiar noise came from below him a gurgling choking noise what in the world could it be he shone his torch down to see and then stared in amazement there was water at the bottom of the shaft water that swirled and moved around making a strange hollow gurgling noise where did it come from as he watched it it disappeared then it came back again he shone his torch here and there to find out how the water made its way into the shaft there must be a tunnel or a passage of some sort down there that the sea can enter he thought its high tide now so the water is swirling in i wonder now i wonder if its free of water when the tide is out and if so where does that tunnel or whatever it is lead to or is it always under water ill go back and tell the others and have another look at that old map he climbed back glad to be out of the smelly darkness of the old shaft the others were at the top looking down rather anxiously here he is said george see anything interesting julian i did rather said julian climbing out of the shaft got that old map with you i want to look at something if so come upstairs then said dick we can see better there what was down there ju wait till were up in the livingroom said julian he took the map from tinker as soon as he arrived there and sat down to look at it he ran his finger down the shaft to the bottom and then jabbed at a round mark drawn there see that thats a hole at the bottom of the shaft through which seawater is coming its high tide now so the water is seeping into the shaft but its only about a foot deep at low tide there wouldnt be a single drop coming in wouldnt i love to know where that watertunnel went to up to the surface of the rocks through them to somewhere a good way off or what an undersea tunnel said george her eyes bright why dont we explore it sometime when the tide is out well wed have to be pretty certain we wouldnt suddenly be drowned said julian rolling up the map very interesting isnt it i suppose the hole was left in case the constant push of water there when the tide was in might undermine the foundation better to have the shaft half full of water than eaten away by constant tides well began anne and then suddenly stopped in fright a stentorian voice came up the stairway and made everyone jump violently anyone at home hey anyone at home chapter fifteen jacob is in trouble whos that shouting like that said anne fearfully it cant be the robber can it of course not said julian and went to the door of the livingroom he yelled down the stairway who is it what do you want its the police shouted back the enormous voice oh come on up then said julian relieved footsteps could be heard coming up the iron stairway accompanied by loud puffs and pants then a policemans helmet appeared followed by his shoulders and the rest of him soon he was standing in the livingroom beaming round at the surprised company panting with the effort of climbing so many stairs how did you get in asked george we jammed the door shut from the inside well i managed to unjam it miss said the policeman mopping his forehead and smiling he was the same policeman that julian had seen that afternoon not much protection that really you ought to get a new key made how did you get over here the tides in said julian you couldnt have walked over demons rocks no sir i got jem hardys boat said the policeman by the way my names sharp sir police constable sharp a very good name for a policeman said julian with a cheerful grin well have you caught the thief who took our key and the other things no sir but ive a pretty good idea who it is said sharp i couldnt find anyone whod been silting on the quay during the time you were away from the lighthouse sir but i did by chance find a lady whose windows look down on the jetty and she happened to see someone standing about there she said he went over the rocks to the lighthouse who was it the milkman the postman asked dick oh no sir i told your friend they were good fellows said the constable looking quite shocked it was er well sir a man whos a bit of a bad lot whos that asked julian suddenly afraid it might be old jeremiah could he be a bad lot he had sounded such a good fellow well sir its no one you know said sharp its one of a family with rather a bad name sir a man called jacob jacob loomer sir he comes of a family that used to do a bit of wrecking and wrecking old jeremiah was telling us of longago wreckers said dick one was called nosey and another was called bart relations of a wellknown wrecker called oneear er oneear bill said sharp ah yes oneear bill he lived a long time ago when old jeremiah was a young man this here jacob the one that was seen going into your lighthouse today would be his greatgreatgreat grandson i reckon something like that living image of old oneear bill according to jeremiah theres a bad strain in that family cant seem to get it out well you say it was jacob who came into the light house why cant we have him arrested then said julian and make him give up the key he took and the other things well sir if youll come along with me and identify your things maybe i can do something about it said the constable but he may have hidden them all by now though hes that freehanded i wouldnt be surprised if he hasnt given them all away a bit of a fool jacob is as well as a rogue ah hed have liked the job of wrecking ships he would right up his street ill come with you now said julian the others dont need to do they oh no youll do sir said the policeman and he and julian went down the spiral stairway to the entrance the others heard the door bang and looked at one another well to think that a greatgreatgreat grandson of that horrid old oneear bill is still living in the same place as the old wrecker himself did said dick and hes a rogue too history repeating itself we must go and see the wreckers cave tomorrow if we can said george jeremiah boogie said he would show it to us so long as there isnt an old old wrecker hiding there said anne older than jeremiah boogie with a beard down to his feet a sort of old man of the sea with a horrid gurgling voice and eyes like a fish really anne said george astonished ill be scared to go into caves if you say things like that i wonder how julians getting on said tinker mischief stop jigging up and down you make me feel out of breath julian was at jacobs house and there sure enough were the things he had stolen the rug the clock and annes purse empty now and what about the key demanded the constable come on now you took the key out of the door of the lighthouse we know you did give it here jacob i didnt take it said jacob sullenly ill have to take you in you know jacob said the constable youll be searched at the policestation better give up the key now search me all you like said jacob you wont find that key on me i tell you i didnt take it what would i want that key for for the same reason that you usually want keys for said the constable for breaking in and stealing all right jacob if you wont let this young gentleman have his key ill have you searched at the policestation come along with me but alas no key was found on the surly jacob and the constable shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows at julian if you take my advice sir id get a different lock put on your door jacobs got your key somewhere hell be at the lighthouse again as soon as he sees you all go out bah said jacob rudely you and your keys i tell you i didnt take it there wasnt a key there come along with me jacob said the constable he turned to julian well thats all sir well have his house searched the odds are that hes hidden the key somewhere hes an artful dodger this one julian went back to the lighthouse rather worried it might take a few days in a little place like this to have a new lock put in in the meantime they would either have to keep themselves prisoners in the lighthouse or leave a front door that anyone could open the others listened excitedly to his tale when he went back they were glad to have the rug the clock and the purse again though anne was sad that all her money was gone well have to get a new lock and key said julian after all this lighthouse has only been lent to us and its our responsibility to look after it and all it contains its a good thing it was only our things that were taken not professor haylings its getting rather late said anne jumping up we havent had our tea yet ill get it anyone feel like buns with butter and jam everyone did and soon anne produced a large plate of delicious looking buns they talked as they drank their tea and ate the buns i vote we go and find jeremiah boogie tomorrow and see if hes heard of the robbery and if he has anything interesting to say about it said george and also we really must get him to show us the wreckers cave said julian by the way what were the names of the two men who have the job of showing the visitors round the caves im pretty sure one was jacob youre right it was and the other man was called ebenezer said dick well lets hope jacob is locked up or out of the way somewhere when we go to see the caves we shall get some black looks from him if not well we can give him some back said george putting on a terrific scowl and making timmy give a sudden whine she patted him its all right timmy that scowl wasnt for you wed better go to the caves tomorrow morning when the tide will be more or less out said julian and id better see if i can find a locksmith here who can give us a new lock and key quickly why not slip out now said dick ill come with you for a bit of fresh air want to come girls no id like to finish my book said anne and george said the same tinker was playing with mischief and he didnt want to come either well you and the lighthouse will be safe with timmy and mischief to look after you said julian and down the stairway he went with dick close behind him the locksmith promised to come and look at the door in the next day or two cant leave my shop just now he said nobody to see to it itll take me a few days to do the job for you im afraid sir oh blow said julian weve already had a thief in the lighthouse we dont like to go out and leave it empty now they rowed back to the lighthouse shut and jammed the door as best they could and went up to the girls timmy gave them an uproarious welcome and mischief took a flying leap from a chairback on to dicks shoulder no lock or key for a few days said dick sitting down and tickling the delighted little monkey i did want to go and see the caves tomorrow especially the famous wreckers one but we cant possibly leave the lighthouse empty woof said timmy at once he says why not leave him behind and let him guard it said george solemnly and timmy at once said woof again they all laughed dick patted timmy and ruffled the fur behind his ears dear old tim all right you guard the lighthouse you shall have a very special bone for a reward thats settled then we leave timmy here on guard and we all go off to the caves said julian well one of the brothers who show visitors round will be missing tomorrow i fear jacob will not be there i bet well get some scowls from the other brother whats his name now ebenezer said anne well have to be careful that we dont get pushed into a deep pool of water dear me yes said julian one never knows well certainly be on our guard chapter sixteen down in the caves next morning george awoke with a jump timmy was pushing her gently with his nose what is it tim said george timmy gave a bark and ran to where the spiral stairway led downwards go down and tell the boys what it is you want said george sleepily so down the stairway went timmy and into the room where the boys were sleeping he trotted in and nudged julian with his nose but julian was so fast asleep that he didnt stir timmy pawed at him and julian awoke with a jump he sat up oh its you tim what on earth do you want is anything wrong with the girls woof said timmy and ran to the spiral stairway he disappeared down it barking blow hes heard someone said julian yawning well if its ebenezer or jacob no it cant be jacob of course ill tell him what i think of people who steal he unjammed the door of the lighthouse and opened it on the step stood two milkbottles well really timmy fancy waking me because the milkman came said julian taking in the bottles good old milkman i wonder if he had to come by boat the seas pretty high this morning but i suppose he could just about have waded over the rocks at breakfast the five remembered that they meant to see the caves that morning they had a very fine meal of fried bacon bought the day before and eggs with buttered toast and marmalade to follow anne had made some good hot coffee and they all enjoyed themselves immensely mischief made himself a real nuisance by putting a paw deep in the marmalade jar and then when smacked running all over the place leaving sticky marmaladey marks everywhere wed better all take a wet rag with us as we go about the room said anne in disgust hes run over the table and desk and everything bad mischief i do so hate feeling sticky mischief was sad to feel himself in disgrace and leapt on to tinkers shoulder putting his sticky paws lovingly round the boys neck thats right said tinker rub all your stickiness off on me you little monkey well wash up in the sink and you boys can tidy up the rooms said anne then well all go out its a lovely day looks a bit stormy to me said dick what do you say tim tim agreed he thumped his tail vigorously on the floor making mischief pounce on it in joy anne gathered up the crockery and took it to the sink in an hour or so they were ready to go out lets write a card to aunt fanny before we leave said anne then that will be done we wont say a word about the things that were stolen though she might feel upset and tell us to go back and then what would uncle quentin and professor hayling say i bet theyre having a wonderful time arguing all day long working out figures and studying papers said julian and im pretty certain that aunt fanny will have to call them to a meal at least twenty times before they arrive at the table anne wrote the postcard and put on a stamp now im ready she said standing up timmy ran to the top of the stairs glad that everyone seemed to be on the move at last he did so love a walk darling timmy said george im afraid youll have to be left behind to guard the lighthouse you see we havent a key and we cant jam the door from outside so please timmy dear stay behind on guard you know what that means dont you on guard timmys tail went right down he gave a small whine he did so hate being left out of anything especially a walk he pawed gently at george as if to say do please change your mind on guard timmy now said george the lighthouse is in your charge dont let anyone in youd better lie on the mat just inside the entrance timmy ran slowly down behind julian and the others looking very mournful indeed now lie there said george and gave him a pat on the head well take you out again soon and then one of us will stay to guard the lighthouse but this time we all want to go out on guard timmy lay down on the mat and put his head on his paws his big brown eyes looking up at george dear old faithful she said ruffling the hair on his head we wont be very long they slammed the door and went down the lighthouse steps the tide was still out far enough for them to be able to wade over the rocks to the jetty we must be back before its well in said julian or well have to stay ashore till its out again our boat is tied to the lighthouse post remember they went for a stroll along the front and who should be there sitting on a stone seat but old jeremiah boogie smoking his long pipe staring solemnly out to sea goodmorning jeremiah said dick politely i hope we bought the right tobacco for you from tom oh aye said jeremiah puffing out very strongsmelling smoke hallo little monkey so youve come to my shoulder again have you well whats the news from monkeyland the others laughed as mischief at once poured out a stream of monkeychatter into the old mans ear we thought we would go and see the caves today said julian especially the old wreckers cave now dont you let that ebenezer take you round said the old man at once you wont find jacob there oho i know whats happened to him and serve him right never could keep his fingers to himself that one ebenezers as bad he could steal the buttons off your coat and youd never know now look what about me showing you the caves i know them inside out and i can show you things that that rat of an ebenezer doesnt even know of well wed certainly much rather you took us and not ebenezer said julian ebenezer may be feeling rather angry because we told the police about his brother stealing things well give you some more tobacco i mean baccy if youll guide us round well lets go now said jeremiah getting up very spryly this way and off they all went mischief too the little monkey did jeremiah the honour of sitting on his shoulder all the way down the village street the old old man was delighted to see how everyone stared and laughed he took them round the foot of some very high cliffs they came to a rocky beach farther along and walked over it theres the entrance said the old man pointing to a large hole in the cliff nearby thats the way to the caves got a torch yes we brought one each said julian patting his pocket do we have to pay to go in no people give ebenezer a tip five pence or so if he shows them round or jacob when hes there said jeremiah ill deal with ebby though dont you waste your money on that scoundrel the hole in the cliff led to the first cave which was a big one lighted lanterns hung here and there but gave very little light mind your step now warned jeremiah its real slippery in places this way through this old arch it was cold and damp in the cave and the children had to go carefully and avoid the puddles left by the sea then suddenly jeremiah turned a corner and went in a completely different direction down and down and down they went hey were going towards the sea now surely said julian in surprise do the caves go under the sea then not away back into the cliff thats right said jeremiah this is a real rocky coast and the way were taking leads down a tunnel under the rocks and then into the caves deep under ground see the rocky roof over our heads well if you listen you can hear the sea now mumbling and grumbling over it that roof is the bed of the sea that was a very strange thought indeed and rather alarming anne gazed fearfully up at the rocky roof overhead and shone her torch on it halfexpecting to see a few cracks leaking saltwater from the sea rolling over the rocky roof but no there was a little moisture shining on it and that was all are we soon coming to the wreckers cave asked george mischief stop making those noises theres nothing to be scared of mischief didnt like this cold dark strange walk underground and had begun to make harsh frightened noises and then suddenly gave a loud scared screech dont you made me jump said anne goodness listen to the monkeys screech echoing all along the tunnel and back sounds like a hundred monkeys chattering at once our voices echo too mischief was most alarmed to hear the enormous amount of screeches and chattering noises that now filled the tunnel he began to cry almost like a baby and clung to tinker as if he would never let him go i expect he thinks this place is absolutely full of screeching monkeys said anne sorry for the terrified little creature its only the echo mischief hell soon get used to it said tinker hugging the monkey close to him you want to hear the echo just round the next bend of the tunnel said jeremiah stroking the little monkey and very foolishly gave an enormous yell just as they got there the yell came back ten times as loud and the tunnel seemed suddenly full of shouts tumbling over one another everyone jumped violently and mischief leapt high in the air in terror he sprang to the ground and scampered away at top speed wailing in his little monkeyvoice he tore down the tunnel tail in air and disappeared round the corner tinker was very upset mischief come back he yelled youll get lost and along came the echo at once get lost get lost get lost lost lost dont you worry about your monkey said jeremiah comfortingly ive had a score of monkeys in my time and they always come back well ill jolly well stay down here till mischief does come back said tinker in rather a shaky voice they came out into a cave this too was lighted by lanterns though very poorly they had all heard the murmur of voices as they came to it and wondered who was there three other visitors were in the cave sightseeing like the children a big burly fellow was with them with jetblack hair deepset dark eyes and a surly mouth so like jacob that julian guessed at once that he was the brother ebenezer as soon as ebenezer set eyes on jeremiah he roared in fury you get out this is my job you get out ill show the caves to those youngsters and with that such a battle of words followed that the five were almost deafened especially as the echo repeated everything very loudly indeed the three visitors fled away up the tunnel fearing a fight anne was very frightened and clung to julian ebenezer came shouting up to old jeremiah his hand raised havent i told you moren a hundred times to keep out of these caves havent i told you im the one to show folks around and jacob too dont take no notice of him said jeremiah turning his back on the angry man hes nought but a big mouth same as his brother jacob look out yelled julian as the angry ebenezer rushed at jeremiah his fist raised to strike him look out chapter seventeen mischief again and a surprise jeremiah saw the angry man coming at him and very neatly sidestepped ebenezer couldnt stop stepped heavily on a strand of very slippery seaweed and went sprawling into a corner ho said jeremiah delighted very nice ebenezer get up and run at me again hed better not said julian in his most grownup voice i shall report him to the police if he does and that will make a pair of them in two days jacob got into trouble yesterday and now it will be ebenezer ebenezer got up scowling and glared at jeremiah who grinned back in delight coming at me again ebby he said its grand fun to hit an old man isnt it but ebenezer was very much afraid that julian would do what he had threatened and report him to the police he rubbed his shoulder where it had struck a piece of rock and debated what to do come along said jeremiah to the five watching children ill take you down to the wreckers cave ebby can come too if so be he can behave hisself but mebbe hed like to run away home and get his shoulder looked to that was enough for ebby he determined to follow the little company and made rude remarks all the time so he tailed them and shouted at them from a safe distance how they wished they had timmy with them he would have made short work of the rude ebenezer dont take any notice of him said julian lead on jeremiah my word isnt it dark in this tunnel good thing we all brought good torches the tunnel came to an end at last and opened out into an extraordinary cave the roof was unexpectedly high and the irregular sides were ridged with shelves of rocks on the shelves were dirty old boxes a crate or two and some sacks what in the world are those asked dick shining his torch on them well young sir theyre just what they look like ordinary boxes and sacks said jeremiah put there by ebenezer and jacob to fool people they tells everybody theyre what the old wreckers got out of ships they wrecked years ago hoohoohoo anybody that believes those lies deserves to be fooled theyre all from ebbys backyard seen them lying there meself hoohoohoo his hoohooing laugh echoed round the cave and ebenezer made an angry growling noise rather like a dog im not going to fool these kids said jeremiah you and your sacks and boxes i know where the old things are the real old things oh yes i do theyre no better than the sacks and boxes there wherever they are said ebby in a growling voice youre lying old jeremiah you dont know nothing take us on farther said dick there must be more caves i think this is exciting is this really where the old wreckers hid the things they salvaged from the wrecks they caused or just a tale oh this is their cave thats true enough dressed up a bit by ebby there said jeremiah but i know the caves farther on ebby doesnt hes too skeered to go farther under the sea aint you ebby ebby said something that sounded rude julian turned to jeremiah eagerly oh do take us farther if it isnt dangerous well im going farther on anyway said tinker suddenly mischief hasnt come back so he must be lost and im going to find him julian saw that tinker was quite determined right he said well come with you jeremiah lead the way but its not really dangerous is it i mean we dont want to find the sea sweeping through these caves right up to where we are tides not on the turn yet said jeremiah were all right for a while when it comes in it swirls up this passage here but it stops at the wreckers cave thats just too high for it see the tunnel runs downwards fast now it goes right under your lighthouse have you seen it down at the bottom of the shaft good gracious yes said julian remembering i went down it and the sea was swirling in and out at openings in the bottom of the shaft do you mean to say that the sea that rises in the shaft at high tide comes racing up into these tunnels too aye that it does said jeremiah you can get from here to the lighthouse under the rocky seabed right to that foundation shaft but nobody dares tide comes in so quickly you might get caught and drownded ebby at once shouted something rude again it sounded as if he was telling jeremiah to go and get drownded too do lets go on farther said dick come on jeremiah so jeremiah led them farther on under the rocky bed of the sea it was strange and rather frightening to hear the constant noise of the water racing over the roof of the winding tunnel their torches lighted up slimy walls and rocky shelves and hollows you know this would have been a very good place to hide treasure said julian glancing up at a dark hollow in the roof of the tunnel though i dont know how anyone would set about looking for it there are hundreds of nooks and crannies and isnt it cold in this tunnel well the suns rays never penetrate down here said dick my word the sea sounds pretty loud now i wish we could find mischief said anne to george look at poor tinker hes crying hes pretending not to but i could see the tears rolling down his cheeks last time i flashed my torch on him they stopped to look at something a strange jellylike thing like an enormous sea anemone ebby caught them up and bumped into dick he rounded on ebby at once keep off follow us if you like but dont come so near we dont like you ebby took no notice but kept as close behind everyone as he possibly could and dick realized that he was probably feeling very scared then as they rounded another corner of the tunnel and saw yet another cave tinker gave a yell that echoed everywhere mischief look there he is mischief and sure enough there was the little monkey crouched under a small shelf of rock shivering in fright he wouldnt even go running to tinker tinker had to pick him up and hug him mischief poor mischief were you very frightened he said youre trembling all over you shouldnt have run away you might have been lost for ever mischief had something clutched in his tiny paw he chattered to tinker and put his little furry arms round his neck as he did so he opened one paw and something fell out and rolled over the rocky floor what have you dropped mischief said dick and shone his torch down on to the floor of the cave something was glittering there something round and yellow everyone stared and a shock of excitement went through julian who was nearest a gold coin he cried and picked it up as bright as when it was minted mischief where did you get it from look dick look george its gold all right immediately everyone was full of the greatest excitement one thought only in their heads the treasure mischief must have found the treasure it was an old coin very old where could mischief have found it oh lets go farther on and see cried dick jeremiah it must bc the treasure mischief will lead us to it but mischief would do nothing of the sort he was not going to lose himself again he was going to sit on tinkers shoulders with an arm safely round the boys neck he hadnt liked being lost all by himself in the dark jeremiah would not go any farther either he shook his head no not today young sirs tide will soon be sweeping up these tunnels faster than we can walk better turn back now in case were caught manys the visitor thats had to run for his life when the tide came up all of a sudden georges sharp ears caught the sound of swooshswoosh somewhere the tide had crept in come on she said wed better do what jeremiah says the seas coming up the tunnel now as well as over it and soon it will be sweeping up the beach too and in at the cliffpassages well be caught in the middle and have to stay here for ages no need for alarm missy said old jeremiah theres a bit of time yet hallo wheres ebenezer gone blow he must have heard us talking about mischiefs gold piece said george i forgot all about him now he knows that mischief has found a gold coin hell feel sure that the treasure may be somewhere down here and hell look for it as soon as ever he can why didnt we keep quiet about it i forgot he was standing near us groaned dick well i suppose the whole of demons rocks village will know by now that a monkey has found the treasure and hordes of sightseers will swarm down here hoping to find it it must have been put in a pretty dry place surely for that coin to be so bright and untarnished buck up wed better go back as quickly as possible said julian look at old jeremiah hes too thrilled for words hes planning to find the treasure himself at the earliest possible moment well i vote we have a shot at it ourselves tomorrow said dick excitement welling up in him at the thought good old mischief youre better than any detective then away up the tunnels they went making all kinds of plans what an excitement chapter eighteen back in the lighthouse and an exciting talk old jeremiah was as excited as the others but he said very little he was angry to think that ebenezer should have been there to see the find he didnt trust that ebby nor that jacob either theyd be ferreting after that treasure as sure as nuts were nuts and monkeys were monkeys ha wouldnt they like to know where it was he stumped on up the old tunnels thinking hard and at last they came out into the welcome daylight again here jeremiah buy yourself some more baccy said julian putting twenty pence into the old mans hand and dont count too much on that treasure i expect its just an odd coin that mischief found in a dry corner somewhere thank you young sir said the old man im not wanting the treasure myself im just hoping that ebby and jacob dont find it theyll be hunting all the time for it now they were glad to be out in the open again the sun had gone now and the wind had whipped up it was raining hard i say wed better buck up else we shant be able to walk back to the lighthouse over the rocks said julian worried but fortunately the wind was against the tide and they just had time to wade over to the lighthouse steps theres our little boat bobbingabout said tinker and hark i can hear old timmy barking hes heard us coming so he had he had been lying on the doormat his ears glued to the crack under the door listening listening nobody had come near the lighthouse and not a sound did old timmy hear but the wind and the sea and a few gulls gliding by were back timmy yelled george and she pushed at the door it opened and timmy leapt out almost knocking her over mischief sprang on to the dogs back and chattered at him without stopping hes telling him about the gold coin he found said tinker with a laugh oh i wish youd been with us timmy it was grand it feels as if weve been away for ages said george but it isnt very late after all unless my watch is slow im hungry lets have something to eat and talk about everything and what were going to do so over biscuits and sandwiches and coffee they talked and talked we must get down to the caves again as soon as possible said george im absolutely certain that jacob and ebby will be down there hunting for coins as soon as the tides out again well we cant do anything today thats certain said dick for one thing the tides in now and for another thing its blowing up for a storm just hark at the wind timmy was sitting as close to george as he possibly could he hadnt liked her going out without him she sat with her arm round him eating her biscuits occasionally giving him half of one tinker was doing the same with mischief the children talked and talked where could mischief have found that coin was it one on its own that the sea had swept into the tunnel or was it part of a whole lot of coins had it come from an ironbound box whose wooden sides had rotted away they talked endlessly their eyes bright the round gold coin on the table in front of them i suppose it would be treasuretrove if we found it said dick i mean it would be so old that it would belong to the crown and not to anyone in particular i expect wed be allowed to keep a few coins ourselves said george if only we could go straightaway now and hunt in that tunnel i feel as if i cant wait woof said timmy agreeing though he really hadnt much idea of what they were talking about i say listen to the sea crashing over the rocks between us and the jetty said julian startled at the sudden booming the wind must be working up to a gale well bad weathers been forecast for some time saicl dick gloomily blow itll be jolly difficult rowing to and fro in that little bobabout boat i doubt if wed be able to walk across the rocks even at low tide with a big sea running before the wind oh dont be so gloomy said anne well do you want us to be prisoners here in the lighthouse demanded dick it wouldnt matter theres plenty of food said anne no there isnt remember there are five of us and timmy and mischief as well said dick shut up dick said julian youre scaring anne and tinker this storm will soon blow over well be able to pop out and do some shopping tomorrow but the storm grew fiercer and the sky became so dark that anne lighted the lamps rain slashed against the lighthouse and the wind made a loud howling noise that made timmy growl deep down in his throat anne went to look out of the window she felt frightened when she saw the great waves that came surging over the rocks below some of them broke on the rocks and the spray flew so high that it spattered the window out of which she was looking she drew back in alarm do you know what hit the window then it was spray from a great wave whew said julian and went to the window himself what a wonderful sight the sea was grey now not blue and it raced along towards the shore great waves curling over into white manes spray flying out to sea there were angry waves too topped with white which turned into spray as the strong wind caught them only a few gulls were out screaming in excitement allowing the wind to take them along on their great white wings well i certainly wouldnt mind being a gull today said dick it must be a wonderful feeling to ride on a storm no wonder they are screaming in joy eeoo eeoo eeooo eeooooo cried the gulls sounding like cats mewing in hunger im sorry for the strips out in this said julian goodness think of the sailingships in the olden days caught on this rocky coast in a wind like this its almost a hurricane and think of that wicked old oneear bill gloating when he saw a ship sailing nearer and nearer the rocks said george and even taking the warninglamp out of its place on the cliff and bringing it near here to make sure that any ships out that night would make straight for the rocks crash dont said anne i hate to think of things like that lets have a game said julian where are the cards move that lamp a bit closer to the table dick its getting so jolly dark now no more talk of wrecks think of something cheerful teasup for instance the treasure and you know i think it would be quite easy to find the treasure said dick bringing the lamp close to the table mischief is a very clever little thing im sure he would remember where he found that coin and lead us straight to the place it might have been just an odd coin dropped by the man who hid the hoard said anne it might but wherever it was found i think we can safely say that the main hoard wouldnt be very far away said dick well if we do go hunting well have to go when the tide is well out said julian i dont really fancy scrabbling about in those caves and tunnels under the rocky seabed when i know that somehow or other when the tide is coming in the water gets under the seabed as well as on it dick sat frowning thinking out something ju he said at last you remember the direction we went in as soon as we were underground this morning we went leftish all the way didnt we yes we did said tinker at once i had my little compass with me look it clips to my wristwatch and we went sharp west all the time towards the lighthouse that would be said julian and drew a quick plan see heres the lighthouse say and just here is the entrance into the cliff where we first went heres the path we took curving right back to the sea again under the rocky beach here it goes and thats a cave see then more tunnel and caves the way always curving sharply to the left a bit farther on and wed have been almost under the lighthouse said dick in amazement thats right said julian and maybe in the old days before this lighthouse was built and ships were sent crashing on the rocks on which it now stands there was a tunnel down from those lighthouse rocks that joined up with the tunnel we were in this morning so that the wreckers would find it very easy to stow away anything valuable they found in a wrecked ship without being seen whew you mean they waited till the ship smashed up then waded over the rocks as we do took what they could find and disappeared down a tunnel there to hide it and came out the other end said anne george stared at julian and her eyes were bright maybe the tunnel is still somewhere in these rocks she said somewhere down at the edge of them because we know the sea gets into the tunnel julian lets look for it tomorrow i think youre right there may be a hole in the rocks here somewhere that drops down into the tunnel we were in nobody wanted to play a game after that they felt much too excited they studied julians plan again and again glad that tinkers little compass had shown him so clearly that morning that the undersea passages had led due west to the lighthouse rocks do you suppose that everyone has forgotten the old hole said dick nobody has told us anything about it not even jeremiah do you think it may have been blocked up julian frowned thinking hard well yes it may have been he said it is queer that jeremiah didnt say anything about it anyway well have a good hunt tomorrow and if we find it well drop down and hunt for the treasure said tinker his eyes shining what a shock for ebenezer and jacob if we find it first chapter nineteen a nasty shock the storm blew itself out that evening and next day was much calmer the sky still looked angry and rain fell now and again but it was possible to get out of the lighthouse door in the morning and go down the steps on to the rocks shall we go shopping first or look for the hole said julian look for the hole said dick promptly the wind is still pretty strong and the storm might blow up again just look at that angry sky we wouldnt be able to mess about round the edge of the rocks if the sea gets any rougher they spread out and went cautiously over the great rocks on which the lighthouse was built at low tide the rocks stood well up out of the sea the lighthouse was built on the highest part and seemed to tower over the searchers as they clambered here and there seeking for any hole that looked as if it might lead down into some tunnel below heres a hole called anne suddenly and they all clambered over to her in excitement timmy too julian looked down to where anne was pointing yes it does look a likely one he said big enough to take a man too ill climb down and see he slid down the hole holding on to projecting pieces of rock as he went the others watched thrilled timmy barked he didnt like to see julian disappearing like this but before julian quite disappeared he shouted again im afraid its no good its come to a sudden end im standing on firm rock and though ive felt all round it with my feet theres no opening anywhere its a blind end what a disappointment blow said dick lying down on the rocks and putting his arm down the hole to help julian to climb up again i had high hopes then julian heres my hand do you want any help thanks it is a bit difficult said julian he climbed up with difficulty and squeezed out of the hole thankfully i wouldnt like to get wedged in here he said especially with the tide coming in its beginning to pour with rain again said anne shall we go shopping now or wait a bit oh lets wait said george im cold and wet now lets go into the lighthouse and make some hot coffee what a disappointment never mind we can always go down the tunnels we were in yesterday and search around maybe mischief will show us where he found the gold coin they all went into the lighthouse and once more julian jammed the door i wish that locksmith would come he said if we go down into the caves well have to leave old timmy behind on guard and it is such a shame woof said timmy heartily agreeing they all went upstairs and anne began to make the coffee as they were sitting drinking it timmy suddenly sprang to his feet with a most bloodcurdling growl everyone jumped and anne spilt her coffee timmy whats up said george in alarm timmy was standing with his nose towards the closed door of the room his hackles rising up on his neck he looked truly fierce what on earth is the matter tim said julian going to the door there cant be anyone on the stairway the entrance doors jammed timmy raced out of the door as soon as julian opened it and tore down the spiral stairway at such a speed that he fell and rolled to the bottom george gave a terrified scream timmy have you hurt yourself but timmy leapt to his feet at once and ran to the entrance door growling so ferociously that anne felt really frightened julian ran down and went to the door it was still well and truly jammed timmy maybe its just the poor milkman come with some milk again he said and unjammed the door he took hold of the handle to open it it wouldnt open julian pulled and tugged but it was of no use the door simply would not open by this time everyone was down beside him let me try said dick the door must just have stuck no he couldnt open it either julian looked gravely round at everyone im afraid very much afraid that somebody has locked us in he said there was a horrified silence then george cried out in anger locked us in how dare they whos done this well i think we can guess said julian it was whoever came and stole our key the other day ebenezer no jacob cried dick one of the two anyway how dare they what are we to do we cant get out why have they done this this silly wicked thing im afraid its because they think we might go looking for the treasure and find it said julian his face grave we felt sure that mischief might remember where he had found that gold coin and lead us there and im pretty sure they think the same so this is their way of making sure they have time to find the treasure before we do theyre wicked theyre wicked cried george taking hold of the handle of the door and pulling it violently were prisoners dont pull the handle off old thing said julian that wouldnt help at all lets go upstairs and talk about it well have to think of some way out of this unexpected difficulty they went soberly upstairs again and sat down in the livingroom yes they were certainly prisoners what are we going to do said dick we are in a real fix julian yes youre right said julian looking worried we cant get out of the lighthouse thats certain on the other hand how can we get help no telephone shouting would never be heard cant use our boat no one would ever know we are prisoners theyve seen us going in and out of the lighthouse and if we suddenly dont appear any more theyll simply think we have gone home and that the lighthouse is empty again we shall die of starvation said anne scared oh no i expect we shall think of something said dick seeing that anne was really frightened all the same its a puzzle we cant get out and no one can get in whoever locked that door has certainly taken the key away with him they talked and they talked and finally they felt hungry so they had a meal though they felt that they ought to eat sparingly in case their food ran short too quickly and i feel so hungry complained george i keep feeling hungry here thats what i told you living in a lighthouse somehow makes you feel hungry all the time said tinker well try and catch the milkman tomorrow morning said julian suddenly lets see now we could write a note and push it under the door so that he would see it tomorrow when he comes we could put help we are locked in it would blow away said george you know it would we could pin it down our side and then it wouldnt said anne half of it would still stick out under the door well its worth trying said dick and immediately wrote out the note on a large sheet of paper he shot downstairs to pin it to the mat and shoved half the paper underneath so that it stuck out on the other side of the door he ran back upstairs i dont for a moment think that the milkman will come across the rocks in this weather he said theyll be almost impassable still well hope for the best there didnt seem anything else to do the evening came early for the sky was very dark again and the wind once more got up and howled dismally even the gulls decided that it was no longer a good idea to glide to and fro they played games that evening and tried to laugh and make jokes but secretly everyone was worried suppose that the stormy weather went on and on and nobody guessed they were locked in the lighthouse and the milkman didnt bring any milk and didnt see the note and they ate all their food and cheer up everyone said julian seeing the dismal looks around the table weve been in worse fixes than this well i dont think we have said anne i just cant see any way out of this one there was rather a long silence during which timmy sighed heavily as if he too was worrying only the monkey seemed cheerful and went headoverheels at top speed round the room sitting up for laughs at the end but nobody laughed nobody even seemed to notice him mischief felt very sad and crept over to timmy for comfort there is one idea that might be a good one said julian at last its been running round in my mind for a while and im not sure whether its possible or not anyway its one we might try tomorrow if help doesnt come what asked everyone at once and timmy lifted his head and whined as if he too quite understood well do you remember that i went down that foundation shaft said julian and saw the water swirling at the bottom now do you suppose its at all possible that that shaft was bored down through a natural hole and the lighthouse builders chose to put the foundation shaft there because there was a readymade shaft they could use a fine hole going right down through the rock and they made the hole into a cementlined shaft strong and everlasting so that the lighthouse would never be at the mercy of waves and wind but would stand firm whatever happened this was a new idea to everyone and it took a little while to sink in then dick smacked the tabletop and made them all jump julian youve got it yes that strong cementlined shaft runs down a natural hole and that hole must be the one weve been looking for the one that connects up with the tunnels we were in this morning no wonder we couldnt find it when we hunted all over the rocks the shaftmakers used it there was silence again everyone was taking this in even tinker julian looked round the table and smiled have you all jumped to it he said if that is the hole we were looking for what about one of us going down that iron ladder again to the bottom and finding out if it does lead into the tunnel we were in today and walking through it and up the passage and coming out through the cliff entrance we used this morning said george julian what an absolutely wonderful idea we could escape that way what a shock for ebby and jacob well do it somehow well do it chapter twenty down the shaft and into the tunnel it was a most exciting idea to think that the iron ladder in the great cementlined shaft might possibly lead to the tunnel they had been into that morning julian had seen water swirling at the bottom when the tide was in possibly if they went down it when the tide was going out there would be no danger of being trapped the storm was very fitful now sometimes it came back again and then the wind blew so hard that it seemed as if the buffeted lighthouse must fall rain fell in torrents that night and during the dark early hours of the morning when the tide was in great waves pounded over the rocks sending spray almost over the top of the lighthouse julian awoke and looked out of the bedroom window in awe i hope theres no ship out anywhere near here tonight he said and then gave a sudden exclamation whats that something swept right across the sky its the beam from the new lighthouse at high cliffs said dick i saw it last night it must have a very powerful beam mustnt it to show even on a night like this they watched for a little while and then julian yawned lets try to go to sleep he said we thought we were going away for a nice little holiday and bang were in the middle of something again well lets hope that we come out of it all right said dick settling down in his rugs once more i must say that i feel a bit cut off from civilization at the moment night julian in the morning the storm was still about and the wind was terrific julian ran down to the entrance door to see if the milkman could possibly have come and had seen their message for help but no the paper was still half on their side flapping on the mat obviously the milkman hadnt dared to cross the rocks that morning either on foot or by boat dick had looked out of the window to make sure that tlieir boat was still safely moored to the post and to his surprise and distress it was no longer there tinker was very upset wheres my little boat gone has somebody stolen it maybe or possibly the storm broke the mooringrope and the boat was smashed to pieces on the rocks said julian anyway its gone poor old tinker what a shame tinker was very sad and mischief tried to comfort him doing all sorts of silly tricks to make him laugh but tinker wouldnt laugh he really was right down in the dumps they had rather a sparse breakfast and were very silent anne cleared away and washed up and then julian called them all together well now we must decide about this descent down the shaft to what we hope will be the tunnel we were in yesterday he said i am going down myself toss for it said dick at once theres no reason why i shouldnt go is there or what ahout us both going in case the other gets into trouble and needs help not a bad idea said julian except that there wont be anyone to look after the girls and tinker woof said timmy indignantly standing up at once julian laughed and patted him its all right timmy i just wanted to see if you thought you could guard them well all right dick and i will go down the shaft the sooner the better we simply must go while the tide is out what about now dick solemnly they all went down the spiral stairway to the entrance door where the trap was that opened on to the great shaft julian pulled up the lid and gazed down into blackness he shone his torch down but he could not see the bottom well here goes he said and lowered himself down into the shaft his feet seeking the rungs of the iron ladder keep cheerful girls well get through the tunnels and passages and to the entrance in the cliff and fetch help for you in no time at all julian please take care said anne in a shaky voice please please do take care down went julian his torch now held between his teeth after him went dick the girls shone their own torches down the shaft but soon the boys were so far down that they could not be seen only their voices came up now and again sounding very hollow and peculiar were at the bottom shouted julian at last its rock and theres no water at present weve a clear way to follow i crawled out of the hole at the bottom and theres some kind of tunnel there all right were off now crawling out and into the tunnel cheer up all of you see you soon and then the queer hollow voice stopped and the girls and tinker heard nothing more timmy began to whine he couldnt understand these queer goingson at all julian and dick were feeling rather pleased with themselves it hadnt been very difficult to squeeze out of the arches at the bottom ofthe shaft now they were in a dark narrow tunnel whose roof sometimes came down so low that they had to bend double it smelt damp and seaweedy but there seemed to be plenty of air in fact at times quite a little breeze seemed to flow round them i shall be glad when we come into a tunnel we recognize said julian at last we surely must be near where we were yesterday hallo whats this dick look dick dick looked to where julians torch was shining and gave a shout a gold coin another one we must be near where old mischief ran off to yesterday look theres another and another where on earth did they come from the boys shone their torches all around and saw at last where the coins had fallen from above their head was a dark hole running up into the rock as they shone their torches on it a gold coin slid out and dropped down to join the others this is where mischief found the coin cried dick julian there must be a box or something up there which is rotting away and letting out the money it contains bit by bit whoever would have guessed at such a hidingplace said julian marvelling as he shone his torch above his head theres absolutely nothing to be seen except that dark hole no box nothing it must have been pushed right into a recess at the side of the hole by someone who knew a good hidingplace was there give me a legup so that i can put in my hand and feel said dick buck up this is too exciting for words julian gave him a legup and dick put his head and shoulders into the hole he felt to one side nothing felt to the other side and his hand came across something hard and cold an iron band perhaps he ran his hand over it and touched something soft and crumbly old old wood rotting away maybe possibly a wooden chest only held together by the iron bands he scrabbled about and julian gave a sudden shout hey youve showered me with money whew i never saw so many gold coins in my life julian i think theres more than one box or chest up there said dick jumping down and looking at the big heap of shining coins at his feet there may be a fortune there talk about treasuretrove look lets not disturb anything else up that hole no one knows about it except ourselves better gather up these coins though just in case that awful ebby takes it into his head to come down this way so they filled their pockets with the coins and then made their way onwards again to their joy they soon recognized one of the tunnels they had been in the day before plain sailing now said dick joyfully well soon be out and then well get the locksmith to pick the lock of the lighthouse so that we can get in sh said julian suddenly i think i can hear something they listened but went on again thinking that julian was mistaken but he wasnt as they turned a dark corner that led into a cave someone leapt at them julian went down to the ground at once and dick followed he just had time to see that ebenezer was there with someone else jacob perhaps as dick fell gold coins spilled out of his pocket ebenezer gave a cry and bent down to them at once julian tried to take his chance and slip by him but the other man caught him and sent him spinning backwards where did you find that money you tell us or youll be sorry shouted ebenezer and the echo came back at once sorry sorry sorry run dick panted julian its our only chance he gave ebenezer a terrific shove which sent him into the other man yes it was jacob and then he and dick were off at once running as fast as they could back along the way they had come you come here yelled ebenezer and they heard him pounding after them hurry panted dick if only we can get to the shaft were all right but alas they took the wrong turning and soon found themselves in a cave they had never seen before ebenezer and jacob blundered past without seeing them better stay here a while said julian let them get a good way off so they stayed still and quiet and then at last ventured out of their hidingplace and tried to find their way back to the right path you know if we get lost down here were done for said julian and once the tide flows in we shall be in a pretty poor way somehow weve got to get out through the cliff way or back to the shaft hang on to me dick we mustnt get separated whatever happens they stumbled on not really knowing whether they were going in the right direction or not they seemed to go through endless tunnels and caves what a labyrinth there was in that great strata of rocks they they heard voices thats ebbys voice and jacobs too whispered julian theyre coming this way hide here and keep still so they hid quietly and listened to ebby and jacob those boys have got to come back here said ebby well wait dont make a sound well have to make a dash for it and hope for the best whispered julian come on well be caught by the tide soon if were not quick they both made a sudden rush and passed the surprised ebby and jacob at a run then down the tunnel beyond them they went as fast as they could bumping their arms and legs and heads against the rocky walls but holding their torches steadily in front of them on they went and on and behind them breathing heavily came ebby and jacob i think this must be a bad dream panted dick julian julian look theres water coming along this tunnel the tides coming in come on said julian i feel as if the shaft isnt far away now i seem to know this tunnel and this cave come on dick we havent a minute to spare weve got to get to the ladder look theres the shaft yelled dick at last come on we shall just about be able to squeeze under the arch at the bottom hurry julian the waters up to our ankles now they reached the shaft and squeezed under the small archway that let the water run through from side to side over the rocky bottom of the shaft they began to mount the ladder and then stopped to hear if there were any sounds from ebby or jacob they heard yells ebby come back tides flowing in and then they heard ebbys angry voice im coming theyve gone farther down and they wont like it theyll be drowned before they get much farther dick grinned come on ju up we go i can see the light through the trapdoor at the top the girls have left it open bless them and soon the two boys were clambering out of the trapdoor with timmy barking madly and licking their necks the girls and tinker too excited for words what happened didnt you get out of the tunnel to find help for us were those men there what happened plenty said julian but unfortunately we didnt get past ebby and jacob who were lying in wait for us so were still stuck in this lighthouse with nobody to help us but but what asked george shaking his arm julian you look excited whats happened we found the treasure said julian come on well tell you all about it and he led the way up the spiral stairway with tinker and the excited girls close behind soon the boys were telling their story and george and anne and tinker listened and exclaimed and danced about and were altogether marvellous listeners to a marvellous tale it must have been the treasure in an ironbound chest oh ju werent you excited when the coins poured out yes it was certainly a very fine moment said julian mischief stop pulling my hair my word its been an exciting morning what about a drink of lemonade and by the way whats the weather been like we couldnt see a thing down below oh its awful again julian said anne theres another storm coming look at those scurrying black clouds it does look bad said julian his excitement leaving him as he saw clearly that another big storm was blowing up we certainly shouldnt be able to get out of here today even if we could get out of the door julian tinker found his fathers old pocket radio in a cupboard said anne and it still works we listened to the weather report and it gave an important warning to all ships at sea or by the coast it said they must run to safety as soon as they could well im blessed if i know what to do for the best said julian looking out of the window how in the world are we to let people know were here marooned in the lighthouse well simply have to think of something but that was easier said than done how did one get help when there was no way to get help how did one escape out of a locked lighthouse when there was no key chapter twentyone a wonderful idea im thirsty said tinker ill get some lemonade well go slow with it then said dick you dont know how long we may be locked up here and we havent endless food and drink tinker looked alarmed might we be locked up here for weeks and weeks he said if people thought we had left the lighthouse and gone back home because of the bad weather we might easily be here for some time said julian soberly nobody would bother about us theyd think we were safe at home but mother would soon feel worried if she didnt hear from us said george we said wed send her a card each day you know and if she doesnt have one for a day or two she would be sure to get worried and send someone over here hurrah for mothers said dick relieved all the same i dont fancy a week or so here with hardly anything to eat well have plenty of one thing though and thats rain water there must be some way out of this said julian who had been sitting silent frowning at his thoughts cant we get a message out somehow are there any flags here tinker that we could wave out of a window no said tinker ive never seen any what about a white tablecloth weve one of those yes that would do said julian fetch it tinker tinker pulled it off the table and gave it to julian julian went to the window and looked through the glass which was misted with spray i dont expect anyone will notice a tablecloth being shaken out of this window he said but ill try it my word the windows hard to open it seems to have stuck he opened it at last and immediately an enormous gust of wind came in and everything went flying papers books carpets chairs fell over and poor mischief was blown from one side of the lighthouse room to the other timmy barked in fright and tried to catch the flying papers as they went by his nose the tablecloth disappeared at once julian managed to close the window again after a terrific effort and once more the room became peaceful whew said julian i didnt guess there was such a gale outside i should think that tablecloth is about five miles away by now the gulls will get a surprise when it comes flapping along in the sky george couldnt help laughing at that frightened though she was oh julian it was a jolly good thing you didnt fly off with the tablecloth my word what a gale i wonder the lighthouse stands it well we do feel a buffet now and again said dick there did you feel that it was either a wave bumping into the rocks or spray forced against us i distinctly felt the lighthouse shake a little rubbish said julian seeing annes scared face dont make silly jokes like that youre quite sure that the lighthouse cant be blown down said anne in a small voice dear anne use your commonsense said julian would it have stood for all these years if it hadnt been strong enough to stand against storms far worse than this mischief is feeling frightened too said tinker hes gone and hidden look well long may he stay there said julian at least hes not trying to open the biscuittin or delve into the bag of sweets i should just like to know how many of our sweets he has eaten up to now whoooooooosh that was an extra big gale of wind that buffeted the lighthouse and made timmy stand up and growl rain pattered against the window sounding as if someone was throwing pebbles julian was very worried it really did look as if the stormy weather was going on and on it might quite well continue for a few days and their food certainly would not last long there were still some tins left and they had plenty of water of course the rain saw to that but somehow they were all always so hungry cheer up julian said george you do look grim i feel it said julian i cannot for the life of me think of any way to escape from here or even to get help weve no way of signalling pity the lighthouse lamp is no longer going said tinker that would have been a fine signal to tinkers enormous surprise julian suddenly gave a shout leapt up came over to tinker and gave him such a clap on the back that the surprised boy almost fell off his chair wwwhats the matter stammered tinker rubbing his shoulder dont you see perhaps we can set the old lamp going and make it shine out as it used to do not to warn ships of course but to make people realize that we are prisoners in the lighthouse said julian jubilantly tinker do you know if its possible to light the lamp i think so said tinker my father showed me how it worked and i think i remember oh and theres a bell that can be struck too better and better said julian where is the bell it was dismantled and put away said tinker it used to hang in that sort of verandah place that runs outside round the lamproom theres a big hook for it there oh it hung in that outside gallery did it said julian well that means that one of us would have to go out there in the wind and hang it up not too good there must be a ninetymileanhour gale up there anyway lets get the bell and have a look at it the great bell was down in the storeroom covered up it was made of brass and once had had a hammer that struck it at intervals worked by some simple machinery but the machinery was in pieces no good at all well take the bell upstairs said julian gosh its heavy as lead dick ill want your help between them the two boys carried the heavy bell up to the livingroom and tinker brought up the old hammer that used to strike it julian and dick held up the bell by its loop of iron hit it with the hammer tinker said julian see if it stills sounds loudly tinker struck it hard with the hammer and at once a great deep clang filled the room from side to side making timmy jump almost out of his skin he and mischief left the room at top speed and fell down the spiral stairway together all the others jumped too and stared at one another in awe the sound of the bell went booming round and round the room filling their ears so that they had to shake their heads to try and get rid of the sound julian at last clasped the rim of the bell with both his hands and the sound died away what a wonderful bell he said in awe look how old it is too see it says cast in my word if only we could get it hung up in its place on the gallery the sound of it would go right to the village and beyond i wonder how many ships heard it in the old days booming out every now and again as the hammer struck it tinker raised the hammer again but dick stopped him no you saw how scared timmy and mischief were theyll probably jump through a window glass and all if we sound the bell again well wait till we think the wind has died down a bit and then try to hang the bell said julian now lets look at the lamp will it want oil tinker it may do though i think theres some still in it left when the lighthouse was closed down said tinker but there is plenty down in the storeroom good said julian feeling decidedly more cheerful now if the gale dies down at all well try to hang the bell we can strike that as soon as its hung and not wait till we light the lamp but the gale seemed to get worse and julian really did wonder if the old lighthouse would stand up to it should he take everyone down to the storeroom just in case i will if the gale gets worse he thought though if the lighthouse should fall there wouldnt be much chance for us whatever part of it were in they went up to the lamproom in the afternoon and looked at the great old lamp tinker explained how it worked it used to go round and round mechanically he said and there were screens here and here that shut out the light in places as it went round so that the light seemed to go on and off if any ship was watching it it seemed to flash you see instead of to shine steadily ships noticed it more quickly then the screens were broken in pieces there was still some oil in the lamp but julian added more the wick seemed perfectly good now if only they could light the lamp and keep it going someone would be sure to see it and wonder about it julian felt in his pocket for matches as the lamproom was enclosed in glass it was easy to keep the match alight he touched the oily wick with it and hey presto the lamp was lighted it was a very big lamp and close to the light was quite blinding dick crowed with delight weve done it old lighthouse youre going to shine once more tonight youre alive again now to hang the bell said julian and he cautiously opened the door leading on to the gallery outside having waited until the wind died down for a moment he and dick lifted the bell up to the hook there and slipped the iron loop over it it hung there swinging and julian lifted the hammer but at that moment a great gust took him and he staggered almost falling over the railing dick caught him just in time and with georges help dragged him into the lamproom they were all very whitefaced that was a narrow escape said george her hands shaking and her body trembling well have to be careful if we go out on the gallery again perhaps we had better rely only on the lamp i vote we all go down and have some hot tea said julian thankful for his escape his legs felt shaky as he went down the stairs he was most surprised julian was seldom scared and it was peculiar to have legs that suddenly gave at the knees however everyone soon recovered when they were drinking hot tea and eating ginger biscuits i wish it was dark so that we could see how bright the light is from the lamp when it shines said dick it will be dark very quickly today it was so dark that the light streaming from the old lamp at the top of the lighthouse was brilliant it cut a shining path through the night gleaming yellow and through the roar of the sea went a great clanging as julian with dick holding on to him struck the old bell hanging in the gallery listen said george her hand on timmys collar listen boom booooooom boooom tim that bell must feel happy tonight its found its voice again booooooooom has anyone heard that old bell on this stormy night has anyone seen the light from the old old lamp booooooooom chapter twentytwo the end of the adventure down in the village of demons rocks that night people drew their curtains made up their fires and sat down in their armchairs they were thankful not to be out in the wind and the rain old jeremiah boogle was lighting his pipe sitting by his own roaring fire when he heard a sound that made him drop the flaring match and listen in amazement boooooom boooooom a bell a bell ive not heard for nigh on forty years said old jeremiah standing up hardly able to believe his ears no it cant be the lighthouse bell thats been gone for many a day boooooooom jeremiah went to his window and pulled aside the old curtain he stared out and could not believe his eyes he gave a yell millie come look here lighthouse lamp is shining out millie wheres that granddaughter of mine millie what is it grandad now said a plump little woman bustling in look millie am i seeing right aint that the lighthouse lamp ashining there said jeremiah well theres a bright light shining out there high above demons rocks said millie but i never in my life saw the lighthouse lamp shining out before and whats that booming noise grandfather like a wonderful great bell thats

a plantpot there are folk there three boys and two girls and a monkey too and a dog as well well there now said millie and what would they be there for did they set the lamp agoing and sound that bell booooom there it goes again enough to wake all the babies in demons rocks village millie was right it did wake all the babies and the children and amazed every man and woman in the place including ebenezer and jacob they had leapt to their feet when they had heard the bell and were astounded to see the great light shining out steadily in the night they heard people hurrying by their cottage on their way to demons rocks jetty they heard jeremiahs big voice booming out too its they children up there in the lighthouse abanging that bell and setting that light ashining somethings wrong its help theyre needing folks somethings wrong ebenezer and jacob knew quite well what was wrong the children were locked in the lighthouse and couldnt get out they might be ill or hurt or starving but they couldnt get out to fetch help and now the whole village was aroused and when the morning came a boat would bob out on the great waves and find out what had happened ebby and jacob disappeared that night it wasnt constable sharp they feared it was the people of the village they slipped away in the dark and the rain and were gone but youll be caught ebby youll be caught jacob and no one will be sorry for you no one at all when daylight came there were many people on the jetty ready to go across to the lighthouse the wind was so rough that great waves still rolled over the rocks on which the lighthouse stood soon a boat was launched and jeremiah constable sharp and the village doctor went across the boat careering from side to side like a mad thing as the waves caught it they went up the steps to the lighthouse and banged at the door and from the other side came julians glad voice youll have to break down the door ebby or jacob locked us in and took the key we cant get out and were running short of food right stand back shouted jeremiah constable and i are going to break in jeremiah was old but he was still hefty and constable sharp was heftier still the lock suddenly splintered under their enormous shoves and the door flew wide open jeremiah and the policeman shot inside and bumped into julian and the rest sending them flying timmy barked in astonishment and mischief fled up the stairway soon they were all in the livingroom and julian was pouring out his story anne made tea and handed round steaming cups jeremiah listened openmouthed and the policeman busily took notes the doctor glad that no one was ill or hurt sipped his tea and listened too we didnt know how to get out when we were locked in said julian coming to the end of his long story so in the end we lighted the old lamp and hung up the old bell and struck it with the hammer i could hardly stand in the gallery though there was such a wind i struck it for half an hour and then my brother here went on till he felt too cold the lamp didnt burn all night it went out early this morning but both bell and light did their job well son said jeremiah looking twenty years younger he was so excited ah to think that old lamp shone again and that old bell sounded i thought i must be dreaming well be after that ebenezer and jacob said the policeman shutting his notebook and it seems to me youd all best go home young sir this weathers going on for a bit and theres nothing to keep you here is there well said julian actually there is something to keep us here you know the old wreckers lost treasure you told us about jeremiah well weve found it jeremiah was so astounded that he couldnt say a word he goggled at julian and opened and shut his mouth like a fish julian took some golden coins out of his pocket and showed them to the policeman and the doctor and to jeremiah there you are he said we know where there are thousands of these they are in ironbound boxes and chests down in one of the tunnels in the rock what do you think of that we cant leave here till weve given the treasure into the hands of the police it belongs to the crown doesnt it yes it does said constable sharp gazing at the bright gold coins but youll get a fine reward young man all of you will wheres this treasure id better get it straight away well you have to go down the foundation shaft of the lighthouse said julian gravely but with a twinkle in his eye and crawl under the archway at the bottom and then make your way down the tunnel but be careful the sea doesnt catch you and then when you come to the policeman stopped scribbling down what julian was saying and looked startled julian laughed its all right dick and i will fetch it ourselves today and give it to you complete with every single gold coin he said we dont need to go down the shaft theres another way in the way you took us jeremiah well go this morning for a last excitement and then home perhaps you would kindly telephone to kirrin garage for a car to fetch us at twelve oclock constable oh good said anne an adventure is always exciting but ive really had enough at the moment this was such a badweather one oh constable look out that monkey has

anne who really didnt like dark smelly tunnels and caves ill do the packing timmy and i will help you said george who knew that anne wouldnt like to be left alone in the lighthouse the boys went off with jeremiah the doctor and constable sharp rowing over the rocks to the jetty the doctor and jeremiah said goodbye at the jetty and the three boys and mischief took constable sharp to find the treasure they had to push their way through quite a crowd of people who had collected on the quay anxious to know why the light had shone out from the lighthouse in the night and why the bell had sounded make way please said the policeman politely everything is all right these children were locked in the lighthouse and couldnt get out make way please there is no need for any excitement no
