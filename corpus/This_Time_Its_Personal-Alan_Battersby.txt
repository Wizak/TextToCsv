 chapter one new york in the spring it was a fine but chilly spring morning fine enough even to make the new york borough of queens seem attractive like any other day i left my apartment on main street queens and walked to the subway station to commute into midtown manhattan on the number seven train like any other day i read the new york daily news to pass the time during the journey out of professional interest i always glance through the days fresh crime stories muggings thefts a carjacking a shooting a bank robbery and so on crime the unpleasant reality of life from which i make my living the names marley nat marley licensed private investigator my prediction is that you already have a mental image of my type of work i can safely bet that your image comes straight from the fantasy world of hollywood thats a long way from the truth the majority of my work is dull often just pure routine stuff like divorce bad debts or missing persons dont imagine for a moment that im goodlooking either just an ordinarylooking guy bald overweight and on the wrong side of forty and lets get another thing straight my working days seldom start with a wealthy attractive female client anxiously waiting for my professional services my office is on east rd street just a couple of blocks from grand central station stella delgado my personal assistant was already at her desk talking on the phone stellas been with me most of the time ive been in business a beautiful intelligent puerto rican in her late twenties if she wanted she could get a far better job elsewhere and ive told her that too but she insists on working for me she must like me youve heard of the expression on the wrong side of the tracks meaning the poor underprivileged areas of the inner city thats where stella grew up in the barrio on the upper east side known as spanish harlem she had left school early and got into plenty of trouble as a kid then it took years of night school study to catch up on her education as she put down the phone i asked how are things on this beautiful spring morning silence she just gave me a blank stare the morning mail was on her desk unopened something was definitely wrong stella whats the matter come on out with it she looked up at me tearfully nat i dont know what to do its family my kid brother jose ive just been talking to him on the phone hes been arrested he could be in serious trouble there was work to catch up with that morning bills to send out to our satisfied or dissatisfied clients and some annoying letters from the irs the tax people yet again theyd claimed i hadnt paid enough tax but clients and the irs would have to wait stella tell me everything its a long story jose was found by the police in the early hours of this morning on th street just off lexington avenue upper east side he was lying unconscious with head injuries in the drivers seat of a car that had crashed into a wall in a parking lot nat he doesnt even own a car anyway he was taken to the emergency room at metropolitan hospital now hes in a secure room under police guard he was allowed to make one phone call so he called me so whats the story how did he get into this mess i asked the awful thing is he has no memory of what he was doing stella said all he can remember is being at some bar in brighton beach with his buddies yesterday evening then nothing has he been charged with anything i asked no at least not as far as i know replied stella why were jose and his buddies going out for a drink at brighton beach anyway thats quite a way from spanish harlem for a night out jose works in the summer at a diner on surf avenue coney island the place closes up in the winter jose had been to see his boss to confirm his job for next summer he got some good news they took him on as a cook jose had taken a couple of his buddies along to see if he could fix up work for them they were taken on as waiters good money plus room and board starting first of april afterwards they went out to celebrate the thought of coney island brought back some of those golden childhood memories trips to coney island beach and the rides at the amusement park family vacations at the beach i put those thoughts to the back of my mind and concentrated on stellas story anything more i asked he said he had just a vague memory of a bar somewhere on brighton beach avenue he knew hed had a few too many drinks then nothing until he woke up in a hospital bed maybe hes in shock i suggested temporary memory loss if this was a simple case of drunkdriving he wouldnt be under police guard and where did he get the car from i dont know nat joses never had a drivers license not having a drivers license didnt mean he hadnt stolen the car and driven it anyway but i didnt say that to stella i thought for a moment if jose hadnt been charged with any offense the nypd could only hold him for a limited time all right stella this is what well do if jose hasnt been formally charged theres no reason why we shouldnt be allowed to visit were going straight over to the hospital to talk with him stella didnt move but just stood by her desk biting her lip is something else bothering you i asked nat im worried sick joses an ordinary loveable guy who likes a good time ok hes got a criminal record he got into some trouble when he was a teenager but i know hes harmless a danger to nobody but someone with his background you know as well as i do what conclusion the police will come to come on stella i said things have changed in this city its not like the bad old days you know how sensitive the police are nowadays about any question of possible prejudice you cant assume that the nypd will think jose is guilty because of his background any suspect has to be judged on the evidence maybe youre right she replied simply stella didnt seem to be convinced but i knew the nypd would go to any lengths to avoid the kind of publicity an accusation of racial prejudice would attract i also understood stellas fears stella and her family are puerto rican during the s tens of thousands of puerto ricans emigrated from their island to the usa when they arrived some of them discovered that the usa wasnt the land of opportunity theyd expected some had exchanged the poverty of puerto rico for the poor neighborhoods of new york there were deadend jobs waiting for them as kitchen hands or unskilled factory workers today however some have succeeded in creating a good life like stella with a permanent job comfortable apartment and loving husband but for stella it had been a struggle i could appreciate how her culture and background might affect the way she saw things lock up the office and lets go i said chapter two metropolitan hospital after a few inquiries at the main reception desk we were finally given the location of joses room at the hospital eventually when we reached the floor it was obvious that gaining access would be no simple matter there was a boredlooking police officer sitting outside i thought i might start with a little gentle persuasion it can sometimes work even on police officers i should know i used to be an nypd officer before i set up my own business excuse me i said showing the officer my investigators license i represent mr jose de la cruz would it be possible to speak to him the lady here is ms delgado sister of mr de la cruz the officer was unimpressed he looked me up and down and said flatly sorry sir no ones allowed in and thats official i wondered if he was going to be one of those people who get their job satisfaction by creating difficulties for others i wasnt going to take no as the final answer come on now just a quick word wont do any harm no replied the officer sharply this guys a suspect hes wanted for questioning suspected of doing what i demanded has he been charged with any crime dont know and no thanks for all your cooperation give me the name of your boss will you i asked it was captain oldenberg a familiar name oldenberg and i had worked together at the nypd that was over fifteen years ago when wed both been patrolmen on the streets of the lower east side since id left the nypd to become a private eye oldenberg had risen through the ranks and had now been promoted to captain every now and then our professional paths crossed oldenberg was the sort of guy you didnt forget in a hurry he could be bad tempered loud and dominating at times despite that he was basically a good cop id need all my charm to deal with him though thanks ill be back i said stella was looking furious nat exactly what is going on here she demanded as we walked away from the room are you just going to take no for an answer stay calm stella in this situation we need friends not enemies ill call oldenberg i phoned police headquarters and was put through to oldenbergs office he wasnt exactly pleased to hear from me that was normal he was even less pleased when i asked if jose was free to leave once the doctors had given him the all clear youve got to be joking marley he shouted theres no way im going to let that guy out on the streets hes being held on reasonable suspicion ive had a crime scene team examining the car de la cruz was found in and im waiting for the results of forensic tests tests to examine what bloodstains on clothes dna a weapon i tried my charm on oldenberg again id be interested to know what those tests would be for i said sure you would marley you know i cant reveal any details of evidence until the suspect has been charged it was the answer id been expecting no harm in having another try have you established who was the owner of the vehicle i asked hopefully same as my previous answer he replied bluntly i got the impression that the captain was enjoying himself one last attempt to make some progress ok oldenberg i know your position rules have to be obeyed but if my client hasnt been charged why cant i speak to him i have his sister with me and shes upset in a big way just ten minutes and ill agree to the police officer being present too all right marley have your ten minutes ill call the officer and tell him to expect you we hurried back to speak to jose the officer showed us into his room jose was sitting up in bed with a bandage around his head and an iv drip attached to his arm there was a hopeless expression on his face stella went over to him took his hand and spoke to him gently how are you feeling jose not great im full of painkillers but i can still feel my head spinning said jose stella its real good to see you are you going to get me out of here i havent done anything wrong you and i both know you havent done anything wrong she said remember what i told you jose youve got to keep holding on so whats the cop doing here huh asked jose glancing in the direction of the officer we had to agree to the officer being present jose this is my boss nat marley hes going to help you im sure glad to see you nat said jose if were going to help you youve got to give us the whole story dont hold anything back i said everything that happened from the time you left home yesterday until you woke up in this hospital bed jose with his two friends miguel and carlos took the subway to coney island to find work the boss at the diner offered him a job as a cook and joses buddies were taken on as waiters jose showed miguel and carlos around the sights of coney island during the afternoon after stopping for food they moved on to brighton beach to celebrate by early evening theyd had several drinks in bars on brighton beach avenue in the heart of the russian community he had a confused memory of waking up in a bar his buddies had gone then nothing the next thing he remembered was waking up in metropolitan hospital you dont remember anything else i asked nothing its the honest truth nat said jose its all a black fog brighton beach kind of an unusual night out for three guys from upper manhattan huh i asked youre right at first it felt kind of strange for us to be there said jose but people were nice and didnt mind three outsiders having a night out one bartender got friendly when we asked him about all the different vodkas now think hard jose can you remember anything else i asked nothing he replied what happened to miguel and carlos i cant remember it didnt look good jose had been found unconscious at the wheel of a car that wasnt his he had no memory of what had happened after passing out in a brighton beach bar jose i know you dont have a drivers license but can you drive i asked no way nat ive never tried and even if i could id have been too drunk to drive the police officer interrupted us times up mr marley there wasnt any point in asking for more time i didnt think we were going to learn anything more of value as to what had actually happened it was still a complete mystery was jose the victim or was he the guilty party my impression of him from our brief talk was of a harmless ordinary guy a guy who had gotten into some sort of trouble and had no explanation for what had happened it wasnt looking good there was some small hope though since id gotten clients out of worse situations than this jose needed a lawyer urgently and i knew just the woman for the job lena rosenthal she was capable intelligent and tough someone who could stand up to oldenberg as soon as jose was charged with a crime then we would have something concrete from the nypd otherwise we were just operating in the dark stella had to get back to her family so i gave her the rest of the day off i just wished i could say something that might give her some comfort but i knew whatever i said would be inadequate once i had more information then i might be able to offer her some hope the next day the temperature was close to freezing a layer of frost covered the windows of cars parked on the street overnight id arrived at the office early and was just putting the breakfast coffee and donuts down on the desk when the phone rang a familiar voice barked at me captain oldenberg marley just calling to tell you that your client de la cruz is still being held at the hospital i wanted to get him moved to headquarters for further questioning but the doctors insisted he be kept under observation im still waiting for the results of the tests on bloodstains found on his jacket and a wallet in his possession oldenberg had given away a few more details bloodstains things were getting more serious in desperation i said oldenberg my client cant drive and whats more the alcohol level from the blood tests should indicate hed have been incapable of driving anyway marley dont make me laugh he replied my client needs to consult his lawyer with your permission id like to take her over to the hospital this morning any objections be my guest marley ill call the officer on duty and tell him to expect you by now stella had arrived i told her the latest developments she took it all in silently then sat in front of her computer with her head in her hands i arranged to pick up lena rosenthal later as our cab headed up first avenue towards the hospital i gave lena all the details she needed about joses case i also explained how i was involved lena this isnt just a routine case for me this guys the kid brother of my assistant stella delgado stellas been working for me so long that shes like part of my family i feel responsible for both stella and jose you could say its personal this time lena nodded thanks for telling me nat anything else i should know i should warn you about captain oldenberg he has a reputation for being aggressive and insensitive oldenberg and i have met before i know what to expect replied lena at the hospital before we saw jose a doctor took us aside excuse me are you family she asked we represent mr de la cruz the names nat marley private investigator i replied flashing my id at the doctor this is his lawyer ms rosenthal we have permission from the nypd to visit our client thank you im dr ericson mr de la cruz has been under my care since he was admitted his condition has been giving me cause for concern in the accident he received a heavy blow to the head so far his condition has been stable but there have been some symptoms that worry me hes complained about seeing double images and he has twice lost consciousness though very briefly and also theres some memory loss so i must warn you not to put mr de la cruz under any unnecessary stress hes been through enough already and with any further stress understood doctor well take great care before seeing jose lena turned to me it would be a good idea not to mention anything about the forensic tests this guy sounds scared enough already i nodded my agreement eventually we were allowed in to speak to jose he looked at us with dull eyes and raised a hand to acknowledge us i could see the despair in his eyes lena went over exactly the same questions as i had asked before there was nothing more that jose could add we had made no further progress as we were leaving jose cried out hopelessly nat for gods sake get me out of here im going out of my mind chapter three jones beach saturday morning was cold but bright i was feeling fit and active i started the day by following my saturday routine buying the daily news and wandering down main street queens to slim petes diner breakfast there was always reliable unhealthy but very tasty maybe that explained slim petes weight problem morning nat said slim pete why so cheerful pete i now realize that a healthy lifestyle is no solution to a midlife crisis which means ill have one of your breakfast specials and plenty of coffee as i worked my way through breakfast i looked through the daily news there was a story about a murder victim a guy by the name of alexei romanov where had i heard the name romanov before that was it the old russian royal family the body had been found late friday afternoon floating in coney island creek the victim had been shot in the head and had been dead for over twentyfour hours there were some more details romanov owned some kind of business on brighton beach he was involved in a society that helped immigrants from russia to settle and adapt to life in the usa his tearful widow told reporters that she had no idea who could have done such a thing he seemed to have been a wellliked and respected man who was active in the community i hoped and prayed there was no connection with jose another story caught my eye the headline read wreck on jones beach part of a lifeboat had been washed up on the shore two bodies had been found nearby no further details id been brought up on staten island as a kid just taking the ferry across to manhattan seemed like a big adventure a day out on coney island was a real trip but jones beach on long island felt like going abroad maybe theres something of that kid still left inside me i still get a thrill when i get way out of the city and stand on the beach looking out at the atlantic watching the waves crashing why not escape from the city for the day the ocean air would do me good i was folding up the newspaper when slim pete came over to chat so whats new yorks smartest private eye doing putting more gangsters behind bars he asked funny you should say that i answered new yorks criminal community can relax ive just decided im going to spend a day at the beach huh a life of leisure its all right for some people i took the bus from main street to jamaica station you can connect there with the long island rail road to freeport from there i took a cab to jones beach a long narrow strip of land about two miles from the mainland there was a real chill in the wind coming in off the ocean enough to keep any crowds away so early in the year in the height of the season thousands of new yorkers crowd into the area to claim their little piece of beach but today i could walk without tripping over beach towels or bumping into umbrellas i strolled along the shore for about an hour then returned unusually energetic for me but i felt better afterwards the air was clean and fresh then i stood for a while on the atlantic side watching the waves crash onto the beach i knew why i had really come here it was the reports of the bodies washed up on the beach it was my day off but i was still playing the investigator that was why my marriage had broken up my wife never saw much of me when i was with the nypd when i started out on my own as a private investigator she saw even less of me then one day she walked out on me she left a note which said that i just didnt give her enough attention and she couldnt carry on like that the sad truth was she was right if theres ever a second mrs marley shell have to be one very tolerant lady to put up with me i wandered over to a group of bars and restaurants which would be packed with visitors in a few weeks one or two were already open while in others work was going on in preparation for the coming season outside a bar an old guy up on a ladder was painting he looked down at me from his work youre out of luck if you want a drink mister we dont open till the first of april he said just wanted to talk if its not holding you up i replied go ahead and talk mister im just doing this as a favor for my soninlaw he doesnt care how slowly i work i see jones beach has been in the news some story about a lifeboat found wrecked along the shore and two bodies i said the old man came down from the ladder a good sign i had got his interest he pointed west along the shore with a dripping paintbrush the wrecked lifeboat was found about a mile west along the beach theres an old lady when i say old shes a good ten years older than me well she goes beachcombing regularly you know looking for shells and stuff she found the wreck and the bodies really must have been quite a shock for her i said i dont know about that mister it made her day never seen her so excited it was time to make my move i showed him my investigators license gee a real private eye exclaimed the old man i wouldve expected someone someone younger and betterlooking i interrupted we come in all shapes and sizes look im investigating this wreck for a client i lied id like to talk to this lady who is she and where can i find her her names edith tilden people call her edie shes english but shes lived here for years she looks kind of eccentric but shes ok once you get talking see that place over there the old man pointed toward a beatup building with the sign ornellas italian clam house above the entrance shell probably be in there he continued she claims ornellas the only person on jones beach who can make a good cup of tea lifes full of surprises since when did italians make good tea i entered the restaurant it didnt look open for business most of the tables and chairs were piled up in a corner only a handful of tables were set at one of the tables sat a little old lady dressed in bright yellow and purple a plump cheerful woman welcomed me morning mister no hot food until april just snacks and hot and cold drinks she said i was looking for a sandwich and a cup of tea ive been told that you make the best tea in jones beach i replied the old woman at the table looked up and said youve come to the right place for tea then make that two teas one for the lady here i went over to her table mind if i join you i asked not at all she answered take a seat i noticed the way she spoke not the slightest american accent thanks you english i asked im probably as american as you are now ive been in the usa for fifty years but never lost the accent or the teadrinking habit the names edie edie tilden pleased to meet you im nat marley the sandwich and teas were brought over to the table after small talk about the weather it was time to get some information i showed edie my private investigators license her eyes grew large and round and her mouth dropped open this old lady was deeply impressed i wish i had that effect on people more often i hear you found the wrecked lifeboat and two bodies on the beach im investigating the wreck for a client i lied again edie waved her teaspoon at me excitedly mr marley ive been walking up and down this beach for years ive found bits and pieces of boats but never a body two real dead bodies what do you say to that she asked must have been a terrible shock i said people dont look pretty after theyve been in the sea can you describe them i asked certainly two young men could be anywhere in their twenties medium height thin both of them looked as if they needed a good meal short hair they hadnt shaved for days cheaplooking clothes one of them had a gold cross on a chain around his neck ive never seen one like it before let me show you she paused took a clean paper napkin from the table found a pencil in her pocket and drew a picture of a cross with two horizontal bars the top one a little shorter then at the base of the cross a short bar at a fortyfive degree angle i didnt recognize it thanks mind if i keep this i asked now what can you remember about the boat what i found was the rear half probably from a boat big enough to fit a dozen people in it had seen better days though what do you mean the wood was rotten with age some of it was so soft i could break off pieces with my bare hands it looked like someone had been trying to repair it but hadnt made a good job of it the boat must have split in two were there any identifying marks like names or numbers i asked some letters at the back maybe the boats name edie answered i couldnt make out a complete word but it looked like a foreign language and thats about all i can tell you the coast guard took it away so theres nothing to see now thanks youve been very helpful heres my card where can i contact you if i need to speak to you again she wrote a freeport address and phone number on the paper i left edie and did some more beach walking i felt relaxed and content when i finally got back to queens that evening but there was still the problem of jose unless i turned up some new evidence soon he could be facing a long prison sentence the next day i woke up early but was feeling active it must have been the effect of all that exercise the day before there are various ways to spend your sunday unfortunately i had to go into the office to sort out some accounts on the subway i glanced through the sunday edition of the daily news it didnt have anything to add to yesterdays stories at the office on east rd street i was trying to make sense of the previous years accounts when the phone rang who on earth wanted to speak to me at this time on a sunday i grabbed the phone it was oldenberg marley trust you to be in the office on a sunday just wanted to bring you up to date on your client i immediately felt tense go on i said im on my way back from metropolitan hospital said oldenberg de la cruz has been charged with murder chapter four east harlem oldenberg i began youve got a confused guy in a hospital bed with serious head injuries and you add to the misery with a murder charge just doing my job marley he replied following procedure whos the murder victim i asked a guy by the name of alexei romanov some businessman from brighton beach the same guy id read about in the daily news ok oldenberg youd better explain how you reached the conclusion that my clients a killer oldenberg went on to give me the details the cause of death was a shot to the head from the pistol which was found in the car joses fingerprints were on the handle and trigger the results of the forensic tests proved that he was the attacker romanovs blood was found on joses jacket also the nypd had positive identification of a wallet found in his possession it belonged to romanov the police had the murder weapon the killer and forensic evidence as far as oldenberg was concerned the investigation was closed i had serious doubts all the evidence pointed toward jose but what was the motive ok oldenberg have you established a motive i asked maybe he saw the opportunity to get some easy money a carjacking i guess he answered again i wasnt convinced could a sleepy drunk possibly be capable of carjacking and murder what do you mean i guess wheres the supporting evidence do you have witnesses i asked who needs witnesses with the amount of evidence piled up against him oldenberg asked no point in continuing the conversation id learned enough the significant point was the lack of witnesses oldenberg obviously thought that the forensic evidence was enough to prove jose was guilty someone must have seen jose and his buddies celebrating that night id have to go to brighton beach to do some of my own investigating meanwhile i needed to check on jose a call to the hospital confirmed that his condition was stable but the doctors were still keeping him under observation it seemed unlikely that he would be allowed to leave the hospital but jose was better off there than in a cell another call this time to stella i brought her up to date on developments i also needed to get a clearer picture of exactly what had happened on wednesday night i had to speak to one of joses buddies stella promised to set up a meeting with them as soon as possible a few minutes later stella called back nat ive set up a meeting with carlos and miguel can you get over here now yes good well be at my moms apartment first ave apartment on the tenth floor thats the east river housing on first avenue between nd and th streets well be expecting you call me on my cell phone if you have any problem finding it there wouldnt be any problem the area was spanish harlem and id walked most of those streets when i was an nypd patrolman my only hope was that his buddies would remember something that had slipped joses mind anything i took an uptown local train from grand central to rd street then walked the three blocks across town to the east river housing project in the space of those seven subway stops the city changes completely in spanish harlem theres not a skyscraper in sight only a few remaining traditional brownstone houses among the anonymous gray concrete blocks of the housing projects i was shown into a comfortably furnished room overlooking the east river with a view of wards island at the southern tip of the bronx joses buddies were there two ordinarylooking guys in their early twenties stella introduced us nat id like you to meet miguel and carlos this is my boss nat hes like family to me and were doing everything we can to help jose i want you to tell everything to nat just like you told it to me all of it again asked carlos yes every bit you might recall something that could help jose she said carlos began much of what they said confirmed what we already knew from joses story the interview at the diner the sightseeing tour of coney island the bars on brighton beach avenue what i was really interested in was the final bar where jose had fallen asleep we ended up in this bar that had every kind of vodka you could imagine continued carlos the bartender in there got friendly when we took an interest in the drinks he was recommending what to try the name of the bar i asked sorry nat i dont remember replied carlos so some bar somewhere in brighton beach selling lots of different vodkas could be one of many in new yorks little odessa can you remember anything else about the bar the walls were covered with baseball stuff team photos shirts bats that sort of thing i remember asking the bartender hey whats all this baseball in the middle of the russian community apparently the owners a huge baseball fan good i said there cant be too many bars like that in little odessa how long did you stay we tried all these different flavored vodkas after an hour or so i knew id had too much my head was spinning jose had fallen asleep and i knew wed have to help him home we needed to get sober for the subway ride so miguel and i went out to find some black coffee we found a place that had coffee to go carlos waited outside the bar with the coffees while i went inside to get jose but there was no sign of him i asked the bartender but he didnt know we just thought hed woken up and gone home thanks youve been a great help call stella if you remember anything more i said progress at last i now had a starting point for my investigation i had to find the bar that jose and his friends had gone to now i had a lead the baseball connection suddenly my cell phone rang it was captain oldenberg marley its your client de la cruz the guys gone crazy he broke out of an operating room and somehow climbed up on the roof of the hospital hes threatening to throw himself off he might listen to you can you come right now and help talk some sense into him chapter five a matter of life or death metropolitan hospital is only three blocks downtown on first avenue stella ran on ahead and i hurried after her i was completely out of breath when i arrived outside the main entrance was a collection of various nypd vehicles and a fire department truck with a ladder barriers had been set up around the base of the building with signs that read police line do not cross high up on the top of the building sitting on the edge of the roof i could make out a figure it was jose if he jumped there was no way hed survive among the police vehicles was a large blue van marked tactical response unit thats police language which translated means a negotiation team these are the people whose weapons are words not guns they will negotiate for hours or days to prevent a crime or a tragedy i was relieved to see them here those guys are so calm compared to officers like oldenberg they wouldnt get impatient watching paint dry if it takes fortyeight hours to prevent a potential death by talking to the guy hour after hour theyll do it persuasion not force is their philosophy oldenberg was waiting for us outside the entrance er marley he began this is kind of embarrassing i cut him off embarrassing its a disaster how on earth did my client end up on the roof i demanded i thought you had him under twentyfourhour guard whats been going on here is this another example of nypd inefficiency as we hurried through the hospital corridors oldenberg raised his hands in apology i cant offer any excuses your client had been taken to an operating room the police officer was told that de la cruz was unconscious so he decided to take an unofficial break outside the medical team had to leave de la cruz temporarily while they attended to a more urgent case during that time he must have regained consciousness panicked and gone up to the roof an elevator took us up to the top floor we were taken through a door marked no entry at the foot of the stairs to the roof dr ericson was waiting she looked nervous and anxious mr marley and ms delgado thank god youre here my patient needs people he knows and trusts you know he should be in the operating room he was being prepared for surgery before escaping wearing only a surgical gown hes seriously ill im not trying to be dramatic but this is a matter of life or death thanks doctor i understand your concern i said one more thing mr marley there are some curious bruise marks on mr de la cruzs neck like someone had gripped him violently he couldnt have received injuries like that in a car crash the doctor put her fingers and thumb around her throat to demonstrate i told captain oldenberg but he didnt seem to take any notice i dont like that mans attitude me neither i replied thanks for telling me it could be very important we climbed the stairs to the roof outside the wind was bitterly cold a woman was sitting on a low wall a few yards away from jose detective valdez from the negotiation team jose was sitting on the wall wrapped up in a blanket from the operating room with one leg hanging over the edge stella and i cautiously made our way along the roof i dont like heights especially when the only protection from a fatal drop is a kneehigh wall we sat down beside her mr marley and ms delgado she said in a whisper with her face turned away from jose im very relieved to see you here the more people there are around that jose knows and trusts the more likely we are to talk him off the roof just keep your distance from him until hes ready to speak to you jose knows us as nat and stella are there any other officers up here i asked no i tried to get more in position but jose noticed them and started to panic so i insisted on just one officer and here i am valdez explained in situations like this you never know whether a suicide threat is a desperate call for help or if its the real thing its a situation where nobody can take chances the consequences could be disastrous detective valdez continued with the routine that has saved countless lives in this city the technique was to establish a relationship and gain trust jose you know who i am now i just want to talk she said no response from jose he put the blanket over his head so his face was hidden from view i just want to know if youre listening raise a hand if youre listening to me she asked jose briefly raised his right hand she continued in the same smooth calm voice ive got some friends of yours here stella and nat theyre worried about you do you want to speak to them again no response detective valdez didnt give up jose just listen you know these people theyre trying to help you valdez tried patiently again and again at last a reaction from jose he pulled the blanket off swung his leg back from the edge and stood up all he was wearing underneath was a green surgical gown from the hospital operating room the poor guy must have been freezing what can you do to help me shouted jose i got a murder charge hanging over me what do i have to live for my head i got this pain it wont go away speak to him nat whispered valdez i stood up trying not to look down at the drop below jose weve got new evidence i can prove you didnt do it that wasnt strictly true but it might encourage him to come down from the roof then how come theyve charged me with murder how come protested jose he threw the blanket over the edge there was a sudden shock of panic below until it became obvious that it was the blanket rather than jose that was falling then he sat on the wall with his head down again he swung one leg over the edge what do you think i whispered to valdez not good but not a disaster id like stella to talk to him now she said stellas voice was cracking with emotion as she spoke jose listen to me i know you didnt do it youre not a killer something happened to you after you left that bar and nats going to prove it well get you off this murder charge i promise silence stella appealed to him again jose responded at last what do you have to promise with now there was a change in his behavior words were coming slowly as if speech involved a major physical and mental effort i dont know im finished my head whats happening asked stella i think hes going to jump valdez whispered but i dont want to frighten him with any sudden movements nat get ready to grab him but dont move until i say now joses body began to tremble violently he began to rock his body from side to side im a no good failure he muttered get ready nat whispered valdez start moving in on him jose continued muttering to himself with his head lowered sometimes what he said made sense sometimes it was just a confused string of words i crept along the roof towards him im a no good fail as joses voice trailed off into silence the sideways rocking motion continued with each swing the top part of his body hung for a moment over the vertical drop then the return swing behind me valdez shouted urgently this is it now jose had reached the furthest point of the swing but this time he didnt return he was slipping off the edge i made a dive for his foot and just managed to grab it jose was now hanging upside down over the edge i was also hanging over the edge with only my knees pressed against the wall preventing me from following jose stella and valdez were already hanging on to me but in that position no one else could reach jose from the roof jose was not light and i could feel my grip slipping valdez was screaming to the firefighters below move it get that ladder up here before we have a fatality i concentrated all my efforts on keeping my arm locked around his foot jose swung in space over the drop i could feel my muscles aching and weakening then out of the corner of my eye i noticed the ladder swinging round at the top of the ladder there was a firefighter who took joses unconscious body into his powerful arms and swung him over his shoulder as jose was brought down to safety a medical team on the ground was waiting to take him straight to the operating room i pushed myself back from the edge and collapsed behind the safety of the wall i opened my eyes to see stella kneeling beside me nat are you ok she asked you were wonderful thanks im alright just let me lie here i dont want to see that drop again just yet i lay there for a while thinking it was good to be alive after all id had quite enough excitement for one day nat youre a hero said valdez well if im a hero so are you you read all the signs that he was going to jump anyway lets get down to the operating room and see whats happening we were informed that dr ericson was already operating on jose the brain surgery was a delicate procedure which would take hours there was also a high element of risk jose had already put himself in danger by escaping from the operating room the added stress could only have done further damage stella decided to stay at the hospital and wait for news as i left she was calling her mother a better option for me was home food beer tv and relaxation chapter six the odessa steps monday morning back at the office on east rd street i was going to be all alone stella had stayed overnight at metropolitan hospital her brother had come out of surgery but was still unconscious it was still too early to tell whether the surgery had been a success i was now convinced that someone wanted a convenient fall guy to take the blame for romanovs murder maybe jose had simply been unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time just a harmless guy enjoying an evening out with his buddies now he was facing a murder charge the problem was our total lack of evidence the whole thing made me angry but i couldnt allow that anger to affect my judgment meanwhile id done a little research on the cross that edie tilden had seen on the body on jones beach it was definitely russian the design used in the russian orthodox church it was likely that the letters on the lifeboat were also russian i now had photographs of jose miguel and carlos id phoned all the bars in the area and had finally discovered one run by a baseball enthusiast the odessa steps i decided it was time to take a trip to brighton beach and follow the movements of the three friends on wednesday night there was a small chance id pick up a few pieces of evidence as i was getting ready to leave i had a surprise phone call edie tilden the elderly woman id met at jones beach mr marley edie tilden remember me she asked its kind of hard to forget you i replied youre not going to believe this but i found two more bodies on the beach cold and stiff they were i gripped the phone tightly now dont get overexcited just describe what you saw dont dramatize well it was early this morning i was out to see what the morning high tide had washed up along the shore and then i found them two more young men about fivehundred yards east from where the boat was wrecked said edie edie went on to describe them the two young men could have been anywhere in their twenties like the other two bodies they were very thin they were wearing cheap casual clothes jeans denim jackets tshirts and running shoes clothes worn by young men everywhere nothing specific to go on here did you notice any jewelry or identifying marks like scars i asked no nothing like that she said thanks edie thats good work you should have been a detective keep on with the beachcombing call me anytime you see something suspicious will you i was very curious a murder in coney island and now four bodies washed up on jones beach romanov was a respected member of the russian community and it looked like the four dead men found on jones beach were also russian was there a connection i was wondering how those boys had died drowned accidentally in a storm or what i called the coast guard press officer who had prepared a news release he promised to email it to me immediately as i put the phone down the email came through us coast guard group moriches press release incident at jones beach long island the coast guard service is currently investigating the wreck of a lifeboat discovered on jones beach and also the discovery of four bodies nearby the victims are white male and aged between twenty and thirty the wreck is being investigated as suspicious for the following reasons no boats have been reported missing no person has been reported missing at sea the boat was not in seaworthy condition no registration details are available for the boat if you have any information that would be of assistance to the us coast guard please contact commander j lockhart us coast guard station moriches long island new york i printed out the email and put it aside to read again later it was time to go brighton beach and pay a visit to the bar where jose had fallen asleep i took an express q train from the nd street subway station as the train made its way through the suburbs of brooklyn i glanced through the daily news nothing more on the romanov story i got out at the brighton beach subway station and started working my way along the avenue inquiring at bars whether jose and his buddies might have been drinking there it was just before noon so the bars were still quiet a couple of bartenders vaguely recognized the photographs but couldnt provide me with anything useful i finally arrived at the odessa steps inside the walls were covered with baseball souvenirs picture after picture of the famous brooklyn dodgers teams who dominated the american baseball scene in the s and s i ordered a beer and sat down to take in the atmosphere the lunchtime crowd was arriving and the bar was becoming noisy with russian conversation at the next table one of the staff had a collection of tools on the table and also a beautiful antique baseball bat he was preparing to put it on the wall excuse me i said im interested in the bat i bet it has a history something new for the baseball exhibition huh this bat mister was used in the final game of the world series proudly replied the bartender when the brooklyn dodgers beat the new york yankees its my bosss favorite piece he paid a fortune for it at todays prices im sure he did i said well that was back in the s so it isnt a new piece weve had it up here in the bar for years youre not going to believe this but wednesday night last week some joker pulled it off the wall no kidding whoever it was wouldve been lucky to get out of here alive i commented i guess so he said i showed him my investigators license and also the photos of jose and his buddies did you happen to see these three guys in here on wednesday i asked he immediately pointed at joses picture hey thats the guy who grabbed the bat what time was this had to be nine oclock i remember because it was just before my break the bartender replied what happened to this guy after he tried to take the bat so far the bartender had been talkative now he looked nervous and started to hesitate er i must have been on my break look why dont you ask my colleague behind the bar hell remember the conversation with the other bartender followed the same pattern his memory was perfectly clear up to the point when jose took the bat mysteriously they both suffered from total memory loss after that were they hiding something or were they scared of something i was certain about one thing if a stranger walked into this bar and attempted to steal one of their sports treasures theyd be lucky to get away unharmed was it possible jose received those throat and head injuries in the bar i didnt think i was going to find out anything more but at least i had made some progress jose and his buddies had definitely been in the bar i had a time pm when jose must have woken up and in his confused state made a grab for the bat but why wouldnt the bartenders reveal anything more i stayed at the bar and ordered a roast beef sandwich and fries while i was waiting for the food i made a call to stella at metropolitan hospital jose was still in intensive care slipping into a coma a state of deep unconsciousness nat said stella my moms going to take over for me at the hospital ill be going home soon to get some sleep im just exhausted but ill be at the office first thing tomorrow you know you dont have to if you want to keep your mom company i said nat im depending on you to clear joses name and prove his innocence lets get on with this investigation im going to be right there with you chapter seven evidence early tuesday morning on main street in queens the weather was just awful it was pouring with fat raindrops bouncing off the sidewalks car headlights were reflecting off the road surface in places now inches deep in water i splashed along the sidewalk my hat and coat were soaking wet by the time i got to the subway station at east rd street it all seemed like a normal day stella was already at her desk going through the morning mail she gave me her usual bright hi nat but underneath that cheerful exterior i knew she was deeply worried as soon as id woken up id phoned the hospital to get an update on joses condition i was simply told no change the investigation into joses evening at brighton beach had made little progress id also had a call from lena rosenthal oldenberg had given all the relevant police information to lena our lawyer this included the autopsy report on romanov we had arranged a midmorning meeting at east rd street over breakfast i did some thinking i recalled the basic points of police procedure which id been taught years ago at the nypd academy in every investigation always establish mom which stands for motive opportunity and means motive why did the suspect commit the crime opportunity did the suspect have the chance to carry out the crime means did the suspect have the weapon to carry out the crime but when you applied this system to jose nothing seemed to make sense theres nothing out of the ordinary in a guy having too many drinks and waking up in a strange bar but how and why could he suddenly come into the possession of a handgun steal a car and commit murder later that morning lena was going through some of the details of romanovs autopsy report with me what worries me nat is timing she began we know that jose probably left the odessa steps at or around nine oclock according to this report romanovs time of death was somewhere between and the same evening now for a drunk whod just woken up jose would have to have been one fast mover agreed i said theres absolutely nothing to show how or where he came across romanov lena continued did he just walk out into the street wave a car to stop and then rob and brutally murder the driver as i see it theres no logic here no supporting evidence apart from the forensics anything more in the reports cause of death a gunshot to the head at close range romanov was on the ground when he was killed according to the report there was bruising on his upper arms which could indicate the killer was standing on his arms when the fatal shot was fired stella who had been making some notes suddenly interrupted ms rosenthal i need to get something clear the fingerprints that were found on the gun barrel righthand or lefthand prints all righthand prints according to the report lena replied stella said nothing but just looked down at the notepad stella is jose righthanded i asked stella nodded another setback if only jose was lefthanded another possible line of investigation closed oldenberg had not followed official procedure after dr ericson had reported the bruises on joses neck with some minor blackmail i could ask a favor i thought i might have a talk with oldenberg i knew a subject that would hold his attention baseball his mind is an encyclopedia of baseball history oldenberg its marley just called to tell you ive been admiring a bat used by the brooklyn dodgers in the final game of the world series there was a low whistle of surprise from oldenberg i knew i had his full attention its a valuable piece of baseball history i continued and you can see it for yourself at the odessa steps bar on brighton beach theyve got a whole museum of baseball stuff around the walls but last wednesday night some guy pulled this bat off the wall hey that would be terrible that guy would be lucky to get out of the place in one piece i suggested thats what people at the bar told me and the guy is the accused jose de la cruz but he got out of the bar somehow and then look what happened to him kind of strange dont you think especially when the bar staff went suspiciously quiet when i asked what happened after jose grabbed the bat i dont know what to say marley this information might have an effect on the case think about it now i continued its come to my attention that medical staff at metropolitan reported bruising on de la cruzs neck which couldnt have been the result of the car crash but you didnt order a medical examination of my client how did you know about that demanded oldenberg just doing my job i replied calmly i have my contacts im prepared to ignore this failure to follow official procedure if you do me a little favor i need an official introduction from the nypd to lockhart commander of the coast guard group in moriches thats the long island south section whats this all about marley lets just say another line of inquiry one oclock it had been a busy morning and i could hear a cold beer calling my name from mcfaddens bar mcfaddens bar is just a block across town from the office on second avenue a favorite watering hole for new york journalists i phoned the bar to check whether ed winchester was there eds an old friend and a wonderful source of information hed been chief crime reporter for the daily news for years and still did some parttime work for the paper though he was now officially retired no sooner had i entered the bar than i heard my name being called a tall elderly guy with silver hair and a deeplylined face was waving an empty glass at me nat perfect timing ed said that must mean your glass needs refilling i replied i took the beers over to an empty table and went though all the recent events with ed romanovs death joses night out at brighton beach the wrecked lifeboat and the bodies on jones beach you see ed there seem to be russian connections everywhere i was just curious whether youd heard anything about crime among the russian community money laundering is the big one he replied in international terms the russian ruble is seen as little more than toy money so much of the real business of crime is done in hard currency in us dollars a lot of illegal dollars from that black economy are probably coming in to the usa from russia the problem then is how to integrate that money into the legal economy here without attracting attention id heard about money laundering anybody running organized crime operations like drugs or illegal gambling receives huge amounts of cash thus the need for your friendly neighborhood money launderer to clean the dirty money by transferring it through a network of bank accounts until nobody can find where it came from once it reappears at the other end of the process the moneys clean and legal ed called the crime desk to see if they knew of any money laundering activity in the russian community he listened carefully for a couple of minutes then turned to me with a broad smile theres a guy by the name of victor kamenev he said it seems he was depositing regular amounts of cash up to ten thousand dollars at a time in a variety of banks around lower manhattan hes got a business kamenev finance of course there was the usual gossip at the crime desk as to whether he was laundering money for the russian mafia but no concrete evidence ed had delivered the goods again and cheap at the price of a beer another russian name but was there any possible connection between romanovs death and the wreck on jones beach i walked across town to first avenue and wandered through the united nations plaza over to the east river walking time is thinking time so i just ignored the rain i needed a way to gain access to the russian community alexei romanovs widow could be our entry key but under the circumstances we might have to be a little economical with the truth the initial approach to mrs romanov would need tact and sensitivity more stellas specialty than mine back at the office after describing the plan to stella she made that allimportant call her telephone manner was as always perfect mrs romanov im very sorry to disturb you at this extremely sad time im stella delgado my employer mr nat marley is investigating a matter which is of deep concern to the russian community after stella had completed the call we had an appointment for the following afternoon chapter eight mrs romanov it was one of those march mornings when the weather still hadnt made up its mind if its the depth of winter or the beginning of spring an icy wind was cutting across manhattan a few snowflakes were falling from the heavy gray clouds id arranged to meet stella at metropolitan hospital where shed been at joses bedside with her mom stella was waiting outside the main entrance shivering with cold youll catch your death of cold out here stella i said i prefer it out here right now ive had enough of hospitals ive just been with jose for an hour theres no change still in a deep coma just the same as before at least the police are being more relaxed about access now that hes unconscious id like to see him anyway now that im here i said we made our way up to joses room as usual the police guard was on duty outside the room through the window i could see stellas mom at the bedside talking to the unconscious jose see that nat mom spends hour after hour chatting to him shes convinced shes getting through to him but i havent noticed any kind of response lets hope it does some good i said i didnt feel it was appropriate to enter the room jose was with his family i knew that the unconscious brain can still be active and functioning i just hoped he was receiving something something that might get though whatever block was keeping him from regaining consciousness yesterday oldenberg had emailed me a letter of introduction to a commander lockhart of the us coast guard who was based at the moriches coast guard station id already made an appointment to talk to him about the jones beach wreck the wrecked lifeboat was now being stored at jones beach coast guard station and i had arranged to meet lockhart there i was curious to examine it and prove any new russian connections as far as this investigation was concerned it was all a very long shot it could easily be a pointless visit but i felt we should be doing something for jose the subway was clear of the worst of the rush hour crowds as the number four train sped downtown toward midtown manhattan i thought over what i knew about joses night out in brighton beach if only he would regain consciousness then he might recall something relevant from st street an e train took us west across town to penn station where we took a long island rail road train to freeport a fortyminute journey but quicker and cheaper than any cab as the train made its way through the suburbs of queens i noticed stella biting her lip i know that little habit of hers it means something is on her mind are you ok stella i asked this past week nat has been a total nightmare im tense and anxious all the time we seem to be getting nowhere fast i know its not your fault youre doing everything you possibly can but there are times when i feel like tearing my hair out and screaming dont give up hope stella i said i wont let jose down believe me im positive the evidence is out there the pressures getting me down too if this was an ordinary everyday investigation id be able to walk away from it and put it right out of my mind but its there with me all the time if i wake up in the middle of the night im thinking about it well crack this case somehow we took a cab from freeport to the jones beach coast guard station where we were welcomed by the officer responsible for long island south commander lockhart a tall fitlooking man in his fifties pleased to meet you mr marley said lockhart shaking my hand with a firm grip captain oldenberg asked me to give you every possible assistance thanks i said this is my assistant stella delgado were working on a case that just might have a connection with the recent incident on jones beach as you know wed like to see that wrecked lifeboat which was recovered i replied lockhart took us out to a workshop alongside the coast guard building inside was part of what had once been a wellbuilt boat the paint was peeling off it some clean fresh wood was visible where the boat had split in two at the back of the boat were the faded letters they did look like russian letters lockhart took a screwdriver from a workbench and pointed at a section of the boat id like to demonstrate to you just how poor the condition of this boat is he announced he drove the blade of the screwdriver into the wood it went through with little effort the wood was completely rotten stella gasped those poor guys she exclaimed they wouldnt have had a chance this boat was no more than a floating grave lockhart continued its completely falling apart what about the four guys who were found on jones beach i asked i have the full autopsy details in my office shall we go there and ill show you he suggested inside his office lockhart sorted through a pile of documents here we are cause of death exposure and drowning they must have floated for as long as they could maybe holding on to what was left of the boat but the chance of survival in those temperatures would have been very slight he said was there any form of identification on the bodies asked stella all that was found were some russian labels on their clothes and a russian orthodox cross but otherwise weve no identification were running a check with the russian authorities but these things take time off the record what do you think really happened to these guys i asked our guess is an illegal immigration operation lockhart began they probably paid a huge amount of money for the privilege of being smuggled from russia into the usa in cases like these another bigger boat would be involved probably a small fishing boat they remain offshore then transfer the immigrants into smaller boats are you talking about occasional incidents or regular shipments of immigrants i asked we suspect regular traffic weve had a number of reports of suspicious activity from routine coast guard patrols the coast guard has carried out a number of search and seizure operations at sea but our resources are limited for every illegal immigrant we seize there could be others slipping through the net of course we question the ones we catch but never learn anything really useful like names of the people behind the operation thanks i said this has been very useful if i discover anything relevant ill let you know mr marley whoever put any people into that boat might as well have been holding a gun to their heads said lockhart you realize there could still be more bodies it could take time before theyre all washed onto the beach from jones beach we took a cab to brighton beach the heavy clouds had begun to lift slightly and the occasional ray of sunshine was breaking through our next appointment with alexei romanovs widow had to be handled very delicately the romanov house was situated in a wealthy neighborhood of brighton beach off shore boulevard large houses with wellcared for gardens none of the trees had been optimistic enough to think about bursting into leaf yet the temperature couldnt have been much above freezing the door was answered by a maid who took our names and left us waiting in the entrance hall soon she returned and led us into an elegantly furnished dining room mrs romanov then entered a tall grayhaired woman wearing a black dress with a simple gold pin fastened at her throat in her face you could see the grief that she must have been going through ms delgado and mr marley welcome do sit down she said we realize that this is not an appropriate time to visit began stella were aware of the good work your late husband did with newly arrived russian immigrants and wed like to offer our deepest sympathies thank you youre most kind she said our visit concerns russian immigrants who may have been attempting to enter the country illegally you may have heard about the bodies found on jones beach asked stella mrs romanov nodded they were probably young russian men stella continued the boat they were sailing in was in a completely unseaworthy condition whoever was behind this immigrant smuggling operation had surely sent these boys to their deaths mrs romanov frowned i could see we had her attention but this is dreadful can i be of any assistance asked mrs romanov poor alexei would have moved heaven and earth to bring the people responsible to justice i judged it was the right time to make my move i realize that this is not a suitable time to ask this question maam i said we know your husband was active with the immigrant welfare society could he possibly have made any enemies in the russian community you see there could be some connection between your husbands death and these poor boys found on jones beach i really couldnt be absolutely sure of my facts here but again there was no harm in taking a chance if we were going to make any progress with joses case the police have already asked me all about began mrs romanov she then paused and gave me a hard stare i dont think youre being completely truthful with me mr marley what is the real reason for your visit it was time to put all our cards on the table mrs romanov i apologize yes i have been less than honest i am a private investigator representing my client jose de la cruz who as you know has been charged with the murder of your late husband i do not believe that your husband was the victim of a simple street crime i suspect your husband had discovered something that put his life in danger mrs romanovs face grew pale she sat silently and still as i continued we also have to admit that our interest in this case is personal our client jose de la cruz is ms delgados younger brother stella turned to face mrs romanov believe me mrs romanov this is difficult for me too as god is my witness my brother is not a killer just a gentle harmless ordinary guy who mustve been in the wrong place at the wrong time said stella i continued as far as the nypd are concerned theyve found their killer but im not convinced i am asking for your help in finding your husbands real killer or killers i cant be more honest than that chapter nine victor kamenev mrs romanov stood up and stared out the window for a moment before speaking again mr marley ms delgado she said i believe you are sincere you may count on my cooperation and support stella looked at me and smiled mrs romanov continued you appreciate this is a very difficult time for me but ill do my best theres something quite weird about the events of last week ive had this feeling that the police have not made every effort to investigate the case fully alexei was well respected for all his community work he had a fine reputation he made friends rather than enemies i think of all the people hes helped to settle here and become good american citizens and im not aware of anyone who could have anything against him did he ever mention any names any little remarks he made about people i asked take your time there is something last night i was going through alexeis wardrobe seeing what i could give away to charity in a jacket pocket i found a piece of paper rolled up into a ball it was a short message in russian with no date or address it was a warning and just said i am telling you this in the strictest confidence mossolov could be dangerous you dont know what youre getting involved with it was signed victor you still have the note i asked mrs romanov opened a desk drawer and took out the note does the name victor mean anything to you i asked no she answered well it could be victor kamenev who runs a business by the name of kamenev finance i said well have to check this out and get back to you have you informed the police about this no theres just been so much on my mind she began id advise you to let them have the note immediately but with your permission id rather you didnt tell the nypd about kamenev until ive checked him out first we left the house and made our way to the brighton beach subway and took an express q train back to manhattan at last some pieces of the puzzle seemed to be falling into place but we were still a long way from the solution we had another russian connection i wanted to pay a surprise visit to mr kamenev but i needed support we could be moving in deep dangerous waters i made a call on my cell phone to joe blaney an exnypd colleague of mine joes also an exnypd heavyweight boxing champion he retired a few years ago but still looks impressively tough tough enough to scare people into cooperating thats one good reason why he accompanies me on any job where theres an element of risk joe i have some work for you are you busy i asked i got nothing on said joe meet me at mcsorleys ale house on east th street at three oclock this afternoon ill give you all the details then stella and i transferred to an uptown train at broadway and lafayette and got off at astor place in the middle of the east village joe joined us in the bar just before three i gave him a brief outline of the story so far before we left for kamenevs office on the stairs up to the office old wallpaper was peeling off the walls on the upstairs landing flattened cigarette butts covered the floor elegant huh muttered joe as we entered kamenevs office the contrast couldnt have been greater inside all was clean neat and tastefully decorated the floors were polished wood everywhere was the latest in office technology in response to our request to speak to kamenev the receptionist said a little too automatically you dont have an appointment sorry but mr kamenev is busy with a client there was no sound of conversation coming from his office seems awfully quiet in there would you tell him nat marley wants to speak to him concerning alexei romanov she gave me a sour look and picked up the phone she spoke briefly to him and then turned to me and said seems that mr kamenevs not so busy after all you can go in the guy behind the desk had to be kamenev a big man with rosy cheeks bushy moustache and a full head of curly hair you could see his reflection in the polished wood of the large desk around the room were various framed photographs of life in the old russia from the nineteenth century mr kamenev the names nat marley licensed private investigator this is my assistant stella delgado and my colleague joe blaney ill come straight to the point im investigating the recent murder of alexei romanov i believe you may have information concerning who was responsible for the killing i dont know anything who sent you here demanded kamenev nervously kamenev suddenly opened a desk drawer and produced an automatic pistol he pointed it at me with a trembling hand joe was equally quick his old police special was pointing straight at kamenev but his hand was rock steady mr kamenev said joe smoothly its obvious youre no gunman lets use some common sense i suggest you put that gun down kamenev sighed and placed the gun on the desk joe moved to the desk and emptied the bullets out of the weapon then returned it to kamenev is it true that you sent a warning note to mr romanov i asked kamenev eyed us suspiciously from behind his desk before i say anything i need to have a guarantee that you are genuine he said by all means i suggest you call alexei romanovs widow i replied and gave him the number a conversation in rapid russian followed after a while he put the phone down and looked at us my apologies you understand i have to be cautious i glanced around the room again there were also photographs of the old russian royal family nicholas the last of the czars with czarina alexandra you obviously love your country you must be a patriot also you must have been a friend of alexei romanov who were you trying to protect him from silence after a long pause kamenev spoke this is very difficult for me mr marley its really not wise to say anything more if i were you id stay away from all this kamenev looked uncomfortable i wondered if he was too scared to talk like the bartenders at the odessa steps i tried a different approach kamenevs business could be benefiting from the money coming in from the illegal immigrant operation i had no proof but it was worth a try i want to speak to you about some poor russian boys found dead on jones beach ive heard a rumor that someone was laundering the money these boys paid to get into the country money that needed to be integrated into the legal economy i understand thats your line of business kamenev remained silent is money laundering part of your business i insisted again kamenev didnt say anything lets get one thing straight i said im sure theres a whole lot of questions the irs would love to ask about your accounts but im not investigating your business lets get back to those poor young men who were washed up on jones beach whoever launders the money those boys paid to get into the country might as well have held a gun to their heads and pulled the trigger would it be you by any chance you see they died because theyd been put in a boat that was falling apart the boat split in two in the storm and they drowned in some way you might share some responsibility for the deaths of four good russian boys i could see kamenevs lips tightening i knew what i said had found its target i was appealing to his sense of honor i hoped and prayed there was some honor left in him four good russian boys i repeated all they wanted was to enter the land of opportunity and make a success of their lives and now theyre dead their families back in russia wont know whats happened to them maybe they saved up for years to give their sons this chance but you wont be out of pocket the money will still be coming in honest to god stammered kamenev i dont ask questions their deaths couldnt be my fault so you were just the honest money launderer huh i asked no questions asked and nothing on your conscience kamenev remained silent sweat started to form on his forehead i have this feeling theres a connection between romanovs death and those boys found drowned on jones beach you follow what im saying i went on he nodded but his expression was blank i think you can help i continued help us find the guys who sent those good russians to their deaths youre a patriot and despite your line of business i believe youre a man of honor the most patriotic thing you could do is help us to find whoever is exploiting honest russian people we also want to find who really killed alexei romanov that man did some fine work in the community helping russian folks to settle here he remained silent i nodded to stella tell him i said to her mr kamenev stella began our interest in this case is also personal my brother jose de la cruz has been wrongly accused of alexei romanovs murder as far as the nypd are concerned hes guilty we believe he was set up as the fall guy to take the blame we need someone who knows the russian community someone who has the contacts and inside knowledge to help bring the real killers to justice kamenev took a deep breath and pushed his hands into his fists ok said kamenev i admit that in my work i dont ask too many questions cash arrives from anonymous clients i only know them by a number but if innocent russian boys have been killed and ive profited from it i interrupted him you still havent told me why you sent the warning note to romanov whos mossolov mossolov runs some sort of operation in brighton beach and contacts me from time to time to expect a delivery of cash weve never met only exchanged coded emails and faxes monday last week mossolov emailed me and asked what i knew about romanov i asked why and the reply was that romanov had been asking inconvenient questions i didnt want to get involved so i just played it safe and denied any knowledge of romanov except whats known publicly i suspected that mossolov was dangerous and so romanov could be in danger thank you mr kamenev our problem is that we still have to prove who murdered romanov i said mr marley i am a patriot and i feel i owe a debt of honor towards my countrymen how can i help im going to set up a meeting with alexei romanovs widow i said id like you to be there expect a call from me tomorrow morning chapter ten witness it was now just over a week since alexei romanov had been found murdered peoples memories tend to fade once events become part of the distant past we needed to find witnesses while their memories were still fresh maybe the presence of kamenev would help the bartenders at the odessa steps to remember more about wednesday night i left stella to do some phoning to set up a meeting with kamenev and mrs romanov i suggested somewhere like a good restaurant in the brighton beach area but i left the choice up to her i had received another coast guard press release another body washed up on jones beach the details were similar to those of the other victims a male in his twenties no form of identification on the body no definite connection could be made with the previous fatalities on jones beach but if there was a connection just how many people had been on board that lifeboat when it left the ship for the long island shore with the information about deaths of innocent russian boys i didnt anticipate too much difficulty in gaining the cooperation of the citizens of brighton beach i had just finished reading the press release when the phone rang i recognized the elegant english accent edie tilden mr marley ive seen a very suspicious incident on fire island had i been wise to encourage that eccentric old lady to play the investigator tell me all about it i said i spent yesterday beachcombing along the eastern tip of fire island and i saw this man who didnt look like he really belonged on a beach she said what do you mean by didnt belong he wasnt dressed properly too formal he was wearing an overcoat over a gray suit shiny black shoes he was looking out at the ocean through binoculars but i dont think he was watching the wildlife could you describe him i asked well he was tall six feet plus with a big build but you see mr marley i saw all this from a distance as soon as i got closer he left perhaps he was frightened by the sight of edie tilden what she had witnessed could be relevant or could have been entirely innocent fire island is the next narrow strip of land off the long island mainland to the east of jones beach anyway i stored away the information thanked her and returned to our immediate concerns stella had made the necessary arrangements a midday meeting at cafe paris in brighton beach a table had been booked and kamenev was on his way to pick us up it would be a pleasant change to travel to brighton beach by car instead of the subway things with kamenev were now more relaxed so we were able to get to know one another a little better victor kamenevs family we learned left russia and settled in america many years ago like many in the russianamerican community russian was his first language and he and his relatives had remained true to their cultural roots the car was now leaving manhattan crossing the brooklyn bridge below the wind was whipping up the waters of the east river into whitetipped waves above us on the footbridge people were walking into manhattan well wrappedup against the cold soon we were cruising along flatbush avenue with the skyscrapers of manhattan fading into the distance the conversation turned to recent events mr marley kamenev started ive been thinking a lot about our conversation yesterday ill ask whatever questions you want me to i can put pressure on people and ask for favors there are people around brighton beach who owe me money the prospect of negotiating a debt should encourage someone to talk the car was now rolling through the suburbs of brooklyn the rest of the journey passed sociably on arriving at the cafe paris we met mrs romanov who was waiting in the reception area we were taken over to our table where i made the introductions mrs romanov youve already met stella and this is mr victor kamenev mr kamenev is as anxious as you are to get justice for your husband mr kamenev sent the warning note to your late husband not surprisingly mrs romanov looked extremely tense after ordering mrs romanov questioned kamenev a long conversation in russian to begin with mrs romanovs voice was sharp i held my breath and crossed my fingers but soon she sounded much friendlier i breathed out then they shook hands warmly mrs romanov addressed everybody im sorry about that i needed to be absolutely sure about mr kamenev now i feel i can trust him this is a very difficult time for me its little more than a week since poor alexei was so cruelly murdered i want to thank you all very sincerely for coming here mr marley i know you said your interest in this case was personal naturally mine is too i know you must have other work you should be doing and this investigation must be a considerable expense well not really maam i began mr marley youre a very poor liar im hiring you to find my husbands murderer whatever the cost i could certainly use the money i hadnt done any other work since id heard the news about jose and there was still the office rent taxes and salaries to pay thank you maam i accept stella will draw up a contract after a discussion over lunch there seemed to be two clear avenues of investigation one was the odessa steps having a member of the russian community with us could help to make some progress there the other avenue was alexei romanovs computer files particularly those concerning the immigrant welfare society computer skills were stellas specialty so she left with mrs romanov to examine the computer while i paid a visit to the bar with kamenev when we arrived the lunchtime crowd was building up i took victor over to the display of sports souvenirs i showed him the baseball bat jose had grabbed the bat was now securely fixed to the wall with metal bands and strong screws i gave kamenev all the background information he might need about joses night out in brighton beach i recognized the bartender id spoken with on my previous visit he was laughing and joking with the regular customers his face dropped as soon as he saw me holding up joses picture remember me i asked i was asking you about this guy whod been drinking here last wednesday night his names jose and hes in a lot of trouble i got the impression you were suffering from a little memory loss or maybe you were just confused ive brought a friend along to help you remember the bartender stood there silently sweat started to form on his forehead he looked like a frightened animal nervous and vulnerable i didnt see nothing i swear i didnt see nothing he repeated meanwhile a smartly dressed guy who i took to be the manager joined the bartender whats going on here he asked ill have no harassment of my staff the moment he made eye contact with kamenev the manager froze and lowered his head victor spoke to him in russian it sounded like a heated argument at first but tempers soon cooled the manager waved to the bartender who poured drinks for kamenev and myself mikhail the bar manager has just remembered how much in debt he is to me ive offered to be flexible about the repayments provided we get some information shall we move into your office mikhail the bartender told us that jose had woken up in the bar alone he was sleepy and confused he stood up reached out an arm grabbed the baseball bat fell over and just lay there the regular customers at the bar were very offended who was this guy damaging the sacred bat before anyone could lay a hand on him someone else had got involved and protected jose from the furious regulars this guy had taken pity on him and said hed help get him home i was getting very interested indeed there were a whole lot of questions i needed to ask via kamenevs interpreting the guy who helped jose name i asked the bartender paused and looked fearfully toward his boss who nodded his permission hes called nick zernov if you know whats good for you youll stay clear of him hes a real bad guy that explained why he had the power to protect jose from an angry crowd zernov had seen the opportunity to use jose as the fall guy to make jose appear guilty for a murder give me a full description of zernov will you i asked tall over six feet and muscular black hair cut really short thick black eyebrows his nose looks like someone broke it likes to wear expensive suits shiny material i experienced that thrill you get when you realize some parts of the puzzle might at last be fitting together i recalled edie tildens description of the guy shed seen on fire island i had to remind myself not to get overexcited we still had nothing concrete yet i continued with the questioning how drunk was jose could he stand up he was a bit unsteady after zernov picked him up but otherwise ok he had a few more drinks and then zernov took him outside thats all i know the bartender said you know this guy jose is facing a murder charge they think he killed alexei romanov jose was just a harmless drunk i dont believe he is the killer i said the name romanov meant something to the bartender his face brightened mr romanov helped me and my family such a good man i had a final question would you be prepared to tell the police what youve just told us another discussion in russian between kamenev and the bartender the bartender frowned and shook his head then he said something almost in a whisper before i got the translation i knew it meant no the bartender was clearly terrified chapter eleven progress it was time to see how stella had been doing at the romanov house with the computer files as kamenevs car rolled along shore boulevard i was thinking about the case i told kamenev my theory victor i think we have enough new information to encourage the police to follow a new line of investigation we now know that jose left the bar with a guy who has local criminal connections zernov doesnt sound like the type of guy whod rescue someone from a beating purely out of warm sympathetic feelings toward his fellow men so my theory is that zernov saw an opportunity to use jose as the fall guy but what about all the evidence against your client the forensics and the murder weapon asked kamenev itd be quite easy for zernov to kill romanov i explained then for him to wipe the gun clean grip joses hand around it leaving his fingerprints on the gun even easier to do if jose was already unconscious back at the house stella had found something a file protected by a password whatever she tried family names or place names she couldnt open the file i glanced around the room there were a number of photographs of old russia opposite the desk was a picture of a wide avenue in a major city mrs romanov noticed me studying the picture poor alexei loved that street scene she said its the nevsky prospekt in old st petersburg thats an idea why dont you try typing in nevsky prospekt could you spell that out for me asked stella again the computer denied us access stella keyed in the words individually but still no success mrs romanov had another suggestion that street is named after the russian national hero alexander nevsky try his name suggested mrs romanov stella keyed in the words this time the protected file opened there were lists of dates going back over the past two years at regular intervals next to some of the dates were russian names sometimes with local addresses by some of the names there was a capital m with a question mark the most recent date was last friday there were also a couple of future dates with an m next to them the first of these was saturday march th what do you make of that asked stella well m could stand for mossolov said kamenev ok if we assume that zernov works for mossolov i said and if we can find out what sort of operation mossolov is running then things should fall into place mrs romanov had been examining the names and dates in the computer file mr marley i know some of these names some of them are people who alexei helped through the immigrant welfare society this one here boris tchernov i know he entered the country illegally could mossolov be smuggling in russian immigrants could these be the dates when they were brought in its possible but wed still need more proof i answered id like to talk to tchernov but it would be helpful if you would accompany me mrs romanov so theres someone he knows and trusts but that will have to wait until tomorrow its time i had another talk with captain oldenberg stella would you print me out a couple of hard copies of that file we said our goodbyes to mrs romanov and left with kamenev in his car kamenev dropped us off at police plaza in manhattan a sergeant led us to oldenbergs office oldenberg was sitting with his feet up on the desk and didnt bother to remove them when we entered please dont stand up just for us oldenberg i said what made you think i would growled the captain i dont suppose you want some coffee thanks for the hospitality but if its nypd coffee well do without it sensible decision now what can i do for you marley he asked at last removing his feet from the desk there was the usual expression on the captains face which seemed to say that life and work were an annoyance and i wasnt making things any better it was time to get him interested the odessa steps brighton beach i began you remember i told you that jose pulled that baseball bat off the wall and then got out of that bar unharmed well the reason was that he had a protector go on marley youre beginning to interest me said oldenberg i also got a witness but i doubt whether hed give a statement to the police a bartender saw jose leave the bar with a big smartly dressed guy we have a name nick zernov hes part of a local gang how do you spell that asked the captain there was a rare burst of energy from oldenberg as he swung around in his chair to the computer and typed in the name a list of names came up on the screen including a nicholai zernov hes known as nick so this nicholai could be the guy i suggested oldenberg opened the file the photo matched the bartenders description zernov had a long criminal record like the bartender in the odessa steps had said he was a guy to avoid hed been charged with murder but found not guilty and had served a fouryear prison sentence for robbery oldenberg im positive thats the guy who killed romanov i said would you print me out a couple of copies of the picture so if he is wheres your proof demanded oldenberg i dont have anything to charge him with well lets provide you with more new evidence i continued you already know about the warning note which mrs romanov found in her husbands jacket ive found the guy who wrote it a victor kamenev who owns kamenev finance he has a lot of contacts in the russian community he discovered that romanov had been doing some personal investigation into what could be an illegal immigrantsmuggling operation but his questions had really bothered someone by the name of mossolov kamenev knew mossolov was angry so he sent the warning note to romanov ok lets check to see if theres anything on this mossolov said oldenberg he typed in the name but the screen remained blank he paused and thought for a moment if im going to charge zernov i need solid evidence we have nothing on him except for the fact he left the odessa steps with de la cruz itll be easier to find evidence against zernov if hes under the impression that de la cruz is charged with murder you see where this is leading marley you mean the official nypd line is that jose is the killer case closed the unofficial line is that the investigation quietly continues i suggested you got it said oldenberg ill have a police surveillance team watch zernovs movements without being seen suddenly stellas cell phone rang she rushed out into the hallway to answer it there was a scream of joy followed by rapid spanish conversation she rushed back in to the room with tears in her eyes and grinning broadly nat that was mom joses going to be all right he regained consciousness this afternoon and hes been talking to her the doctors think the operation was a success thats great news stella now if youll excuse us oldenberg we need to get over to the hospital ok marley said oldenberg ill call the guard and tell him to expect you the rush hour traffic was crawling through manhattan to avoid the chaos on the streets we took the subway uptown from city hall to rd street from there it was only a few blocks walk to the hospital stella ran on ahead i finally reached joses room and through the window saw stella sitting beside the bed smiling at jose i knocked softly on the door stella came out into the hall nat said stella strict orders from the nurse dont get jose overexcited he can talk but its all a big effort he just needs plenty of rest weve only been allowed ten minutes jose recognized me as i walked in nat thanks for what you did on the roof its all a bit vague but im told you saved my life dont worry i replied everythings ok now what do you mean ok he asked trying to sit up in bed im facing a murder charge come on jose just lie down and try to relax said stella youve got to rest she smiled at him and gently stroked his hand as soon as jose was calmer i spoke to him again jose weve spent the last week investigating were turning up new evidence all the time just trust us were doing everything possible to clear your name i want you to concentrate on recovering be a good patient nat i can remember something said jose when i woke up in the bar miguel and carlos werent around i stood up but lost my balance i reached out and grabbed the first thing i saw to stop myself from falling it came off in my hand then there i was lying on the floor with all these angry guys looking at me i cant remember what happened after that thanks jose i said it was time to leave jose to rest i succeeded in persuading stella to go home before going back to queens i thought i should stop by at east rd street to check if there had been any messages an email had arrived from commander lockhart of the us coast guard it read dear mr marley please contact me as soon as possible we have some new evidence here that may be connected with the wrecked lifeboat and fatalities at jones beach its a russian fishing boat which was wrecked on jones beach last night id like to show it to you best wishes jim lockhart commander us coast guard group moriches i was very interested indeed i called lockhart immediately to confirm that i would be there in the morning enough investigating for one day it was time to go home chapter twelve wreck on jones beach after the recent storms the weather was now calmer with the prospect of spring in the air id called stella to tell her i was on my way to jones beach to inspect the fishing boat that lockhart had told me about stellas instructions were for her to set up a meeting with mrs romanov that afternoon lockhart had arranged to meet me at babylon station on the long island rail road then to take me across the bay to the eastern end of jones beach to the site of the wreck it was an ancientlooking rusty boat the force of the storm had driven it sideways onto the beach above the normal hightide mark it lay there on the sand and stones leaning at a slight angle barriers had been set up around the boat a coast guard officer stood by a ladder leading up to the deck on board lockhart gave me the full story of what had happened the previous day in the early evening the boat had been reported to the coast guard by a local fishing boat as a potential danger to shipping its engine had failed and it was drifting helplessly off jones beach no emergency signals had been received the crew of the local boat had tried to assist but the offer of help was rejected have a good look around said lockhart tell me what you think im no sailor but i wouldnt have felt confident out in the ocean in that boat it had been some time since anybody had gone fishing in this floating wreck i stuck my head into a cabin on a table lay us navy charts for the south long island coast and new york harbor see those charts said lockhart theyre all uptodate what about the crew i asked all four crew members were captured the boat was kept under observation by a helicopter from the cape cod air station as you know theres easy road access to jones beach so we picked them up as soon as the boat was wrecked they were carrying russian identification they claim they dont understand a word of english so weve arranged for an interpreter whether we get anything out of them is another matter theyve been taken to the coast guard first district headquarters lockhart led me down below deck there were a series of cabins fitted with beds with cheap nylon sleeping bags there were signs of recent occupation the air smelled of stale tobacco on the floor lay russian magazines playing cards smashed plates and cups and the remains of a meal according to my calculations theres accommodation down here for fifteen people plus crew said lockhart this could be the boat that those poor russian boys were in but i cant prove anything five bodies so far so if they had been shipped here on this boat there are potentially more fatalities i asked yes its unlikely there would have been any survivors from the lifeboat said lockhart i accompanied lockhart up to the bridge inside it was full of sophisticated equipment the boat may look like a wreck but theyve installed the latest satellite navigation system explained lockhart look at this little device it gives you your exact position wherever you are my theory is the appearance of this boat is a deliberate disguise from a distance it looks like any other fishing boat a perfect cover for smuggling in illegal immigrants no ships log though so we have no record of the boats movements if you come outside theres one last thing to show you lockhart took me outside look he said the lifeboats missing but i cant prove yet that the lifeboat wrecked on the beach came from this boat so if you have this boat does that mean its the end of the smuggling operation i asked we cant tell he replied it wouldnt surprise me if they had several boats operating also we have no idea how many smuggling operations are active at one time were going to double coast guard patrols off the south long island shore back in lockharts car i showed him the document from romanovs computer file take a look at these dates i said are there any connections with incidents reported to the coast guard or that the coast guard has been involved with after examining the list of dates carefully lockhart said yes theres a definite pattern here some of these dates match up where did you get this information from the computer files of an alexei romanov who was found brutally murdered last week im reasonably sure he was doing his own investigation of an immigrant smuggling operation he must have asked too many awkward questions and paid the price lockhart pointed to the final date on the list which was the next day saturday march th this could indicate another delivery of immigrants will arrive tomorrow i told lockhart about what edie tilden had seen at the fire island the big smartly dressed guy looking out to sea through binoculars of course it could be nothing i said but i suspect he was checking out fire island as a possible landing point lockhart unfolded a map of the long island beaches lets suppose that a boat is going to be landed on fire island there are lots of beaches but very limited road access across the bay any vehicle would have to return via jones beach from this point at the tip of fire island and then there are only three points of access back to long island theyd be caught like rats in a trap maybe but you still wouldnt catch whoevers in charge of the whole operation i commented lockhart thought for a moment then said ill have to contact my superior officer and talk this over i think the immediate plan of action should be a joint coast guard and nypd operation lockhart dropped me off at babylon station i phoned ahead to stella and arranged to meet her at cafe paris on brighton beach avenue she had already set up a meeting with mrs romanov at her home we had names and addresses of people from alexei romanovs computer file to make any progress we would need mrs romanov with us because of her status in the russian community stella was looking more bright and cheerful the fact that jose was at last on the road to recovery must have been a huge relief just as we were about to leave the restaurant to see mrs romanov there was a call from kamenev hed been doing some research and had discovered a company called mossolov import and export in my experience a business which describes its function as import and export could mean anything it was a conveniently vague term that could apply to any number of activities was importing immigrants one of them ill tell you another thing said kamenev i phoned several times but just got an answering machine each time when someone finally answered they just hung up without saying a word when i asked to speak to mossolov good work victor do you have an address i asked the business was located on brighton beach avenue it would be worth checking out a guy like zernov wouldnt act on his own initiative he wasnt paid to think he would obey the bosss orders and that boss could be the mysterious mossolov i passed on the information to captain oldenberg and also informed him about my meeting with lockhart more leads for the nypd to follow up oldenberg promised to put an nypd surveillance unit in place to watch the office at the romanov house i described the russian fishing boat and its probable function to mrs romanov she listened carefully obviously upset by what she heard she turned away and held a handkerchief to her eyes for a moment then she turned back to me and told me what progress she had made mrs romanov had already made contact with one of the people on the list boris tchernov a young man her husband had helped personally she had made an appointment with tchernov who would come to her house tchernov was in his late twenties he was an immigrant who had been in the usa for almost twelve months his english was good enough to communicate effectively without the need for an interpreter he had met alexei romanov and was sincerely grateful for all the assistance he had received from the immigrant welfare society mr tchernov does the name mossolov mean anything to you i asked he shook his head ive never heard of it what about nick nick zernov i asked i could see an anxious expression as i said the name tchernov knew all about him i can tell you all about zernov three years ago i was living in minsk back in the old country it was a hard life there were ten of us living in a little apartment in one of the old soviet buildings on the outskirts of the city id always dreamed of a new life in the usa but it was difficult to emigrate legally theres a limited number of visas available i heard some gossip around that there were other means of entering the country what you needed was three thousand us dollars a man called nick visited regularly made all the arrangements and promised that jobs would be waiting for us tchernov continued with more details of the operation provided you had the money no questions were asked i finally met him exactly as i had imagined welldressed successful he told me stories about the usa the land of opportunity where any man could realize his ambition as long as you had the dollars i worked every hour i could i borrowed and im ashamed to say i stole i didnt care how i got that cash there was no question of flying us in we were taken to the baltic coast near st petersburg to an isolated fishing port i couldnt believe the boat they put us in the conditions were awful disgusting food cold damp cabins even rats there must have been twenty of us on board crossing the atlantic one of the guys became seriously sick he had terrible stomach pains we begged the captain to radio for help but he refused the guy died after four days they wrapped him up in an old sheet tied a lump of concrete to his feet and dropped him overboard i dont imagine his family ever got a refund from nick the atlantic crossing took about ten days most of the time it was stormy we were exhausted and seasick finally we were all put into a small lifeboat in the middle of the night and dropped off on a deserted beach nick was waiting there with a truck we were ordered to get in and lie on the floor and were taken to an empty factory building i remember there was some sort of railroad track on the floor we waited there and eventually we were taken in small groups to various addresses in the brighton beach and coney island area once wed arrived we learned the true reality of our situation we were in the usa without entry visas and had none of the standard documentation in effect we were nonpersons and totally in nicks power if i was discovered by the authorities i could be sent straight back to belarus he could exploit us any way he liked we were given really miserable jobs in kitchens or workshops working twelve hours a day or more for very little money and me with a good education my life was being dominated by him i escaped but found myself living on the streets i was confused and didnt know how i would cope then i contacted the immigrant welfare society mr romanov was very kind to me and gave me money for food and rent such a good man he was helping me with my application for a green card so i could become a legal resident i was so shocked when i heard that hed been murdered who could have done such a thing tchernov had come to the end of his story i took out zernovs photograph which we had received from oldenberg this picture was taken some time ago does this guy look anything like nick i asked boris examined the picture closely and handed it back hes put on weight and lost some hair but thats him chapter thirteen a message from mossolov it was almost six oclock by the time we got back to east rd street the light on the answering machine was flashing stella pressed the playback button a brief but threatening anonymous message if you know whats good for your health keep out of our business someone was trying to warn us off and was prepared to use violence but i wasnt intending to lose any sleep over it we had done enough for one day and i told stella to go home i stayed on at the office for a while sorting through some old case papers and filing them away the phone rang i grabbed it and said marley speaking but there was just silence exactly the same thing happened twice again at fifteenminute intervals whoever was at the other end wasnt talkative i was starting to get suspicious we have one of those phones that displays the callers number i tried calling the number but there was no answer maybe someone was keeping track of where i was i put a call through to the coast guard to see if lockhart had anything to report from their patrols off southern long island nothing as yet it had been a long day and the ideal way to finish it off was an appointment with a cold beer at mcfaddens bar outside east rd street was practically deserted was it my imagination or was there someone watching me in the shadows of a service entrance across the street i went over to investigate nobody there either my eyes were playing tricks on me or i was turning into a nervous wreck definitely time for that beer i would feel more comfortable where there was noise bright lights and company i ordered a large beer and stayed by the bar for a while chatting with some of the regular guys from the daily news the tiredness was beginning to hit me time to go home but id forgotten something i patted my pockets and realized id left the keys to my apartment in the office returning along east rd street i suddenly became aware of a large black limo following me very slowly i turned around and started walking rapidly in the other direction as i was passing the car it stopped and a door suddenly swung open blocking my path i stepped aside to avoid the door but a large heavily built guy was already out of the car standing directly in front of me i immediately recognized the bushy eyebrows and broken nose nick zernov he was easily six inches taller than me the street was completely deserted if i tried to run i knew zernov being younger and in better shape would easily catch me the only sensible thing to do was to talk good evening lost your way or something i asked zernovs response was to lift me up effortlessly by my coat his forehead was now level with my nose thats what i call a serious invasion of personal space i didnt like the idea of my nose being broken either marley i have a message from mossolov said zernov stop asking questions dont stick your big nose in our business mossolov knows youve been watching us and wants you to call your people off otherwise ill have to break your legs is that clear marley couldnt be clearer i replied message received and understood zernov got back inside the car which sped off towards park avenue id learned two things from the meeting first that zernov was definitely working for mossolov second mossolov thought i had been watching them they hadnt connected the surveillance operation with the nypd this was a possible advantage if they didnt think that the police were involved they might still go ahead with another immigrant smuggling operation id have to contact oldenberg to tell him to make the police operation less obvious then theyd assume theyd scared me off i went back to the office and called captain oldenberg fortunately he was still at his desk i explained what had just happened do you have anything new on zernov i asked we have some good photos oldenberg said zernov was twice seen entering the mossolov import export office on brighton beach avenue but we havent had a sighting of the boss of the organization zernovs been seen with two men and a woman on a couple of occasions ill email some pictures through to you one more call before i could go home this time to joe blaney joe ive had a serious threat made against me i need protection youll need to be armed and another thing will you rent a car anything thats powerful but looks anonymous could you start this evening sure boss im not doing anything else at the moment joe replied ok then pack a suitcase and come to my apartment at pm i said on the subway home i immediately fell fast asleep but knew as always id wake up just before the train arrived at main street queens its a technique ive developed over long years of commuting on main street i bought a bottle of chilled white wine at the local liquor store and got myself a korean takeout meal it was my intention finally to have the quiet evening id promised myself when joe arrived i knew i would sleep more soundly its reassuring to have an exnypd heavyweight boxing champion sharing the apartment since i left the nypd ive never carried a gun normally my philosophy is that if a job involves using a gun its a job not worth taking thats on account of the potential health risks i knew if joe had to use a gun hed be more accurate than i could ever hope to be there would be no weekend break i wanted to bring this case to a close chapter fourteen memories saturday morning the weather forecast promised clear mild weather over the weekend perfect conditions for landing immigrants along the long island shore joe and i got an early start and had arrived at east rd street by am the light on the answering machine was flashing a message from mrs romanov asking me to call her urgently mrs romanov marley here im so glad youve called ive had some dreadful news said mrs romanov you remember the bartender at the odessa steps who witnessed zernov leaving with de la cruz hes been badly beaten up and not only him the manager of the bar was also attacked im terribly sorry to hear that this is probably zernovs work hes making sure they stay silent i said well hes succeeded theyre absolutely terrified i heard about this through contacts at the immigrant welfare society it was a brutal attack that man zernov must not get away with it i was just thinking about contacting oldenberg and lockhart when the phone rang it was stella calling from metropolitan hospital nat thank god ive caught you ive been trying your apartment its jose his memorys returning and he wants to speak to you can you get over to the hospital now im on my way i replied jose was looking much brighter his head was heavily bandaged but he was sitting up in bed nat its all coming back said jose what happened on that night out i can remember things now places people faces piece by piece jose put the story together everything matched what i already knew until he reached the point where hed made a grab for the baseball bat ok now jose take it slowly from this point i said tell me everything you saw or heard i looked up and saw this crowd standing over me wow they were mad as hell at me i couldnt understand what id done then i realized it was something to do with the bat i heard someone shouting what the hell are you doing i was lying there scared surrounded by a bunch of real angry guys then someone pushed through the crowd and said dont touch him hes mine ill take care of him what did he look like i asked a big tough guy as tall as joe here said jose he was wearing a shiny suit expensivelooking he didnt look pretty he had a face like a boxer whos lost too many fights sounds exactly like our friend zernov go on jose he picked me up off the floor this guys name you said it was zernov well he was holding my arm behind my back with a tight grip then he spoke again to the crowd and repeated ill take care of him got any objections then he bought you a drink i asked yeah he gave me drink after drink i felt like i was going to be sick but i was too scared to refuse he started asking me all these questions he wanted to know where i was from and what i was doing in brighton beach then he said hed give me a lift home and took me outside i tried to escape but he was too quick for me my arm was pushed up so far behind my back that i thought itd break he took me down a side street pushed me up against a wall and said youre coming with me he grabbed me by the neck until i couldnt breathe and thats the point nat where everything goes blank the next thing i knew i was here in a hospital bed thanks jose youll need to make a full statement to the police do you feel well enough to do that no problem replied jose but i want to get out of here its been nearly two weeks its not going to be long now i said but you have to stay here under police guard so zernov and company think theyve gotten away with it just hang on the police are going to spread some misinformation so whatever you hear on the news or read in the papers ignore it itll just encourage zernov and mossolov to remain under the impression that the police think youre guilty back at east rd street there was a message from captain oldenberg a joint meeting between the nypd and the coast guard had been arranged for two oclock at police headquarters oldenberg had invited me to attend i put a call through to him what do you want marley growled the captain you sound full of the joys of spring oldenberg i said couple of things you could do for me first send an officer to metropolitan hospital to take a full statement from de la cruz his memorys returning and it includes a positive id of a guy matching zernovs description sure said oldenberg anything else id like you to spread a rumor in advance of this afternoons meeting could you arrange to issue a statement to the press to the effect that de la cruz will be released from the hospital today and taken to rikers island prison before his trial for the murder of romanov i want this distributed to all the local radio and tv stations and i also want it in the sunday newspapers my theory is the more misinformation you create the more likely mossolov is to make a move you got it marley ill have the press office get on to it immediately and those pictures of zernov that i promised you ill email them now oldenberg was true to his word within minutes the photos arrived the picture quality wasnt great but there was enough detail there to make out zernov looking huge and ugly as normal what do you think of these i asked joe well hes been getting around a lot lately and meeting a lot of people he pointed to one of the pictures showing zernov opening the limo door for a big man in an expensive suit and dark glasses is that mossolov do you think could be i answered in the next photo the same man was standing next to a woman with long dark hair and whos the woman another colleague mossolovs wife i said i looked out the window as promised on the early weather forecast it was clear and calm these conditions would be exactly what mossolov needed to bring in the next boatload a call came through from lockhart to confirm that he would be present at the afternoon meeting he also brought me uptodate on the latest developments from the coast guard end one of the captured crew members decided to talk ill email a copy of the statement in advance of the meeting it makes for interesting reading theres strong evidence that the casualties on jones beach and the wreck of the fishing boat are connected as soon as the email was printed out i glanced quickly through it until i came to the relevant section then i read slowly and carefully we were carrying ten russian immigrants the captain stopped about a kilometer off shore and the men were loaded onto the lifeboat we had complained to the captain about the condition of the lifeboat the captain ignored the complaints a signal was received from the shore then the lifeboat set off towards the light when it had covered about half the distance the weather changed rapidly a storm blew up we could see that the boat was in trouble they couldnt seem to control it i guess the motor had broken down then we lost sight of it i begged the captain to move in and pick up any survivors eventually he agreed but by the time we reached the area there was nothing to be seen we were now in danger of being driven onto the shore ourselves so we had to leave and head out to sea it was then that we started to have engine trouble the captain tried to steer away from the long island shore but the engine was gradually losing power day after day we tried to fix the engine but nothing worked eventually a combination of wind and currents started to push the ship back towards the coast when the next storm blew up the motor finally failed completely we were helpless also we didnt have a lifeboat to escape in our boat was finally wrecked on jones beach and the crew members were arrested by the coast guard i continued reading through to the end no mention of any names of the people who could be behind the operation if there was no connection here to zernov and mossolov maybe they would still go ahead with an attempt to land illegal immigrants chapter fifteen closing the net as joe drove me downtown on second avenue to police headquarters i turned on the car radio and checked the local radio stations to see if i could find any news i caught a bulletin on wnyc oldenbergs press office had achieved everything i could have hoped for jose was named as having been arrested and charged with the murder of alexei romanov perfect the publicity would hopefully deceive zernov and mossolov as long as they were acting under a false sense of security they might proceed with bringing in the next shipment of immigrants at police headquarters oldenberg and lockhart were reviewing the case after a while i spoke up lets assume that romanov was murdered on mossolovs orders because he knew too much about their operation at least some of the dates we found on romanovs computer are the same dates when the smuggling operations took place we have a future date on that list now assuming the shipment will be landed on fire island then it should be a simple surveillance operation to follow any vehicle to its destination thats where we should strike i doubt whether mossolov is going to run the risk of hanging around exposed beaches all seems logical enough to me said lockhart now we already know that mossolov import and export is located on brighton beach avenue i dont believe the immigrants will be taken there itd be too obvious i know from boris tchernovs statements that the immigrants were taken to some sort of factory building in the coney island area i would suggest that any vehicle they use to move the people is followed at a very safe distance maybe by nypd helicopter then have police units standing by in the coney island and brighton beach area oldenberg and lockhart then proceeded to organize the combined nypdcoast guard operation the plan was to have a coast guard patrol boat out at sea observing any movements there also a coast guard helicopter from air station cape cod would be on patrol and coast guard officers would be posted along fire island at regular intervals the police part of the operation was to observe all road exit points from the beaches to the mainland and report to the nypd helicopter which would then follow the suspicious vehicle four unmarked nypd cars would be placed along the length of neptune avenue ready to pursue the vehicle to its final destination i had a special request to make oldenberg im not in the habit of asking favors from you but i want to be in on this operation with my colleague joe blaney you realize that ive provided the nypd with most of the information in this case so far yes replied oldenberg and you know my personal interest in this case i want to prove without any doubt that de la cruz is innocent and also i want to find out who killed romanov i need a confession thats why we have to be there at the finish youre both exnypd so youre well aware of the risks said oldenberg bluntly you have my permission but dont even think about playing the hero marley understood well have all units in position by dusk and ill keep in regular contact with you by cell phone joe and i had little else to do until nightfall before leaving for coney island i put a call through to stella to give her an update nat those news bulletins exclaimed stella theyre just awful what a relief theyre not true ive had calls from just about every relative in the family about the news i just had to tell them not to worry well if those bulletins have fooled all your family lets hope they have the same effect on zernov and mossolov i remarked another call to mrs romanov to inform her of the real purpose of the bulletins and to reassure her that we were making definite progress im reasonably optimistic that your husbands killer will be behind bars by tomorrow i said take care mr marley and god be with you she replied we headed off in the rental car towards the brooklyn bridge through the steel network i could see that the waters of the east river were smooth and calm with the late afternoon sunshine reflecting off the surface we passed rapidly through the suburbs of brooklyn on ocean parkway which eventually brought us onto surf avenue parallel to the oceanfront we had some time to kill so i asked joe to continue west along surf avenue the amusement parks dominated by the huge roller coaster rides soon came into view one of those rides which had terrified and delighted me as a child was still operating the cyclone i still remember the way the train of little cars would climb up the track to the highest point then dive and shake down what felt like a series of nearvertical drops there was another roller coaster ride standing behind locked gates i examined the curves and slopes now i recognized it as the old thunderbolt another childhood favorite sadly it was now in a state of total disrepair with peeling paintwork rust and fire damage the sun was now sinking low and the western sky was glowing with shades of orange and pink it was going to be a long night it was completely dark when i received the first call from oldenberg the coast guard had been following the movements of ships off the long island coast all day as the light faded a fishing boat had turned towards the shore and was now heading in the direction of fire island it looks like its all happening joe i said time to get in position chapter sixteen face to face time seemed to drag as joe and i sat waiting in the car in a parking lot off neptune avenue joe had brought a police radio with him so we could listen in on the action i didnt want to feel we were missing any of the excitement soon after ten oclock we received a report of the first definite sighting from oldenberg coast guard observers had watched a small boat land a party of ten men and four packages at the eastern end of fire island a white ford truck had arrived driven by a tall heavily built guy who matched zernovs description the truck had picked up the men and the packages and had been spotted leaving fire island later oldenberg informed us that the truck was now on long island highway heading toward freeport the nypd helicopter was following its movements at a safe distance it was around eleven oclock when we heard that the truck was approaching the coney island area the helicopter pilot was having trouble following the vehicle an ocean storm was brewing and a lot of fog was rolling in not ideal conditions for surveillance from the air the pilot now reported that the truck was on the eastern side of jfk airport on the belt parkway which circles the coast around jamaica bay frequent banks of fog continued to make observation from the air a problem then we heard a panicky note in the pilots voice captain oldenberg were losing him no there he is again this is getting difficult theres more fog ahead lost him no weve got him again captain we may not be able to keep the suspect under surveillance the trucks heading east on the belt parkway now i suggest you move all units now to the belt parkway exits for coney island finally we heard the pilot admit defeat captain oldenberg weve lost him there was radio silence for a time then a sighting of the truck leaving the belt parkway at exit seven and heading towards ocean parkway a call from oldenberg marley the trucks in coney island on ocean parkway i have one unit already following and im ordering all units in ill keep you posted we continued listening in on the police radio at first everything went smoothly until the intersection at brighton beach parkway an officer was speaking to oldenberg captain we have the suspect in sight were about fifty yards behind red light coming to a stop hey hes run right through the red light try and follow ordered oldenberg suddenly over the radio we heard the scream of tires followed by two impacts of steel against steel then silence captain oldenberg said the officer we just ran into the side of a cab and our other car is buried in the back of our car nobody hurt just shaken up sorry but both cars are out of action wheres the third car shouted oldenberg get after the suspect sorry captain the traffics now at a standstill at the intersection nothings moving the third car cant get through weve lost him hell swore oldenberg a moment later oldenberg called me on the cell phone marley i hate to admit this but youve lost the suspect i finished for him we know oldenberg weve been listening in on the police radio joe and i are going to cruise around the neighborhood just in case we spot something i suggest you do the same i asked joe to head towards surf avenue soon we were passing by the amusement parks with the ghostly shapes of the big wheels and roller coasters appearing out of the fog as we made our way along the avenue i started thinking about the surveillance photographs of zernov suddenly every piece in the puzzle joined together to give me a complete picture that photograph of zernov outside a set of gates i thought back to our tour of the sights of coney island the old thunderbolt roller coaster the gates with the peeling paint boris tchernovs statement that they were taken to some sort of factory building with a railroad track on the floor i knew then where they had to be joe the old thunderbolt roller coaster and step on it the car sped towards west th street off surf avenue as we approached the roller coaster the ruined structure gradually came into focus through the fog i told joe to kill the headlights as we neared the gates all was quiet and the street was deserted signs reading dangerous structure no admittance were attached to the fence surrounding the old ride the gates were at least ten feet high but with joes help i climbed over on the other side there was a lock and key with a thick steel chain i tried the key in the lock it turned without any effort this entrance was obviously used regularly i opened the gates to let joe through we looked around us now there was sufficient moonlight to provide better visibility about seventyfive yards away i spotted a white ford truck and a limo parked alongside a onestory building in the shadows of the roller coaster structure no lights could be seen a door opened a sudden flash of light from the interior of the building then darkness get down i whispered to joe we dived for cover behind an ancient roller coaster car i looked over the edge and watched it was zernov he started to walk in the direction of the gates shining a flashlight from side to side we kept our heads low as the ray of light was directed towards us then he went back inside my mouth was dry and my heart was beating like a drum joe we need backup zernovs in there and presumably mossolov there could be more of the gang inside i called oldenberg and gave him our location when you arrive i want you to park so your cars blocking the gate ok same for the other police car then well have the exit sealed but hurry oldenberg made rapid time two minutes later we heard the deep hum of the engine oldenberg and his sergeant slipped inside the gates over here i whispered to oldenberg wheres the other car i demanded oldenberg spoke urgently into his cell phone his officers had gone to the wrong roller coaster oldenberg considered the situation for a moment then announced were going in all the evidence should be there any delay could mean we lose the key players you with me marley all the way oldenberg we hurried over to the door of the building from inside we could hear conversation in russian and laughter although there were only the four of us we had the element of surprise oldenberg the sergeant and joe had their weapons ready oldenberg nodded to his sergeant who kicked the door wide open we rushed inside the sergeant shouted police dont move hands in the air for a second the scene before us seemed to be frozen in time the building was lit by oil lamps ten young men were sitting on benches around a table drinking coffee and eating sandwiches zernov who was sitting at another table stared at us in disbelief the big man from the photographs was there sitting next to zernov the woman with long dark hair was standing behind them on the floor was the railroad track which tchernov had mentioned in a corner lay an old roller coaster car on its side the place must have been the repair workshop the woman didnt seem to be alarmed at all zernov looked towards her with a confused expression as if expecting instructions then she turned towards zernov and screamed dont just stand there do something he suddenly got up and reached for his gun but before he could aim it two shots rang out he spun around with the impact of the bullets then he crashed to the floor firing his gun wildly a bullet passed through one of the oil lamps smashing the glass a cloud of gunsmoke hung in the air the place now seemed unnaturally quiet for a second everyone stood motionless then we rushed forward there were two bullet holes in zernovs chest blood was dripping from his mouth and he was gasping for breath he didnt look as if he had long to live meanwhile the woman had thrown herself to the ground and had landed in a pool of rustcolored oily water as she raised herself her face and hair and were dripping with the orangeblack liquid i looked at the guy still sitting at the table are you mossolov he stared at me almost paralyzed with fear im just the driver he stammered dont shoot me the woman was now wiping the oil from her face she looked down at her feet not making eye contact with anybody then a slight movement from zernov with a painful effort he slowly pointed a bloody finger towards the woman then the gasping stopped his eyes open wide in a lifeless stare we looked at the woman in astonishment was she mossolov she remained standing there looking down at the floor the womans handbag was lying on the table i quickly found a drivers license katarina mossolov i showed the document to oldenberg let me introduce you to mossolov i said well would you believe it exclaimed oldenberg everybodys attention was focused on mossolov but suddenly there was the sound of rapid footsteps hey wheres the driver asked the sergeant urgently from outside we heard the sound of a motor then tires spinning and screaming as the limo raced to the gates he wont get far remarked oldenberg then came the crash of breaking wood and bending metal footsteps running down the street a shout police stop right there the other police car had finally arrived theyve got him said oldenberg from the sound of the crash thats another nypd car out of action still cars are replaceable good officers arent i had one last favor to ask oldenberg before you charge mossolov i want a word with her just trust me ok she looked at me blankly oily liquid was still dripping from her hair i dont enjoy being threatened i said to her coldly the last time i met your man zernov he promised to break my legs if i didnt behave now look at him the nypd already has enough evidence against you to put you away for a very long time the only choice you have is to cooperate unless youd like my muscle man joe to help persuade you i must have sounded convincing i knew it was an empty threat but she believed me she looked around in alarm joe grinned unpleasantly at her to back up the message so tell me did you have romanov murdered i asked all right i admit it i ordered romanovs death she said in a low tired voice he knew too much and had been asking too many questions about my operation nick was carrying out my orders but the fool made everything too complicated i told him to make it look like a simple carjacking nothing fancy then he found that stupid drunk in the odessa steps i dont know who was more stupid nick or the drunk not that it matters any more i had the confession i wanted case closed oldenberg did you catch all that i asked everything marley and i didnt hear you making any threats may i congratulate you that was a compliment indeed coming from the captain thanks shes all yours now will you arrange the immediate release of de la cruz hell need a statement to the effect that he was wrongfully arrested and charged and of course an official apology from the nypd his lawyer will also be asking for financial compensation for wrongful arrest you got it replied oldenberg my hands started to tremble violently i knew that old familiar reaction to shock i felt a wave of exhaustion going through my body but there were still two more things i had to do first a call to mrs romanov mrs romanov i know who murdered your husband nick zernov acting under the orders of a katarina mossolov the woman behind the immigrant smuggling zernov is now dead and mossolov is under arrest youll get a full report on monday thank god youre safe said mrs romanov i cant thank you enough and a call to stella its nat we have all the proof joses going to be a free man weve cleared his name oh nat im so relieved i dont know what to say its like huge weights been lifted from me ill have to phone around to all the family right now you do that stella ill see you on monday i took one last look around the repair shop the glow of the oil lamps zernov lifeless on the floor dead eyes staring into empty space mossolov now in handcuffs with an expression of complete disbelief the illegal immigrants were still sitting at the table looking around in shocked silence what an introduction to the usa the land of opportunity time to get back to some of that predictable routine work like divorce bad debts and missing persons it was safe and dull paid the bills and didnt involve being shot at come on joe thats quite enough excitement for one night lets go home the end
