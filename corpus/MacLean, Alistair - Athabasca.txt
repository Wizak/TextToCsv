 athabasca alistar maclean prologue this book is not primarily about oil but is based on oil and the means whereby oil is recovered from the earth so it may be of some interest and help to look briefly at these phenomena what oil is and how it is formed in the first place no one quite seems to know the technical books and treatises on this subject are legion i am aware that personally i havent seen a fraction of them and they are largely so i am assured in close agreement except when they come to what one would have thought was a point of considerable interest how precisely does oil become oil there appear to be as many divergent theories about this as there are about the origins of life confronted with complexities the welladvised layman takes refuge in oversimplification which is what i now do as i can do no other only two elements were needed for the formation of oil rock and the incredibly abundant plants and primitive living organisms that teemed in rivers lakes and seas as far back as perhaps a billion years ago hence the term fossil fuels the biblical references to the rock of ages give rise to misconceptions about the nature and permanency of rock rock the material of which the earths crust is made is neither eternal nor indestructible nor is it even unchanging on the contrary it is in a state of constant change movement and flux and it is salutary to remind ourselves that there was a time when no rock existed even today there is a singular lack of agreement among geologists geophysicists and astronomers as to how the earth came into being but there is a measure of agreement that there was a primary incandescent and gaseous state followed by a molten state neither of which was conducive to the formation of anything rock included it is erroneous to suppose that rock has been is and ever will be yet we are not concerned here with the ultimate origins of rock but rock as we have it today it is admittedly difficult to observe this process of flux because a minor change may take ten million years a major change a hundred million rock is constantly being destroyed and rebuilt in the destructive process weather is the main factor in the rebuilding the forces of gravity five main weather elements act upon rock frost and ice fracture rock it can be gradually eroded by airborne dust the action of the seas whether through the constant movement of waves and tides or the pounding of heavy storm waves remorselessly wears away the coastlines rivers are immensely powerful destructive agencies one has but to look at the grand canyon to appreciate their enormous power and such rocks as escape all these influences are worn away over the eons by the effect of rain whatever the cause of erosion the end result is the same the rock is reduced to its tiniest possible constituents rock particles or simply dust rain and melting snow carry this dust down to the tiniest rivulets and the mightiest rivers which in turn transport it to lakes inland seas and the coastal regions of the oceans dust however fine and powdery is still heavier than water and whenever the water becomes sufficiently still it will gradually sink to the bottom not only in lakes and seas but also in the sluggish lower reaches of rivers and where flood conditions exist in the form of silt and so over unimaginably long reaches of time whole mountain ranges are carried down to the seas and in the process through the effects of gravity new rock is born as layer after layer of dust accumulates on the bottom building up to a depth of ten a hundred perhaps even a thousand feet the lowermost layers being gradually compacted by the immense and steadily increasing pressures from above until the particles fuse together and reform as new rock it is in the intermediate and final processes of this new rock formation that oil comes into being those lakes and seas of hundreds of millions of years ago were almost choked by water plants and the most primitive forms of aquatic life on dying they sank to the bottom of the lakes and seas along with the settling dust particles and were gradually buried deep under the endless layers of more dust and more aquatic and plant life that slowly accumulated above them the passing of millions of years and the steadily increasing pressures from above gradually changed the decayed vegetation and dead aquatic life into oil described thus simply and quickly the process sounds reasonable enough but this is where the gray and disputatious area arises the conditions necessary for the formation of oil are known the cause of the metamorphosis is not it seems probable that some form of chemical catalyst is involved but this catalyst has not been isolated the first purely synthetic oil as distinct from secondary synthetic oils such as those derived from coal has yet to be produced we just have to accept that oil is oil that it is there bound up in rock strata in fairly welldefined areas throughout the world but always on the sites of ancient seas and lakes some of which are now continental land some buried deep under the encroachment of new oceans had the oil remained intermingled with those deeply buried rock strata and were the earth a stable place that oil would have been irrecoverable but our planet is a highly unstable place there is no such thing as a stable continent securely anchored to the core of the earth the continents rest on the socalled tectonic plates which in turn float on the molten magma below with neither anchor nor rudder free to wander in whichever haphazard fashion they will this they unquestionably do they are much given to banging into each other grinding alongside each other overriding or dipping under each other in a wholly unpredictable fashion and in general resembling rocks in the demonstration of their fundamental instability as this banging and clashing takes place over periods of tens or hundreds of millions of years it is not readily apparent to us except in the form of earthquakes which generally occur where two tectonic plates are in contention the collision of two such plates engenders incredible pressures and two of the effects of such pressures are of particular concern here in the first place the huge compressive forces involved tend to squeeze the oil from the rock strata in which it is imbedded and to disperse it in whichever direction the pressure permits up down or sideways secondly a collision buckles or folds the rock strata themselves the upper strata being forced upward to form mountain ranges the northern movement of the indian tectonic plate created the himalayas and the lower strata buckling to create what are virtually subterranean mountains folding the layered strata into massive domes and arches it is at this point insofar as oil recovery is concerned that the nature of the rocks themselves become of importance the rock can be porous or nonporous the porous rock such as gypsum permits liquids such as oil to pass through them while the nonporous such as limestone does not in the case of porous rock the oil influenced by those compressive forces will seep upward through the rock until the distributive pressure eases when it will come to rest at or very close to the surface of the earth in the case of nonporous rock the oil will become trapped in a dome or arch and in spite of the great pressures from below can escape neither sideways nor upward but must remain where it is in this latter case what are regarded as conventional methods are used in the recovery of oil geologists locate a dome and a hole is drilled with reasonable luck they hit an oil dome and not a solid one and their problems are over the powerful subterranean pressures normally drive the oil to the surface the recovery of seepage oil which has passed upward through porous rock presents a quite different and far more formidable problem the answer to which was not found until as late as even then it was only a partial answer the trouble of course is that this surface seepage oil does not collect in pools but is inextricably intermixed with foreign matter such as sand and clay from which it has to be abstracted and refined it is in fact a solid and has to be mined as such and although this solidified oil may go as deep as six thousand feet only the first two hundred feet in the limits of presentday knowledge and techniques are accessible and that only by surface mining conventional mining methods the sinking of vertical shafts and the driving of horizontal galleries would be hopelessly inadequate as they would provide only the tiniest fraction of the raw material required to make the extraction process commercially viable the latest oil extraction plant which went into operation only in the summer of requires tons of raw material every hour two excellent examples of the two different methods of oil recovery are to be found in the far northwest of north america the conventional method of deep drilling is well exemplified by the prudhoe bay oil field on the arctic shore of northern alaska its latterday counterpart the surface mining of oil is to be found and indeed it is the only place in the world where it can be found in the tar sands of athabasca one this said george dermott is no place for us he eased his considerable bulk back from the dining table and regarded the remains of several enormous lamb chops with disfavor jim brady expects his field operatives to be lean fit and athletic are we lean fit and athletic there are desserts donald mackenzie said like dermott he was a large and comfortable man a little larger and a little less comfortable than his partner with a rugged weatherbeaten face observers often took him and his partner for a pair of retired heavyweight boxers i can see cakes cookies and a wide variety of pastries he went on you read their food brochure says that the average man requires at least five thousand calories a day to cope with arctic conditions but we george are not average men six thousand would do better in a pinch nearer seven would be safer id say chocolate mousse and double cream he had a notice about it on the staff bulletin board dermott said wryly heavy black border for some reason signed too senior operatives dont look at staff boards mackenzie heaved his pounds erect and headed purposefully for the food counter there was no doubt that bp sohio did extremely well by their staff here at prudhoe bay on the bitter rim of the arctic ocean in midwinter the spacious light and airy dining room with multicolored pastel walls backdropping the recurrent fivepointedstar motif was maintained at a pleasantly fresh º f by the airconditioned central heating the temperature difference between the dining room and the outside world was degrees the range of excellently cooked food was also astonishing dont exactly starve themselves up here he said as he returned with a mousse for each of them and a pitcher of heavy cream i wonder what the old alaskan sourdoughs would have made of it the first reaction of a prospector or trapper of yesteryear would have been that he was suffering from hallucinations all in all it was hard to say what feature he would have found the most astonishing eighty per cent of the items on the menu would have been unknown to him but he would have been still more amazed by the fortyfoot swimming pool and the glassedin garden with its pine trees birches plants and profusion of flowers that abutted on the dining room god knows what the old boys would have thought said dermott you might ask him though he indicated a man heading in their direction jack london would have recognized this one right away mackenzie said more the robert service type id say the newcomer certainly wasnt of current vintage he wore heavy felt boots moleskin trousers and an incredibly faded mackinaw which went well enough with the equally faded patches on the sleeves a pair of sealskin gloves were suspended from his neck and he carried a coonskin cap in his right hand his hair was long and white and parted in the middle he had a slightly hooked nose and clear blue eyes with deeply entrenched crows feet which could have been caused by too much sun too much snow or a too highly developed sense of humor the rest of his face was obscured by a magnificent grizzled beard and mustache both of which were at that moment rimed by droplets of ice the yellow hard hat swinging from his left hand struck a jarring note he stopped at their table and from the momentary flash of white teeth it could be assumed that he was smiling mr dermott mr mackenzie he offered his hand finlayson john finlayson dermott said mr finlayson field operations managers office i am the field operations manager he pulled out a chair sat sighed and removed some ice particles from his beard yes yes i know hard to believe he smiled again gestured at his clothing most people think ive been riding the rods you know hobo on the boxcars god knows why nearest railroad tracks a long long way from prudhoe bay like tahiti and grass skirts you know gone native too many years on the north slope his oddly staccato manner of speech was indeed suggestive of a person whose contact with civilization was at best intermittent sorry i couldnt make it meet you i mean deadhorse mackenzie said deadhorse airstrip a little trouble at one of the gathering centers happens all the time subzero temperatures play hell with the molecular structure of steel being well taken care of i hope no complaints dermott smiled not that we require much care there the food counter here mackenzie the wateringhole and the camel dermott checked himself he was beginning to talk like finlayson well one little complaint perhaps too many items on the lunch menu too large a helping of any item my colleagues waistline your colleagues waistline can take care of itself mackenzie said comfortably but i do have a complaint mr finlayson i can imagine another momentary flash of teeth and finlayson was on his feet lets hear it in my office just a few steps he walked across the dining hall stopped outside a door and indicated another door to the left master operations control center the heart of prudhoe bay or the western half of it at least all the computerized process control facilities for the supervision of the fields operations dermott said an enterprising lad with a satchelful of grenades could have himself quite a time in there five seconds and he could close down the entire oil field come all the way from houston just to cheer me up this way he led them through the outer door then through an inner one to a small office desks chairs and filing cabinets all in metal all in battleship gray he gestured them to sit and smiled at mackenzie as the french say a meal without wine is like a day without sunshine its this texas dust mackenzie said sticks in the gullet like no other dust laughs at water finlayson made a sweeping motion with his hand some big rigs out there damned expensive and damned difficult to handle its pitch dark say forty below and youre tired youre always tired up here dont forget we work twelve hours a day seven days a week a couple of scotches on top of all that and youve written off a million dollars worth of equipment or you damage the pipeline or you kill yourself or worst of all you kill some of your mates comparatively they had it easy in the old prohibition days bulk smuggling from canada bathtub gin illicit stills by the thousand rather different on the north slope here get caught smuggling in a teaspoonful of liquor and thats it no argument no court of appeal out but theres no problem no one is going to risk eight hundred dollars a week for ten cents worth of bourbon mackenzie said whens the next flight out to anchorage finlayson smiled all is not lost mr mackenzie he unlocked a filing cabinet produced a bottle of scotch and two glasses and poured with a generous hand welcome to the north slope gentlemen i was having visions said mackenzie of travelers stranded in an alpine blizzard and a st bernard lolloping toward them with the usual restorative youre not a drinking man certainly one week in five when i rejoin my family in anchorage this is strictly for visiting vips one would assume you qualify under that heading thoughtfully he mopped melting ice from his beard though frankly i never heard of your organization until a couple of days ago think of us as desert roses mackenzie said born to blush and bloom unseen i think ive got that wrong but the desert bit is appropriate enough thats where we seem to spend most of our time he nodded toward the window a desert doesnt have to be made of sand i suppose this qualifies as an arctic desert i think of it that way myself but what do you do in those deserts your function i mean our function dermott considered oddly enough id say our function is to reduce our worthy employer jim brady to a state of bankruptcy jim brady i thought his initial was a his mother was english she christened him algernon wouldnt you object hes always known as jim anyway there are only three people in the world any good at extinguishing oilfield fires particularly gusher fires and all three are texasbased jim bradys one of the three it used to be commonly accepted that there are just three causes of such oil fires spontaneous combustion which should never happen but does the human factor ie sheer carelessness and mechanical failure after twentyfive years in the business brady recognized that there was a fourth and more sinister element involved that would come broadly speaking under the heading of industrial sabotage who would engage in sabotage what would the motivation be well first we can rule out the most obvious rivalry among the big oil companies it doesnt exist this notion of cutthroat competition exists only in the sensational press and among the more feebleminded of the public to be a fly on the wall at a closed meeting of the oil lobby in washington is to understand once and for all the meaning of the expression two minds with but a single thought two hearts that beat as one multiplied by twenty of course let exxon put up the price of gas by a penny today and gulf shell bp elf agip and all the others will do the same tomorrow or even take prudhoe bay here the classic example surely of cooperation umpteen companies working handinglove for the mutual benefit of all concerned benefit of all the oil companies that is the state of alaska and the general public might adopt a rather different and more jaundiced viewpoint so we rule out business rivalries this leaves another kind of energy power international power politics say country x could seriously weaken enemy country y by slowing down its oil revenues thats one obvious scenario then theres internal power politics suppose disaffected elements in an oilrich dictatorship see a means of demonstrating their dissatisfaction against a regime that clasps the illgotten gains to its mercenary bosom or at best distributes some measure of the largesse to its nearest and dearest while ensuring that the peasantry remains in the properly medieval state of poverty starvation does nicely as motivation this kind of setup leaves room for personal revenge the settling of old scores the working off of old grudges and dont forget the pyromaniac who sees in oil a ludicrously easy target and the source of lovely flames in short theres room for practically everything and the more bizarre and unimaginable the more likely to happen a case in point he nodded at mackenzie donald and i have just returned from the gulf the local security men and the police were baffled by an outbreak of small fires small socalled but with damage totalling two million dollars clearly the work of an arsonist we tracked him down apprehended him and punished him we gave him a bow and arrow finlayson looked at them as if their scotch had taken hold too quickly elevenyearold son of the british consul he had a powerful webley air pistol webley makes the traditional ammunition for this hollow concave lead pellets they do not make pellets of hardened steel which give off a splendid spark when they strike ferrous metal this lad had a plentiful supply obtained from a local arab boy who had a similar pistol and used those illegal pellets for hunting desert vermin incidentally the arab boys old man a prince of the blood royal owned the oil field in question the english boys arrows have rubber tips im sure theres a moral there somewhere sure theres a lesson the unpredictable is always with you our industrial sabotage division thats jim bradys term for it was formed six years ago there are fourteen of us in it at first it was a purely investigative agency we went to a place after the deed had been done and the fire put out as often as not it was jim who put it out and tried to find out who had done it why and what his modus operandi had been frankly we had very limited success usually the horse had gone and all we were doing was locking the empty stable door now the emphasis has changed we try to lock the damned door in such a fashion that no one can open it in other words prevention the maximum tightening of both mechanical and human security the response to this service has been remarkable were now the most profitable side of jims operations by far capping off runaway wells putting fires out cant hold a candle if youll pardon the expression to our security work such is the demand for our services that we could triple our division and still not cope with all the calls being made upon us well why dont you triple the business i mean trained personnel mackenzie said just not there more accurately there are next to no experienced operatives and theres an almost total dearth of people qualified to be trained for the job the combination of qualifications is difficult to come by you have to have an investigative mind and that in turn is based on an inborn instinct for detection the sherlock holmes genes shall we say youve either got it or not it cant be inculcated you have to have an eye and a nose for security an obsession almost and this can only come from field experience you have to have a pretty detailed knowledge of the oil industry worldwide and above all you have to be an oilman and you gentlemen are oilmen it was a statement not a question all our working lives dermott said weve both been field operation managers if your services are in such demand how come we should be so lucky as to jump to the head of the queue dermott said as far as we know this is the first time any oil company has received notification of intent to sabotage first real chance weve had to try out our preventive medicine were just slightly puzzled on one point mr finlayson you say you never heard of us until a couple of days ago how come were here then i mean we knew of this three days ago when we arrived back from the mideast we spent a day resting up another day studying the layout and security measures of the alaskan pipeline and you did that eh isnt it classified information dermott was patient we could have sent for it immediately on receiving the request for assistance we didnt have to the information mr finlayson is not classified its in the public domain big companies tend to be incredibly careless about such matters whether to reassure the public or burnish their own image by taking thoroughgoing precautions they not only release large chunks of information about their activities but positively bombard the public with them the information of course comes in disparate and apparently unrelated lumps it requires only a moderately intelligent fella to piece them all together not that those big companies such as alyeska who built your pipeline have much to reproach themselves about they dont even begin to operate in the same league of indiscretion as the alltime champs the u s government take the classic example of the declassification of the secret of the atom bomb when the russians got the bomb the government thought there was no point in being secretive anymore and proceeded to tell all you want to know how to make an atom bomb just send a pittance to the aec in washington and youll have the necessary information by return mail that this information could be used by americans against americans apparently never occurred to the towering intellects of capitol hill and the pentagon who seem to have been under the impression that the american criminal classes voluntarily retired en masse on the day of declassification finlayson raised a defensive hand hold enough i accept that you havent infiltrated prudhole bay with a battalion of spies answers simple when i received this unpleasant letter it was sent to me not to our hq in anchorage i talked to the general manager alaska we both agreed that it was almost certainly a hoax still i regret to say that many alaskans arent all that kindly disposed toward us we also agreed that if it was not a hoax it could be something very serious indeed people like us although were well enough up the ladder in our own fields dont make final decisions on the safety and future of a tenbilliondollar investment so we notified the grand panjandrums your directive came from london informing me of their decision must have come as an afterthought head offices being what they are dermott said got this threatening note here finlayson retrieved a single sheet of notepaper from a drawer and passed it across my dear mr finlayson dermott read well thats civil enough i have to inform you that you will be incurring a slight spillage of oil in the near future not much i assure you just sufficient to convince you that we can interrupt oil flow whenever and wherever we please please notify arco dermott shoved the letter across to mackenzie understandably unsigned no demands if this is genuine its intended as a softeningup demonstration in preparation for the big threat and big demand that will follow a moralesapper if you will designed to scare the pants off you finlaysons gaze was on the middle distance im not so sure he hasnt done that already you notified arco yup oil fields split more or less halfandhalf we run the western sector arco atlantic richfield exxon some smaller groups they run the eastern sector whats their reaction like mine hope for the best prepare for the worst your security chief whats his reaction downright pessimistic its his baby after all if i were in his shoes id feel the same way hes convinced of the genuineness of this threat me too dermott said this came in an envelope ah thank you he read the address mr john finlayson bsc amime not only punctilious but theyve done their homework on you bp sohio prudhoe bay alaska postmarked edmonton alberta that mean anything to you nary a thing i have neither friends nor acquaintances there and certainly no business contacts your security chiefs reaction same as mine zero whats his name bronowski sam bronowski lets have him in shall we youll have to wait im afraid hes down in fairbanks back tonight if the weather holds up depends on visibility blizzard season we dont have one precipitation on the north slope is very low maybe six inches in a winter high winds are the bugaboo they blow up the surface snow so that the air can be completely opaque for thirty or forty feet above the ground just before christmas a few years ago a hercules normally the safest of aircraft tried to land in those conditions didnt make it two of the crew of four killed pilots have become a bit leery since if a hercules can crash any aircraft can these high winds and the surface snowstorms they generate that snow can be driving along at seventy miles an hour are the bane of our existence up here thats why this operations center is built on pilings seven feet above ground lets the snow blow right underneath otherwise wed end the winter season buried under a massive drift the pilings of course also virtually eliminate heat transfer to the permafrost but thats secondary whats bronowski doing in fairbanks stiffening the thin red line hiring extra security guards for fairbanks how does he set about that approach varies i suppose really bronowskis department mr dermott he has carte blanche in those matters i suggest you ask him on his return oh come on youre his boss bosses keep tabs on their subordinates roughly how does he recruit well hes probably built up a list of people whom hes personally contacted and who might be available in a state of emergency im honestly not sure about this i may be his boss but when i delegate responsibility i do just that i do know that he approaches the chief of police and asks for suitable recommendations he may or may not have put in an ad in the allalaska weekly thats published in fairbanks finlayson thought briefly i wouldnt say hes deliberately closemouthed about this i suppose when youve been a security man all your life you naturally dont let your left hand know what the right hands doing what kind of men does he recruit almost all excops you know exstate troopers but not trained security men as such no although id have thought security would have come as second nature to a state trooper finlayson smiled i imagine sams principal criterion is whether the man can shoot straight securitys a mental thing not physical you said almost all hes brought in two firstclass security agents from outside ones stationed at fairbanks the other at valdez who says theyre first class sam he handpicked them finlayson rubbed his drying beard in what could have been a gesture of irritation you know mr dermott friendly even genial you may be but i have the odd impression that im being thirddegreed rubbish if that were happening youd know all about it because id be asking you questions about yourself ive no intention of doing so now or in the future you wouldnt be having a dossier on me would you tuesday september was the day and date you entered your secondary school in dundee scotland jesus whats so sensitive about the fairbanks area why strengthen your defenses there particularly finlayson shifted in his seat no hardandfast reason really never mind whether its hard and fast the reason finlayson drew in his breath as if he were about to sigh then seemed to change his mind bit silly really you know how whisperings can generate a hoodoo people on the line are a bit scared of that sector youll know that the pipeline has three mountain ranges to traverse on its eighthundredmile run south to the terminal at valdez so pump stations twelve in all pump station number eight is close to fairbanks it blew up in the summer of seventyseven completely destroyed fatalities yes explanations given for this blowup of course satisfactory the pipeline construction company alyeska were satisfied but not everyone the public was skeptical state and federal agencies withheld comment what reason did alyeska give mechanical and electrical malfunction do you believe that i wasnt there the explanation was generally accepted the explanation was widely disbelieved sabotage perhaps perhaps i dont know i was here at the time ive never even seen pump station number eight been rebuilt of course dermott sighed this is where i should be showing some slight traces of exasperation dont believe in committing yourself do you mr finlayson still youd probably make a good security agent i dont suppose youd like to venture an opinion as to whether there was a coverup or not my opinion hardly matters what matters i suppose is that the alaskan press was damned certain there was and said so loud and clear the fact that the papers appeared unconcerned about the possibility of libel action could be regarded as significant they would have welcomed a public inquiry one assumes that alyeska would not have why were the newspapers stirred up or is that an unnecessary question what incensed the press was that they were prevented for many hours from reaching the scene of the accident what doubly incensed them was that they were prevented not by peace officers of the state but by alyeskas private guards who incredibly took it upon themselves to close state roads even their local pr man agreed that this amounted to illegal restraint anybody sue no court action resulted why when finlayson shrugged dermott went on could it have been because alyeska is the biggest employer in the state because the life blood of so many companies depends on their contracts with alyeska in other words big money talking big possibly any minute now ill be signing you up for jim brady what did the press say because theyd been prevented for a whole day from getting to the scene of the accident they believed alyeska employees had been working feverishly during that time to clean up and minimize the effects of the accident to remove the evidence of a major spillage and to conceal the fact that their failsafe system had failed dangerously alyeska had also the press said covered up the worst effects of the fire damage might they also have removed or covered up incriminating evidence pointing to sabotage no guessing games for me ah right do you or bronowski know of any disaffected elements in fairbanks depends what you mean by disaffected if you mean environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline yes hundreds and very strongly opposed but i assume theyre open about it always give their full names and addresses when writing to the papers yes besides environmentalists tend to be sensitive and nonviolent people who work within the confines of the law about any other disaffected types i wouldnt know there are fifteen thousand people in fairbanks and it would be optimistic to expect theyre all as pure as the driven snow what did bronowski think of the incident he wasnt there that wasnt what i asked he was in new york at the time he hadnt even joined the company then a relative newcomer then yes in your book i suppose that automatically makes him a suspect if you wish to go ahead and waste your time investigating his antecedents by all means do so but i could save you time and effort by telling you that we had him checked doublechecked and triplechecked by three separate topflight agencies the new york police department gave him a clean bill of health his record and that of his company are were impeccable i dont doubt it what were his qualifications and what was his company one and the same thing really he headed up one of the biggest and arguably the best security agencies in new york before that he was a cop what did his company specialize in nothing but the best guards mainly additional guards for a handful of the biggest banks when their own security forces were understaffed by holidays or illness guarding the homes of the richest people in manhattan and long island to prevent the ungodly making off with the guests jewellery when largescale social functions were being held his third speciality was providing security for exhibitions of precious gems and paintings if you could ever persuade the dutch to lend you rembrandts night watch for a couple of months bronowski would be the man youd send for what would induce a man to leave all that and come to this end of the world he doesnt say he doesnt have to homesickness more specifically his wifes homesickness she lives in anchorage he flies down there every weekend i thought you were supposed to do a full four weeks up here before you got time off doesnt apply to bronowski only to those whose permanent job is here this is his nominal base but the whole line is his responsibility for instance if theres trouble in valdez hes a damn sight nearer it in his wifes flat in anchorage than he would be if he were up here and hes very mobile is our sam owns and flies his own comanche we pay his fuel thats all hes not without the odd penny to his name i should say not he doesnt really need this job but he cant bear to be inactive money he retains the controlling interest in his new york firm no conflict of interests how the hell could there be a conflict of interests hes never even been out of the state since he arrived here over a year ago a trustworthy lad it would seem damn few of them around these days dermott looked at mackenzie donald yes mackenzie picked up the unsigned letter from edmonton fbi seen this of course not whats it got to do with the fbi it might have an awful lot to do with them and soon i know alaskans think that this is a nation apart that this is your own special and private fiefdom up here and that you refer to us unfortunates as the lower fortyeight but youre still part of the united states when the oil from the pipeline arrives at valdez its shipped to one of the west coast states any interruption in oil transfer between prudhoe bay and say california would be regarded as an unlawful interference with interstate commerce and would automatically bring in the fbi well it hasnt happened yet besides what can the fbi do they know nothing of oil or pipeline security look after the pipeline they couldnt even look after themselves wed just spend most of our time trying to thaw out the few of them who didnt freeze to death during their first ten minutes here they could only survive under cover so what could they do there take over our computer terminals and master communications and alarm detection stations at prudhoe bay fairbanks and valdez we have highly trained specialists to monitor over three thousand sources of alarm information asking the fbi to do that would be like asking a blind man to read sanskrit inside or out theyd only be in the way and a useless burden to all concerned alaska state troopers could survive i guess theyd survive where even some of your own men couldnt have you been in touch with them have you notified the state authorities in juneau no why not they dont love us oh sure if there was physical trouble violence theyd move in immediately until then theyd rather not know i cant say i blame them and before you ask me why ill tell you for good or bad weve inherited the alyeska mantle alyeska built the pipeline and they run it but we use it im afraid theres a wide gray area of nondiscrimination here in most peoples eyes they were pipeline we are pipeline finlayson reflected on hisnext words its hard not to feel a bit sorry for alyeska they were pretty cruelly pilloried sure they bore the responsibility for a remarkable amount of waste and incurred vast cost overruns but they did complete an impossible job in impossible conditions and whats more brought it in on schedule best construction company in north america at the time brilliant engineering and brilliant engineers but the brilliance stopped short of their pr people who might as well have been operating in downtown manhattan for all they knew about alaskans their job should have been to sell the pipeline to the people all they succeeded in doing was in turning a large section of the population solidly against the line and the construction company he shook his head you had to be truly gifted to get it as wrong as they did they sought to protect the good name of alyeska but all they did by blatant coverups it was alleged and by deliberate lying was to bring whatever good name there was into total disrepute finlayson reached into a drawer took out two sheets of paper and gave them to dermott and mackenzie photostats of a classic example of the way they handled those under contract to them one would assume they learned their trade in one of the more repressive police states read it youll find it instructive youll also understand how by simple thought transference were not in line for much public sympathy the two men read the photostats alyeska pipeline supplement no service company revision no pipeline and roads april job specification page c in no event shall contractor or its personnel report a leak or an oil spill to any governmental agency such reporting shall be the sole responsibility of alyeska contractor shall emphasize this to all its supervisory personnel and employees d further in no event shall contractor or its personnel discuss report or communicate in any way with news media whether the news media be radio television newspapers or periodicals any such communication by contractor shall be deemed to be a material breach of contract by contractor all contracts with news media regarding leaks or oil spills shall be made by alyeska if news media people contact contractor or contractors personnel they shall refer news media to alyeska without further discussing reporting or communicating contractor shall emphasize the aforementioned alyeska news media requirements to all its supervisory personnel and employees dermott rested the photostat on his knee an american wrote this an american of foreign extraction mackenzie said who obviously trained under goebbels a charming directive dermott said hushup coverup or lose your contract toe the line or youre fired a shining example of american democracy at its finest well well he glanced briefly at the paper then at finlayson how did you get hold of this classified information surely oddly enough no what you would call the public domain editorial page allalaska weekly july dont question it was classified how the paper got hold of it i dont know nice to see a little paper going against the might of a giant company and getting away with it restores ones faith in something or other finlayson picked up another photostat the same editorial also made a despairing reference to the horrendous negative impact of the pipeline on us thats as true now as it was then weve inherited this horrendous negative impact and were still suffering from it so there it is im not saying were entirely friendless or that the authorities wouldnt move in quickly if there were any overt violations of the law but because votes are important those in charge of our destinies rule from behind they sense the wind of public opinion then enact acceptable legislation and adopt correspondingly safe attitudes whatever happens theyre not going to antagonize those who keep them in power they are not with the publics eye on both them and us going to come and hold our hands because of any anonymous threat by some anonymous crackpot mackenzie said so it amounts to this until actual sabotage occurs you can expect no outside help so far as preventive measures are concerned youre dependent solely upon bronowski and his security teams in effect youre on your own its an unhappy thought but there it is dermott stood up and walked back and forth accepting this threat as real whos behind it and what does he want not a crackpot thats sure if it were say some environmentalist running amok hed go ahead and do his damnedest without any prior warning no could be with a view to extortion or blackmail which do not have to be the same thing extortion would be for money blackmail could have many different purposes in mind stopping the flow of oil is unlikely to be that primary purpose more likely itll be a stoppage for another and more important purpose money politics local or international power misguided idealism genuine idealism or just crackpot irresponsibility well im afraid speculation will have to wait on developments meantime mr finlayson id like to see bronowski as soon as possible i told you he has business to finish hell be flying up in a few hours ask him to fly up now please sorry bronowskis his own man overall hes answerable to me but not in field operations hed walk out if i tried to usurp his authority unless he had the power to act independently hed be effectively hamstrung you dont hire a dog and bark yourself i dont think you quite understand mr mackenzie and i have not only been promised total cooperation weve been empowered to direct security measures if in our judgement such extreme measures are dictated by circumstances finlaysons yukon beard still masked his expression but there was no mistaking the disbelief in his voice you mean take over from bronowski if again in our judgement hes good enough we just sit by the sidelines and advise if not we will exercise the authority invested in us invested by whom this is preposterous i will not i cannot permit it you walk in here and imagine no no way i have received no such directive then i suggest you seek such a directive or confirmation of it immediately from whom the grand panjandrums as you call them london dermott said nothing thats for mr black dermott remained silent general manager alaska dermott nodded at the three telephones on finlaysons desk hes as far away as one of those hes out of state hes visiting our offices in seattle san francisco and los angeles at what times and in what order i dont know i do know hell be back in anchorage at noon tomorrow are you telling me that is the soonest you can or will contact him yes you could phone those offices ive told you i dont know where hed be ht could be at some other place altogether like as not hes in the air you could try couldnt you finlayson remained silent and dermott spoke again you could call london direct you dont know much about the hierarchy in oil companies do you no but i know this now dermotts customary geniality was gone youre a considerable disappointment finlayson you are or very well may be in serious trouble in the circumstances one does not expect an executive in top management to resort to stiff outrage and wounded pride youve got your priorities wrong my friend the good of the company comes first not your feelings or protecting your ass finlaysons eyes showed no expression mackenzie was staring at the ceiling as if he had found something of absorbing interest there dermott he had learned over the years was a past master at pinning an adversary into a corner the victim either surrendered or placed himself in an impossible situation of which dermott would take ruthless advantage if he couldnt get cooperation he would settle for nothing less than domination dermott went on i have made three requests all of which i regard as perfectly reasonable and you have refused all three you persist in your refusals yes i do dermott said well donald what are my options there are none mackenzie sounded sad only the inevitable yes dermott looked at finlayson coldly you have a radio microwave band to valdez that links up with the continental exchanges he pushed a card toward finlayson or would you refuse me permission to talk to my head office in houston finlayson said nothing he took the card lifted the phone and talked to the switchboard after three minutes silence which only finlayson seemed to find uncomfortable the phone rang finlayson listened briefly then handed over the phone dermott said brady enterprises mr brady please dermott there was a pause then good afternoon jim well well george bradys strong carrying voice was clearly audible in the office prudhoe bay is it coincidence coincidence i was just on the point of phoning you well my report jim news rather theres nothing to report and i have news for you mine first its more important open line one moment dermott looked at finlayson what security classification does your switchboard operator have none jesus shes only a telephone girl as you so rightly observe jesus heaven help the transalaska pipeline he pulled out a notebook and pencil and addressed the phone sorry jim open go ahead in a clear precise voice brady began to recite a seemingly meaningless jumble of letters and figures which dermott noted down in neatly printed script after about two minutes brady paused and said repeat no thanks you have something to say just this field manager here uncooperative unreasonable and obstructive i dont think we can profitably operate here permission to pull out there was only a brief pause before brady said clearly permission granted there came the click of a replaced receiver and dermott rose to his feet finlayson was already on his mr dermott dermott looked down at him icily and spoke in a voice as cold as winter give my love to london mr finlayson if youre ever there two thirteen hundred miles southeast of prudhoe bay at ten pm bradys men met jay shore in the bar of the peter pond hotel in fort mcmurray among those qualified to pass judgement on such matters it was readily agreed that as an engineering construction manager shore had no peer in canada his face was dark saturnine almost piratical which was rather an unfair trick for nature to play on him since that same nature had made him easygoing companionable humorous and cheerful not that he felt in the least humorous and cheerful at that moment nor did the man who sat beside him bill reynolds sanmobils operations manager a rubicund and normally smiling man to whom nature had given precisely the kind of diabolical mind that shore appeared to have but didnt bill reynolds looked across the table to dermott and mackenzie whom he and shore had met thirty seconds previously and said you make fast time gentlemen remarkable service if one may say so we try dermott said comfortably we do our best scotch asked mackenzie thanks reynolds nodded twin jet is that it right a shade expensive a man would think gets you around dermott smiled head office thats edmonton told us you might take up to four days we didnt expect you in four hours reynolds eyed dermott speculatively over his newly poured glass im afraid we dont know much about you fair enough we probably know even less about you not oilmen then of course but drilling oilmen were not familiar with mining the stuff and your fulltime job is security thats right so theres no need to ask what you were doing up on the north slope right again how long were you up there two hours two hours you mean you can lick a security we licked nothing we left may one ask why operations manager was unhelpful lets say me and my big mouth meaning im the operations manager here but i get the message dermott said pleasantly no message you asked a question i answered and you decided to walk out we have a backlog of cases all over the world and no time to waste trying to help those who wont help themselves lets not get off on the wrong foot gentlemen your company expects mackenzie and me to do the questioning while you do the answering when was this threat received shore said ten oclock this morning you have it with you not exactly it came by phone where from anchorage international call who took the message i did bill here was with me listening in caller gave us his message twice word for word he said i have to inform you that sanmobil will be incurring a slight interruption in oil production in the near future not much i assure you just sufficient to convince you that we can interrupt oil flow whenever and wherever we please that was all no demands no surprisingly dont worry the demands will come when the big threat does would you recognize this voice again would i recognize the voices of a million other canadians who talk exactly as he does you take this threat seriously i do we take most things seriously how good is security at the plant well fair enough for normal circumstances i suppose these promise to be highly abnormal circumstances how many guards twentyfour under terry brinckman he knows what hes doing i dont doubt it guard dogs none the usual police dogs alsatians dobermans boxers cant survive in these extreme conditions huskies can of course but they make lousy watchdogs theyre more interested in fighting each other than looking for intruders electric fences shore rolled his eyes upward and looked sorrowful you want to equip the environmentalists with a gallows right on the site why if even the meanest old wolf were to singe its mangy hide okay okay i suppose its pointless to ask about electronic beams sensor devices and the like pointless is right mackenzie said how big is this plant site reynolds looked unhappy about eight thousand acres eight thousand acres mackenzies voice was all doom what kind of perimeter would that make for fourteen miles yes we have a problem here mackenzie said i take it your security duties are twofold the guarding of vital installations in the plant itself and patrolling the perimeter to keep intruders out reynolds nodded the guards are in three shifts eight men per shift eight men without any protective aids at all to guard the plant itself and at the same time patrol fourteen miles of perimeter in the blackness of a winter night shore was defensive ours is a twentyfourhour operation the plant is brilliantly lit day and night but the perimeter isnt a blind man could drive a coach and four hell why go on a couple of army regiments might help although i doubt even that as i say a problem not only that dermott said all the brilliant illumination in the world isnt of the slightest help not when youve got hundreds of workers on each of the three shifts a day meaning subversives subversives less than two per cent of the work force are noncanadians theres been a royal decree abolishing canadian criminals when you hire you investigate backgrounds well not intensive questioning third degree lie detector tests or any of that rubbish try that and youd never hire anyone we check on previous experience qualifications recommendations and most important criminal records thats the least important really clever criminals never have criminal records dermott looked like a man who had been about to sigh explode curse or quit but had changed his mind well its late tomorrow mr mackenzie and i would like to talk to your terry brinckman and look over the plant if we have a car here at ten oclock how about seven oclock yes seven will be fine dermott and mackenzie watched the two men go looked at each other emptied their glasses signalled the barman then looked out through the windows of the peter pond hotel named after the first white man ever to see the tar sands pond went down the athabasca river by canoe almost exactly two hundred years before he did not take too much interest in the sand it appears but ten years later the much more famous explorer alexander mackenzie was intrigued by the sticky substance oozing from outcrops high above the river and wrote the bitumen is in a fluid state and when mixed with gum or the resinous substance collected from the spruce fir serves to gum the indians canoes in its heated state it emits a smell like that of seacoal oddly the significance of the words seacoal wasnt appreciated for more than a hundred years nobody realized that the two eighteenthcentury explorers had stumbled across one of the worlds largest reservoirs of fossil fuels but had they not so stumbled there would have been no peter pond hotel where it is today nor indeed the township beyond its windows even in the midnineteensixties fort mcmurray was little more than a rough primitive frontier outpost with a population of only thirteen hundred and streets covered with dust mud or slush according to season by now though still a frontier town it had become a frontier town with a difference treasuring its past but with an eye to the future it was the epitome of a boomtown and in terms of burgeoning population the fastest expanding township in canada where there were thirteen hundred citizens fourteen years earlier there were now thirteen thousand schools hotels banks hospitals churches supermarkets and above all hundreds of new houses stood and more were being built and wonder of wonders the streets were paved this seeming miracle stemmed from one factor and one factor only fort mcmurray sits squarely in the heart of the athabasca tar sands the biggest such known deposits in the world it had been snowing heavily earlier in the evening and had still not completely stopped everything houses streets car tops trees was under a smooth cover of white hundreds of lights shone hospitably through the gently falling flakes the scene would have gladdened the eye and heart of a christmas postcard artist some such thought had occurred to mackenzie santa claus should be here tonight indeed dermott sounded morose especially if he brought along some of that peace on earth and goodwill to all men whatever happened to peace on earth were running low on goodwill toward men shortage of everything what did you make of that telephone message to sanmobil same thing you did practically identical to the letter finlayson received up in prudhoe bay obviously the work of the same man or group of men and what do you make of the fact that alaskan oil people got a threatening message from alberta while the albertan oil interests received the same threat from alaska nothing except that both threats had the same origin that call from anchorage for a certainty from a public telephone booth untraceable probably not certainly i dont know if you can dial direct from anchorage to here i dont think so but we can find out if not the telephone operator will have a record theres a chance that we might locate the phone mackenzie briefly surveyed fort mcmurray through the base of his glass and said thatll be a big help it might be a small help two ways that call came in at ten this morning thats six am anchorage time who except a nut or some nightshift worker is going to be out in the black and freezing streets of anchorage at that hour that sort of odd behaviour i suggest isnt likely to go unnoticed if theres anyone there to notice state troopers in a patrol car taxi driver snowplough driver mailman on the way to work youd be surprised at the number of people who go about their lawful occasions in the dark watches of the night i would not be surprised mackenzie spoke with some feeling weve done it often enough in this damned job of ours two ways you said whats the second way if i locate this pay phone we can have the police remove the coin box and give it to their fingerprint boys the chances are good that the person who made the call to fort mcmurray used more highdenomination coins than anyone else who went into the pay phone that day or night get two or three large coins with the same prints and thats our man objection coins are handled by many people youll get prints all right a plethora shall we say of fingerprints objection overruled its established that on a metal surface the overlay the last person to touch such a surface leaves the dominant print by the same token wed print the area around the dial people dont dial in fur mittens then wed check with criminal records the prints may be on file if they are well get the man and ask him all sorts of interesting questions you do have a devious mind george low cunning but albeit a mind first catch your man though if we get a description or prints with history it shouldnt be too difficult if hes gone to ground it would be different but theres no reason why he should think he has to take cover might be awkward for him anyway may well be a pillar of the anchorage business and social communities ill bet the other anchorage pillars would love to hear you say that theyd have the same opinion of you as our friend john finlayson has now what are we going to do about finlayson anyway rapprochement doesnt seem advisable its essential with the tieup so obvious let him stew in his own juice for a while i dont mean that the way it sounds but just let him worry awhile in prudhoe bay until were ready hes a good man intelligent honest he reacted precisely the way you or i would have if a couple of interlopers had tried to take over the longer we stay away the more certainly were guaranteed his cooperation when we get back jim brady may have been the bearer of bad news but that call of his couldnt have come at a more opportune time gave us the perfect excuse to take off speaking of jim ive been thinking that i dont much like any of this presentiments my scottish forebears one presumes you know that prudhoe bay and this place here contain well over half the oil reserves of north america its an awful lot of oil a man wouldnt want anything to happen to these two you havent worried about such things before an investigator is supposed to be cold clinical detached thats about other peoples oil this is our oil massive responsibilities awesome decisions at the highest levels we were talking of jim brady i still am you think we should have him up here i do so do i must be why i raised the subject lets go call him three jim brady that passionate believer in leanness keenness fitness and athleticism for his field operatives stood five feet eight in his elevator shoes and turned the scales at around pounds never a believer in travelling light he brought with him on the flight from houston not only his attractive blond wife jean but also his positively stunning daughter stella another natural blond who acted as his secretary on these field trips he left jean behind at the hotel in fort mcmurray hut kept stella with him in the minibus that sanmobil had sent to ferry him out to the plant the first impression he made on the hard men of athabasca was less than favorable he wore a superbly cut darkgray business suit it had to be well cut even to approximate a frame as spherical as his a white shirt and a conservative tie on top of these indoor clothes however he wore two woolen overcoats and a vast beaver coat the combined effect being to render his vertical and horizontal dimensions approximately equal he sported a soft felt hat the same color as his suit but this too was almost invisible anchored by a gray woolen scarf that passed twice over the crown and under his chins well ill be damned he exclaimed his voice was muffled by the ends of the scarf tied across his face just below the eyes which were the only part of him that could be seen even so it was clear to his companions that he was impressed this sure is something you boys must have a lot of fun digging away here and building these nice little ol sand castles thats one way of putting it mr brady jay shore spoke with restraint not much perhaps by texas standards but its still the biggest mining operation in the history of mankind no offence no offence you dont expect a texan to admit theres something bigger and better outside his own state one could almost feel him bracing himself for a handsome admission that beats anything ive ever come across that was a dragline but a dragline such as brady had never seen before a dragline is essentially an engine housing with a control cabin that operates a crane like boom the boom is hinged and swivelled at the base of the engine housing and so can be both raised and lowered and swung from side to side control is achieved by cables from the engine housing which pass over a massive steel superstructure and reach out to the tip of the boom another cable passing over the tip of the boom supports a bucket which can be lowered to scoop up material raised again and then swung to one side to dump its load biggest thing that ever moved on earth said shore move stella said yes it can move walks shuffles would be a better word on those two huge shoes at the base step by step you wouldnt want to enter it for the kentucky derby it takes seven hours to travel a mile not that its ever required to travel more than a few yards at a time point is it gets there and that long nose she said the boom the comparison most generally used is that its as long as a football field wrong its longer from here the bucket doesnt look all that big but thats only because everything is dwarfed out of perspective it scoops up eighty cubic yards at a time or enough to fill a twocar garage a large twocar garage the dragline weighs sixtyfive hundred tons about the same as a lightmedium cruiser cost about thirty million dollars takes fifteen to eighteen months to build on the site of course there are four of them and between them they can shift up to a quarter of a million tons a day you win this is a boomtown brady said lets get inside im cold the other four dermott mackenzie shore and brinckman the security chieflooked at him in mild astonishment it seemed impossible that a man so extravagantly upholstered and insulated both naturally and otherwise could possibly feel even cool but if brady said he was cold he was cold they clambered into the minibus which if a bit short on other creature comforts did at least have heaters in excellent condition also in excellent condition was the girl who sat down in the back seat lowered her parka hood and beamed at them brinckman was much the youngest of the men and had not paid much attention to stella now he touched the rim of his fur cap and lit up like a lamp his enthusiasm was hardly surprising for the white fur parka made her as cuddly looking as a polar bear cub wanna dictate anything dad she asked not yet brady grunted once safely sheltered from the vicious cold he undid the ends of the scarf that concealed his face somewhere in the distant past there must have been signs of the character that had driven him from the back streets of poverty to his present millions but years of gracious living had eradicated all trace of them bone structure had vanished under a fatty accumulation which had left him without a crease line or even the hint of crows feet it was a fat spoiled face like a cherubs with one exception there was nothing cherubic about the eyes they were blue cool appraising and shrewd he looked through the window at the dragline so thats the end of the line the beginning of it shore said the tar sands may lie as deep as fifty feet down the stuff above the overburden is useless to us gravel clay muskeg shale oilpoor sand and has to be removed first of all he pointed to an approaching vehicle heres some of that rubbish being carried away now its been excavated by another dragline on a new site to impress you further mr brady those trucks are also the biggest in the world a hundred and twentyfive tons empty payload of a hundred and fifty and all this on just four tires but you will admit they are some tires the truck was passing now and they were indeed some tires to brady they looked at least ten feet high and proportionately bulky the truck itself was monstrous twenty feet high at the cab and about the same width with the driver mounted so high as to be barely visible from the ground you could buy a very acceptable car for the price of one of those tires shore said as for the truck itself if you went shopping for one at todays prices you wouldnt get much change from three quarters of a million he spoke to his driver who started up and moved slowly off when the overburden is gone the same dragline scoops up the tar sand as the one weve just looked at is doing now and dumps it in this huge pile we call a windrow a weird machine of phenomenal length was nosing into the pile shore pointed and said a bucketwheel reclaimer theres one paired with every dragline four hundred and twentyeight feet long you can see the revolving bucket wheel biting into the windrow with fourteen buckets on a fortyfootdiameter wheel it can remove a fair tonnage every minute the tar sands are then transported along the spine of the reclaimer the bridge we call it to the separators from there brady interrupted separators sometimes the sands come in big solid lumps as hard as rock which could damage the conveyor belts the separators are just vibrating screens that sort out the lumps and without the separators the conveyor belts could be damaged certainly put out of commission probably we dont know its never been allowed to happen yet and then the tar sands go into the travelling hoppers you see there they drop the stuff onto the conveyor belt and off it goes to the processing plant after that one minute it was dermott you have a fair amount of this conveyor belting a fair bit how much exactly shore looked uncomfortable sixteen miles dermott stared at him and shore hurried on at the end of the conveyor system radial stackers direct it to what are called surge piles just really storage dumps radial stackers said brady what are they elevated extensions of the conveyor belts they can rotate through a certain arc to direct the tar sands to a suitable surge pile they can also feed bins that take the sands underground to start the processes of chemical and physical separation of the bitumen the first of those processes jesus said mackenzie incredulously that about sums it up dermott said i have no wish to be rude mr shore but i dont want to hear about the extraction processes ive already heard and seen all i want to good god almighty exclaimed mackenzie by way of variation brady said whats the matter gentlemen dermott picked his words carefully when don and i were talking to mr shore and mr reynolds the operations manager last night we thought we had reason to be concerned i now realize we were wasting our time on trifles but by god now i am worried last night we had to face the fact of the ridiculous ease with which the perimeter can be penetrated and the almost equal ease with which subversives could be introduced onto the plant floor in retrospect those are but bagatelles how many points did you pick up don six my count also first off the draglines they look as impregnable as the rock of gibraltar they are in fact pathetically vulnerable a hundred tons of high explosive would hardly dent the rock of gibraltar but i could take out a dragline with two fivepound charges of wraparound explosive placed where the boom is hinged to the machine house brinckman an intelligent and clearly competent person in his early thirties spoke for the first time in fifteen minutes then immediately wished he hadnt he said fine if you could approach the dragline but you cant the area is lit by brilliant floodlights jesus mackenzies limited repertoire was in use again what do you mean mr mackenzie what i mean is i would locate the breaker or switch or whatever that supplies the power to the floodlights and immobilize it by smashing it or by the brilliantly innovative device of turning it off or id cut the power lines simpler still with a fivesecond burst from a submachine gun id shoot them out assuming of course that theyre not made of bulletproof glass dermott saved brinckman the embarrassment of a long silence five pounds of commercial amatol would take out the bucket wheel for an indefinite period a similar amount would take care of the reclaimers bridge two pounds to buckle the separator plate thats four ways getting at the radial stackers would be another excellent device that would mean sanmobil couldnt even get the tar sands stockpiled in the surge piles down below for processing and then best of all is this little matter of sixteen unpatrolled miles of conveyor belting there was quiet in the bus until dermott rumbled on why bother sabotaging the separation plant when its so much simpler and more effective to interrupt the flow of raw material you cant very well carry out a processing operation if youve got nothing to process itd be childishly simple four draglines four bucket wheels four reclaimers bridges four separators four radial stackers sixteen miles of conveyor fourteen miles of unpatrolled perimeter and eight men to cover situations ludicrous im afraid mr brady theres no way in the world we can stop our anchorage friend from carrying out his threat brady turned what appeared to be one cold blue eye on the unfortunate brinckman and what do you have to say what can i say except to agree even if i had ten times the number of men at my disposal we still wouldnt be geared to meet a threat like this he shrugged im sorry i didnt even dream of anything like this nor did anyone else nothing to reproach yourself about you security people thought you were in the oil business not at war what are your normal duties anyway were here to prevent three things physical trouble among members of the work force petty pilfering and drinking on the plant site but so far weve had few instances of any of them visibly brinckmans words struck a chord in brady ah yes trouble in moments of stress and all that he turned in his seat stella yes dad she opened a wicker basket produced a flask and glass poured a drink and handed it to her father daiquiri he saidwe also have scotch gin rum sorry mr brady shore said no the company has very strict regulations brady gave him some terse suggestions as to what he could do with company regulations and turned to brinckman again so in effect youve been pretty superfluous up ill now and if anything are going to be even more so in the future id agree with half of that the fact that weve had little to do up to now doesnt mean weve been superfluous presence is important you dont heave a brick through a jewellers window if theres an interested cop standing by five feet away as to the future yes i agree i feel pretty helpless if you were carrying out an attack somewhere what would you go for brinckman was not of two minds the conveyor belting every time brady looked at dermott and mackenzie both men nodded mr shore agreed shore was absentmindedly sipping some scotch that had found its way into his hand apart from the fact that theres so damn much of it its fragile six feet wide but the steel cord belting is only an inch and a half thick with a sledgehammer and chisel i could wreck it myself shore looked and sounded tense not many people are aware of the vast quantities of material that are processed here to keep the plant operating at capacity and to make the project commercially viable we need close on a quarter of a million tons of tar sands a day as i said the biggest mining operation ever cut off the supplies and the plant closes down in a few hours thats a hundred and thirty thousand barrels of oil a day lost even sanmobil couldnt stand this kind of loss indefinitely how much did it cost to set up this plant brady asked two billion near enough two billion dollars and a potential operating loss of a hundred and thirty thousand barrels of oil a day brady shook his head no ones arguing about the brilliance of the men who dreamed up this idea same goes for the engineers who made it work but theres another thing no one would question at least i would never question and that is that those towering intellects had a huge blind spot why didnt the bosses foresee this i know its easy to be wise after the event but goddamn you dont need much foresight to think of that oil is not just another business couldnt they have seen the giant potential for hate or crackpots or blackmail couldnt they have foreseen that theyd built the biggest industrial hostage to fortune of all time shore gazed gloomily at his glass gloomily drank its contents and maintained a gloomy silence dermott said well not quite what do you mean not quite sure its an industrial hostage to fortune but not the biggest of all time that dubious distinction belongs without any question to the transalaska pipeline their capital outlay wasnt two billion it was eight billion they dont transport a hundred and thirty thousand barrels a day they transport one million two hundred thousand and they dont just have sixteen miles of conveyor belting to guard they have eight hundred miles of pipeline brady handed his glass back for a refill digested this unpleasant thought fortified himself and said dont they have any means of protecting the damned thing to the extent that they can limit damage certainly they have magnificent communication and electronic control systems with every imaginable failsafe and backup device even to the extent of a satellite emergency control station dermott produced a paper from his pocket they have twelve pump stations locally or remotely controlled they have sixtytwo remote gate valves all radiocontrolled from the pump station immediately to the north those gate valves can stop the flow of oil in either direction there are eighty check valves to prevent the oil from flowing backward and well all sorts of other weird valves that would only make sense to an engineer altogether they have a remotecontrol capability at well over a thousand points in other words they can isolate any section of the line at any time they want because it takes six minutes to shut down a big pump some oil is bound to escape up to fifty thousand barrels its estimated that may seem a lot but its a drop in the bucket compared to whats in the pipeline but theres no way the oil can keep on pumping out indefinitely all very interesting brady sounded cool you can bet they try harder to protect the environment you can also bet that crooks and extortionists dont give a damn about the environment one way or another all they want is to interrupt the flow of oil can the line be protected well about this huge blind spot you mentioned what youre trying not to tell me is that the pipeline can be breached any place any time thats right brady looked at dermott youve thought about this problem of course and you donald me too well then what have you come up with nothing thats why we sent for you we thought you might come up with something brady looked at him maliciously and resumed his pondering by and by he said what happens if theres a break and the oil is stopped in the pipe does it gum up eventually but it takes time the oil is hot when it comes out of the ground and its still warm when it reaches valdez the pipeline is very heavily insulated and the oil passing through the pipe generates friction heat they reckon they might get it flowing again after a twentyoneday standstill maximum after that he spread hishands no more oil flow no not ever again i shouldnt think so i dont really know nobodys talked to me about it i dont think anyone really wants to talk about it no one did until brady said do you know what i wish i know dermott said you wish you were back in houston the radiophone rang the driver listened briefly then turned to shore operations managers office will we return immediately mr reynolds says its urgent the bus driver picked up speed reynolds was waiting for them he indicated a phone lying on his table and spoke to brady houston for you brady said hello then he made a gesture of irritation and turned to dermott horseshit damn code take it huh this was hardly reasonable of brady since it was he who had invented the code and insisted on using it for almost everything except hello and goodbye dermott reached for a pad and pencil took the phone and started writing it took him about a minute to record the message and two more to decode it he said into the phone is that all you have a pause when did you get this message and when did this happen another pause fifteen minutes and two hours thank you he turned to brady his face bleak the pipelines been breached pump station number four near atigun pass in the brooks range no hard details yet damage not severe it seems but enough to close down the line no chance of an accident explosives they took out two gate valves there was a brief silence while brady surveyed dermott curiously no need to look so goddamned grim george we were expecting something like this its not the end of the world it is for two of the men on pump station four theyve been murdered four it was halfpast two in the afternoon alaskan time almost dark but with good visibility a tenknot wind and a temperature of ºf ºc below when the twinjet touched down again on one of the prudhoe bay airstrips brady dermott and mackenzie had moved quickly after receipt of the message from houston they had driven back to fort mcmurray packed essentials which in bradys case consisted primarily of three flasks said goodbye to jean and stella and driven straight to the airport brady was asleep when they entered yukon air space and mackenzie dozed off shortly afterward only dermott remained awake trying to puzzle out why the enemy in carrying out what they said would be and in fact proved to be no more than a token demonstration should have found it necessary to kill in the process as the jet came to a halt a brightly lit minibus pulled up alongside and slid open a front door brady third out of the aircraft was first into the bus the others followed him in and the door was quickly closed as the bus moved off the man who had ushered them aboard came and sat down beside them aged anywhere between forty and fifty he was a broad chunky man with a broad chunky face he looked tough but he also looked as if he could be humorous although he had nothing to smile about at that moment mr brady mr dermott mr mackenzie he said in the unmistakably flat accent of one who had been born within commuting distance of boston welcome mr finlayson sent me to meet you as you can imagine hes right now practically a prisoner in the master operations control center my names sam bronowski dermott said security chief for my sins he smiled youll be mr dermott the man whos going to take over from me dermott looked at him who the hell said that mr finlayson or words to that effect im afraid mr finlayson must be slightly overwrought bronowski smiled again well now that wouldnt surprise me either hes been talking to london and i think he suffered some damage to his left ear brady said were not out to take over from anyone thats not how we work but unless we get cooperation i mean total cooperation we might as well have stayed home for instance mr dermott here wanted to talk to you right away the chairman of your company himself had guaranteed me complete cooperation yet finlayson refused pointblank to cooperate with dermott and mackenzie id have come at once if id known said bronowski quickly unlike mr finlayson ive been a security man all my life and i know who you are and the reputation you have in a setup like this i can do with all the expert help i can get go easy with him will you this isnt his line of country he treats the pipeline as his favorite daughter this is a new experience for him and he didnt know what to do he wasnt stalling just playing it safe until hed consulted on the highest level you dont need lessons in sticking up for your boss do you im being fair to him i hope you will be too you can imagine how he feels says that if he hadnt been so ornery those two men up at pump station four might be alive now thats plain daft mackenzie said i appreciate his feelings but this would have happened if there had been fifty dermotts and fifty mackenzies here when brady asked are we going out there mr finlayson asked if you and your colleagues would come first to see him and mr black the helicopter is ready to go any moment after that black general manager alaska you been out at the station i was the man who found them rather i was the first man on the scene after the attack along with my section chief tim houston you fly your own plane yes not this time though that section of the brooks range is like the mountains on the moon helicopter weve been making a continuous check on the pump stations and the remote gate valves since this damned threat came through and wed stayed at station five last night we were just approaching four a mile away id reckon when we saw this damned great explosion saw it you know oil smoke and flames you mean did we hear anything you never do in a helicopter you dont have to not when you see the roof take off into the air so we put down and got out me with a rifle tim with two pistols wasting our time the bastards had gone being oilmen yourselves youll know it requires quite a group of men and a complex of buildings to provide the care and maintenance for a couple of thirteenthousandfivehundredhorsepower aircrafttype turbines not to mention all the monitoring and communications they have to handle it was the pump room itself that was on fire not too badly but badly enough for tim and me not to go inside without fire extinguishers wed just started looking when we heard shouting come from a store room it was locked naturally but the key had been left in the lock poulson hes the boss came running out with his men they had the extinguishers located and the fire out in three minutes but it was too late for the two engineers inside theyd come down the previous day from prudhoe bay to do a routine maintenance job on one of the turbines they were dead very bronowskis face registered no emotion they were brothers fine boys friends of mine and tims no possibility of accidental death from the effects of the explosion explosions dont shoot you they were pretty badly charred but charring doesnt hide a bullet wound between the eyes you searched the area certainly conditions werent ideal it was dark with a little snow falling i thought i saw helicopter ski marks on a windblown stretch of rock the others werent so sure on the remote offchance i contacted anchorage and asked them to alert every public and private airport and strip in the state also to have radio and tv stations ask the public to report hearing or sighting a helicopter in an unusual place i havent but one hope in ten thousand that the request will bring any results he grimaced most people never realize how huge this state is its bigger than half of western europe but its got a population of just over three hundred thousand which is to say its virtually uninhabited again helicopters are an accepted fact of life in alaska and people pay no more attention to them than you would to a car in texas third weve still only got about three good hours of light and the idea of carrying out an air search is laughable anyway wed require fifty times the number of planes we have and even then it would be sheer luck to find them but for the record we did find out something unpleasant in case anything should happen to the pump station theres an emergency pipeline that can be switched in to bypass it our friends took care of that also they blew up the control valve so theres going to be a massive oil spillage no chance the line is loaded with thousands of sensors all the way from prudhoe bay to valdez and any section of it can be closed down and isolated immediately even the repairs would normally present no problem but neither metal nor men work too well in these abnormally low temperatures apparently that doesnt apply to saboteurs dermott said how many were there poulson said two two others said three the remainder werent sure not a very observant lot are they i wonder if thats fair mr dermott poulsons a good man and he doesnt miss much did he see their faces no that much is for certain masked no their fur collars were pulled high up and their hats low down so that only their eyes were visible you cant tell the color of a mans eyes in the darkness besides our people had just been dragged from bed but not the two engineers they were working on the engines how come at that very early hour bronowski spoke with restraint because they had been up all night because they were going home to their families in fairbanks for their weeks leave and because i had arranged to pick them up there shortly after that time did poulson or any of his friends recognize the voices if they had id have the owners behind bars by this time their collars were up to their eyes of course their voices would have been muffled you ask a lot of questions mr dermott mr dermott is a trained interrogator brady said cheerfully trained him myself as a matter of fact what happened after that poulson and his men were marched across to the food store and locked in there we keep it locked because of bears unless bears are near starving they arent very partial to human beings but theyre partial indeed to all human goodies thank you mr bronowski one last question did poulson or his men hear the fatal shots no both the men poulson saw were carrying silenced guns thats the great advantage of those modern educational pictures mr dermott there was a pause in the questioning brady said because i am an acute observer of character george i can tell somethings eating you whats on your mind its only a thought im wondering if the murderers are employees of the transalaska pipeline the silence was brief but marked then bronowski said this beats everything i speak as dr watson you understand i know that sherlock holmes could solve a crime without leaving his armchair but i never knew of any cop or security man who could come up with the answer without at least visiting the scene of the crime dermott said mildly im not claiming to have solved anything im just putting forward a possibility brady said what makes you even think that in the first place you pipeline people arent just the biggest employer of labor around here youre the only one where the hell else could the killers have come from what else could they have been lonely trappers or prospectors on the north slope or the brooks range in the depth of winter theyd freeze to death the first day out they wouldnt be prospectors because the tundra is frozen solid and beneath that theres two thousand feet of solid permafrost as for trappers theyd be not only cold and lonely but very hungry indeed because they wouldnt find any form of food north of brooks range until the late spring comes brady grunted what youre saying in effect is that the pipeline is the sole means of lifesupport in those parts its a fact had this happened at pump station seven or eight circumstances would have been quite different those stations are only a hop skip and jump from fairbanks by car but you dont take a car over the brooks range in the heart of winter and you dont backpack over the range at this time of year unless youre bent on quick suicide so the question remains how did they get there and away again helicopter bronowski said remember i said i thought i saw ski marks tim tim houston saw the marks too although he was less sure the others were frankly skeptical but admitted the possibility but ive been flying helicopters for as long as i can remember bronowski shook his head in exasperation gods sake how else could they have got in and out i thought mackenzie said that those pump stations had limitedrange radarscopes they do bronowski shrugged but snow plays funny tricks on radar also they may not have been looking or maybe they had the set switched off not expecting company in such bad weather dermott said they were expecting you surely not for another hour or so wed had deteriorating weather at number five so we left ahead of schedule another thing even if they had picked up an incoming helicopter theyd automatically have assumed it was one of ours and would have had no reason to be suspicious be that as it may said dermott im convinced it was an inside job the killers are pipeline employees the note announcing their intention of causing a slight spillage of oil seemed civil and civilized enough with no hint of violence but violence there has been the saboteurs blundered and so they had to kill blundered mackenzie was a lap behind yes bronowski said the key had been left in the storeroom door dont forget all the engineers locked inside were engineers with the minimum of equipment they could have either turned the key in the lock or slipped a piece of paper cardboard linoleum anything under the bottom of the door pushed the key out to fall on it and hauled the key inside me id have thrown that key a mile away but the killers didnt their intention was to bring the two pumphouse engineers to the storeroom and usher them in to join their friends and lock them in too but they didnt do that either why because one of the saboteurs said or did something that betrayed their identity to the two engineers they were recognized by the engineers who evidently knew them well enough to penetrate their disguises the saboteurs had no option so they killed them brady said hows that for a hypothesis sam bronowski was pondering his reply when the minibus pulled up outside the main entrance to the administrative building brady predictably was the first out and scuttled as far as a nearly spherical human being could be said to scuttle to the welcoming shelter that lay behind the main door the others followed more sedately john finlayson rose as they entered his room he extended his hand to brady and said delighted to meet you sir he nodded curtly toward dermott mackenzie and bronowski then turned to a man seated to his right behind a table mr hamish black general manager alaska mr black didnt look like the general manager of anything far less the manager of a tough and ruthless oil operation the rolled umbrella and bowler hat were missing but even without them his lean bony face immaculately trimmed pencil moustache thinning black hair parted with millimetric precision over the center of his scalp and the eyes behind pincenez made him the epitome of a top city of london accountant which he was that such a man who could hardly tell a nut from a bolt should head up a huge industrial complex was not a new phenomenon the tea boy who had painstakingly fought his way up through the ranks to boardroom level had become a man of no mean importance it was hamish black so adept at punching the keyboard of his pocket calculator who called the industrial tune it was rumored that his income ran into six figures pounds sterling not dollars his employers evidently thought he was worth every penny of it he waited patiently while finlayson made the introductions i would not go as far as mr finlayson and say im delighted to meet you blacks smile was as thin as his face his flat precise controlled voice belonged to the city londons wall street just as surely as did his appearance under other circumstances yes under these i can only say that im glad you mr brady and your colleagues are here i assume mr bronowski has supplied you with details how did you propose we proceed i dont know do we have a glass the expression on finlaysons face could have been interpreted as reluctant disapproval black it seemed didnt believe in using expressions brady produced poured the inevitable daiquiri waved the flask at the others who waved it on and said the fbi have been notified black nodded reluctantly reluctantly theres a legal obligation to notify of any interruption of interstate commerce quite frankly i dont see what they can achieve theyre out at the pump station now they havent arrived here yet theyre waiting for some specialist army ordnance officers to accompany them experts on bombs explosives and the like waste of time among the people who built and run this line there are as good if not better explosives experts than in any army ordnance corps the killers wouldnt have left a trace of explosives at pump station number four if a silence can be said to be cold the ensuing silence was downright chilly finlayson said stonily does that statement mean what i think it means i should imagine it does said brady explain george dermott explained when he had finished finlayson said preposterous why should any of our pipeline employees want to do a thing like that it doesnt make sense its never a pleasant thing to nurture a viper in your bosom brady said agreeably mr black makes sense to me if only because no other immediate explanation occurs what do you think mr brady exactly what i was asking mr bronowski as we touched down yes well bronowski didnt seem any too comfortable i dont like it an inside job is all too damn plausible point is carry this line of thinking a little further and the finger points at tim houston and myself as the two prime suspects bronowski paused tim and i had a helicopter we were in the right place at approximately the right time we know of a dozen ways to sabotage the pipeline its no secret that were both pretty experienced in the use of explosives so taking out station four would have presented no problem for us he paused but whos going to suspect the security chief and his number two me for one said brady he sipped his drink and sighed id have you clapped behind bars right now were it not for your impeccable record lack of apparent motive and the fact that its incredible that you should have acted in such a clumsy fashion not clumsy mr brady the killers were stupid to the point of insanity or badly frightened the job certainly wasnt the work of professional hit men why shoot the two engineers why leave any evidence that murder had been done just knock them unconscious a dozen ways that can be done without leaving a mark then blow them to pieces along with the pump station act of god and no hint of foul play amateurism is a grievesome thing is it not brady turned to finlayson could we have a line to anchorage please thank you give him the number then take the call george dermott did so and within four minutes had hung up his part of the conversation having been limited mainly to monosyllables wouldnt you know dermott said no luck said mackenzie too much the anchorage police have located not one but four hot phone booths suspicious characters either inside them or lurking in the vicinity and this at that most ungodly hour all four of them dammit with a disproportionate number of highdenomination coins inside them all four have been dismantled and taken along to the cop shop but they havent been fingerprinted yet and it may be hours before the cops can check the prints against their files black said with sardonic restraint the relevance of this call escapes me it has something to do with pump station four maybe said brady maybe not all we know for certain is that sanmobil the people who have the tarsands concession north of fort mcmurray in alberta have also received a threat against their oil production lines couched in almost identical terms with the threat you received the only difference being that while yours arrived by mail theirs came from a public phone booth in anchorage were trying to trace which booth and with any fingerprint luck who the caller may have been black thought briefly then said curious a threat against alaskan oil from alberta and one against albertan oil from alaska must tie up with pump station four the arm of coincidence isnt all that long and while youre sitting here mr brady some illintentioned person or persons may be planting an explosive device at some strategic point in sanmobils tar sands the thought had not escaped me however surmise and speculation will serve no point until we turn up one or two hard facts we hope that one may even result from a close inspection of pump station four coming out there mr black good heavens no im very much a deskbound citizen but i shall await your return with interest return im going no place those frozen wastes not for me my excellent representatives know what to look for besides someone has to stay and run the command post how far to the pump station mr bronowski helicopter miles hundred and forty give or take splendid that will leave us ample time for a belated lunch your commissary is still open mr finlayson i trust and your wine cellar tolerable sorry about that mr brady finlayson made no effort to conceal the satisfaction in his voice company regulations forbid alcohol no need to distress yourself brady said urbanely aboard my jet is the finest cellar north of the arctic circle five three generatorfed arc lamps threw the halfdemolished pump house and its shattered contents into harsh relief glaring white and stygian blackness with no intermediate shading between snow drifted silently down through the allbutvanished roof and a high wind blew a fine white cloud through a gaping hole in the northern wall already the combined effects of the two snows had softened and blurred the outlines of the machinery but not sufficiently to conceal the fact that engines motors pumps and switchgear had been either destroyed or severely damaged mercifully the snow had already covered the two mounds that lay side by side before the mangled remains of a switchboard dermott looked slowly around with a face again as bleak as the scene that lay before him damage evenly spread he said so it couldnt have come from one central blast halfadozen charges more likely he turned to poulson the head man a blackbearded man with bitter eyes how many explosions did you hear just the one i think we really cant be sure if there were more after the first one our eardrums were sure in no condition to register them but were agreed that one was all we heard triggered electrically by radio or if they used fulminate of mercury by sympathetic detonation experts obviously he looked at the two shapeless snowcovered mounds but not so expert in other ways why have those two men been left here orders whose orders head office not to be moved until the postmortems have been carried out rubbish you cant do a postmortem on a frozen body dermott stooped began to clear away the snow from the nearest of the mounds then looked up in surprise as a heavy hand clamped on his left shoulder you deaf or something mister poulson didnt sound truculent just annoyed im in charge here you were donald sure mackenzie eased poulsons hand away and said lets go talk to the head office man black and hear what he has to say about obstructing murder investigations that wont be necessary mr mackenzie bronowski said he nodded to poulson johns upset wouldnt you be poulson hesitated briefly turned and left the pump room dermott had most of the snow cleared away when he felt a light touch on his shoulder it was poulson again proffering him of all things a longhandled clothes brush dermott took it smiled his thanks and delicately brushed away the remaining snow the dreadfully charred skull of the dead man was barely recognizable as that of a human being but the cause of the round hole above the eyeless left socket was unmistakable with mackenzies help the corpse was frozen solid he lifted the body and peered at the back of the skull the skin was unbroken bullets lodged in the head dermott said rifling marks on it should be of interest to the police ballistics department i suppose bronowski agreed reluctantly but alaska covers just over half a million square miles im afraid optimism is not my long suit were agreed there they lowered the body to the ground and dermott tried to unzip the shredded green parka but it too was frozen there was a slight crackling of ice as he eased the jacket away from the shirt beneath and peered into the gap between the two layers of clothing he could see some documents including a buffcolored envelope tucked away in the inside right pocket by sliding his hand in flat he tried to extract them with his fore and middle fingers but because he could achieve so little grip and because they seemed frozen not only together but also to the side of the pocket they proved impossible to move dermott straightened to an upright kneeling position looked at the dead man thoughtfully then up at bronowski could we have the two bodies moved to someplace where they can be thawed out a bit i cant examine them in this state nor by the same token can the doctors carry out their postmortems john bronowski looked at poulson who nodded albeit with some reluctance another thing dermott said whats the quickest way of clearing away the snow here from the floor and machinery canvas covers and a couple of hotair blowers no time at all want me to fix it now and the two men please then theres a question or two id like to ask in your living quarters perhaps straight across be with you in a few minutes outside on their way mackenzie said your hounddog instincts have been aroused what gives dead man back there index finger on his right hand is broken that all wouldnt be surprised if half the bones in his body are broken could be but this bone appears to have been broken in a rather peculiar fashion be able to tell better later bronowski and poulson joined them around the table of the comfortable kitchen living quarters poulson said okay fixed snow in the pump room should be gone in fifteen minutes about the two engineers well i wouldnt know considerably longer dermott said thanks now then bronowski mackenzie and myself think it likely that the murderers were employees of the transalaska pipeline what would you think of that poulson glanced enquiringly at bronowski found no inspiration there looked away and pondered it figures he said at last the only living souls for ten thousand square miles around here a hundred thousand as far as i know are employed by the pipeline more than that while any mad bomber could have blown up the pump station it took an oilman to know where to locate and destroy the bypass control valve we also theorize that the engineers what were their names by the way james and james brothers we think that the bombers gave themselves away in one fashion or another that the jameses recognized them and had to be silenced for keeps but you and your men didnt recognize them thats for sure for sure poulson smiled without much humor if what you suppose is correct its just as well for us that we didnt but then its not surprising that we didnt dont forget that up here in number four were no better than hermits living on a desert island the only time we see anybody is when we go on leave every few weeks travelling maintenance engineers like the jameses or come to that mr bronowski here see ten times as many people as we do and so are likely to recognize ten times as many people which makes your idea that it was an inside job all the more likely you and your men are certain there wasnt the remotest peculiarity about them either in speech or dress that struck a chord youre flogging a dead horse dermott i suppose theres a possibility that those saboteurs came by helicopter damned if i can see how else they could have come mr bronowski here thought he saw skid marks i wasnt sure one way or another it was a bad night for being sure of anything dark with a strong wind and drifting snow circumstances like that you can imagine almost anything you didnt hear this helicopter approaching or imagine you heard it we heard nothing dont forget we were all asleep and i thought you mounted a radar watch in a fashion any errant bleep triggers off an alarm but we dont sit with our eyes glued to the screen night and day then because of the extremely heavy insulation its difficult for any sound to penetrate from outside the generator running next door doesnt help much either finally of course the wind was blowing as it still is almost directly from the north and would have carried away the sound of any craft approaching from the opposite direction i know that a helicopter is one of the most rackety bits of machinery in existence but even though we were wide awake then we didnt hear mr bronowskis chopper coming in from the south sorry thats all i can tell you how long will it take to repair the pump room a few days a week im not sure well need new engines switchgear pipelines a mobile crane and a bulldozer all those we already have at prudhole except the engines and i expect a here will fly those in this evening then a chopper or two can fly the stuff out here the repair crews will be on the job in the morning so a week before the oil starts flowing again no no tomorrow with luck the bypass control valve is not a major repair job parts replacement mainly dermott said you might look at all this as just a minor disruption technically yes the ghosts of the james brothers might see it differently want to look at the pump room now most of the stuff should have melted by this time the snow in the pump room had gone and the atmosphere was warm and humid without the protective white covering the scene was more repellent than before the extent of the devastation more clearly and dishearteningly evident and the stench of oil and charring more pungent and penetrating each with a powerful flashlight to lighten the shadows cast by the arc lamps dermott mackenzie and bronowski embarked on a search of every square inch of the floors and walls after ten minutes poulson said curiously what are you looking for ill let you know when i find it dermott said meantime i havent a clue in that case can i join in the search sure dont touch or turn anything over the fbi wouldnt like it ten minutes later dermott straightened and switched off his light thats it then gentlemen if youve found no more than i have among the four of us weve found nothing looks as if fire or blasts have wiped the platter clean lets have a look at the james brothers they should be in a fairly examinable state by now they were dermott moved first to the man hed looked at in the pump room this time the zip on the green parka unfastened easily the blast effect that had shredded the parka had not penetrated it for the plaid shirt beneath bore no signs of damage dermott removed some papers cards and envelopes from the inside right pocket of the jacket leafed through and replaced them he then lifted both charred wrists examined them and the hands in an apparently cursory fashion and lowered them again he repeated the process with the other victim then rose to his feet poulson bent a quizzical eye on him thats the way a detective examines a murdered man i dont suppose it is but then im not a detective he turned to bronowski you all through if you are sam bronowski led the way to the helicopter dermott and mackenzie following through the thinly driving snow that reduced visibility to a few yards it was intensely cold clues mackenzie said into dermotts ear not from any wish for privacy but simply to make himself heard man cant move around without tripping over them none in the pump room thats sure place had been pretty comprehensively quartered before we ever got there almost certainly before the snow had started to cover anything what do you mean the old finetooth comb is what i mean poulson and his men and or who else perhaps there was nothing to find dermott said or rather shouted that dead mans forefinger had been deliberately broken bent in at fortyfive degrees toward the thumb never seen anything like it before freak accident odd is better something else odd too when i searched him first there was a buff envelope in his inner pocket i was unable to get it out but you were when you unzipped it later no it was gone and or at work you think so it seems all very curious mackenzie said jim brady was of the same opinion after reporting the results of their investigation dermott and mackenzie had retired with him to the room hed been allocated for the night brady said why didnt you mention those things to black and finlayson those are hard facts an oddly broken finger a missing envelope hard facts theres only my word for it ive no idea what was in the envelope anyway and although id say the forefinger had been deliberately broken im no osteologist but no harm in mentioning those things surely bronowski and houston were there too you really dont trust anyone do you george bradys tone was admiring not reproachful as you never fail to remind people sir you taught me yourself true true brady said complacently very well then have them up ill do my olympian act while you ply them with questions and strong drink dermott spoke on the phone and within a minute bronowski and houston had knocked entered and taken seats kind gentlemen kind brady was at his most avuncular long day i know and you must be damnably tired but were babes in the wood up here were not only short of necessary information were totally devoid of it and we believe you two gentlemen are those best equipped to supply us with that information but i forget myself gentlemen i suggest a preinquisitional restorative mackenzie said what mr brady means is a drink thats what i said you gentlemen like scotch offduty yes but you know the company regulations sir and how strictly mr finlayson interprets those strict i am ironclad in the interpretation of my own regulations the wave of bradys arm was indeed olympian you are offduty off regular duty anyhow george refreshments mr dermott will ask the questions alternating i do not doubt with mr mackenzie you gentlemen if you will be so kind will fill in the gaps in our knowledge he took his daiquiri from dermott savored it laid down his glass relaxed in his chair and steepled his hands under his chin i shall but listen and evaluate nobody was left with any doubt as to which was the most demanding task of the three health gentlemen bronowski lifted his own glass which he had accepted with no great show of reluctance and confusion to our enemies dermott said thats precisely the point the enemy arent confused we are the taking out of pump station four is only the opening skirmish in what promises to be a bloody battle they the enemy know where theyre going to hit again we have not the vaguest idea but you must have by the very nature of your job you must be more aware of the points most vulnerable to attack than anyone else between prudhoe bay and valdez take off your security hats and put on those of the enemy where would you strike next jesus bronowski fortified himself with some of bradys malt thats more than a sixtyfourdollar question its an eighthundredmile question and every damned mile is virtually a sitting target the boss is right tim houston said if we sit here and drink your whiskey while pretending to help were only abusing your hospitality theres nothing we or anyone else can do to help a combatready division of the u s army would be about as useful as a gaggle of girl scouts the task is impossible and the line indefensible mackenzie said well george at least were operating on a bigger scale than with the tarsands boys in athabasca there they said a battalion wouldnt be big enough to guard their installation now its a division mackenzie turned to bronowski lets switch hats with the enemy where wouldnt you strike next bronowski said well i wouldnt strike at any of the pump stations again on the assumption that until this matter is cleared up they will be heavily guarded id have been sorely tempted to go for pump station ten at the isabel pass in the alaska range or number twelve at the thompson pass in the chugach mountains all pump stations are vital of course but some are more vital than others and those are number ten and number twelve along with number four here he considered briefly or maybe i would go for them i mean maybe youd be so damned certain that i wouldnt hit again in the same place that you wouldnt much bother dermott held up his hand start in on the doubleguessing and were up all night on with the hazards the low priority ones i mean i wouldnt go for the two master operations control centers at prudhoe bay they could be taken out easily enough and sure theyd stall all production from the wells immediately but not for long its no secret that contingency plans for bypassing the centers are already in hand repairs wouldnt take all that long in any event security will be now tightened to the extent that the game wouldnt be worth the candle so we can be pretty certain that there will be no attempt made to sabotage the oil supply before it enters the pipeline same goes for when it leaves the pipe at valdez maximum damage there could be inflicted at the oil movements control center where the pipeline controller can monitor and control the flow of oil all the way from prudhoe to valdez and the terminal controller hes in the same room actually controls practically everything that moves in the terminal itself both of those in turn are dependent on whats called the backbone supervisory system computer knock out any of those three and youre in dead trouble but theyre pretty secure as they are from now theyll be virtually impregnable again not worth it dermott said how about the storage tanks well now if one or two of them were attacked or ruptured it would be impossible to get them all at once the containment dikes would take care of the spillage fire would be another thing but even then the snow would have a blanketing effect we may only have an annual dusting of snow up here but down there they have over three hundred inches anyway the tank farms are the most open and easily guarded complex on the entire pipeline theres no way you can really get at them without bombing the area not very likely one would think what about the tanker terminals again easily guarded i hardly think theyre likely to run to underwater demolition squads even if they did they couldnt do much damage and that would be easily repaired the tankers themselves sink a dozen and theres always a thirteenth no way you can interrupt the oil flow by hitting the tankers the valdez narrows block them dermott nodded and bronowski shook his head the narrows arent as narrow as they look on a smallscale chart three thousand feet thats the minimum channel width between the middle rock and the east shore youd have to sink an awful lot of vessels to block that channel so we cross off the unlikely targets where does that leave us it leaves us with eight hundred miles bronowski shifted the air temperature is the overriding factor houston said no saboteur worth his salt would consider wrecking anything except the pipeline itself this time of the year any attack has to be in the open air why this is only early february remember and to all intents were still in the depth of winter as often as not the temperature is well on the wrong side of thirty below and in these parts thirty below is the crucial figure rupture the pipeline at say thirtyfive below and it stays ruptured repair is virtually impossible men can work although well below their norm but unfortunately the metal they may try to repair or the machine tools they use to make the repairs wont cooperate with them at extreme temperatures profound molecular changes occur in metal and it becomes unworkable given the right or wrong conditions a tap on an iron rod will shatter it like glass brady said you mean all i need is a hammer and a few taps on the pipeline houston was patient not quite what with the heat of the oil inside and the insulation lagging outside the steel of the pipeline is always warm and malleable its the repair tools that would fracture dermott said but surely it would be possible to erect canvas or tarpaulin covers over the fracture and bring the temperature up to workable levels by using hotair blowers you know the way poulson did at station four of course which is why i wouldnt attack the pipeline directly id attack the structures that support the pipeline those that are already frozen solid at air temperature and would require days perhaps weeks to bring up to a working temperature structures indeed the terrain between prudhoe and valdez is desperately uneven and traversed with innumerable watercourses which have to be forded or spanned in one way or another there are over six hundred streams and rivers along the run the sixhundredfiftyfoot freespan suspension bridge over the tazlina river would make a dilly of a target even better would be the twelvehundredfoot span a similar type of construction over the tanana river but one doesnt even have to operate on such a grandiose scale and i personally would prefer not to he looked at bronowski wouldnt you agree completely operate on a much more moderate and undramatic scale but one equally effective id go for the vsms every time dermott said vsms vertical support members roughly half the length of the pipeline is above ground and lies on a horizontal cradle or saddle supported by vertical metal posts that makes for a fair number of targets seventyeight thousand of them to be precise they would be a snap to take out wraparound beehive plastic explosives which would need all of a minute to fix in position take out twenty of those and the line would collapse under its own weight and the weight of the oil inside it take weeks to repair they could still use those hotair canvas shelters a hell of a lot of help that would be bronowski said if they couldnt bring up the cranes and crawler equipment to effect the repairs anyway there are places where at this time of year it just couldnt be done there is for instance one particularly vulnerable stretch that gave the designers headaches the builders sleepless nights and security nightmares this steep and dangerous stretch is between pump station five and the summit of atigun pass which is between four and five thousand feet high houston said four thousand seven hundred and seventyfive feet four thousand seven hundred and seventyfive feet in a run of a hundred miles from the pass the pipe comes down to twelve hundred feet which is quite a drop with a corresponding amount of builtup pressure thats not the problem in the event of a break in the line a special computer linkage between four and five will automatically shut down the pumps in four and close every remote valve between the stations the failsafe procedures are highly sophisticated and they work at the very worst the spillage could be restricted to fifty thousand barrels but the point is in winter the line couldnt be repaired brady coughed apologetically and descended from his olympian heights so a break in this particular section about now could immobilize the line for weeks on end no question then forget it mr brady the burdens i have to bear alone brady sighed let me have men about me who can think i begin to understand why i am what i am i find it extraordinary that the construction company never carried out any tests to discover what happens to the viscosity of oil in low temperatures why didnt they seal off a couple of hundred feet of experimental pipe with oil inside it and see how long it would take before it gummed up to the extent that it would cease to flow never occurred to them i suppose bronowski said an eventuality that would never arise it has arisen an estimate of three weeks has been bandied about based on scientific calculations one assumes bronowski said i wouldnt know not my field maybe mr black or mr finlayson would know mr black knows nothing about oil and i doubt whether mr finlayson or any other professional oilman on the line has anything but the vaguest idea could be ten days could be thirty you take my point george yes blackmail threats extortion some positive and very material advantages to be gained interruption is one thing cessation another they require a lever a bargaining counter close down the line completely and the oil companies would laugh at their threats for then they would have nothing to lose the bargaining arm would have gone the kidnapper cant very well hold a kidnappee for ransom if its known that the kidnappee is dead i question if i could have put it better myself brady said he had about him an air of magnanimous selfsatisfaction we are clearly not dealing with clowns our friends would have taken such imponderables into account and would err on the side of caution you are with me mr bronowski i am now but when i was talking about hazards i wasnt taking that side of it into account i know you werent nobody was well i think that will do gentlemen we appear to have established two things it is unlikely that any attack will be carried out on any major installation that is prudhoe valdez or the intervening twelve major pump stations it is further unlikely that any attack will be carried out in regions so inaccessible that repairs may be impossible for weeks on end so were left with the likelihood that any further sabotage will take the form of attacks on accessible stretches of vsms or the taking out of minor bridges the possibility of destroying the tazlina or tanana bridges is remote as those could well take weeks to repair we may not have come up with too much but at least we have clarified matters and established some sort of system of priorities not without difficulty brady heaved himself to his feet to indicate that the interview was over thank you gentlemen both for your time and information ill see you in the morning at of course a reasonably christian hour the door closed behind bronowski and houston brady asked well what did you make of that dermott said as you said just a limitation of possibilities which unfortunately still remain practically limitless three things id like to do first id like the fbi or whoever to carry out a rigorous investigation into the pasts of poulson and his pals at pump station four you have reason to suspect them not really but ive an odd feeling something is wrong at number four don shares my feeling but theres nothing we can put a finger on except that buff envelope that was missing from the dead engineers pocket even with that im beginning to question whether my eyes or imagination were playing tricks on me the lighting was damned harsh and i could have got my colors wrong no matter as youd be the first to agree every pipeline employee is a suspect until his innocence is established you bet you said poulson and bronowski seemed on pretty cordial terms bronowski is the sort of character who seems on pretty cordial terms with everyone if youre suggesting what i think you are i might mention that according to finlayson there have been three security checks carried out on bronowski and passed with flying colors no doubt what does finlayson know about security checks and how to evaluate them has he any guarantee that none of those three professedly unbiased investigators was not in fact a bosom friend of bronowski now have a very good and very discreet friend in new york as you say yourself every pipeline operator is as guilty as hell until proved otherwise i didnt quite say that hairsplitting the second thing id like a medical opinion preferably that of a doctor with some osteopathetic knowledge on how the dead engineers finger came to be broken how can that help how should i know dermott sounded almost irritable god knows jim youve emphasized often enough never to overlook anything that seems odd true true brady said pacifically there was a third matter lets find out how the fingerprint boys in anchorage are getting on with that telephonebooth affair three tiny things i know but its all we have to go on four theres also bronowski and now the telephone rang brady picked it up listened briefly scowled and handed the phone over to dermott for you dermott lifted an eyebrow its that damnable code again dermott gave him a familiar look put the phone to his ear reached for a pad and started to take notes after barely a minute he hung up and said and now that was your last question wasnt it what yes so and now its back to the old jet and heighho for canada dermott gave brady an encouraging smile should be all right sir still plenty of daiquiris in your airborne bar what the devil is that meant to mean just this sir dermotts smile had gone you will recall our three brilliant minds sitting around in sanmobils office and coming to the unanimous conclusion that there were six points vulnerable to attack the draglines the bucket wheels the reclaimers bridges the separator plates the radial stackers and above all the conveyor belting some joker up there obviously didnt see it our way at all hes taken out the main processing plant six four hours later the brady enterprises team stood shivering in sanmobils sabotaged processing plant at athabasca brady himself was enveloped in his usual cocoon of coats and scarves his temper not improved by the fact that the flight from alaska had deprived him of dinner how did it happen he repeated here we have an easily patrolled area brilliantly lit as you pointed out yourself and staffed with one hundred per cent i beg your pardon ninetyeight per centloyal and patriotic canadians he peered through a large hole that had been blown in a cylindrical container how can such things be i dont think thats quite fair mr brady bill reynolds the fairhaired and ruddyfaced operations manager spoke up for his colleague terry brinckman the security chief at whom bradys remarks had been directed terry had only eight men on duty last night and that was his second shift of the day in other words he himself had been continuously on duty for fifteen hours when this incident occurred you can see how hard he was trying brady did not nod in assent reynolds went on you remember we had all agreed on the priorities the areas most liable to attack those were the places that terry and his men were doing their best to protect which didnt leave any men for patrolling the plant itself you will recall mr brady that you were in complete agreement you also said terry had nothing to reproach himself with if were going to apportion blame lets not forget ourselves nobodys blaming anybody mr reynolds how extensive is the damage enough terry and i figure that these guys let off three charges here thats the gasoil hydrotreater and the same number next door at the naptha hydrotreater in fact weve been extremely lucky we could have had gas explosions and fuel fires we had none as it is damage is comparatively slight we should be on stream again in fortyeight hours meantime everything is shut down not the draglines but the rest is the radial stackers are full one of the plant operatives you think brinckman said im afraid were sure its a big plant but it takes surprisingly few people to operate it and everybody on a shift knows everybody else a stranger would have been spotted at once besides we know it was an inside job six thirtyounce explosive charges were taken from the blasting shed last night blasting shed reynolds said we use explosives to break up large chunks of tar sand that have become too tightly bound together but weve only got small charges big enough it would seem the blasting shed is normally kept locked doublelocked somebody forced the door nobody forced anything thats why brinckman told you were sure it was an inside job somebody used keys who normally holds the keys dermott asked reynolds said there are three sets i hold one brinckman has two why two one i keep permanently brinckman explained the other goes to the security supervisor for the night shift who passes it on to the person in charge of the morning and afternoon shifts who are those other security shift supervisors brinckman said my number two jorgensen this is his shift really and napier i dont think that any of the three of us is much given to stealing explosives mr dermott not unless youre certifiable now it seems unlikely anyone would risk abstracting keys and having copies made not only would they be too likely to be missed but theres also more than a fair chance that we could trace the key cutter and so the thief there could be illegal key cutters i still doubt the keys would have been taken much more likely someone took an impression that would need seconds only and thats where the illegal side would come in no straight key cutter would touch an impression how easy would it be for anyone to get hold of the keys even briefly brinckman said about jorgensens and napiers i wouldnt know i clip mine to my belt mackenzie said everybodys got to sleep so you take your belt off then dont you sure brinckman shrugged and if youre going to ask me next if im a heavy sleeper well yes i am and if youre going to ask me if it would have been possible for anyone to sneak into my room while i was asleep borrow my key for a couple of minutes and return it unseen well yes that would have been perfectly possible too this brady said is not going to take us very far stickyfingered characters with an affinity for keys are legion would there have been any security man in this area tonight jorgensen would know brinckman said shall i get him wont he be out patrolling sixteen miles of conveyor belting or something hes in the canteen but surely hes in charge on duty in charge of what mr brady there are four men keeping an eye on the four draglines the rest of the plant is closed down we think it unlikely that this bomber will strike again tonight not much is unlikely bring him along to my office reynolds said brinckman left i think youll find it warmer and more comfortable there mr brady they followed reynolds to the office block through an external room where a brighteyed and pretty young woman at the desk gave them a charming smile and on into reynolds office where brady began divesting himself of several outer layers of clothing even before reynolds had the door closed reynolds took his chair behind the desk while brady sank wearily into the only armchair in the room reynolds said sorry to drag you all over the northwest like this no sleep no food jet lags all very upsetting in the circumstances i feel entitled to bend company regulations come to think of it im the only person in sanmobile who can a refreshment would be in order ha brady pondered early in the morning not only no dinner but no breakfast either a hopeful look crept into his eye daiquiri but i thought you always we had an unfortunate experience over the yukon dermott said we ran out brady scowled reynolds smiled no daiquiris here but a really excellent twelveyearold malt a few seconds later brady lowered his halftumbler and nodded appreciatively a close second now you two this to dermott and mackenzie ive done all the work so far yes sir not even the shadow of a smile touched mackenzies face three questions if i may who suggested checking up on the amount of explosives in the blasting shed nobody terry brinckman did it right off the bat we have a meticulous checking system and an easy one the tally sheets kept up to date twice a day we just count the numbers of each particular type of explosive subtract that number from the latest entry on the tally sheet and thats the number thats been issued that day or stolen as the case may be well thats certainly a mark in favor of your security chief you have reservations about him good heavens no why on earth should i number two where do you hang up your keys at night i dont he nodded toward a massive safe in a corner kept there day and night ah in that case ill have to rephrase what was going to be my third question you are the only person with a key to that safe theres one more key corinne has it ah that lovely lassie in the outer office that as you say lovely lassie in the outer office is my secretary and why does she have a key various reasons all big companies as you must know have their codes were no exception code books are kept there corinnes my coding expert also i cant be here all the time undermanagers accountants our legal people and the security chief all have access to the safe i can assure you the safe contains items of vastly more importance than the keys to the blasting shed nothing has ever been missing yet people just walk in help themselves and walk out reynolds lifted his eyebrows and looked hard at mackenzie not quite we are security conscious to a degree they have to sign in show corinne what theyve taken and sign out again a couple of keys in a trouser pocket of course she doesnt search them there has to be a certain amount of trust at executive levels yes could we have her in do you think reynolds spoke into the box on his desk corinne entered looking good standing up in her khaki cord levis and nicely distorted plaid shirt a person with a smile for everyone reynolds said you know who those gentlemen are corinne yes sir i think everybody does i think mr mackenzie here would like to ask you some questions sir how long have you been with mr reynolds just over two years before that i came straight from secretarial school you have a pretty sensitive and responsible position here she smiled again but this time a little uncertainly as if unsure where the questions were leading mr reynolds lists me as his confidential secretary may i ask how old you are twentytwo you must be the youngest confidential secretary of any big corporation ive ever come across this time she caught her lip and glanced at reynolds who was leaning back in his chair hands clasped lazily behind his neck with the air of a man who was almost enjoying himself he smiled and said mr mackenzie is an industrial sabotage investigator he has a job to do and asking questions is part of that job i know hes just made a statement not asked a question but its one of those statements that expects comment she turned back to mackenzie with a swing of her long chestnut hair i suppose ive been pretty lucky at that she spoke with marked coolness and mackenzie felt it none of my questions are directed against you corinne okay now you must know the executivelevel people pretty well i can hardly help it they all come through me to get to mr reynolds including those who have business with that safe there of course i know them all well all good friends i take it well she smiled but the smile had an edge to it lots of them are much too senior to be my friends but on good terms shall we say oh yes she smiled again i dont think ive made any enemies perish the thought this came from george dermott who took over the questioning on a brisker note any of the people using the safe ever give you trouble like trying to take away what they shouldnt not often and then its only absentmindedness or because they havent studied the classified list and surely mr dermott if anyone wanted to get something past me theyd hide it in their clothing dermott nodded thats true miss delorme the girl was inspecting his roughandready good looks with a spark of humor in her eye as if amused by his blunt approach he caught the expression and in his turn watched her for a reflective moment what do you think now he asked her do you think anyone might have smuggled something past you out of the safe she looked him in the eye they might she said but i doubt it could i have a list of the people who used the safe in the past four or five days certainly she left and returned with a sheet which dermott studied briefly good lord the safe appears to be the mecca for half of sanmobil twenty entries at least in the last four days he looked up at the girl this is a carbon may i keep it of course thank you corinne delorme smiled at the room in general but the blue eyes came back to dermott before she went out charming indeed said brady plenty of spunk mackenzie said ruefully she built a whole generation gap between you and me george he frowned what gave you the idea her name was delorme there was a plaque on her desk corinne delorme it said dermott shook his head hawkeye mackenzie he said the other men laughed some of the tension that had grown in the room during the questioning of the girl fell away again well anything more i can do for you reynolds asked dermott said yes please could we have a list of the names of your security staff reynolds bent over the intercom and spoke to corinne he had just finished when brinckman arrived accompanied by a tall redhaired man whom he introduced as carl jorgensen dermott said you were in charge of the night security shift i understand were you around the sabotaged area at all tonight several times so often i thought you would have been concentrating on what we regarded mistakenly as the more vulnerable areas i went around them a couple of times but by jeep only but i had this funny feeling that we might have been guarding the wrong places dont ask me why your funny feeling didnt turn out to be so funny after all anything offbeat anything to arouse suspicion nothing i know everybody on the night shift and i know where they work nobody there that shouldnt have been there nobody in any place that he hadnt any right to be youve got a key to the blasting shed where do you keep it terry brinckman mentioned this i have it only during my tour of duty and then i hand it over i always carry it in the same buttondown pocket on my shirt could anybody get at it nobody except a professional pickpocket and even then id know the two security men left and corinne came in with a sheet of paper reynolds said that was quick not really they were typed out ages ago brady said to the girl you must come and meet my daughter stella im sure youd get on both the same age stella is very like you actually thank you mr brady i think id like that ill have her call you when she had gone dermott said what do you mean like your daughter ive never seen anyone less like stella dancing eyes my boy dancing eyes one must learn to probe beneath the surface brady heaved himself to his feet the years creep on breakfast and bed im through detecting for the day its tougher than capping fires dermott drove the rented car back to the hotel mackenzie sitting beside him brady took his ease across the entire width of the back seat he said im afraid i wasnt quite leveling with reynolds there breakfast yes but itll be some hours before i we retire i have come up with a plan he paused dermott said courteously were listening i think ill do some listening first why do you think i employ you thats a fair question mackenzie said why to investigate to detect to think to plot to scheme to plan all at once mackenzie said brady ignored him i dont want to come up with a proposal and then if it goes wrong have to spend the rest of my days listening to your carping reproaches id like you two to come up with an idea and then if its a lemon we can all share the blame incidentally donald i take it you have your bugbox with you the electronic eavesdropping locatordetector thats what i said yes splendid now george lets have your reading of the situation my reading of the situation is that for all the good were doing we havent a hope in hell of stopping the bad guys from doing exactly what they want and when they want there is no way to forestall attacks on sanmobil or the alaska pipeline theyre calling the shots and were the sitting ducks if youll pardon the mixing of the metaphors they call the tune and we dance to it theyre active were passive theyre offensive were defensive if we have any tactics id say its time we changed them go on his leader urged him from behind if thats meant to sound encouraging dermott said i dont know why but hows this for a positive thought instead of letting them keep us offbalance why dont we keep them offbalance instead of their harassing us let us harass them go on go on the back seat exhorted lets attack them and put them on the defensive let them start worrying instead of us he paused i see things as through a glass darkly but i say plant a light at the end of the tunnel what well do is well provoke them provoke a reaction provoke the hell out of them well hang it on this one factor our own pasts our backgrounds can be probed until the cows come home and nothing will be turned up but you can say that about how many people in a hundred dermott twisted his head briefly to locate a peculiar noise from the back of the car brady was actually rubbing his hands together well donald whats your reading of it simple enough when you see it mackenzie said all you have to do is to antagonize anywhere between sixty and eighty people to hell and back again investigate them as openly as possible deploy maximum indiscretion brady beamed what sixty to eighty people do we investigate in alaska all the security agents here the security agents again plus everybody whos had access to reynolds safe in the past few days going to include reynolds himself good heavens no mackenzie said inconsequentially she is a lovely girl brady looked aloof mackenzie asked him do you really expect to find your panjandrum among that lot panjandrum the prime mover mr big messrs big not for a moment but if theres a rotten apple in the barrel he may well find him for us mackenzie said right so we get all their names and past histories later on sooner rather than later well have the lot fingerprinted sure theyre going to stand on their civic rights and yell blue murder and that will please you no end refusal to cooperate will point the finger of suspicion at the refusee if thats the word i want then you feed the information to your investigators in houston washington and new york cost no object urgency desperate not that youll care a damn whether the investigators come up with anything or not all that matters is that the suspects get to hear such inquiries are under way thats all the provocation theyll need what kind of reactions do we expect to provoke dermott asked unpleasant ones i should hope for the villains i mean the first thing id do dermott told brady is send your family back to houston jean and stella could really become a liability the scheme might rebound on you cant you see the word coming through lay off brady or something unpleasants going to happen to your family these people are playing for high stakes theyve killed once they wont hesitate to kill again they cant be hung twice same thought occurred to me mackenzie turned to face the back seat either get the girls right back home or have the rcmp protect them hell i need them brady sat forward with indignation number one i have to be looked after number two stellas handling the ekofisk business for me ekofisk dermott almost turned backward whats that big fire in the north sea norwegian half started after youd come north we have a team going in there today well okay dermott gave way a little so you have to keep in touch but why not work through the locals that brunette of reynolds corinne she could field calls for you what happens when we go back to alaska use somebody up there finlaysons got a secretary must have no substitute for the personal touch said brady magisterially he sank in the seat as though the argument were over his two heavyweights turned forward again with an exchange of looks having been through all this a hundred times before they knew that further pressure would be useless for the moment wherever he went brady maintained the fiction that his wife and daughter were part of his essential lifesupport system and he kept them with him regardless of the expense or danger seven not that dermott and mackenzie in the least minded having jean and stella around like mother like daughter whereas jean was a strikingly handsome woman in her middleforties with that lovely naturally blond hair and intelligent gray eyes stella looked the spittin image of her mother only younger and even livelier with as her father was so fond of claiming dancing eyes the men found jean awaiting their return in the lounge bar of the peter pond hotel tall and elegant she advanced to meet them with her usual expression of tolerant kindly amusement this look dermott knew from experience reflected her genuine feelings an equable temperament was no small advantage for someone who had to spend her life humoring jim brady hi honey he reached up slightly to kiss her on the forehead wheres stella in your room shes got some messages for you been pretty busy on the phone excuse me then gentlemen maybe one of you would be so kind as to buy my wife a drink he waddled off along the corridor while dermott and mackenzie settled comfortably into the warmth of the bar in marked contrast to her husband jean scarcely drank alcohol at all and she sipped carefully at a pineapple juice while the two men addressed themselves to the scotch nor did she try to talk shop in bradys absence instead she chatted pleasantly about fort mcmurray and its modest midwinter pleasures until her husband returned when he came back stella was with him swinging along with her easy loosehipped walk dermott not normally given to flights of fancy was suddenly struck by the absurd disparity between the two figures jesus he thought to himself a hippo and a gazelle what a pair scarcely had brady subsided into an armchair with an outsize glass of daiquiri in his pudgy hand than he made a slight sign to dermott and mackenzie who muttered something and slipped off brady seemed in buoyant form and began to regale his family with an edited account of his movements around the far north after a while jean said doubtfully it doesnt seem to me youve accomplished very much brady was unruffled ninety per cent of our business is cerebral my dear when we move into action what happens is merely the almost mechanical and inevitable culmination of all the invisible hard work thats gone on before he tapped his head the wise general doesnt fling his troops into battle without reconnoitering beforehand weve been reconnoitering jean smiled let us know when youve identified the enemy suddenly she became serious its a nasty business isnt it murder always is my dear i dont like it jim i dont like you being in it surely this is for the law youve never come across murder before in your business so i run away she looked at his ample frame and laughed thats one thing youre not built for run stella said mockscornfully dad couldnt jog from here to the john please brady beamed i trust no such haste will be necessary where did donald go jean asked upstairs doing a little job for me mackenzie was at that moment moving slowly around bradys apartment with a calibrated metal box in one hand a portable antenna in the other and a pair of earphones on his head he moved purposefully a man who knew what he was about he soon found what he was looking for when he came back to the bar he headed straight for bradys family encampment two he reported two what uncle donald stella asked sweetly mackenzie appealed to his boss when are you going to start training this incorrigibly nosy daughter of yours ive stopped failed mothers job anyway he jerked his head upward got them all did you guess so dermott also reappeared to report ah george brady greeted him how did it go reynolds seems very cooperative unfortunately all records are stored at the head office in edmonton he says by the time theyve been dug out and flown up here it may be late this evening or even tomorrow morning what records stella asked affairs of state brady told her well cant be helped anything else naturally enough hes got no fingerprinting equipment fix it after lunch he says hell fix it himself the police chiefs a pal of his apparently thinks the chief might be a bit stuffy about the delay in reporting the crime he grinned across at stella and dont ask what crime no sir mr dermott sir she wrinkled her upper lip in a fetching manner i never ask questions if im just permitted to fetch and carry mend and clean brady went on reynolds can always claim that at first he thought it was an industrial accident i understand the chief of police has twentytwenty vision and intelligence to match well reynolds will have to handle it as best he can what about prudhoe bay an hours hold theyll page me fair enough brady shifted his attention to stella we met an enchanting girl this morning didnt we george knock spots off you any day wouldnt she gentlemen unquestionably said mackenzie stella looked at dermott foul arent they dead heat said dermott but shes very nice the managers secretary brady said corinne delorme i thought maybe youd like to meet her she said shed like to meet you she must know all the nightclubs discos and other iniquitous dens in fort mcmurray stella said news for you dad youve got to be talking about another town i dont know what this place is like in summer but whatever it is its a dead city in midwinter you might have warned us that this is an arctic town lovely choice of phrase wonderful sense of geography thats education for you brady said to no one in particular maybe you should have stayed in houston stella looked at her mother did you hear what i just heard mom she asked with a scornful shake of the head at her father which brought the pale blond hair swinging around her face jean smiled i heard sooner or later my dear you have to face up to the fact that your father is no more and no less than a fearful old hypocrite but he dragged us up here kicking and screaming against our wills and now remarkably words failed her as much as it was possible for so rubicund a face to register an expression bradys was registering unhappiness well now youve found out you dont like it maybe youd rather get back down to houston a note of wistfulness crept into his voice itll be nearly seventydegrees back there now silence descended brady looked at dermott and dermott looked at him jean brady looked at both of them something goes on that i dont understand she said brady dropped his eyes so she switched her attention to dermott george yes maam george he looked at her and dont call me maam no jean he sighed and spoke with some feeling the boss of brady enterprises is not only a fearful old hypocrite hes a fearful old coward as well what he wants in the good oldfashioned western phrase is that you should get out of town why what on earth have we done dermott looked hopefully at mackenzie who said youve done nothing he has or is about to mackenzie shook his head at dermott this is difficult he said dermott explained weve decided on a course of action to flush the ungodly into the open make them show their hand don and i have this unpleasant feeling that their reaction may be directed against brady enterprises in general and its boss in particular the reaction may be violent these people dont play by any rules but their own we dont think theyd go for jim himself its well known that he cant be intimidated but whats equally well known is what he thinks of his own family if they got you or stella or both of you they might figure they could force him to pull out jean reached out to take stellas hand but this must be nonsense she said drama things like that dont happen anymore don i appeal to you she looked anxiously at her daughter gave her hand a little shake and released it mackenzie was dogged dont appeal to me jean when they snip off your finger with the wedding ring on it will you still be saying things like that dont happen anymore she looked hurt sorry if i sound brutal but things like that have never stopped happening it may not come to anything so bad im looking on the blackest possible side but thats the only sensible way to look weve got to find a safe place for you and stella how can jim operate at his best if youre on his mind hes right muttered brady go pack your bags please during mackenzies speech stella had sat with her hands clasped together on her lap like a schoolgirl listening gravely now she said i cant do that dad why not whos going to make your daiquiris for you her mother cut in sharply theres a little more to this than the damned daiquiris if we left whos going to be number one target dad said stella flatly she glowered at dermott you know that george i do he answered mildly but donald and i are pretty good at looking after people that would be just fine wouldnt it she threw herself back in her chair hazel eyes blazing all three of you shot or blown up or something getting upset isnt going to help said jean soothingly logic will though she transferred her attention to brady if we went youd still be worried stiff about us and wed be worried stiff about you so where would that get us brady said nothing and she went on but theres only one point that really matters not only will i not run away from my husband ill be damned if jean brady will run period stella said and ill be damned if stella brady runs either whos gonna maintain communications for one thing you know how long i spent on the phone today to england and all that four hours she stood up decisively another drink dad she cocked an ear at him ostentatiously im sorry i didnt hear that monstrous regiment of women was what i said ah she smiled collected the empty glasses and headed for the bar brady glared at dermott and mackenzie hell of a lot of good you two are why didnt you back me up he sighed heavily and changed his tack why dont we all get something to eat lunch and after that ill catch up on some sleep what are you girls proposing to do this afternoon stella came back with full glasses were going for a sleigh ride wont that be nice good god you mean outside brady gloomily surveyed the few flakes drifting past the window very nice for some im sure but not for the sane he struggled to his feet the dining room in two minutes then george if you will he took dermott aside with a giant caribou tbone steak a quarter of blueberry pie and some excellent california burgundy inside him brady watched his befurred wife and daughter go out through the main entrance and sighed with satisfaction at the feeling of physical wellbeing that enveloped him well gentlemen i really believe i might manage a brief snooze after all yourselves too dermott said off and on donald and i thought wed chivvy up prudhoe bay and sanmobil and get those names and records through as soon as possible well thank you gentlemen very considerate do not wake me up unless armageddon is nigh aha here not unexpectedly return the ladies he waited until his wife had reached the table something up then something is up jean did not sound pleased there are two men on the driving bench of that sleigh why two my dear im not the arbiter of local customs are you afraid theyre homosexual she lowered her voice theyre both carrying guns you cant see them but you can if you know what i mean brady said members of the royal canadian mounted police are entitled to bear arms at all times says so in their constitution jean stared at him snorted with resignation turned and left jim brady beamed in satisfaction mackenzie said airily they tell me there are some very handsome young constables in the rcmp apart from chatting with ferguson bradys pilot dermott spent the afternoon alone in the lounge consuming one cup of coffee after the other about midafternoon jean and stella returned rosycheeked and in high spirits stella it appeared had learned from their escorts of a place where the younger people congregated of an evening and had called corinne delorme at work to invite her out whether they intended to invite their erstwhile escorts along stella did not say nor did dermott inquire brady would have the place comprehensively checked out before he would let them near it shortly afterward dermott received a call from alaska it was bronowski in prudhoe bay john finlayson he said was out at pump station four but was expected back soon he bronowski would immediately set about obtaining what dermott wanted and would arrange for the services of a fingerprint expert from anchorage at five oclock reynolds came through to say that the fingerprinting was well in hand the records dermott required were even then being delivered to edmonton airport and would be delivered straight from mcmurray airport to the hotel at sixthirty mackenzie appeared looking refreshed but at the same time reproachful you should have called me id meant to come down a couple of hours ago ill sleep tonight dermott said thats four hours you owe me three and a half i put a call through to houston explained what we had in mind told them to alert washington and new york and emphasized the urgency i trust your unofficial listener got it all down he could hardly fail to mackenzie said there was a bug installed inside the base plate of the telephone well that should be the final stirringup of the hornets nest lets hope the wrong people dont get stung hows jim peered around his door on the way down looked like hed died in his sleep at seven oclock a call came through from sanmobil dermott indicated to mackenzie that he should listen in on the extension earphone slotted onto the back of the receiver mr reynolds not more bad news i hope for me it is ive been told to shut down the plant for a week when now well a few minutes ago and im to be contacted in fortyeight hours to see if ive complied was the message from anchorage where else phone no telex they sent an open message no code our own company code dermott looked at mackenzie pretty sure of themselves arent they reynolds said what was that talking to donald mackenzie hes listening in so they know that we know its an inside job they must be pretty sure of themselves whos got access to the code books anybody whos got access to my safe how many people does that make twenty give or take what do you intend to do consult edmonton with their approval i intend to be on stream again inside fortyeight hours i wish you luck dermott replaced the receiver and looked at mackenzie now what do you think armageddon is nigh enough to justify waking up the boss not yet nothing he we or anybody can do infuriating lets try anchorage want to bet theyve had a similar threat to close down the pipeline he lifted the phone asked for the number listened briefly then hung up hold they say one hour two hours theyre not sure the telephone rang dermott picked it up anchorage no it cant be ive just been told ah i see he looked at mackenzie police mackenzie picked up the extension receiver they both listened in silence dermott said thank you thank you very much and both hung up mackenzie said well they seem pretty confident theyre certain perfect copies of the prints from the anchorage phone booths but they cant match them up with any of their lists it all helps mackenzie said gloomily its not all that bad the photostat is promised for tomorrow might just match up with some of the prints we hope to collect the alaskan ones i mean it would be too easy to check up on anyone here who made a brief stopover in anchorage stella came into the lounge all set for dancing in black sequinned silk and colored tights and carrying her coat dermott said and where do you think youre going stella said im going out with corinne first a snack and then the bright lights and the light fantastic youll confine your dancing activities strictly to this hotel youre not going any place when she had got through a diatribe calling him a stuffed shirt and a spoilsport she added mr reynolds said its all right when did he say this we phoned about an hour ago its not up to mr reynolds to give you permission but he knows corinne is coming with me she lives near here you dont think hed let his secretary walk into danger do you she wouldnt be walking into danger nobody would be interested in her but in you yes stella said you sound as if youre convinced something is going to happen to me thats the way to make sure that nothing will happen to you by taking precautions see what your father says anyway but how would he know whats safe and what isnt how would he check up hed go to the top the chief of police im certain stella smiled brilliantly and said but weve talked already to him over the phone he was with mr reynolds he says its perfectly okay she smiled again impishly besides we wont lack protection your friends of this afternoon john carmody and bill jones well i suppose that does make a difference ah here comes corinne he beckoned her across made the introductions and watched as they moved off well i suppose we worry too much he glanced at the doorway when i look at that lot coming in i hardly think we need worry at all that lot were a pretty formidable looking pair big men in their late twenties or early thirties who looked eminently capable of taking care not only of themselves but of anyone who might be along with them dermott and mackenzie rose and crossed to meet them dermott said i could be wrong but you wouldnt be two policemen disguised as civilians there we go said the fairhaired man cant be very good at undercover work if its as obvious as that im john carmody this is bill jones you must be mr dermott and mr mackenzie miss brady described you to us mackenzie asked you gentlemen on overtime tonight carmody grinned tonight two gallant volunteers labor of love doesnt look like being any great hardship watch them beautiful she may be but stellas a conniving young minx one other thing you know we have a feeling some bad actors might try to hurt her or take her out of circulation just a suspicion but you never know i think we might be able to take care of that im sure you can most kind of you gentlemen very much appreciated i can tell you i know mr brady would like to thank you himself but as hes in the land of dreams ill do it on his behalf the girls are through there i hope you have a pleasant evening dermott and mackenzie returned to their table where they talked in desultory fashion then the phone rang again this time it was alaska prudhoe bay tim houston here bad news im afraid sam bronowski is in the hospital i found him lying unconscious on the floor of finlaysons office appears to have been struck over the head with a heavy object he was hit over the temple where the skull is thinnest doctor says there may be a fracture hes just finishing some x rays hes certainly concussed when did this happen half hour ago no more but thats not all john finlayson is missing he vanished soon after coming back from pump station pour searched everywhere no trace of him not in any of the buildings if hes outside on a night like this well there was a grim pause he wont be around for long weve got a high wind and heavy drifting and the temperatures between thirty and forty below every man in the place is out looking for him maybe he was attacked by the same person who attacked bronowski maybe he wandered out dazed maybe he was forcibly removed although i dont see how that could be possible with so many people around are you coming up are the fbi and the state police there yes but theres been another development a message from edmonton yes telling you to close down the line how did you know they made similar demands weve got one here ill talk to mr brady if you dont hear youll know were on our way he replaced the receiver and said to mackenzie armageddon enough to wake jim more than enough eight ferguson the pilot was unhappy and with good reason throughout the flight he was in more or less continuous touch with the operations center in prudhoe bay and knew that the weather ahead was dangerous the wind was gusting at miles per hour flying snow had cut ground visibility to a few feet and the thickness of the drifting surface snow storm was estimated at sixty feet or even more less than ideal circumstances for landing a fast jet in darkness ferguson had every modern navigational and landing aid but although he could make a handsoff touchdown if he had to he preferred to see terra firma before he put his wheels down on it one factor in fergusons favor was that he was a profound pessimist his three passengers well knew that he was not given to endangering his own life let alone those of other people on board and would have turned back had the risks been too great brady who had been wakened from a deep sleep and was in a sour mood spoke scarcely a word on the way north mackenzie and dermott aware that the flight might be their last opportunity for some time spent most of the trip asleep the landing with much advancing and retarding of the throttles was a heavy bouncing one but nonetheless safely accomplished visibility was down to twenty feet and ferguson crept cautiously forward until he picked up the lights of a vehicle when the cabin door was opened freezing snow whirled in and brady lost no time in making his customary elephantine dash for the shelter of the waiting minibus at the wheel was tim houston lieutenant to the invalided bronowski evening mr brady houston wore no welcoming smile filthy night i wont ask if you had a good flight because im sure you didnt afraid you havent had too much sleep since you came to the northwest im exhausted brady didnt mention that hed had six hours sleep before leaving fort mcmurray whats the word about john finlayson none weve examined every building every pump house every last shack within a mile of the operations center we thought there was a remote chance that hed gone across to the arco center but they searched and found nothing whats your feeling hes dead he must be houston shook his head if he isnt or wasnt under cover he couldnt have lasted a quarter of the time hes been missing what makes that even more certain is that he didnt take his outdoor furs with him without furs ten minutes if that the fbi or police come up with anything zero conditions are bad mr brady i can see that brady spoke with feeling and shivered i suppose youll have to wait for daylight before you can carry out a proper search tomorrow will be too late even now its too late anyway even if he is around the chances are we wont find him we might not find him until warmer weather comes and the snow goes drifting you mean this was mackenzie yes he could be in a gully or by the roadside our roads are built five feet high on gravel and he could be lying at the bottom of a ditch with not even a mound to show where he is houston gave a shrug what a way to die mackenzie said im accepting the fact that he is gone houston said and though it sounds callous maybe its not such a bad way to go perhaps the easiest way to go no suffering you just go to sleep and never wake up again dermott said you make it sound almost pleasant hows bronowski no fracture heavy contusions dr blake reckons the concussion is only slight he was stirring and seeming to make an effort to surface when i left the camp no further progress in that direction nothing very much doubt whether there will be either sam was the only person who could have told us anything or identified his assailant its a thousand to one that he was attacked from behind and never caught a glimpse of his attacker if he had the attacker would probably have silenced him for keeps after youve killed two people whats a third the same people you reckon houston stared its too much of a coincidence to be different people mr brady i suppose this telex from edmonton houston scratched his head told us to close down the line for a week says theyre going to check in fortyeight hours and in your own company code you said dermott asked him they didnt give a damn about letting us see it was an inside job damned arrogance and the telex was addressed to mr black only someone working on the pipeline would know that he was up here he spends nearly all his time in anchorage dermott said hows black taking this difficult to say bit of a cold fish not much given to showing his feelings i know how id feel in his shoes hes the general manager alaska and the buck stops with him houston was doing black a degree less than justice when they arrived at his office in the operations center he had a distinctly unhappy and distraut air about him he said good of you to come mr brady must have been a highly unpleasant trip and in the middle of a winters night he turned to a tall tanned man with irongray hair this is mr morrison fbi morrison shook hands with all three know of you of course mr brady ill bet you dont get too much of this sort of thing out in the gulf states never dont get any of this damnable snow and cold either mr houston here tells me that youre all up against a blank wall finlayson just vanished morrison said we were hoping that a fresh mind might be of use im afraid your hopes are misplaced i leave detection to the professionals im merely as are my colleagues here a sabotage investigator although in this case its clear that sabotage and crimes of violence have a common ground youve had mr finlaysons office fingerprinted of course from top to bottom hundreds of prints and not one seems to be of any use no prints there that shouldnt have been there you mean that the owners of those prints all had regular and legitimate access to the office morrison nodded just that brady scowled and since were convinced that this character is someone working on the pipeline any one of those fingerprints might be his mackenzie asked the fbi man any sign of the weapon used on bronowski nothing dr blake believes the blow was administered by the butt of a gun dermott asked wheres the doctor in the sick bay with bronowski whos just recovered consciousness hes still dazed and incoherent but it seems hell be okay can we see the two of them i dont know black said the doctor certainly i dont know whether hell allow you to talk to bronowski he cant be all that bad if hes conscious said dermott its a matter of urgency hes the only person who might be able to give us a clue about what happened to finlayson when they arrived in the sick bay bronowski was speaking coherently enough to dr blake he was very pale the right hand side of his head had been shaved and a huge bandage stretching from the top of his skull to the lobe of the ear covered the right temple dermott looked at the doctor a tall swarthy man with an almost cadaverous face and a hooked nose hows the patient coming on the wounds not too bad hes just been soundly stunned which is apt to addle anyones brains a bit headache for a couple of days a couple of brief questions for bronowski well brief dr blake nodded at dermotts companions dermott asked did you see the guy who knocked you down see him bronowski exclaimed didnt even hear him first thing i knew of anything was when i woke up in this bed here did you know finlayson was missing no how longs he been gone some hours must have gone missing before you were clobbered did you see him at all speak to him i did i was working on those reports you asked me to get for you he asked about the conversation i had with you then left bronowski thought about it that was the last i saw of him he looked at black those papers i was working on are they still on the table i saw them can you have them put back in the safe please theyre confidential ill do that black said dermott askedmay i see you a minute doctor youre seeing me now the doctor looked quizzically at dermott down his long nose dermott smiled heavily do you want me to discuss my chilblains and gout in public in the consulting room dr blake said you look in pretty good shape to me advancing years is all have you been up to pump station four ah so its that business what stopped you discussing it out there because im naturally cagey distrustful and suspicious i went up with finlayson blake made a grimace at the memory place was a ghastly mess so were the two murdered men they were all that dermott agreed did you carry out an autopsy on them there was a pause have you the right to be asking me these questions dermott nodded i think so doctor were all interested injustice im trying to find out who killed those two men may be three by now if finlayson stays missing very well blake said i carried out an autopsy it was fairly perfunctory i admit when men have been shot through the forehead its pointless to try to establish the possibility that they died of heart failure instead although mind you from the mangled state of their bodies its clear that the blast effect of the explosion would in itself have been enough to kill them the bullets were still lodged in the head they were and are a lowvelocity pistol i know theyll have to be recovered but thats a job for the police surgeon not for me did you search them blake lifted a saturnine eyebrow my dear fellow im a doctor not a detective why should i search them i did see that one had some papers in an inside coat pocket but i didnt examine them that was all no gun no holster i can testify to that i had to remove coat and shirt nothing of that nature one last question dermott said did you notice the index finger on the same mans right hand fractured just below the knuckle bone odd sort of break in a way but it could have resulted from a variety of causes dont forget the blast flung both of them heavily against some machinery thank you for your patience dermott made for the door then turned the dead men are still at pump station four no we brought them back here i understand their families want them buried in anchorage and that theyll be flown down there tomorrow dermott looked around finlaysons office and said to black anything been altered since bronowski was discovered here youd have to ask mr morrison at the time i was across seeing my opposite number in arco and didnt get here for twenty minutes the fbi man said some things have been touched naturally my men had to when they were carrying out their fingerprinting mackenzie nodded to the buff folders on finlaysons desk are those the reports on the security men the ones that bronowski said he was studying when he was clobbered black looked at houston and the security man said yes there were fingerprints too mackenzie raised an eyebrow those will be in the safe houston said wed like to see those and the records dermott said in fact wed like to see everything in that safe black intervened but thats where all our company confidential information is kept thats precisely why wed like to examine it black compressed his lips thats a very large order mr dermott if our hands are to be tied we might as well go back to houston or have you something to hide i consider that remark offensive i dont brady had spoken from the depths of the only armchair in the room if you have something to hide wed like to know what it is if you havent open up your safe you may be the senior man in alaska but the people in london are the ones that matter and theyve promised me we would be afforded every cooperation you are showing distinct signs of lack of cooperation i must say that gives me food for thought blacks lips were very pale now that could be construed as a veiled threat mr brady construe it any damned way you like weve been through this up here once before and john finlayson has gone on a walkabout or somewhere even less attractive cooperate or we leave and leave you with the task of explaining to london the reason for your secretiveness i am not being secretive in the best interests of the company the best interest of your company is to keep that oil flowing and head off these killers if you dont let us examine that safe we can only conclude that for some reason you choose to obstruct the best interest of your company brady poured himself a daiquiri as if to indicate that his part of the discussion was over black surrendered very well the lips had now thinned almost to nothing under protest and under i may say duress i agree to what i regard as an outrageous request the keys are in mr finlaysons desk i will bid you good night one moment dermott didnt sound any more friendly than black do you have records of all your employees on the pipeline it was clear that black was considering some further opposition and then decided against it we do but very concise couldnt call them reports mainly just brief notes of previous jobs held where are they here no only reports on security personnel are kept here and thats because bronowski regards this as his base the rest are kept in anchorage wed like to see them perhaps you can arrange for them to be made available i can arrange it i understand from dr blake that you have a flight to anchorage tomorrow is it a big plane too big said black the accountant a only one available tomorrow why one or more of us might want to hitch a lift dermott answered we could among other things pick up those reports seats would be available black said yes no more questions i trust one you received this threatening telex message from edmonton today telling you to close down the line or else what do you propose to do carry on production of course black tried to smile sardonically but the moment was wrong assuming of course that the criminals have been apprehended wheres the telex bronowski had it it may be on his person or in his desk ill find it dermott said i dont think bronowski would like you rummaging about his desk hes not here is he besides hes a security man he would understand dermott shook his head i dont think you ever will no black said good night he turned on his heel and left no one said good night to him well well brady exclaimed a friend for life in three minutes flat dont know how you do it george pity he acts so suspiciously otherwise hed have made a splendid suspect badly ruffled feathers morrison said to put it in a restrained fashion ruffling other peoples feathers is his speciality a martinet of the first order they say but an extraordinarily able man dermott said not i gather universally popular does he have friends professional business contacts thats all socially nothing if he has any friends he hides them well he tried to conceal a yawn my normal bedtime lies well behind me in the fbi we try to get to bed by ten pm can i be of any assistance before i go two things dermott said the maintenance crew at pump station four fellow called poulson in charge could you have their backgrounds investigated as rigorously as possible you have a reason for asking the fbi man sounded hopeful nothing really just that they happened to be there when the sabotage occurred im clutching at straws we have damn little else to clutch at dermott smiled wryly i think we can do that morrison said and the other dr blake tells me that the two dead engineers were brought back here today do you know where they were put morrison knew and told them said his good nights and left brady said i think i shall go and rest lightly in my room notify me if the heavens fall in but not after the first half hour or so i take it you two are about to indulge your morbid curiosity in viewing the departed dermott and mackenzie looked down at the two murdered engineers they had been covered in white sheets no attempt had been made to clean them up since they last saw them at pump station four perhaps it had been impossible perhaps no one had had a strong enough stomach for the task mackenzie said i hope theyre going to be sewn up in canvas or something before being taken to anchorage tomorrow or their relatives are going to have the screaming heebiejeebies whatever youre looking for george look for it quick im not enjoying myself nor was dermott not only was the sight revolting but the smell was nauseating he lifted the hand of the man hed briefly examined before and said how would you say that forefinger got that way mackenzie bent wrinkled his nose and said it sounds crazy but it could have been broken by a pair of pliers the trouble is that charrings obliterated any marks that might have been made on the skin dermott went to a wash basin soaked his handkerchief and cleaned up the charred area as best he could the black carbon came off surprisingly easily it didnt leave the skin clean the pitting was too deep for that but clean enough to permit a closer examination no pliers mackenzie said to break the bone pliers would have had to close right into the flesh and would have been bound to leave sawtooth marks no sawtooth marks so no pliers but i agree with you im sure that bone was deliberately broken dermott rubbed some carbon off the charred clothing and smeared it on the cleaned area so that it did not look as if it had been wiped he opened the jacket and slid his hand into the inside pocket it came out empty mackenzie said the papers and cards have taken wing and flown with assistance of course indeed could have been poulson or one of his pals could have been bronowski when he was out there yesterday could have been the kindly healer himself blake he does look like a first cousin of dracula mackenzie said dermott raised the damp handkerchief again and started to clear the area around the bullet in the forehead he peered closely at the wound and said to mackenzie can you see what i imagine i see mackenzie stooped low and peered closely still stooped he said softly with the hawk eyes of my youth gone forever i could do with a powerful magnifying glass he straightened what i imagine i see is the brown scorch marks of burned powder as before dermott smeared some carbon back on the cleaned area funny my imagination runs the same way this guy was shot at point blank range the scenario reads that it was a very close thing indeed the killer had a gun on this engineer and was probably searching him what he didnt know was that the engineer not only had a gun of his own but had it out however it was he must have seen it just in time and shot to kill there could have been no time to indulge in any fancier gunwork the engineers gun hand must have gone into muscular spasm irreversible contraction not unknown at the time of violent death to free the gun the killer had to wrench it so violently that he snapped the trigger finger dont you think that fits in with the peculiar angle at which the finger was broken i think you have it it fits anyway mackenzie frowned theres only one thing i see wrong with your scenario why should the killer take the gun in the first place he had a gun of his own sure he had but he couldnt use it anymore dermott said more accurately he couldnt afford to keep it anymore having seen no exit holes at the back of the head he knew he had left two bullets in the region of two occiputs and that the police could match up the bullets with the gun he was carrying which meant he would have to get rid of it which meant that he would be gunless at least temporarily so he took the engineers gun my guess is that he will have got rid of both guns by this time and hes almost certainly got another weapon by now in these united states and dont forget alaska is the united states getting hold of a hand gun is extremely simple mackenzie said slowly it all fits we may well be up against a professional killer we may well be up against a psychopath mackenzie shivered my scottish highland ancestry some illmannered lout has just walked all over my grave lets take counsel with the boss counsel and something else if i know our worthy employer hell already have had half thecontents of the jets bar brought to his room and you want his ideas i want some of those contents mackenzie had exaggerated somewhat ferguson hadnt brought across more than a tenth of the planes stock but even that represented a goodly amount mackenzie had already had his first scotch and was on his second he looked at brady propped up in bed in a pair of shocking heliotrope pyjamas which served only to accentuate his massive girth and said well what do you make of georges theory i believe in the facts and i also believe in the theory for the adequate reason that i see no alternative to it brady contemplated his fingernails i also believe were up against a trained ruthless and intelligent killer i dont doubt that he might be a psychopath on the loose in fact there may be two psychopaths an even more unpleasant prospect the trouble is george i dont see how this advances us much we dont know when this nut will hit again what can we do to prevent it we can scare him dermott answered thats what we can do ill bet hes already worried by the fact that were raking in fingerprints and records all over the shop lets try to worry him a little more ill go down to anchorage tomorrow while you and mackenzie stay here and do some work dermott sipped his scotch it should be a change for at least one of you i could be deeply wounded brady said but slings and arrows from an ungrateful staff are nothing new to me what precisely do you have in mind drastically narrowing the range of suspects is what i have in mind all very simple really this is a closeknit community here in prudhoe bay they more or less live out of each others pockets everyones movements must be known to at least a handful of other people probably a great deal more check on everybody and find out who has a definite alibi for being here on the morning the engineers were being killed out in the mountains if two or more people say can honestly tell you that x was here at the time of the crime you can strike x off the suspects list at the end of the day well know how many suspects we have not even a handful i bet i wouldnt be surprised if there were none at all remember that pump station four is a hundred and forty miles away and the only feasible way of getting there is by helicopter one would have to have the time and opportunity and the ability to fly a helicopter to get there and there would be no hope of taking a chopper without someone noticing i think youll find it all very straightforward less straightforward is the next inquiry who was in anchorage on the day that the original phone message was sent from there to sanmobil there must have been quite a few dont forget they go on holiday every three or four weeks and almost without exception they go to fairbanks or anchorage it will be more difficult to establish alibis you wont find many people who have witnesses as to their whereabouts at am of a black winter morning in alaska in this case though were more concerned about those who are not in the clear than those who are ill bring back a photostat of the prints theyve taken we should be able to get the doubtfuls fingerprints without too much trouble and with luck match one set up with the phone booths set i dont know how this sounds to you but it seems quite straightforward to me and to me said brady i think don and i can manage that little chore without too much difficulty dont forget though that theres a fairly large community of people down at valdez as youre my boss dermott said ill refrain from giving you a withering stare who in valdez is going to fly a round trip of thirteen hundred miles during a winter night stopping occasionally for fuel and so giving his identity away and whos going to fly or helicopter the sixteen hundred miles round trip to clobber bronowski and very possibly do away with finlayson especially as he would be immediately recognized as a stranger the moment he set foot in this area mackenzie said he has a point you must admit in fact two points dermott went on and dont tell me they could have come from one of the pumping stations they dont have helicopters i didnt say anything of the sort brady sounded aggrieved all right well go along with the assumption that its prudhoe bay or nothing but what if we turn up zero then it will be your turn to come up with the next bright idea hard day brady said you for bed yes i had intended to look at those records and prints tonight but the prints arent going to be of any use to me until i return from anchorage reports can wait too ill just hunt up that edmonton telex and take it down to the anchorage police and see if they can help me he stood up by the way has it occurred to you that you yourself may be in danger tonight me it was as if dermott had suggested some unthinkable form of lesemajeste then a look of vague apprehension crept into bradys face it may not be just your family who are at risk dermott persisted why should these people bother about kidnapping when they could achieve their ends by putting a bullet in your back which is not if i may say so without offense a very easy target to miss how are you to know there isnt a homicidal maniac in the room next door to you good god brady drank deeply from his daiquiri then he sat back and smiled at last action donald get the smith and wesson from my case he took the gun thrust it deep under his pillow and said almost hopefully dont you think you two are at risk also sure mackenzie said but not nearly as much as you no jim brady no brady enterprises youre the legend without either of us you could still function quite efficiently this homicidal maniac doesnt strike me as the type who would go for a couple of lieutenants while the captain is around good night then dermott said dont forget to lock your door as boon as were gone dont worry youre armed right of course but we dont think well be needing any weapons when dermott woke up it was with such a heavyheaded feeling of exhaustion that he could have sworn he hadnt been to sleep at all in fact less than an hour had elapsed since hed switched out the light closed his eyes and dropped off he did not wake up of his own volition the overhead light was on and morrison looking as distraught as a senior fbi agent is ever likely to look was shaking him by the shoulder dermott eyed him blearily sorry about this morrison began but i thought youd like to come along in fact i want you to dermott peered at his watch and winced for gods sake where weve found him sleep and all desire for it dropped from dermott like a cloak finlayson yes dead yes murdered we dont know youll need warm clothing wake mackenzie will you sure morrison left dermott rose and dressed for the cruel temperatures outside as he pulled on a quilted anorak his mind went back to his first meeting with finlayson he thought of the neatly parted white hair the grizzled yukon beard the hobo clothes had he been too hard on the man no good worrying now he pocketed a flashlight and moved into the passageway tim houston was standing there dermott said so you know too i found him how come instinct i guess the bitterness in houstons voice was unmistakable one of those finely honed instincts that comes into operation about ten hours too late meaning that finlayson could have been saved if this instinct of yours had been operational ten hours ago maybe but almost certainly not john was murdered shot knifed what nothing like that i didnt examine him i knew that mr morrison and you wouldnt want me to touch him i didnt have to examine him hes outside its thirty below and all hes wearing is a linen shirt and jeans hes not even got shoes on that makes it murder dermott said nothing so houston continued apart from the fact that hed never have crossed the outside doorstep voluntarily without his arctic clothing hed never have been permitted to do so anyway there are always people in the reception area besides a person who mans the central telephone fulltime by the same token it would have been impossible for anyone to carry him out lugging corpses is conspicuous so he wouldnt even have had to be a corpse i think he was silenced in his own bedroom and bundled straight out the window the cold would have finished him off here come your friends ill go get some more flashlights outside the cold was breathtaking the temperature as houston had said stood at thirty below the fortymileperhour gale brought the combination of temperature and chillfactor down to minus seventy even doublewrapped as a polar bear without an exposed inch of flesh the fact remains that one still has to breathe and breathing in those conditions until numbness intervenes is a form of exquisite and refined agony in the initial stages it is impossible to tell whether one is inhaling glacial air or superheated steam a searing sensation dominates all else the only way to survive for any length of time is to breathe pure oxygen from a suitably insulated tank but those are not readily available in the arctic houston led them around the right hand corner of the main building after about ten yards he stopped bent down and shone his flashlight between the supporting pilings other beams joined his a body lay face down an insignificant heap already halfcovered by the drifting snow dermott shouted you have sharp eyes houston a lot of people would have missed this lets get him inside dont you want to examine him here have a look around i do not when this wind drops well come back and look for clues in the meantime i dont want to join finlayson here i agree morrison said his teeth chattered audibly and he was shaking with the cold recovering the body from under the building provided the four men with no problem even if finlayson had weighed twice as much they would have had him out in seconds flat such was their determination to regain shelter and warmth as soon as possible as it was finlayson was slightly built and handling him was like handling a pound log so solidly frozen had he become when they were clear of the pilings dermott looked up at a brightly lit window above and yelled through the wind whos room is that houston shouted his your theory fits doesnt it it does when they brought finlayson into the reception area there were perhaps halfadozen men sitting or standing around for a moment nobody said anything then one man stepped forward and with some diffidence asked shall i bring dr blake mackenzie shook his head sadly im sure hes an excellent doctor but no medical school has yet got around to offering a course on raising a man from the dead thanks all the same dermott said have we got an empty room where we can put him houston looked at him and dermott shook his head in selfreproach okay so my minds gummed up with cold or lack of sleep or both his own room of course where can we find a rubber sheet so they took finlayson to his room and laid him on the rubber sheet on top of his bed dermott said is there an individual thermostat control in here sure said houston its set on seventytwo turn it up what for dr blake will want to do a postmortem you cant examine a person whos frozen solid were getting experienced at this sort of thing too experienced dermott turned to mackenzie houston thinks finlayson was silenced in this room killed knocked out we dont know he also thinks that our friends got rid of him by the simple expedient of opening the window and dumping him onto the snow bank beneath mackenzie crossed to the window opened it shivered at the icy blast of air that swept into the room leaned out and peered down seconds later he had the window firmly closed again has to be that were directly above the spot where we found him and its in deep shadow down there he looked at houston is there much traffic along there at night none nor during the day no call for it track leads nowhere so the killers left either by the front door or by this same window they did the obvious thingjust stuffed him under the building hoping the snow would have drifted over him before daylight came mackenzie sighed he couldnt by any chance have felt sick opened the window for some fresh air fell and crawled under the building dermott said you believe thats possible no john finlayson wouldnt get a breath of fresh air that way he got a dearth of fresh air murder well i think the boss should be told hes sure going to be pleased isnt he brady was furious his black scowl accorded ill with his heliotrope pyjamas he said progress on all fronts what do you two intend to do mackenzie said pacifically thats why were here we thought you might be able to give us a lead a lead how the hell can i give you a lead ive been asleep he corrected himself well for a few minutes anyway sad about finlayson fine man by all accounts what do you reckon george one things for sure the similarities between what happened here tonight and what occurred at pump station four are too great to be a coincidence as with the two engineers so with finlayson they all saw or heard too much for their own health they recognized a person or persons whom they knew well and who knew them and those people were engaged in something that couldnt be explained away so they had to be silenced in the most final way brady thought for a moment and asked is there a direct connection between bronowski being clobbered and finlayson being killed i wouldnt bet on it dermott said tieup looks too obvious you could argue that bronowski escaped because he didnt catch his assailants redhanded in whatever they were doing and that finlayson died because he did but thats too easy too glib what does houston think he doesnt appear to have any more idea about it than we do appear brady seized on the word you mean he may know more than hes telling at the moment hes not saying or telling anything but you dont trust him no and while were at it i dont trust bronowski hell man hes been savagely assaulted assaulted not savagely i dont trust dr blake either because hes unhelpful and uncooperative a good enough reason brady became tactful well you do tend to ride a bit roughshod over peoples feelings to hell with their delicate sensibilities were dealing here with three cases of murder come to that i dont trust black either you dont trust black general manager alberta he can be the king of siam for all i care dermott said forcefully some of the most successful businessmen in history also number in the ranks of the biggest swindlers ever im not suggesting he is a swindler all i say is that hes crafty cagey cold and uncooperative in short i dont trust anyone look friends were looking at this from the wrong angle brady suggested were on the inside trying to look out maybe we should be on the outside trying to look in think of it this way who wants to hit the pipeline here and at the tar sands of athabasca do you see any significance in the fact that here they receive their instructions from edmonton while in alberta they come from anchorage none dermott was positive may be just coincidence at best a crude attempt to confuse us surely they cant be so naive as to try to convey the impression that canada is trying to interfere with americas oil supplies and vice versa ideas ludicrous in these times of an acute oil shortage what have two friendly neighbours to gain by cutting each others throats then who has to gain mackenzie spoke quietly opec he said mackenzie was just as positive as dermott had been if they could put a stranglehold on the two countries supplies from the north they stand to gain immensely in both profits and power both our governments have made it clear that theyre prepared to go to any lengths to shake free once and for all from this crucifying dependence on opec oil this wouldnt suit our foreign friends at all they have us over a barrel an oil barrel if you will and they want to keep it that way why now jim brady said although i know as well as you do they have tremendous leverage at the moment and the last thing theyd ever want to do is to abdicate this position of almost dictatorial power decisions are being made now in both countries should north america become anywhere near selfsufficient in oil our blackmailing friends would lose their power base theyd be forced to abandon their pretensions to playing an authoritative role in world affairs and perhaps worst of all for them their profits would be reduced to such a trickle that theyd have to forgo their grandiose schemes for industrial and technological expansion for hauling their countries into the middle of the late twentieth century without any of the intermediate struggle or learning and developmental process when it comes to national survival desperate men are prepared to go to desperate lengths brady paced for some time then said do you really think the opec countries would take concerted action against us hell no half of them are barely on speaking terms with the other half and you cant imagine relatively moderate countries like saudi arabia participating in any such combined operation but you know as well as i do that among the opec rulers there are some certifiable loonies who would stop at nothing to achieve their own ends and you wont have forgotten that some of those countries play host to the most ruthless terrorist trainers in the business brady said what would you say to that george its a theory and a perfectly tenable one on the other hand since coming here i havent seen a single person who looks remotely like an arabian or middle eastern terrorist so what would your guess be as a wild guess i would suspect our troubles are caused by good oldfashioned capitalistic free enterprise and if thats the case the potential sources of our troubles are legion im afraid we wont solve this by looking at it from the outside well have to look out from the inside and the motive blackmail obviously cash well the only other bargaining counter is hostages nobodys balding any hostages so whats left theyre now in the process of softening us up by proving they can carry out their threats when and as they wish they wont be asking for pennies i shouldnt think so to start with the pipeline and sanmobil have a combined investment of ten billion for every day that delivery is held up theyll be losing millions more most important of all our two countries are desperate for oil whoever those people are they have us not over but in a barrel naked the ransom will be high i should imagine it would be paid whod pay it mackenzie said the oil companies the governments theyve all got a stake in this brady said and once the blackmailers have been paid whats to prevent them repeating the process all over again nothing that i can see god youre a jobs comforter let me comfort you some more shall i there could be a lashup between dons theory and mine if this is blackmail and if the killers do collect whats to prevent some of the opec countries approaching them and offering to double or triple their money if they destroy the supply lines for keeps and get out youve a big responsibility on your shoulders mr brady you george are a rock of strength and compassion in times of trouble and stress brady sounded plaintive well if there are no constructive suggestions forthcoming i suggest we all retire there is thinking to be done and i must take counsel with myself on such nights the best company dermott still felt unaccountably tired when the alarm clock dragged him up from the depths of a troubled sleep it was just before eight in the morning he rose reluctantly showered shaved made his way to finlaysons room and was about to knock when the door was opened by dr blake at that time of the morning the doctors beaked nose hollow cheeks and sunken eyes lent him a more cadaverous look than ever not the kind of physicians face dermott thought to inspire hope and confidence ah come in mr dermott ive finished with finlayson was just about to send for his casket he and the two engineers from pump station four are being flown out at ninethirty i understand youre going with them yes you have caskets macabre you think well we do keep a few tucked away apart from natural illnesses this is an accidentprone profession and we have to be prepared you cant very well whistle up an undertaker from fairbanks or anchorage at a moments notice i suppose not dermott nodded at the dead man any luck in establishing the cause of death well normally it requires a full autopsy to discover whether a victim has been suffering from cerebrovascular disease or cardiac arrest fortunately or unfortunately it wasnt necessary in this case blake sounded grim what would be natural causes elsewhere are unnatural here john finlayson was murdered how beyond exposure none of your usual methods he was rendered unconscious and left to die in the cold clad as he was in these abnormally low temperatures id say his heart must have stopped in under a minute how was he knocked out sandbagged in the classic spot at the base of the neck an expert you can see the slight contusion and roughness there a contusion can only be caused by blood still circulating so he was clearly alive after the blow the cold killed him where could the attacker have got sand in this godforsaken frozen hole dr blake smiled dermott wished he hadnt the long narrow teeth only accentuated the deaths head effect if you arent too squeamish you can smell what they used dermott bent and rose almost immediately salt blake nodded probably slightly dampened makes an even more effective bludgeon than sand they teach you this in medical school i was on the forensic side once if i make out and sign the death certificate will you be kind enough to hand it in at anchorage of course big burly highcolored and irrepressibly cheerful john ffoulkes looked more like a prosperous farmer than a tough competent senior police officer he produced a bottle of whiskey and two glasses and smiled at dermott in view of those ridiculous prohibition laws they have up at prudhoe bay maybe we can make up here in anchorage my chief would like your style we dont do so badly there mr brady claims to have the biggest portable bar north of the arctic circle he has too well then to help erase the memory of your flight i gather you didnt enjoy it much extreme turbulence an absence of pretty stewardesses and the knowledge that youre carrying three murdered men in the cargo hold doesnt make for a very relaxed flight ffoulkes stopped smiling ah yes the dead men not only a tragic affair but an extremely unpleasant one ive had reports from my own state troopers and the fbi i wonder if you could have anything to add to what they said i doubt it mr morrison of the fbi struck me as a highly competent officer hes all that and a close friend of mine but tell me anyway please dermotts account was as succinct as it was comprehensive at the end ffoulkes said tallies almost exactly with the other reports but no hard facts suspicions yes hard facts no so the only lead you really have are the prints we got from that telephone booth dermott nodded and ffoulkes brought out a buff folder from a desk drawer here they are some are pretty smudged but a few are not too bad are you an expert i can read them with a powerful glass and a lot of luck but an expert no ive got a firstclass young lad here like to borrow him for a day or two dermott hesitated thats kind but i dont want to tread on mr morrisons toes hes got his own man up there not in the same class as our david hendry mr morrison wont object he pressed an intercom button and gave an order david hendry was fairhaired smiling and seemed ridiculously young to be a police officer after introductions ffoulkes said lucky lad how do you fancy a vacation in a winter wonderland hendry looked cautious which wonderland sir prudhoe bay oh my god good glad youre happy thats settled then pack your equipment and of course your clothes three parkas should be enough worn on top of each other whens your plane leave mr dermott two hours report back in an hour david hendry opened the door to leave then stood to one side as a lean man whitebearded like an old testament prophet bustled into the room apologies john apologies couldnt have caught me at a worse time or on a worse day two court cases two suicides people get more thoughtless every day you have my sympathies charles as i one hopes have yours dr parker mr dermott hah parker looked at dermott with an illconcealed lack of enthusiasm you the fellow whos come to add to my burden of woes through no wish of mine doctor three burdens to be precise im afraid i cant do anything about them today mr dermott snowed under just snowed very likely i cant do anything about them tomorrow either most unprofessional what is my two assistants coming down with the flu at the busiest time of the year this modern generation i daresay they couldnt help it nambypambies what happened to those three anyway two we know for sure they were in the close vicinity of an explosion after that an oil fire broke out savagely scarred the fumes alone would have finished them off but they were already finished off so blasted to death burned asphyxiated doesnt leave very much for an old sawbones like me to do does it each of them has also a lowvelocity bullet lodged somewhere near the back of his skull dermott said hah so you want them out is that it not me dr parker the state police and the fbi im no cop just an oilfield sabotage investigator parker looked sour i hope my efforts arent as thoroughly wasted as usual ffoulkes smiled what odds would you offer mr dermott about a million to one that theyll be wasted that gun has almost certainly been tossed out of a helicopter somewhere over the brooks range ill still have to ask you charles said ffoulkes dr parker was unimpressed what about this third man bp sohos field production manager in prudhole bay john finlayson good lord know the man well suppose i should say knew now yes dermott nodded to ffoulkes desk thats his death certificate parker picked it up screwed on a pincenez and read through the report unusual he said testily but it seems a straightforward medical report to me theres no autopsy required here he peered at dermott from your expression you appear to disagree im neither agreeing nor disagreeing im just vaguely unhappy have you ever practised medicine mr dermott no and yet you presume to take issue with a colleague of mine you know him then never heard of him parker breathed deeply but damn it hes a physician so was dr crippen what the devil are you insinuating you read into my words what you choose dermott said flatly im insinuating nothing i merely say that his examination was perfunctory and hurried and that he may have missed something you wouldnt claim a divine right of infallibility for doctors i would not his voice was still testy but only a testy mutter now what is it you want a second opinion thats a damned unusual request its a damned unusual murder ffoulkes looked quizzically at dermott and said ill look in at prudhoe bay tomorrow theres nothing like adding a touch of chaos to an existing state of confusion ten dermott and david hendry flew in from anchorage to prudhoe bay in the leaden twilight of late afternoon to find the weather distinctly improved with the wind down to ten knots the top of the drifting snow cloud not more than five feet above ground level visibility in the planes headlights almost back to normal and the temperature at least twenty degrees higher than in the morning in the administration building lounge the first recognizable face dermott saw was that of morrison of the fbi who was sitting with a young gingerhaired man incongruously dressed in gray flannels and blazer morrison looked up and smiled trust john ffoulkes he said no faith in the fbi he gestured toward the gingerhaired young man nick turner ignore the way he dresses hes been to oxford my fingerprint man on your right david hendry your fingerprint man dermott said mildly john ffoulkes just observed that two pairs of eyes were better than one no developments not one you largely a waste of time had a thought on the way up why dont we print john finlaysons room no dice weve done it clean as a whistle close enough lots of unsatisfactory smudges which can only be finlaysons a couple belonging to a plumber who was there on his rounds and one would you believe it just one belonging to the bull cook who must be a real whizkid with duster and polishing cloth bull cook kind of housekeeper bedmaker and cleaner could some other industrious soul have been busy in there with a duster morrison produced two keys his room key and the master key had them in my pocket since finlayson was taken out this morning here endeth the lesson dermott laid the buff folder on the low table before morrison prints from the anchorage phone booth now i must go and report to the boss morrison said it should amuse the two young gentlemen here to compare your anchorage prints with the ones in the office safe you dont sound very optimistic dermott said the fbi agent smiled by nature ive always been an optimist but that was before i crossed the fortyninth parallel dermott found brady and mackenzie taking their ease in the only two chairs in bradys room he looked on them without favor its very pleasant and reassuring to see you two so comfortable and relaxed brady said rough afternoon huh he waved a hand toward the serried row of bottles on the sideboard thisll restore your moral fiber dermott helped himself and asked any news from athabasca how are the family fine fine brady chuckled stella passed on a lot more stuff from norway apparently theyve got that fire licked no need to keep in touch any longer thats good dermott sipped his scotch what are the girls doing right now i guess theyre touring the sanmobil plant courtesy of bill reynolds very hospitable lot those canadians whove they got to protect them reynolds own security men brinckman the boss you remember and jorgensen his number two dermott was unimpressed id rather they had those two young cops brady snapped your reason three first theyre a damned sight tougher and more competent than brinckmans lot second brinckman jorgensen and napier are prime suspects why prime for having the keys that opened the sanmobil armor door for having given the keys to those who did third theyre security men brady smiled blandly youre bushed george youre becoming paranoid about the security men of the great northwest i hope you dont have reason to regret that remark brady scowled but said nothing so dermott changed the subject how did the day go no progress along with morrison we interviewed every man on the base every one had a castiron alibi for the night of the explosion in pump station four so its all clear there except dermott persisted who do you mean bronowski and houston brady glowered at his chief operative and shook his head youre paranoid george i say it again shit we know they were both out there bronowskis been hurt and houston didnt have to find finlayson if he had been crooked it would have suited him far better to let the drifting snow obliterate every last trace of finlayson what do you say to that three things the fact that we know they were out at the pump station makes them more suspect not less second guessing growled brady hate second guessing no doubt but weve agreed that the bombers must be people working on the pipeline weve eliminated everyone else so it has to be them does it not brady did not answer dermott went on the third thing is this there must be some reason albeit devious why bronowski was clobbered and houston made the discovery look at it this way what evidence do we have that bronowski was assaulted the only certain thing we know about him is that hes lying in the sickbay with an impressive bandage around his head i dont think theres a damn thing wrong with bronowski i dont think anybody hit him i suggest that if the bandage were removed his temple would be unblemished except perhaps for an artistic touch of gentian blue brady assumed the expression of a man praying for inner strength so besides not trusting security men you dont trust doctors either some i do some i dont ive already told you that im leery of blake got one single hard fact to back up your suspicions no okay then brady didnt enlarge on this brief statement we also rounded up the prudhoe bay members who were in anchorage on the night of that telephone call mackenzie said fourteen in all they seemed a pretty harmless bunch to me however morrison of the fbi did call up the law in anchorage gave names and addresses and asked them to see if they could turn up anything you printed those fourteen right yes one of morrisons assistants did some ivy league kid no objections offered none they seemed eager to cooperate proves nothing anyway i brought along the prints found on the phone booth theyre being checked now against the prints of the fourteen that wont take long mackenzie said give them a call shall i he called listened briefly hung up and said to dermott cassandra so brady looked positively lugubrious no easy feat for a man without a line in his face houstons finest have run into a brick wall lets not reproach ourselves too much dermott said he looked less downcast than the other two our business is investigating oil sabotage not murder which is the province of the fbi and the alaskan state police they appear to have run into the same brick wall besides we may have the lead into another line of investigation john finlaysons autopsy huh brady gave a contemptuous lift of his hands thats over it turned up nothing the first one didnt but the second one might mackenzie said what another autopsy the first one was pretty superficial and perfunctory unprecedented brady shook his head who the hell authorized this nobody really i did ask for it but politely brady cursed whether because of dermotts words or because he had spilled a goodly portion of a daiquiri over his immaculately trousered knee he refilled his glass breathed deeply and said took your own goddamned good time in getting around to telling us didnt you everything in its own good time jim just a matter of getting priorities right itll be a couple of days before we get the results of this autopsy i really cant see why you are getting so steamed up i can damn well tell you who the hell gave you the authorization to make such a request without first getting permission from me nobody did you had time before you left here this morning to discuss the matter with me sure i had time but i hadnt had the idea by then i was halfway down to anchorage before it occurred to me that there could be something far wrong do you imagine id talk to you in prudhoe bay over an open line you talk as if this place is an international hotbed of espionage brady came back at him sarcastically it only requires one disaffected ear and we might as well pack our bags and return to houston we already know how good those people are at covering their tracks george it was mackenzie youve made your point what triggered your suspicions dr blake you know that as far as the murdered engineers at pump station four and bronowskis alleged accident were concerned i already had reservations about blake i began to wonder if there was anything that could tie blake in with finlaysons death i was the only person who saw the body between the completion of blakes autopsy and the time the lid was screwed down on the coffin dermott stopped to sip during that period blake showed me marks on the back of the neck where he said finlayson had been sandbagged into unconsciousness on the plane it occurred to me that i had never seen a bruise or contusion of that nature there was no sign of discoloration or of swelling it seemed to me more than likely that the skin had been roughed up after death blake said finlayson had been struck by a bag of damp salt his neck smelled of salt all right but it could have been rubbed on during the night after the body had been brought back up to the room if he had been coshed the vertebrae would have been depressed or broken mackenzie said obvious question were they i dont know they looked okay to me but dr parker will know dr parker works along with the anchorage police in a forensic capacity struck me as a very bright old boy my request wasnt too well received at first like yourselves he regarded the concept of a second autopsy as unprecedented or unconstitutional or whatever he read blakes death certificate and seemed to think it perfectly in order but you persuaded him to the contrary not exactly he promised nothing but he seemed interested enough to do something brady said you are a persuasive cuss george dermott paused reflectively it may be nothing or it may be another straw in the wind but dr parker has never heard of dr blake brady resumed his favorite steeplefingered pontificating attitude youre aware that alaska is more than half the size of western europe im also aware that in western europe there must be a hundred million people in alaska a few hundred thousand id be surprised if outside the few hospitals there are more than sixty or seventy doctors and a veteran like parker would be bound to know or know of them all brady unsteepled his fingertips and said there is hope for you an immediate investigation into doctor blakes antecedents would appear to be in order immediate mackenzie agreed morrisons the man for that wouldnt it be interesting too to have a rundown on the man who appointed or recommended blake to this post it would dermott said and it would certainly narrow the field a bit i wonder you remember just after we arrived here asking whether there were any ideas about the type of weapon used on bronowski and morrison said i think i quote him accurately dr blake says hes no specialist in criminal acts of violence brady nodded so this morning when i was with him in finlaysons room discussing the reasons for the mans death he mentioned in an offhand way that he used to be an expert in the forensic field obviously he said it to lend credence to his diagnosis but it was a slip all the same one time or the other he was lying dermott looked at brady and asked your agents in new york who are investigating bronowskis security firm there they arent shall we say exactly burning up the track give them a nudge negative you said yourself that an open line whos talking about an open line we do it through houston in your code huh that damn code you encode any message you like and authorize it in my name mackenzie winked unobtrusively but dermott ignored him and began to spell out the message to the telephone operator it said much for his mastery of a code which its inventor found insupportably burdensome that he encoded the words straight out of his head without having to make a prior transcript he had barely finished when a knock on the door announced the arrival of hamish black the pencil moustache on the alaskan general manager was as immaculately trimmed as ever the central parting of the hair still apparently drawn by ruler the eyeglass so securely anchored that it looked as if it could have ridden out a hurricane he still dressed in pure city accountant first class at that moment however there was a difference in his general demeanour he looked like a firstclass accountant who had just stumbled across proof of unmistakable and gross embezzlement in the books of his favorite client yet he maintained his cool or cold good evening gentlemen he was a specialist in wintry smiles i hope i do not intrude mr brady come in come in brady was affability itself a sure sign that he didnt care too much for his visitor make yourself at home he glanced around the cramped confines of his room and at the already occupied chairs well thank you ill stand i shall not detain you for long a drink one of my incomparable rum drinks how about a cigar thank you i neither smoke nor drink the minuscule twitch of the lefthand corner of his upper lip clearly indicated his opinion of those who did i have come here because in my capacity of general manager of sohio bp i felt it my duty to ask how much progress you have made in your investigations to date dermott said what have we found out so far well will you please be quiet sir i was addressing george brady made a downward placatory movement of the hand toward a dermott who was already halfway out of his seat he looked coldly at black we are not employees of yours mr black we are not even retained by you but directly by your head office in london i suggest that if you want to leave this room the way you entered it you watch your language blacks lips had disappeared somewhere sir i am not accustomed okay okay we all know that youre obviously in a hostile mood our progress so far not much would there be anything else black was clearly taken aback it is difficult for an oldtime manofwar to attack when the wind has been taken out of its sails so you admit no admission were just making a statement can we be of further help indeed you can you can explain to me the justification for your staying on here the firm can scarcely afford the fees you seem likely to charge if it gets no advantage you have achieved nothing and seem unlikely to achieve anything you investigate industrial sabotage specifically oilflow interruption there is i suggest a considerable difference between the spilling of oil and the spilling of blood one cannot but suspect but that you are out of your depth and that events are beyond your control one further suspects that the investigation should be left to those qualified to investigate criminal matters the fbi and the alaskan state police wed be interested to know what theyve found out or dont you feel free to tell us black compressed his lips still tighter mackenzie said may i have a word mr brady certainly donald mr black your attitude here is singularly reminiscent of the one you adopted when first we met you have you the power to make us leave yes permanently no why not you know very well why not london head office would reinstate you possibly with the qualification that if any such situation arose again it would be the general manager alaska who would be required to leave i couldnt really say i can or didnt you know that mr brady is a close personal friend of the chairman of your company from the way that black touched his collar it was clear that this was news to him from the way jim brady experienced a sudden suppressed difficulty in swallowing a mouthful of daiquiri it was clear that it was news to him also to return to your earlier attitude mr black mackenzie persisted on that occasion mr dermott said he thought you might have something to hide mr brady suggested you were being unduly secretive and had what was it again some undisclosed and possibly discreditable reason for choosing to obstruct the best interests of your company reasonable requests you regarded as being preposterous finally as i recall mr dermott said that you were either standing on your high horse as general manager alaska and were above such petty annoyances or that you were concealing something you didnt want us to know about black was possibly a shade or two paler but his pallor could well have been caused by anger he reached for the door handle this is intolerable i refuse to be the subject of character assassination as he pulled open the door mackenzie said reproachfully i think its impolite to interrupt a mans speech blacks eyes matched well the icy conditions outside what does that mean just that i would like to finish what ive been saying black looked at his watch make it short i know you have a great deal to do mr black two tiny spots of pink appeared on the pale cheekbones for mackenzies tone had made it abundantly clear he didnt believe black had anything to do so ill keep it short your intransigence interests us you have made it abundantly clear that you would be happy to be rid of us by your own admission youve acknowledged that we would be back very soon afterward perhaps even in a matter of days the conclusion is that you want us out of the way even if for only a brief period one wonders what you intend to do or have done during that short time i see you leave me with no alternative other than to report your gross incompetence and insolence to my board of directors in london when the door had closed dermott said not a bad exit line hell do nothing of the kind of course not when hes had time to reflect on mr bradys close personal relationship with his board chairman dermott looked at brady i didnt know neither did i brady was positively jovial he smacked one fat fist into the other pudgy palm tell me donald how much of what you said did you mean whos to know not me i just dont like the bastard hardly the basis for a dispassionate judgement dermott said but a splendid demolition job donald there are times when a man rises above himself he paused for a moment then looked at brady remember the last time we had a run in with our friend you said that it was a pity that he acted so suspiciously otherwise he would have made a splendid suspect maybe were outsmarting ourselves its barely possible that he should be a suspect maybe in addition hes outsmarting us this wont have escaped you brady stopped being jovial doubleguessing again how often do i have to tell you george i hate this goddamn doubleguessing general manager alaska jesus george somebody by definition has to be beyond suspicion in dermotts cabin mackenzie said took you ja long time to transmit that coded message to houston your brief was merely to ask them to expedite the bosss earlier instructions what the hell else did you say i asked them to find out if anybody had left bronowskis security firm within six months before or after bronowskis leaving maybe bradys right maybe this security bit is getting to you and even if bronowski has hauled some of his old associates along with him they may have changed their names hardly matters descriptions will be enough and as for my being bitten by the bug its high time you and jim were too how would you try to account for the fact that the bastards in alberta know the alaskan companys code while the villains in alaska know the albertan code the private sanmobil code ever since the first identical messages were received at prudhoe bay and sanmobil weve known our alaskan and athabascan friends were in cal hoots nicely coordinating their efforts to keep us i wrongfooted and ensuring that we were in a while we should have been in b and vice versa theres no doubt in my mind that both security corps have been infiltrated our only suspects on both sides are security people so you think the overall coordinator must be a security man not necessarily but what im sure of is that pretty soon were going to hear of some fresh calamity that has struck in athabasca the master puppeteer must be thinking its time the puppets were dancing again coordination mackenzie said darkly in this instance you heard whati said to black that he wants us out for a few days for some purpose if he cant get rid of us in one way by asking us to leave then hell do it in another by arranging a fresh athabascan calamity dermott sighed drew a line under a list of names he had printed and handed it over names for investigation lets hope by our friend morrison of the fbi what dyou think of it mackenzie took the list and studied it his eyebrows went up make morrison jump for sure he said i dont care if he jumps over the moon as long as he gets on with it when he comes down said dermott heavily weve got to get action somewhere he was about to say something else when the telephone rang he picked up the receiver to listen and gradually his face went chalk white he seemed not to notice when the glass in his left hand shattered crushed by the pressure he had put on it and a little rivulet of blood ran down his palm eleven what a place exclaimed stella as she came back into corinnes office heavens i had no idea it was so big we seem to have driven about fifty miles well its quite a size thats for sure corinne grinned pleased that her guests had enjoyed themselves i hope you found it interesting too mrs brady incredible jean eased off the hood of her parka and shook her hair loose those draglines ive never seen anything like them theyre theyre sort of prehistoric monsters burrowing into the bowels of the earth thats right stellas imagination had been fired no less brontosauruses absolutely sure was kind of mr reynolds to fix our tour and to ask us to supper dont mention it corinne tried out the deprecating smile she had been cultivating we all like having visitors makes a change youll enjoy meeting mary reynolds too now lets see if the boss is ready to leave she buzzed the intercom and announced that the ladies were back over the loudspeaker they heard him say fine ill be through in a minute be right with you she said all set she tidied her desk locked the drawers put the keys in her handbag and pulled on a fetching rolypoly combination suit of powderblue quilted nylon as well as a pair of blue furtopped boots a moment later reynolds himself came through the connecting door similarly muffled in navy blue and white evening ladies he said pleasantly had a good tour i hope not too dull not at all jean had no trouble sounding enthusiastic it was wonderful fascinating good he turned to corinne where are our strongarm boys then waiting for us in the lobby great wed better not leave them behind or your fattoerll give us hell he winked at stella and ushered her through the door terry brinckman sanmobiles security chief and his deputy jorgensen were hovering in the entrance hall as the party approached the two men opened the outside door and let in a blast of the arctic evening out on the tarmac one of the firms yellowandblackcheckered minibuses stood ready with its engine running reynolds opened the passenger door helped jean and stella into the front seat nipped around to the drivers side and slammed the door cursing the knifelike wind corinne hopped into the back seat between the two security men as they cruised down toward the main gates reynolds called up the guard on his twoway radio and identified the vehicle to save the man coming out into the cold at the buss approach the high weld mesh gates began to roll open driven by electric motors a few snowflakes drifted fast through the blaze of the arc lamps that illuminated the perimeter fence reynolds gave a couple of toots on the horn to signal his thanks and a moment later they were out in the open with the headlight beams boring into the frozen darkness ahead the bus was warm and comfortable the journey would take only twenty minutes yet corinne somehow felt uneasy her boss had been on edge all day and although she had maintained a sunny enough exterior she wasnt looking forward to the evening it could be sticky maybe they could get a bit of a concert or singsong going that would help she leaned forward and asked stella if she could play guitar why sure if no one else is listening ah come on i thought we could maybe have a singsong course she can play jean said firmly tick up any tune you care to sing thats great corinne settled back between her two solid escorts the bus had left the inhabited outskirts of the site and was winding through the low hills that separated the tar sands from fort mcmurray reynolds drove smoothly without violent acceleration or braking for the surface of the road was dusted with the evertraveling snow which flashed and glittered in the headlight beams they had just passed a sharp corner which brinckman said was known as hangmans turn when reynolds did jam on his brakes he cursed as the bus slewed to the left then corrected the skid ahead the road was blocked by a black truck which had also skidded sidewayson look out corinne shouted theres someone on the road the bus shuddered to a halt a few yards short of the huddled figure lying face down the flying snow cleared for a few seconds to reveal another body also on its belly but moving oh my god jean cried from up front theres been an accident you ladies sit tight reynolds ordered sharply terry go see whats happened brinckman opened his door and got out corinne felt the blast of air hit her from the right then she saw another figure running or rather staggering toward them from the stranded vehicle the man had his hands up as if to shield his eyes from the minibuss lights he was limping and lurching she thought hes been badly hurt corinne felt brinckman yank the firstaid box out from under the back seat next thing she knew he was flat on his side his feet having gone from under him on the ice he got up at once and advanced more cautiously with his feet apart apparently to the aid of the injured man what happened next was so fast that corinne afterward wondered a hundred times whether or not she had remembered it right everything seemed to go into a blur one moment brinckman was advancing to meet the crippled figure next second the cripple seemed suddenly to shake off his injuries he stood upright and let fly an expertly timed blow that felled brinckman like a tree the instant the man lowered his shielding hand corinne saw he was wearing a stocking mask stella screamed back up quick corinne also shouted something but before any of them could move the attacker was at reynolds door in a second he had wrenched it open and thrown in something that hissed instinctively corinne threw herself down flat on the floor in the back from the front she heard stifled screams and ghastly tearing noises as people struggled for breath then the gas got her too and she found herself fighting and choking as if for her life in spite of her distress she became aware that the people in front were being dragged out into the snow she crouched flat on the floor struggling to control her stinging throat and eyes then she heard a man shout wheres the other chick weve only got two in the next second she felt someone seize the hood of her combination suit and drag her bodily out onto the road without knowing why she pretended to be unconscious somehow it seemed safer she felt herself sliding easily along the icy surface being dragged like a sack of potatoes her backside skidded smoothly over the snow as she was pulled around the front of the minibus into the headlights she noticed that the supposedly injured men had vanished the buss engine was still running but the vehicle blocking the road had started up as well suddenly she was hoisted and dumped in the open back of the truck for the first time she felt afraid not of being kidnapped but of freezing to death in spite of her thick suit she was shivering already and if they were going to be driven miles in an open truck the cold would soon kill them all her fears on that score proved groundless after a rough bumpy drive of only a few seconds the truck crunched to a halt the noise of its motor was suddenly swamped by a far louder heavier roar that burst out all around and over them corinne opened her eyes in terror and saw that they had pulled up beside a graywhite helicopter even as she looked up one of the rotor blades moved past her line of sight she felt she should scream or run but would it do any good even a seconds hesitation was too long she felt herself grabbed by shoulders and ankles and swung aboard again like an inert sack the noise was terrific the engineroar increased to a furious pitch but through it she could hear a woman screaming and men yelling she saw a bundle she recognized as stella struggling frantically with one of the men in stocking masks rolling across the bare steel another of the men slid the door in the side of the fuselage nearly shut but he kept his head stuck out through the gap bellowing at someone still on the ground the enginenote rose and fell rose and fell as though the pilot was having mechanical difficulty then it went up and stayed up but only for a few seconds again it dropped corinne had never been in a helicopter before and did not know what to expect she didnt know whether the pilot was going through his normal takeoff routine or whether he had some problem what she did notice however was that the man whod been shouting to his colleague on the ground had failed to close the door properly it still stood a few inches ajar a desperate idea flashed into her head at the moment of takeoff whenever it came she would dart to the door drag it open and fling herself out before shed had time to evaluate the risks she felt the floor tilt they were off already then came a heavy bump down again she thought next time they did lift it was then or never she rolled over flung herself at the door and hauled it back she was hit by a stunningly cold wash of wind too late she realized that they were already off the ground she was caught by the slipstream whirled around and sucked out she clutched wildly at the door frame but her gloves slipped uselessly over the bare metal at the edge of her consciousness she heard a man screaming youre crazy youll be killed then she was falling through the snowladen wind she tumbled over in mid air and glimpsed a pair of headlights snaking through the night way below that was the last thing she saw the next couple of seconds would bring her nightmares for the rest of her life time stopped she fell endlessly through the freezing sky convinced that her body would be smashed to pieces any instant she tried to scream but could not she tried to breathe but could not she tried to turn over but could not alter her attitude in the slightest she dropped helplessly rigid with terror then she screamed the impact was unbelievably gentle instead of smashing into ironhard tundra she landed in something soft and yielding she hit it backfirst and went right on down through several feet of blessed cushioning she was winded by the impact but that was all she lay on her back gasping and groaning for breath but once she had got it back she began to shake with relief to her own amazement she found she was laughing as well as crying she had landed on her backside in a great big drift of snow jay shore was just about to leave his office at the sanmobil plant when the telephone rang he picked up the receiver and said yes switchboard operator here said a voice high with stress got an emergency driver pete johnson is on the radio wants to talk to you immediately ill take it patch him through shore waited hullo hullo johnsons voice crackled through even more excited than the operators mr shore sir speaking take it easy whats the problem im on my way down to fort mcmurray sir driving bus mb three just come around a corner and found bus mb five abandoned in the middle of the road abandoned thats right doors open motor running lights on point is its the bus mr reynolds took to go home in jesus where are you about a mile past hangmans turn mile toward fort mcmurray okay ill get someone right out there mr shore what is it i just saw a chopper take off from near the road and somebody fell out of it and two of our security guys mr brinckman and mr jorgensen are lying in the road like theyve been hurt real bad damn yeah and theres a truck stuck in the snow by where the plane took off its trying to get back on the road facing toward fort mcmurray keep away from it shore ordered stay in your own vehicle back off a bit but dont go near the truck ill get someone right down okay mr shore sir shore banged down the receiver and snatched up another an outside line he dialled and waited he knew that carmody and jones the two rcmp men assigned to protect the brady family were also due at the reynoldses for supper so he called directly there someone answered mrs reynolds mary jay shore speaking look im afraid theres been some sort of a mixup george and the ladies have got delayed whats that no i hope not nothing to worry about have you the two constables there already great yes please either will do john carmody came on the line emergency said shore quietly i think your partys been hijacked yes i do he explained all he knew in a couple of sentences what i want you to do is come right up the road to hangmans turn you see anybody coming to meet you stop him it could be the gray truck were after okay okay were on our way thats fine get moving carmody drove jones rode shotgun his revolver ready in his hand the cherokee jeep station wagon in fourwheel drive held the road better than a regular sedan but even so they had to go carefully carmody swore steadily as he nursed the wheel goddamn it to hell he kept muttering the first time we leave them this happens what in hell were the sanmobil security guys doing for christs sake they drove on snow whirling through the headlight beams suddenly they saw lights coming the other way block the road jones ordered get sideways better to keep head on dazzle him he cant get past anyway carmody stopped in the middle of the road and switched on the station wagons flashers the oncoming driver rounded a bend saw them braked and slewed violently from side to side before sliding to a halt jones got out and moved toward the vehicle hed only gone three or four yards when a spurt of fire flashed from the drivers window followed instantly by the crack of a gun jones spun sideways clutching his left shoulder the other driver slammed into gear and let out the clutch for a second his tires raced griplessly on the snow then he shot forward cannoned into the jeep shunted it sideways enough for him to scrape past and accelerated away in the direction of fort mcmurray carmody tried to open his door but found it jammed the bodywork was buckled all down that side he hunked across to the other side and ran to the aid of his wounded colleague jones was conscious but bleeding badly from a wound in the top corner of his chest a large dark stain had spread out across the snow beneath his body carmody thought fast it was too cold to administer first aid to the wound if he took off any of joness clothes the man would die of exposure and shock first priority was to get him somewhere warm then to hospital he ought to call up an ambulance come on bill he said gently you gotta get up okay jones muttered im okay on your feet then carmody got him around the waist avoiding his chest and shoulders in case he made anything worse there and hoisted him upright then he propelled him gently toward the jeep and opened one of the back doors in there he said front doors jammed he got the wounded man safely in closed the door climbed aboard himself and turned up the heater to maximum then he addressed himself to the radio to his chagrin he could get nothing out of it the set was live but no signal came through something had been broken by the impact of the truck for a moment carmody considered turning and giving chase then he realized the other driver had too much start on him even with his fourwheel drive he would never overtake him in the short distance between there and fort mcmurray he was closer to the sanmobil plant in any case better get on and make contact with the bus driver who had first raised the alarm he set off as fast as he dared jones was ominously silent not answering questions about how he felt carmody set his jaw and drove through the snow five minutes later he came on the stranded minibus immediately he recognized the blackandyellow checkered mb five which he had seen and ridden in many times before beyond it a line of vehicles had piled up the drivers being kept at bay by johnson who had told them that the police were about to arrive and that no one must touch the bus until the cops had checked it out the beatenup security men were hunched in the seats of johnsons bus apparently comatose carmody sized up the position in a moment get it out of the way he ordered let everybody else through they pushed the reynolds bus to one side and waved the other vehicles past three back in the line was a sanmobil truck with two crewmen aboard the only men shore had been able to conscript immediately at that late hour over johnsons bus radio carmody called for police reinforcements and alerted the sanmobil sickbay warning them that three injured men were being brought in then he detailed one of the sanmobil men to drive his own jeep right onto the plant with jones still in it brinckman and jorgensen unsteady on their feet also climbed aboard get back in the warm carmody told them ill talk to you guys later as they drove off he turned to johnson okay so what happened i just came on the bus in the middle of the road like you saw it the two security guys were lying in front of it trying to get up i got out to see what the matter was and heard the racket of a helicopter engine right close where was it just over there ill show you he switched on a big flashlight and led the way over the frozen tundra sounded like he had a problem with the motor kept running it up and letting it die again then he did go lifted off and headed thataway north here you can see the ski marks in the flashlight beam the imprint of long heavy skis was still visible though dusted over with the snow blown about by the rotors downdraft any markings on the chopper identification carmody asked nothing it was just like a big black shadow against the sky couldnt even tell the color exactly but it looked offwhite pair of small fins near the tail too and then what happened where did the person fall a woman it was she screamed someplace over there johnson pointed not too far how high did she fall from maybe a hundred feet maybe more must be dead wed better look all the same oh my god one of the bradys killed they went up an incline into the teeth of the wind on top of the slope the ground was rounded into smooth gentle humps the flashlight beam sweeping the snow revealed nothing must have been around here said johnson doubtfully cant have been much farther or id never have seen the body at all try over there a bit they cast a little to their left suddenly carmody who had been walking on hardfrozen tundra sank to his waist in snow as he exclaimed and struggled to extricate himself from the drift johnson called listen i thought i heard something they waited catching only the whine of the wind then johnson heard the sound again a cry that sounded faint yet close at hand there it is he shouted sure as hell someone calling this way they tried to move eastward but both lunged into the deep snow again and realized that a rift in the ground ran in that direction shes in the snow cried carmody must be only way she could have survived the fall they regained the hard edge of the invisible miniature valley and followed it another twenty steps then they heard the cry again almost beneath them this time they shouted back and got an answer a few more steps brought them to the lip of a hole about a yard across that had been punched vertically downward into the drift shining the light down it they saw a bundle of powderblue snowsuit hey you mrs brady stella carmody called are you hurt no came the muffled answer im not mrs brady or stella and im not hurt just stuck who are you then corinne delorme corinne heavens sakes john carmody here hold on and well get you right out of there he sent johnson running to the truck for a shovel and a rope and in five minutes they had dug and hoisted the girl out considering she had been outdoors for more than half an hour she was in remarkably good shape mainly because the snow had insulated her and given her complete protection from the wind but as soon as they got her into the warmth of the truck cab reaction set in and she began to shudder uncontrollably carmodys first impulse was to drive her to hospital but then he changed his mind something he could not quite tell what made him favor a more devious approach the guys in the helicopter must reckon she was dead they must think they had another murder on their hands it was a milliontoone that she had fallen into the driftedup ravine rather than onto the ground five yards to either side and every bone in her body would have been broken something might be gained carmody thought if the kidnappers did not realize anyone had survived therefore he decided to move her away into safekeeping at any rate until brady and his team returned know what i want you to do carmody said to johnson drive miss delorme to the isolation unit on the plant the isolation unit when you reach the main gates have her keep down out of sight on the floor i dont want anyone to know where she is any bother say youre on a special run for mr shore okay johnson nodded you hear that corinne carmody lifted up her chin hell take you to a good place at athabasca nice and warm and comfortable out of the way too ill see you back there as soon as i can make it shock and reaction had knocked the girl to pieces for the moment and she could not answer go on then carmody told johnson drive twelve it was past midnight and still snowing heavily when jim brady arrived back in fort mcmurray but the lobby of the peter pond hotel was as crowded and bustling with activity as if it had been just after noon brady sank wearily into a chair and for the first time waved off a drink the flight from prudhoe bay had been a grim one between them brady dermott and mackenzie had uttered hardly a word a tall lean man darkmoustached and heavily tanned approached mr brady my names willoughby glad to make your acquaintance sir though not in these damnable circumstances ah the police chief brady smiled without humor and rough for you mr willoughby to have this happen in your territory i was sorry to hear that one of your men had been killed im glad to say that report was premature there was a great deal of confusion around here when we made that phone call to you the man was shot through the left lung and certainly looked bad but now the doctor says he has a more than even chance thats something brady smiled wanly again willoughby turned to two other men dyou know those two gentlemen ive met said brady mr brinckman sanmobil security chief and his deputy mr jorgensen odd for a couple of reportedly injured men you look remarkably fit to me brinckman said we dont exactly feel it like mr willoughby said things got exaggerated in the heat of the moment no broken bones no knife or gun injuries but they did knock us about a bit pete johnson the guy who raised the alarm will vouch for that said willoughby when he got there jorgensen was lying on the road out cold and brinckman was wandering around in a daze he didnt know if it was last night or last month brady turned to another man who had appeared at his side evening mr shore morning rather the brady family seem to have disturbed a lot of peoples sleep im afraid to hell with that shore was visibly upset i helped show mrs brady and your daughter around the plant yesterday that this should happen to her just as bad that this should happen to you when you and your family were virtually our guests and you were trying to help us a black day and a black eye for sanmobil maybe not all that black said dermott god knows it must be a traumatic experience to be kidnapped but i dont believe any of the four is in immediate danger were not dealing with political fanatics such as you get in europe or the mideast were up against hardheaded business men with no personal animosity against their victims they almost certainly regard them as bargaining counters he clasped and unclasped his big hands theyre going to make demands probably outrageous for the return of the captives and if those demands are met theyll honor the bargain professional kidnappers usually do in their own twisted terms its sound business practice and plain common sense brady turned to willoughby we havent really heard what happened i assume you havent had time to make wideranging inquiries afraid not theyve just vanished into thin air thin air is right helicopter as you heard they could be a few hundred miles away in any direction by this time any chance of airfield radars having picked up their flight path no sir its a million to one that they were flying below radar level besides there are more palm trees in northern alberta than there are radar stations down south its different weve alerted the stations there to keep a watch but nothings been reported so far well brady steepled his fingers sinking back in his chair it might help if we could have a brief chronological account of what happened that wont take long jay shore said yes i was the last person to see them apart from these two he pointed at brinckman and jorgensen they left in one of sanmobils minibuses with bill reynolds driving mackenzie cut in were there any phone calls before they left i wouldnt know why let me ask another question mackenzie looked at brinckman how did the kidnappers stop your bus they had a truck slewed across the road blocked it completely it couldnt have been there long theres a fair bit of traffic on that road and drivers wouldnt take kindly to being held up was there in fact any other traffic at the time i dont think so no willoughby said your point mr mackenzie plain as a pikestaff the kidnappers were tipped off they knew the precise time when reynolds bus left and when it could be expected at the interception point phone or shortwave radio even a cb would have been enough two things are for sure there was an informer and he came from sanmobil impossible shore sounded shocked nothing else makes sense said brady mackenzies right good god shore sounded outraged you make sanmobil sound like a criminals den its not a sunday school said brady heavily dermott turned back to brinckman so reynolds pulled up when he saw this truck across the road then it was all so quick there were two men lying in the road one was facedown and very still as if he were hurt real bad the other was moving hed both hands clutching at the small of his back and was rolling from side to side he seemed to be in agony two other men came running toward us well hardly running more staggering one was limping badly and he had an arm stuck inside his mackinaw jacket as if he was trying to support it both of them had a hand up in front of their faces covering their eyes dermott said didnt that strike you as odd not at all it was dark and we had our headlights on it seemed natural they should shield their eyes from the glare there was a pause then brinckman went on well this guy with the damaged arm as i thought came weaving up to my side of the bus i grabbed the firstaid box and jumped out i slipped on the ice and by the time i had my balance i saw the man had dropped his hand and was wearing a stocking mask then i saw his left arm coming up it was almost a blur but i could see he had some kind of a sap in his hand i had no time to react he fingered his forehead gingerly thats all i guess dermott crossed to him and examined the contusion on the side of his forehead nasty could have been worse though an inch or so further back and youd likely have had a fractured temple looks as if your friend was using lead shot a leather bludgeon wouldnt have done that brinckman stared at him in an odd fashion lead you reckon i should think so dermott turned to jorgensen i take it you hadnt much better luck at least i wasnt blackjacked i just thought my jaw had been broken the other guy was either a heavyweight champion or he was clutching something heavy in his fist i couldnt see he jerked open mr reynolds door flung in some kind of smoke bomb then banged the door shut again tear gas said willoughby you can see his eyes are still inflamed i got out jorgensen went on i waved my gun around but it might have been a water pistol the use it was i was blind next thing i remember pete johnson was trying to shake some sense into us so of course you dont know how reynolds and his passengers made out jim brady looked around he was taking over wheres carmody down at the station said shore still making his report pete johnsons with him theyll be here presently good brady turned back to brinckman the man who attacked you was he wearing gloves im not sure brinckman thought and then said once hed passed out of the beam of the headlights he was in pretty deep shadow and as i said it all happened so damn quickly but i dont think so your man mr jorgensen i could see his hand pretty clearly as he threw the teargas canister no no glove thank you gentlemen mr willoughby a few questions if i may go ahead willoughby cleared his throat this truck the kidnappers used you say it was stolen thats right its been identified belongs to a local garage proprietor it was known he was off on a couple of days hunting trip at this time of year your true enthusiast goes hunting any time at all events it was seen passing through the streets yesterday afternoon and we assumed the owner was taking it along for his trip which argues a fairly intimate local knowledge sure but no help to us willoughby smoothed his dark moustache fort mcmurrays no longer a village have you fingerprinted the truck inside and out being done now its a long job there are hundreds of prints may we see them of course ill have them photostatted but with respect mr brady what do you hope to achieve that we the police cant you never know brady smiled enigmatically mr dermott here is an international expert in fingerprinting i didnt know willoughby smiled at dermott who smiled back he hadnt known either brady changed his tack any chance of identifying the helicopter from the measurements of the ski marks that carmody took willoughby shook his head it was a good idea to record them but no the chances of identifying any one machine from its skiprints are extremely remote because there will almost certainly be dozens of its particular type around this is helicopter country mr brady like alaska here in northern alberta our communications are still very primitive we have no divided highways freeways in this part of the world in fact north of edmonton there are only two paved roads that reach up north between them nothing apart from ourselves and peace river and fort chipewyan there are no commercial airports in an area of two hundred thousand square miles so brady nodded you use choppers the preferred form of transport at all times in winter the only form its a good bet that an intensive air search wouldnt have a hope in hell of locating the getaway machine none ive made a bit of a study of kidnapping and i can answer you best by a comparison the worlds most kidnaphappy place is sardinia its a kind of national pastime there whenever a millionaire is snatched all the resources of the law and the italian armed forces are brought into play the navy blockades harbors and virtually every fishing village on the coast the army sets up roadblocks and specially trained troops sweep the hills the air force carries out exhaustive reconnaissance by plane and helicopter in all the years these searches have been carried out theyve never yet located a single kidnappers hideout alberta is twentyseven times larger than sardinia our resources are a fraction of theirs answer your question one begins to feel the first faint twinges of despair but tell me mr willoughby if you had four kidnapped people on your hands where would you hide them edmonton or calgary but those are towns surely cities yes and the population of each must be crowding half a million the captives wouldnt be hidden theyd be lost well brady pulled himself up in his chair he looked weary okay i suppose we have to wait word from the kidnappers before we make a move you two gentlemen he turned to brinckman and jorgensen i dont think we need keep you any longer thank you for your cooperation the two security men said their good nights and left brady hoisted himself to his feet no sign of carmody yet lets go and make ourselves more comfortable while we wait for him the desk will no doubt inform us when he arrives this way gentlemen once in the privacy of his own room armed now with a fresh drink brady seemed suddenly to shake off his exhaustion okay george he said briskly youve been holding out on us why in what way dont pussyfoot you said you were more concerned about the demands the crooks are going to make than about my family you love my family now what did you mean the first demand will be that you don and i take off for houston they must be convinced were on the verge of a breakthrough the second demand will be a ransom message to keep things within reasonable bounds they can hardly ask for more than a couple of million dollars but that would be peanuts compared with the stakes our friends are playing for third the greater stakes obviously theyll demand a fortune to cease their harassment of both prudhoe bays and sanmobils oil supplies and the increasing destruction of their equipment thats where they hold all the aces as weve seen both systems are embarrassingly vulnerable to attack for as long as the criminals identity remains undiscovered they can keep on destroying both systems piecemeal their price will be high i imagine theyll base it on the development cost of the two systems thats ten billion for starters plus the daily revenue which is the cost of over two million barrels a day five per cent of the total ten depends what the market will bear one things for sure if they demand too much and price themselves out of the market the oil companies are going to cut their losses and run leaving the insurance companies to hold the baby and it will surely be the most expensive baby in insurance history brady said querulously why didnt you bring this up downstairs i have an aversion to talking too much in crowded hotel foyers dermott leaned toward jay shore did your edmonton office send the fingerprints we asked for i have them in the safe at home good dermott nodded approval but willoughby was curious what prints shore hesitated until he received an allbutimperceptible nod from dermott and said mr brady and his men seem pretty well convinced that we have at sanmobil one or more subversives actively aiding and abetting the men trying to destroy us mr dermott particularly suspects our security staff and all those who have access to our safe willoughby shot dermott a cool quizzical look it was clear that he considered the matter one for the canadian police and not for foreign amateurs would you mind explaining why he asked coldly theyre the only suspects we have especially the men in charge of the security shifts not only do they have access to the key of the armory from which the explosives were stolen they actually carry the damn thing around with them on duty more i have good reason to suspect the security staff on the alaskan pipeline further it appears more than likely that both security staffs are working handinglove under the same boss or bosses how else can you explain how the terrorists here know the sohio bp code while the criminals there know sanmobils willoughby said this is just conjecture sure but its conjecture shading into probability isnt it a basic police philosophy to set up a theory and examine it from all sides before discarding it well weve set up our theory examined it from all sides and dont feel like discarding it willoughby frowned then said you dont trust the security men let me amplify that the majority are straight no doubt but until i know for sure theyre all under suspicion including brinckman and jorgensen including is not the word especially jesus youre talking crazy dermott after what they went through tell me what they went through they told you already willoughby had become incredulous dermott was unmoved ive only got their word for that and im pretty sure in both cases that words worthless carmody corroborated their story or rather johnson did maybe you dont trust him either ill decide that when i meet him but the point is johnson didnt corroborate the story all he said correct me if im wrong was that when he arrived on the scene he found brinckman unconscious and jorgensen staggering around thats all he said he had no more idea what went on before that than you or i do then how dyou account for their injuries injuries dermott smiled sarcastically jorgensen didnt have a mark on him brinckman did but if youd been watching him youd have seen him jump when i told him hed been struck by a leadfilled club that didnt fit there was something wrong with the scenario i suggest both men were in perfectly good health until they saw the lights of johnsons minibus approaching whereupon jorgensen acting on instructions tapped brinckman on the head just hard enough to lay him out briefly what do you mean on instructions willoughby demanded doggedly whose that remains to be discovered but you might like to know that these arent the first peculiar injuries weve come across a doctor in prudhoe bay for one has discovered that we have highly suspicious minds on this subject donald and i had to examine a murdered engineer whose finger had sustained a curious fracture the good doctor explained it away to his own apparent satisfaction but not to ours he probably gave orders that if any other such ah marginal incidents happened any security agents in the vicinity were to display proof of injuries sustained in the loyal execution of their duties such as in this case their attempts to protect those whom they were supposed to be protecting willoughby stared at him and muttered you have to be fantacizing dermott answered well see but his reply was cut short by the sudden arrival of carmody and johnson both men looked pale and exhausted a condition brady sought to remedy by providing them with very large scotches after a suitable pause for congratulation on his nights work carmody was taken through his account step by step the exercise proved disappointing until when he came to describe the scene of the helicopter ski marks he suddenly became tonguetied he broke off in midsentence and stammered say mr brady could i er could i talk with you privately well brady was somewhat taken aback by all means but what purpose would it serve these gentlemen enjoy my fullest confidence say what you want in their hearing okay then its about the girl corinne whereupon he told them the story of the rescue amazement swiftly and thoroughly woke up his audience they crowded forward listening intently maybe i was wrong carmodyended up but i just figured that if news of her survival didnt get out it might be a card up our sleeve you figured correctly jim brady said where is she then asked dermott sharply right now shes in the isolation unit at the plant she went a bit hystericalwith the reaction but shes all right dermott let out a whoosh of air and said my oh my a very original observation george brady remarked wryly do i detect a certain pleasure on your part that the young lady is alive and well and in safe hands you do said dermott then he added quickly as if feeling he had been over enthusiastic and why not point is i took a statement from her carmody went on want to hear it certainly brady said fire away the statement still existed only in carmodys notebook and so took some time to read the beginning of it merely confirmed what had been established already but then came a revelation after the holdup the girl reported one man came staggering toward us along the road one man snapped dermott halfrising out of his chair did she say one man thats what she said carmody resumed his recitation backtracking a sentence to emphasize her account i saw two men lying in the road like they were hurt one was dead still the other could move a bit then one other man came limping back toward us he had a hand up in front of his eyes mr brinckman was sitting on my right he jumped out and grabbed the firstaid box from under the seat i think he slipped and fell over then he got up again then i saw the other man straighten up and hit him he went down mr brinckman that is the other man had a stocking mask on i could see that by now he opened the door where mr reynolds was sitting and threw something into the bus thats it cried dermott smiting his fist on the coffee table we got them brady glowered at him would you favor us slower brethren with an explanation the whole thing was a frameup they told us a load of garbage they said two men came at them to make it seem more realistic that they hadnt put up any resistance now its obvious they didnt try to resist they were part of the act jorgensen just sat there watching his partner get slugged how come he wasnt much affected by the tear gas brady asked he was prepared for it of course dermott replied instantly if you screw your eyes shut and hold your breath tear gas has very little effect on you jorgensen only had to hold out for a couple of seconds before opening his own door and getting into the fresh air listen to what the girl said there were no bodies left on the road when she was dragged away every damn one of them had got up right as rain to help get the captives aboard the chopper it was only when they saw johnsons headlights coming that brinckman and jorgensen resumed their artistic poses on the road willoughby muttered a curse i believe youre right he said slowly i really do and we havent a shred of hard evidence against them no way you could dream up a charge and haul them in for preventive detention asked dermott hopefully none i wish you could said dermott id sleep happier for the rest of the night as it is i dont intend to sleep at all ive got a slight aversion to being murdered in bed brady nearly choked on his drink and what the hell does that mean just that i think an attempt will soon be made to murder me and donald and you brady looked as though he might explode but remained speechless dermott addressed him with some acerbity whenever you spoke down there in the foyer just now you were tightening another screw in your own coffin lid he turned to willoughby could you spare a guard for mr shores house tonight of course but why simple mr brady unfortunately made it clear that he wanted copies of fingerprints found on the stolen truck brinckman and jorgensen know that weve asked your people for what could be damning prints from your edmonton hq theyll discover if they havent already that the copies of their own prints which we took earlier are in the safe in mr shores house what good would it do them to get the copies brady asked edgily the originals are at police hq in edmonton how far dyou think this rot has spread said dermott the originals may still be there but they wont be much help once theyve been through a shredding machine wheres the problem asked willoughby we just print em out again on what grounds suspicion just one moderately competent lawyer and the town would be looking for a new police chief theyd refuse pointblank what could you do then point out to them which is the case that its a condition of employment at sanmobil so youd have mass resignations on your hands then what willoughby didnt answer mackenzie broke in you said i was the other grave digger yes you said the kidnappers must have been tipped off from sanmobil as to when to expect reynolds bus you were right of course but brinckman and jorgensen must have thought you meant it was they who gave the tip they may even think we can trace the call to them even though outgoing calls from the plant arent normally tapped well im sorry mackenzie shifted uneasily too bad the damage has been done and it wouldnt have helped to reproach you and mr brady in public the phone rang dermott the nearest picked it up listened briefly and said one moment i think the person you should talk to is mr shore hes right here with us he handed the phone over and listened impassively to shores half of the conversation which consisted almost entirely of muttered expletives the phone rest settled as he replaced the receiver so badly was his hand shaking his face had gone white theyve shot grigson he gasped whos grigson snapped brady sanmobils president thats all thirteen the police doctor a young man named saunders straightened and looked down at the unconscious man on the pile of blankets hell be all right eventually but thats all i can do for him now he needs the services of an orthopedic surgeon how long will it be before i can question him brady asked with the sedative ive given him itll be several hours before he comes around couldnt that damned sedative have waited a little dr saunders looked at brady with a marked lack of enthusiasm i hope for your sake you never have your shoulder and upper arm shattered the bone structure completely fragmented mr grigson was in agony and even had he been conscious i wouldnt have let you question him brady muttered something about medical dictators then looked at shore and said testily what the hell was grigson doing here anyway dammit brady hes more right to be here than you and i and the rest of us put together shore sounded shocked and angry sanmobil is the dreamcometrue of one man and one only and hes lying there before you took him nine years to turn his dream into reality and he had to fight all the way hes the president do you understand that the president mackenzie said pacifically when did he arrive yesterday afternoon flew in from europe mackenzie nodded and looked around reynolds office it wasnt a small room but it was fairly crowded apart from himself brady shore dr saunders and the unconscious grigson there were willoughby and two young men who had clearly been in the wars during the recent past one had a bandaged forehead the other an arm strapped from wrist to elbow it was to this last person steve dawson that mackenzie addressed himself you were in charge of the night shift nominally tonight there was no night shift the plants closed down i know so how many of you were here tonight yourself apart just six people he glanced down at the wounded man mr grigson was asleep in his private room along the corridor there then there was hazlitt supervisor of the night security shift and four security guards deployed around the plant tell us what happened well i was patrolling reinforcing the security team as i had nothing else to do i saw a light come on here in mr reynolds room first i thought it must be mr grigson hes a very active restless person and an erratic sleeper then i got to wondering what he could be doing because hed already spent a couple of hours with mr reynolds yesterday so quiet as i could i came along the passage to grigsons room the door was closed but not locked i went in and there he was asleep i woke him told him there were intruders in the plant and asked to borrow a gun i knew he had one because he used to practice on a little private target range hed set up here hed have none of it he produced his automatic but kept it himself he said hed had it for years and knew how to use it i couldnt argue with him after all im only twentyeight and hes crowding seventy anyway in here we found a man with the door of that safe open hed smashed corinnes desk open with a fire axe to get at the keys he was wearing a stocking mask and examining a bunch of keys he had in his hand mr grigson told him to turn around real slow and not to try anything or hed kill him then suddenly came two pistol shots right close together from behind and mr grigson pitched headlong to the floor he was wearing a white shirt and blood from his right shoulder and arm was pumping through it i could see he was hurt real bad i dropped to my knees to help him the man whod fired the shots probably figured i was going for mr grigsons gun anyway he fired at me too dawson was breathing quickly his distress evident brady poured him a scotch and handed the glass over take this dawsons smile was wan ive never had a drink in my life sir maybe youll never have another said brady agreeably but you need this one and we need your story dawson drank spluttered and coughed he screwed up his eyes and drank some more he clearly detested the stuff but his system didnt for almost immediately some color began to return to his cheeks he touched his bandaged forearm looks worse than it is the bullet just grazed me wrist all the way to elbow but very superficial stung more than anything one of the masked men forced me to help lug mr grigson to the armory on the way out i picked up two firstaid kits they didnt object they pushed us into the armory locked the door and left then i took off mr grigsons shirt and stanched the wound as best i could it took a lot of bandages there was so much blood coming i thought he was going to bleed to death he could have saunders said with certainty no question your quick action saved his life glad i was of some use dawson shuddered looked at the doctor and went on then i bandaged my own arm and had a go at the door but there was no way i could get it open i looked around and found a box full of detonators each with a fuse attached i struck one and dropped it out through one of the ventilation grilles it went off with quite a bang i must have let seven or eight of them off before hazlitt came hammering on the door and asked what the hell was going on i told him and he ran off to fetch a duplicate key dawson drank some more spluttered but less than before and put his glass down i guess thats about all and more than enough said brady with unaccustomed warmth a splendid job son he looked around the assembled group then asked sharply wheres george until then no one had noticed that dermott was missing then mackenzie said he slipped out with carmody some time back you want me to go find him leave him be said brady loftily i have little doubt our faithful bloodhound is pursuing some spoor of his own in fact the bloodhound was pursuing a fancy not a line he had taken carmody aside and whispered in his ear that he urgently wanted to question the girl corinne where was she in the isolation ward like i said carmody replied but i doubt youll find it on your own its way out by itself near dragline one want me to come with you sure thatd be real kind dermott swallowed his disappointment he wanted to go alone the instincts at work inside him made him feel uncomfortable nothing like this had happened to him in years but he had better be realistic and accept the offer of guidance by then the wind had increased as it often did late in the night and was whistling across the flat open site with a deadly chill the noise made it almost impossible to talk in the open not that anyone in his senses would remain in the open for more than the minimum time carmody had been reunited with his damaged cherokee shouting an excuse into the wind he got in first at the passenger door and slid across behind the wheel dermott heaved his massive frame in close behind him and slammed the door carmody drove steadily across an apparently unmarked plain the film of drifting snow had obscured the road and the flat ground all looked the same how the hell do you know which way to go dermott asked markers there carmody pointed as a small stumpy blackandwhite post went past with the number stencilled on it in bold figures were on highway three in a minute well turn onto highway nine altogether they drove for nearly ten minutes before lights showed up out of the darkness ahead dermott was amazed once again at the sheer size of the site by then they were four or five miles from the administration buildings the lights grew to a blaze of several windows and they pulled up outside a single long hut as they went through the door the heat hit them like a hammer as did a smell of disinfectant dermott at once began to wrestle his way out of his outdoor clothes he felt he would stifle if he kept them on for one more second they found corinne propped up on a pile of pillows looking white but very sweet in a pair of peagreen pyjamas contrary to carmodys predictions she was wide awake shed been asleep she said and had woken up thinking it was already morning what time is it anyway she asked four oclock near enough dermott answered how dyou feel fantastic not even a bruise as far as i can tell thats wonderful but my were you lucky dermott began asking routine questions to which he didnt really want the answers he wished to hell carmody would go away someplace and leave him alone with the girl what he would say to her if that happened he didnt quite know all the same it was what he wanted youve given us a real good lead you know he said enthusiastically cant say just what it was but it may be the breakthrough we need mr bradys delighted his voice tailed off as a heavy rumble suddenly shook the building jesus he looked up sharply what was that carmody was gone already out of the room and down the short passage dermott caught up with him at the outside door helicopter carmody snapped made a low pass right over the building there he is burning now way out in the blackness a red and a green light converged and then separated again as the aircraft swung around as the two men stood watching a pair of car headlamps snapped on from a point about a hundred yards in front of them the vehicle moved forward turned and stopped with its headlights steady on a patch of snow its a marker carmody cried hes gonna land quick get the girl out of here they must have come for her how in hell do they know shes here said dermott dont worry about that lets get her away moving like a sprinter carmody slipped back into the building bundled corinne up in a cocoon of blankets and carried her out to the jeep where he dumped her in the back seat dermott lumbered behind him envying his speed and hauled himself into the front without putting on any lights carmody started the engine and moved off into the inky night heading out into the open behind the parked marker vehicle a couple of hundred yards beyond it he swung around and faced in the same direction as the lights so that he and dermott could watch what happened through the windshield they sat there with the heater going full blast warm enough asked carmody over his shoulder plenty thanks corinne sounded as though she was enjoying herself ive got enough blankets to keep an elephant warm dermott wondered uneasily whether that was any sort of a joke at his expense but his speculation was cut short by the arrival of the helicopter suddenly it was there large and graywhite riding down on a storm of snow into the headlight pool the rotor flashed brilliantly in the silvery beams and the snow flew outward from the downdraft thats the one said carmody in a voice charged with excitement the getaway chopper description tallies perfectly with johnsons graywhite no markings small fins by the tail thats our baby damn as soon as the machine had landed the cars headlights cut the watchers sat blinded by the sudden darkness they saw a flashlight bobbing about in the blackness but nothing else boy will they be mad when they find youve gone carmody said happily dyou think theyre still in it corinne asked the others i mean could be easily depends where the choppers been these past few hours must have been waiting on the ground someplace come on snapped dermott lets get out of here wait a minute carmody said easily i wanna see what they do any moment now theyll be at the building there i can see them now two figures moved swiftly past the lighted windows more light showed as the door opened and shut cant we ram the helicopter or something corinne suggested stop it taking off too big said carmody immediately you notice the legs and skis higher than our roof all wed do would be to damage the landing gear which wouldnt stop them getting off besides if i know them theres a couple of guys with guns guarding the thing at least hey what was that what dermott looked at him i heard something machinery sure i did carmody looked out past dermott into the darkness open your window a minute dermott obeyed and instantly the noise was far louder a huge squealing and clanking as of some giant engine jesus christ carmody shouted the dragline its right here beside us dermott opened his door and got out his eyes accustomed to the dark could just make out the gigantic outline towering above them suddenly the noise seemed terrific good god dermott yelled into the wind its alive its moving instinctively he began to run toward the machine or rather around it for already he was alongside beside him he could hear the whine of electric motors the squeal of metal and the crunch of frosted dirt as the mighty shoe ground forward the coldness of the wind seared his lungs and made his eyes stream briefly before they froze in spite of the discomfort he felt fired by excitement and by rage for here was a final and outrageous act of sabotage taking place right on top of him in a flash of intuition he saw what they intended to drive the monster machine over the edge of the pit which it had been excavating the facts and figures that had been flung at him came crowding into his head six and a half thousand tons it could move at some yards an hour the pit was feet deep although he was no engineer he knew instinctively that if the monster went over the edge it would never come out again he came around the front of it and got another shock the edge of the pit showing as a limitless black hole was less than thirty yards away perhaps only twentyfive that meant he had a tenth of an hour six minutes to get the damn thing stopped he looked up desperately the boom disappeared into the night like an eiffel tower tilted over somehow he had to get into the cab and throw the right switches he ran back right under the thing between the shoes somewhere there must be a ladder at last he found it but as he looked up toward the cab far above him he saw someone moving there in a faint glow of light he hesitated one foot on the steel ladder wishing he had a gun and wondering whether he should go back for carmody that was the last thought that entered his head for a couple of minutes for the blow caught him squarely on the back of the neck and brilliant points of light seemed to shoot outward through his head as he slumped to the ground he came around shaking from the cold and stuck in an awkward position his hands were jammed somehow jammed behind him he needed to straighten his arms and get them back into action he strained to sort himself out and realized with a shock that his wrists were manacled together and manacled to something he gave a grunt and heaved whereupon a man spoke out of the dark behind him ah mr dermott said a voice he halfrecognized but could not place struggling will not help you are anchored to a steel ring let into concrete the ring is directly in the patch of dragline one which as you can see and hear is now only a few feet from you the controls have been preset and locked in position so that the middle of the right shoe will pass over you goodbye mr dermott you have less than two minutes to live fear cleared dermotts head bastards he roared sadistic bastards come back but even as he shouted he knew it was useless in the whistle of the wind and the monstrous grinding of the dragline his voice was nothing and carried nowhere he twisted around and discovered that he was tethered almost on the lip of the pit the edge of the black abyss was no more than a yard away in the opposite direction the front of the draglines shoe had ground remorselessly to within fifteen feet of him the front of it was coming on like a tank above him the steel tracery of the boom seemed to fill the sky with an angry black pattern dermott stopped shouting and began to fight the manacles at least there was some movement he could feel that a length of chain had been passed through the shackle on the ground he jerked it furiously back and forth in the faint hope that the chain would break but all he achieved was to chafe his wrists viciously and expose them to the cold he could feel the icy steel biting into his bare skin frostbite he thought dully but what did frostbite matter if he was going to be crushed like a beetle carmody he yelled desperately help where the hell had carmody gone why didnt he come looking dermott fought the chain again and flopped flat gasping the shoe was only twelve feet off scrunching on inch by inch the whine of the electric motors seemed to fill the night as if hell had claimed him he threw his body feverishly to left and right experimenting to see if he could get clear of the shoes line of advance nothing he tried was the slightest good the shoe was ten feet wide and he was tethered right in the middle of its track the monster had been set marching with hideous precision he lay still again panting beaten suddenly images began flashing through his mind conjured up uninvoked by the extremity of his desperation once again he witnessed the final terrifying seconds of the car crash that had killed his wife the time when an explosion had blown him clear off a rig in the gulf of mexico into the sharkowned sea all at once he became aware of a light flashing over him then someone was crouching pulling at his arms then he heard a high feminine cry corinne my god she cried whats happened oh jesus she leaped to her feet and began to run wait she screamed over her shoulder dermott saw her fall get up again and go like a greyhound around the corner of the shoe the flashlight swinging wildly in the blackness he shouted something after her but she was gone wait shed said wait what a hell of a thing to say how could he wait the shoe was scarcely ten feet from him one minute give or take a few seconds he found his eyes were full of tears though whether they were of fear or relief or gratitude or what he couldnt tell he was crying like a baby seconds were passing he began to count he got to ten and couldnt go on he had been overtaken by a horrific vision of the exact physical process of destruction that was about to annihilate him he would feed his feet and legs to the monster first or could he could he listen and watch while his ankles shins and knees were crunched and flattened on the tundra no he would have to get the end over quickly and give it his head but what would that be like for gods sake to hear his skull crack and feel that unthinkable weight impossible never he roared again carmody as if by a miracle his shout was answered headlights came boring up out of the night and swept him as the vehicle turned dermott stared incredulously as the lights came on at speed heading right for him and the front of the shoe at the last moment the vehicle slowed but not enough to stop the driver deliberately slid it into the front of the shoe using it as a lastditch barrier to stop the monsters progress there was a sharp crash and the tinkle of falling glass then the door of the jeep opened and corinne leaped out there was so little space left that dermott had all but been run over the jeeps lefthand wheels were almost on him the next thing he saw was the tires being forced bodily sideways toward him by the irresistible pressure of the draglines advance corinne had the tail gate of the jeep open she dragged out a steel box the emergency equipment and dumped it behind dermott with a crash keep still she shouted above the noise no come back a bit there keep there dermott leaned backward in the attitude she ordered speechless with tension he saw the wheels of the jeep come sideways at him again the back wheel was touching his feet already the jeep was being pushed like a toy at that rate it was going to do more harm than good it was merely acting as an extension of the shoe and would crush him before the dragline itself reached him he felt corinne struggling behind him suddenly she gave a desperate cry oh my god i cant do it im not strong enough dermotts voice returned whats happening he shouted the cutters she sobbed the bolt shears are biting into the chain but i cant get enough pressure on them its too bloody hard put one end on the ground he ordered calmly one handle on the ground then get your weight on the other he felt her try but she slipped and went down with a crash try again he yelled by then the noise of the dragline was overwhelming its roaring and grinding filled the night but suddenly a new sound a sharp crack told him that the great steel treads of the shoe had hooked into some part of the jeeps bodywork instead of being pushed back the vehicle had been gripped and held down dermott stared incredulously as the cherokee began collapsing like an eggshell the remaining headlight was snuffed out cracking snapping noises accompanied the collapse of the hood and front wheels behind him corinne gave a despairing scream i just cant do it ive got halfway through but thats all look for a hacksaw dermott shouted in the emergency pack got one she began working again frantically for dermott time seemed to have stopped he saw that the cherokees engine block had at last offered the dragline a spot of serious resistance only a spot it was true but a definite token ponderous as a dinosaur the machine lifted one foot slowly into the air as it ground the little vehicle beneath its steel sole as if in a trance dermott saw the windshield shatter the front of the roof crumple down the passenger compartment flatten right in front of him a back wheel snapped off and was squashed flat onto the ground if his arms had been free he could have reached out and touched the front of the shoe it was that close but his arms were not free i cant corinne screamed in desperation dennetts head cleared and he shouted is there an axe a what an axe yes here smash the chain with that aim for the link youve been working on i might hit you to hell with that belt it he felt the thump as she let drive the chain snatched sharply at his wrists and nearly jerked his arms from their sockets suddenly he smelled the stink of gasoline the tank had been crushed clank she brought the axe down then again when dermott twisted to see how she was doing the clawing thread of the shoe scraped down past his shoulder the thing was touching him he shrank away from the monstrous beast and brought out his last terrible idea chop my hands off he ordered quite calmly i cant go on its them or me no she gave a piercing shriek and swung the axe down with every ounce of her behind it next second she was on her knees sobbing oh my god its gone its gone dermott fought his instinct to leap up he held himself down as he struggled with the severed link the tread was bumping and bruising him now in another few moments it would hook him under as it had the car for christs sake he shouted quick miraculously his hands came free he got his arms back to their normal position and twisted sideways look out for the pit he yelled he himself was on the very lip hardly had he rolled clear of the dragline when there was a huge whumph and a roar of darkred flame shot sideways at ground level a chance spark had ignited the cars gasoline by a fluke he had rolled into the wind so that the fiery blast went the other way and left him unscathed corinne was there behind him also intact the blaze made no difference to the monsters advance the flames roared for a few seconds then went out and the dragline continued without faltering toward the brink dermott felt weak with reaction but not as weak as the girl one moment she was standing behind him the next as dermott struggled to find the words to express his gratitude to her she had collapsed in a heap on the ground he picked her up as tenderly as he knew how laid her gingerly over his shoulder in a firemans lift and began carrying her toward the stilllighted windows of the isolation quarters his eyes seemed to have gone blurred with the strain or was it just ice he scrubbed them with his free hand and saw better out in the patch of white light ahead of him the helicopter was preparing to take off lights flashing rotor spinning even as he watched it lifted off and slanted away into the sky at once the car whose lights had provided the marker moved off and accelerated once again dermott realized the unspeakable murderers had melted into the night he knew he ought to feel disappointed as it was he could concentrate on nothing except getting back into the warmth of the hut and lying down he was very close to the building going slow when he saw someone pass across the lighted windows in front of him fear seized him maybe it was one of them was he going to be shot after making such an effort before he had time to put down his burden or alter course a flashlight came on searched briefly and found his face good god dermott carmody where in hell have you been trying to ditch the chopper what about you had a had a bit of bother suddenly dermott found he could hardly talk he was about to break down take her will you he croaked ive had it with an exclamation carmody relieved him of his inert burden quick said the policeman inside they laid corinne on one bed and dermott collapsed onto another with the manacles still dangling from his wrists ring shore he gasped tell him for christs sake to switch off the power to dragline one tell him and brady to get up here like they never drove before they had turned on the floodlights to illuminate the foot depths of the pit below they had also hammered in spikes ten yards back from the lip and to these they had attached ropes so that the vertiginously inclined or the lessthansurefooted could cling to them as they peered over the edge dragline one had ended up on its nose tilted backward toward the nearvertical face at an angle of thirty degrees the massive casing appeared undamaged as did the triangular arm over which the control cables passed even the boom its enormous length stretched out horizontally across the uneven valley floor seemed undamaged at least from above brady had prudently wrapped his belaying rope three times around his mighty girth surprisingly little damage he said or so it looks i suppose some of the electric motors were wrenched free from their beds thatll be the least of our troubles jay shore looked stricken ashenfaced in the floodlights the sight of the crippled monster had far more effect on him than on any of the others its getting the damn thing out of there wouldnt it be easier to get a replacement asked brady jesus do you know what a replacement would cost at todays prices forty million dollars probably more and you dont order one up just like that if we could have one on our doorstep tomorrow im sure sanmobil would order it but it cant be done that way you cant transport a thing that size overland electric motors apart the whole caboodle comes crated in tens of thousands of pieces and it takes a team of skilled engineers months to assemble it cranes brady suggested he seemed fascinated by the sheer size of the problem or he was trying to be diverted trying not to think of his missing wife and daughter shore made a dismissive gesture with his gloved hands the biggest cranes in the world a whole battery of them couldnt lift the dragline an inch off the floor well either have to dismantle it piece by piece and raise the bits up here for reassembly or build a road from down there back up to surface level and have it towed up on bogies or perhaps under its own steam the road would have to be a very gentle gradient which would mean a length of over a mile heavily metalled on massive foundations whatever we do itll cost millions he swore at some considerable length and all this in just seven minutes work why in hell couldnt you stop it when we phoned you asked carmody the bastards knew what they were doing said shore savagely theyd gone into the generator room thrown the breaker that fed power to dragline one locked the door from the outside left the key in the lock and smashed it so thoroughly that itll need an oxyacetylene torch to open it again we just couldnt get in to shut down the power they sure knew how to cause the maximum damage and disruption with the minimum of effort said brady i suggest mr shore theres no point in our remaining here a moment longer all youre doing is twisting the knife deeper into your wound lets all get back inside and ask george what happened okay lets go shore who had supervised the construction of the dragline working along with the contractors bucyruserie seemed strangely reluctant to leave the fallen giant it was as if he were abandoning an old friend brady could appreciate how he felt but he could also appreciate how he felt himself he had become acutely conscious of the cold shore took one last look at the dragline and turned back toward the heated haven of the minibus okay he repeated automatically lets go hear dermotts story they drove the short distance back to the isolation block where they found dermott lying on a bed already being questioned by willoughby corinne was sitting on a chair in the corner of the small room looking in better shape than the man shed rescued how is he brady whispered to the nurse out in the corridor his wrists look pretty bad they got chewed up by the manacles and frostbitten as well theyre going to be real painful for the next few days theyll mend though what about his general condition exposure what are you talking about hes got the constitution of an ox by the time brady mackenzie and carmody had filed into the room the place was crammed full brady seemed much moved by the sight of his senior operative brought low with hands and forearms heavily bandaged well george he began clearing his throat heavily i am informed that you plan to survive sure do dermott grinned up at them but boy i wouldnt want to go through that again i got the story willoughby cut in brisk and businesslike he gave a quick precis of what had happened including the arrival and departure of the helicopter im sorry to say it mr shore but it seems the plant is riddled with corruption number one somebody sabotaged the generator room so that you couldnt turn the power off number two somebody else set the controls of the dragline to take it over the edge number three somebody else hit dermott and manacled him to the steel ring number four somebody else again informed the kidnappers that the girl had survived her fall out of the helicopter and was back here in the isolation unit that makes quite a lot of saboteurs for one plant too right it doesshore said bitterly you dont think the chopper came back to do the dragline job that somebody on board got out and set the controls impossible the dragline was moving before the chopper landed isnt that right mr dermott right at least no not quite but wesaw men from the chopper go straight to the building here and then we heard the dragline moving right near us the guys from the helicopter didnt have time to reach the dragline and set up the controls what id like to know is whether your family mr brady were still on board the helicopter willoughby said yes they were carmody startled them all with his sudden pronouncement and mr reynolds he was with them how dyou know jim brady asked dermott sat up abruptly i saw them thats what i was doing all the time you were involved with the dragline i made a wide circle on foot and approached the helicopter from the back there was a man armed with a machine gun guarding the ladder but i climbed up onto the skidstruts from the opposite side and got a look in through the cabin windows they were all there mrs brady stella mr reynolds how brady faltered how did they look fine just fine quite calm all of them but they werent quite as passive as they looked what dyou mean dermott asked quickly one of them managed to drop this out of the door or out of a window from his breast pocket carmody drew a brown leather billfold which he handed to brady looks like one of yours jab nicely embossed in gold my god brady took it thats jeans her middle names anneliese this was a birthday present anything in it sure is take a look with his fingers trembling a little brady opened the billfold unbuttoned a flap and drew out a small scrap of paper crowfoot lake met station he read out loud well im damned dermott was elated i knew it i knew it he kept saying i knew the bastards would overreach themselves didnt i say theyd make a major mistake through overconfidence or desperation well theyve made it somebody couldnt resist the temptation to talk jean heard the name and wrote it down great jean sheer luck i found it said carmody when the chopper took off it blew hell out of the snow and all but buried the billfold i was just having a quick look around when i saw the corner sticking up out of a drift we got it anyway said dermott what are we waiting for not so fast brady countered for one thing we dont know where crowfoot lake is oh yes we do said willoughby its up beyond the birch mountains seventy eighty miles north i know it well how do we get there dermott asked willoughby looked at him reproachfully helicopter no other way its four oclock in the morning gentlemen brady said heavily an error to pursue further tonight for one thing we are all exhausted and for another we dont have a helicopter said dermott precisely george i must say your ordeal doesnt seem to have blunted your wits any thank you dermott lay back happily maybe mr willoughby can help us in the morning i mean later this morning sure sure willoughby stood up but everyone please be careful were up against professionals their performance has been pretty impressive to date nothing would please them better than to catch one of your gentlemen mr brady or you for that matter he turned to corinne only to find she had fallen asleep sitting upright in the corner okay he said gently to mackenzie look after her but whatever you do all keep together like now said brady well all get in that bus together and drive back to town mr carmody it doesnt sound as though your vehicles too serviceable may i offer you a ride flat as a pancake said carmody wryly never saw anything to match it thank you they all piled in with shore driving but before they even reached the administration block a radio message caught them mr shore urgent it was steve dawson of the night shift we got another emergency oh no shore groaned im coming be right there dawson met them and led them straight into a room off the main corridor which held six beds and was obviously a dormitory on one of the beds lay the body of a fairhaired young man whose sightless eyes gazed at the ceiling oh my god said shore who is it dermott snapped david crawford the security man we were talking about the one we suspected thats him what happened stabbed through the heart from behind said dr saunders who was standing by the bed hes been dead some hours we only just found him how come dermott demanded isnt this the security mens dormitory one of two said saunders the others larger normally both are occupied by offduty shifts but since the shutdown the men have been living at home nobody had any cause to come in here tonight ruthless bastards said brady very low pour dead and two critically injured so far well mr willoughby youve got a murder investigation on your hands fourteen at that same morning brady and his team were the sole occupants of the hotels dining room outside the wind had gone the snow had been reduced to the occasional flurry and the sun was making a valiant effort to shine through the drifting gray cloud inside the mood was one of expectancy and suppressed excitement one things for sure said brady firmly youre not coming on this little jaunt oh yes i am dermott countered i most certainly am you try leaving me behind what can you do brady was halfscornful halfsympathetic you cant use a gun knock anybody down tie anybody up all the same ive got to be there dermott was gray from lack of sleep and the pain in his savaged wrists he could use his hands for gentle tasks but his fingers were stiff and to ease the discomfort he kept both elbows propped on the table with his forearms sticking straight up i really need two slings he muttered one for each arm why not stay here and look after your gallant savior mackenzie suggested slyly dermott colored perceptibly and grunted shes okay i guess shes being guarded sure mackenzie agreed but she might be even safer if she came with us with the rot spreading as far as it has he broke off and went back to eating as he saw willoughby the police chief approaching across the room good morning chief brady beamed at him get any sleep one hour willoughby tried to smile but his heart wasnt in it call of duty cant complain news brady announced abruptly take a seat he handed a letter across the table communication from our friends mailed yesterday in the local post office willoughby read the first paragraph without alteration of expression then he looked slowly around the watching faces and said matteroffactly one billion dollars suddenly his calm gave way one billion dollars he cried jesus he qualified the word dollars several times the sonsabitches are crazy whos going to pay attention to this kind of drivel you think its drivel dermott asked i dont probably a rather optimistic estimate of what the market will stand but not very i would think i cant believe it willoughby threw the letter down on the table a billion dollars even if they mean it how could the money be transferred without being traced to the recipient nothing simpler said mackenzie forking a pancake you could lose fort knox in the labyrinth of eurodollars and offshore funds willoughby glared at him over the breakfast cups youd actually pay this blackmailing monster not me mackenzie answered i couldnt but somebody sure enough will whod be so crazy theres no craziness involved said dermott patiently just calculating common business sense the people who stand to lose most our two governments and the major oil companies whove invested in alaska and alberta i dont know what the position is in canada but this is going to pose an intriguing problem in the states because any governmental operation in tandem with the oil companies requires congressional approval and as every schoolkid knows congress would cheerfully immolate the oil companies looks like itll make a highly diverting spectacle willoughby looked baffled read some more brady prompted the next paragraph is only a minor shock to the nervous system the policeman picked up the letter and started again so they want you out of alaska and alberta specifically south of the fortyninth parallel as predicted said brady but no mention of any ransom again as we predicted brady sounded smug youre not getting out i take it oh no im going to contact my pilot in a moment and have him file a flight plan for los angeles willoughby stared at him i thought you wanted to go to crowfoot lake we do but we dont want to advertise our destination to any illnatured persons who may be listening in therefore we file a flight plan for la okay i get it willoughby grinned what do you want me to do well brady became evasive first we need a guarantee from you you cant make deals with the police willoughbys tone suddenly hardened rubbish said brady comfortably its done all the time felons even make deals with judges in court okay so what do you want what we dont want is a company of paratroopers sure they could mop this lot up with their hands tied behind their backs but they might mop up a few wrong people too softly softly on this one finesse stealth secrecy our way or not at all you making a point or something tell me about crowfoot lake said brady its an ideal place for this sort of thing tucked right away in the hills big covered helicopter shelter right by the station a chopper would never be spotted from the air i was up there a year back investigating a reported murder which turned out to be death by misadventure couple of young city boys newly arrived at the weather station happens at the beginning of the hunting season every year without fail all the daniel boones and buffalo bills dropping like flies all over the place how bigs the lake dermott asked can a plane land on it well you can land on it willoughby paused but i dont think it would do you much good see here the lakes only two miles long so wherever you came down on it the people in the met station would be bound to hear you ive got a better idea we need one now mr brady ive got a request im in a delicate position i am the law around these parts and im supposed to know whats going on im also a blackmailer in return for guaranteeing that i can get you to the met station undetected id like some degree of participation in your expedition you cant operate without police authority and im the authority all cards very close to the chest okay but id like an official watching brief a presence i know whose presence id like mackenzie said up till then he had been chewing steadily throughout the conversation but a delicate patting of his big face with the napkin indicated that his meal was over id like carmody willoughby said thats not a bad idea ill get him right away he went off to telephone came back and said a couple of minutes fine brady turned to mackenzie don tell ferguson to go out to the airport and file a flight plan for los angeles tell him to expect people with provisions out there in just over an hour ask the kitchen to give us provisions for two or three days just food mr brady brady loftily ignored the insinuation ferguson is in charge of the commissariat hell know of any shortfalls george well need some hand compasses and i guess ammunition be generous with the ammunition willoughby said hand compasses we have in abundance what guns colts no problem dermott said well thank you tell me mr willoughby you have a deputy chief indeed and a good one good enough to be left in sole charge here sure why why dont you come with us giving us the directions is all very well but its not the same as having you on the spot dont mr dermott you tempt me you tempt me sorely from the momentary gleam of anticipation in his eyes it was clear that he spoke the truth duty alas before pleasure i have a murder investigation on my hands youve just reported zero progress there are shortcuts mr willoughby you wouldnt want us foreign amateurs to do the job for you would you now im afraid im not quite at my best you would be when we introduced you to crawfords murderer where else would he be but at crowfoot lake mr dermott forget my last remark im back at my very best ah here he is carmody looked as large and formidable as ever dermott said with mr willoughbys consent a request to make on behalf of mr brady mr mackenzie and myself as alien civilians we can only request those kidnappers youre aware they are multiple killers desperate men theyll shoot on sight and shoot to kill carmody looked around in slight puzzlement but politely said nothing dermott went on mrs brady her daughter and mr reynolds we know where theyre being held carmody almost like a man in prayer clasped his two hands lightly together and said in a suitably church like whisper boy oh boy lets go get them brady said thank you we appreciate it one hour from now okay willoughby said ill just nip back to the office and put in a call to edmonton aha i thought secrecy was the watchword it still is then may i ask you may not a surprise to be revealed at crowfoot lake or in the very close vicinity you wouldnt rob me of my surprises as the jet lifted off brady looked across the aisle to where carmody had just withdrawn a peculiar metallic device from its chamoislined leather casing it appeared to consist of a small telescope attached to a curving semicircular arm which in turn was bolted to a rectangular metal box brady said what do you have there mr carmody john please mr brady makes me feel less selfconscious we cops are used to being called many things but not mister this this is an infrared telescopic night sight these are the securing clamps fits on a rifle you can see in the dark with that a little light helps but total darkness is rare you can see the enemy but he cant see you thats the idea behind it unsporting and unfair never give the bastards a break especially mr brady if theyre pointing guns at wives and daughters brady turned to willoughby who was in the window seat and what lethal armaments are you carrying apart from the regulation revolver just this little number here he reached down and picked up a zipped leather bag some eighteen inches by ten funny shape for a gun brady said intrigued two pieces that screw together it wouldnt be a submachine gun it would there was a short silence and then brady said no chance youd be carrying a few hand grenades on you carmody gave a deprecating shrug only a few infrared sights submachine guns grenades arent those illegal could be carmody sounded vague im not sure they are at crowfoot lake youd have to ask mr willoughby about that the angle of climb had levelled off and brady nodded his thanks as mackenzie brought a daiquiri to him cruising altitude donald no way could we possibly have reached that yet maybe this is high enough youd have to ask our police chief there he nodded forward willoughby had gone up to the copilots seat and was bent over a map with ferguson doing his navigators bit i see some five minutes more passed before willoughby rose and headed back to sit by brady how long mr willoughby seventy minutes seventy minutes but i thought crowfoot was only seventy miles away we filed a flight plan for los angeles remember our first leg takes us through the radar control at calgary so were flying south were also flying low to lose the radar control at fort mcmurray when we do well circle to the west and then north after ten minutes northeast well keep low no danger of bumping into anything its pretty flat all the way he spread out a chart even the birch mountains here are really nothing of the sort the highest peak is less than twentyseven hundred feet really its just a low divide a watershed the streams on the west side flow west and northwest into the peace and birch rivers the streams to the east flow east and southeast into the athabasca river wheres crowfoot lake here just on the west side of the divide it doesnt have a name printed too small neither does deerhorn here on the east side of the divide thats where were going its a lake too but its always called just deerhorn how far from deerhorn to crowfoot six miles maybe seven far enough i hope we go into deerhorn low and we go into deerhorn slow as near stalling speed as possible the chances of our being heard at that distance are remote the only time well make any real noise is when we land the only way a fastlanding jet like this can stop on a relatively short stretch of ice is to use reverse thrust on the engine that makes quite a racket but im pretty sure that the divide between the two lakes will act as a suitable baffle im a little more concerned about the helicopter helicopter brady said carefully yes left edmonton about half an hour ago due in about an hour after us you promised me and i keep my promise no troops no police not even a peashooter just some arctic gear i want its due to arrive just after dark and without radar transmission or airfield landing lights hows he going to find his way here a signal from us by radio beacon hes only to follow his nose what worries me slightly is the noise the helicopter will make in landing its the biggest youve ever seen and the racket is corresponding of course brady showed his disquiet our friends at crowfoot lake have their own helicopter wont they hop in and come over to investigate i hope not i want them willoughby said grimly to stand trial and they wont be able to if theyre dead if they come across ill have no option but to shoot them down fair enough brady seemed unperturbed at the thought then he added you can do that we came here equipped with weapons for the express purpose of doing just that ah i was asking carmody about some of his equipment and he mentioned this infrared night sight but i thought that was for shooting people it can do that too did he mention the fact that hes also got a rifle that can switch from singleshot to automatic at the touch of a switch the combination of that the nightspot and a squirrelhunters eye makes for a fairly lethal outcome you know i have a submachine gun did i also mention that it has a special large capacity magazine the old circulardrum type and that every sixth shell is a tracer so that i can see how im doing no willoughby smiled and of course we didnt mention my own modest contribution the jumping jacks for use when were not seeing too well whats going on up above just like fireworks really except that you get no fancy explosion of color just a blinding magnesium flare that drifts down slowly on a parachute lasts only ninety seconds but if you cant accomplish what you want to in ninety seconds you should have stayed at home in the first place if i were a devout christian i could almost weep for my adversaries dont who said i was a devout christian jim nodded to carmody he really goes about killing people he leans on people what with submachine guns and highpowered rifles well use them if we have to brady said dryly you surprise me those weapons are illegal of course for police use right thats the trouble with being in a remote northern town you dont keep up as much as you might with all the notes minutes and regulations that edmonton issues every other day of course not sometime later brady winced as the jet engines went into reverse thrust even though reason told him that the decibel level was no higher than normal his apprehensive frame of mind made him feel he was listening to a continuous thunderclap of sound when they had landed he said to willoughby you could have heard that racket clear back in fort mcmurray wasnt all that bad willoughby seemed unconcerned well stretch the legs a little fresh air coming what out in that mess what mess its not even snowing and its seven miles to crowfoot lake a little exercise a little acclimatization remember what you told me back in sanmobil inside the human frame theres no room for both cold and daiquiris lets put it to the test shall we hoisted on your own petard dermott said behind him brady scowled hauled himself upright and followed willoughby to the fore end of the cabin he looked at ferguson and stopped you look worried boy that was a perfect touchdown thank you but i am as you say a little concerned aileron controls got a bit stiff as i came in to land nothing much i daresay soon locate the trouble first landing on ice and maybe i was being a little oversensitive brady followed willoughby out and looked around deerhorn was a singularly bleak and unprepossessing place snowdusted ice beneath their feet flat barren land devoid of any form of vegetation stretching away in featureless anonymity on three sides to the northeast lay a range of low hills sparsely covered with a scattering of stunted snowladen trees those are the birch mountains i told you i dont think the person who named them knew much about mountains and those are birch trees willoughby said he wasnt much of a botanist either these are alders and seven miles beyond look out stand back both men whirled around to see ferguson racing down the boarding steps clutching in one hand a cylindricallyshaped object about ten inches long and three in diameter keep clear keep clear he sprinted by them covered another fifteen yards arched his back while still running and like a cricket bowler overarmed the cylinder with a convulsive jerk of his body the cylinder had traveled not more than three yards when it exploded the blast was powerful enough to knock both brady and willoughby even at a distance of almost twenty yards off their feet for several seconds they lay where they had fallen then made their way unsteadily toward the prone figure of ferguson even as they reached him they were joined by dermott mackenzie and carmody who had been inside the plane ferguson had fallen face down on the ice gently they turned him over his face and body appeared unmarked it was difficult to tell whether or not he was breathing into the plane with him brady said warm blankets and heating pads from the red cross chest his heart may have stopped anyone here know anything about heart massage we do carmody said he picked up ferguson and headed for the plane first aid certificates three minutes later carmody still kneeling in the aisle sank back on his heels and smiled tickers going like a watch he said bloody fast watch mind you but its going good work brady said we leave him there yes dermott said even when he regains consciousness no reason why he shouldnt theres no sign of any head injury hes still going to be in shock heat pads we have in plenty thats all we can give him and probably all he requires can someone tell us what the hell happened he came running up the aisle shouting stay where you are and clutching this damned thing in his hand he was out through the door like a greyhound clearing his trap i know what happened brady said he complained that the controls were a bit stiff when he came in to land that was because whoever placed this charge did a sloppy job the thing stayed in place while we were climbing or cruising at a steady altitude but slid forward and wedged itself against the ailerons when we started to descend as we left the plane he told me he was going to look for the cause of the stiffness brady pursed his lips he found it all right he was lucky said dermott had it been a metalcased bomb the casing would have turned into shrapnel when it exploded and the backlash would have caught him not a mark on him so a plastic bomb for plastic bombs plastic fuses chemicals really you have two acids separated by some synthetic plastic barrier one of them eats through the barrier and when the two different acids meet they detonate when an acid eats its way through the plastic barrier it generates considerable heat im sure ferguson not only felt this heat but knew right away what it meant brady looked somber if we werent such a devious bunch wed have been flying at thirtythousand feet on the way up our last trip gentlemen right said dermott even flying low like we did we had the luck of the devil the drawback of a chemical detonator is that its almost impossible to get timing accuracy within ten or fifteen per cent the timing could have gone off ten minutes earlier and that would have been curtains for us our friends didnt want us out of this country they wanted us out of this world what better way to do it neatly cleanly and efficiently than have your planes tail fall off six miles up the sikorsky skycrane landed in darkness just after threethirty in the afternoon it was as willoughby had promised the biggest helicopter they had ever seen the engines cut the huge rotors idled to a standstill and there was left only the sound of a generator whining somewhere inside the massive hull telescopic steps snaked down from an opened door and two men climbed nimbly down to the ice and approached the waiting group brown the leading figure said lieutenant brown air force alleged skipper of this craft this is lieutenant vos copilot also alleged which of you gentlemen are mr willoughby and mr brady they shook hands and brown turned to introduce a third person who had joined them doctor kenmore how long can you stay willoughby asked as long as you wish very kind you have some cargo for me we have okay to unload now please brown shouted instructions brady said two requests lieutenant you have but to ask i wish we had some more of this civility in the united states air force brady said he addressed dr kenmore my pilots been hurt would you look at him of course donald the two men left for the aircraft george lieutenant this is mr dermott second request we have an excellent transmitter on our plane lieutenant but unfortunately the pilot who operates it is out of action weve got an excellent transmitter and a firstclass radio operator whos ready for action james a young man appeared at the head of the steps take mr dermott to bernie will you bernie was a bespectacled fellow seated by a huge rca transceiver dermott introduced himself and said could you get me some numbers do you think local sir albertan i mean afraid not anchorage and new york no problem we can patch in through a radio link via our edmonton hq bernies professional confidence was reassuring in the extreme numbers and names sir i have them here dermott handed over a notebook i can actually speak to those people if theyre home sure i may be gone for a few hours if i am and you get through will you ask them to hold themselves available or let me know where i can reach them of course dermott rejoined the group outside two lowprofiled vehicles were already on the ice a third was being lowered what are those dermott asked willoughby said my surprise for mr brady snowmobiles theyre not snowmobiles a blackhaired slender youth said sorry willoughby turned to dermott john lowry an expert on those machines the edmonton people sent him up to show us how to operate them theyre everythingmobiles lowry said snow roads rough terrain marshes sand you name it comparatively the american and canadian snowmobiles belong to the age of steam radio made by the firm of vplo initials only the full name is unpronounceable in oulu finland called naturally the finncat made of fiber glass unlike the ordinary snowmobile it has no skis up front that motordriven traction belt you see extends under the full length of the body where did they come from we got three to put through extended tests you know the old testtodestruction bit those are the three dermott said to willoughby nice to have friends not quite standard models lowry went on the front compartments are usually for stowage of gear weve converted them into jump seats brady said you mean i can ride in one of those right now dermott said sotto voce to willoughby test to destruction is right lowry said i should think so sir thats great just great bradys tone was hushed and reverent the prospect of trudging a fourteenmile return journey through albertan snows had held singularly little appeal to him driving is simple lowry said changing the inclination of the traction belt changes the direction of travel done by the handlebars you have forward and reverse gears and a very sophisticated touch hydraulic disc brakes it can also do forty miles an hour forty dermott said it looks as if it would be hard pushed to touch five lowry smiled forty not on rough terrain of course incidentally these dont come cheap four thousand dollars but then the unique never does i understand that you gentlemen are in a hurry first three drivers up please dr kenmore returned from the plane with mackenzie while willoughby and his two men were learning the controls of the finncats kenmore said concussion nothing very serious not the blast he must have hit his head on the ice theres a beauty of a bruise just above his right ear ill have him brought across here we have a heating and lighting generator running all the time when the motors are switched off brady said thank you doctor we appreciate it nothing may one ask where youre off to in those toys dont let young lowry hear you hed have a fit dermott said brady said please understand we dont mean to be churlish well tell you when we come back hows your expertise on shotgun wounds and bones shattered by highvelocity bullets not very extensive im afraid kenmores expression hadnt altered you plan to remedy that before the night is out i hope not bradys face was suddenly serious but it may come to that the six men left at fourthirty exactly one hour after the sikorsky had touched down the helicopters crew were there to see them go lieutenant brown said air force personnel are not as stupid as they look we know where youre going naturally good fortune he looked at the arsenal of weapons they carried ready for action shoulderslung or in holsters dr kenmore may be in for a sleepless night the finncats were everything that lowry had promised nimble manoeuvrable and possessed of remarkable traction two carried small but efficient headlamps which picked out a path through the straggling alders it said much for the dogged willingness of the little twocylinder engines that a heroically suffering brady had to get out only twice the finncat on those occasions had refused to budge another inch and walk a total of two hundred yards on the way to the gently rounded convexity which marked the watershed of the birch mountains shortly before the little army reached this point they had switched off their headlights the descent was simple but just as slow as the ascent because in the absence of lights the halfseen alders had to be negotiated with care the engines no more than idling were gratifyingly quiet willoughby called softly and the three finncats came to a halt far enough he said we cant be more than three hundred yards from the shore okay dermott agreed how many crew at the met station willoughby just two i shouldnt imagine that any harm has come to them they have to keep sending their regular radio reports any breakdown in those would have brought an official helicopter out here very quickly so the reports must have continued to go out under duress they made their way down to the lakes edge keeping their voices low sound travels as well over ice as it does over water tall reeds grew by the frozen shore carmody parted these unpacked his infrared night sight pressed his face against the rubber eye piece and switched on the crowfoot lake meteorological station consisted of only two huts one about three times the size of the other the smaller one had a variety of poles boxes and what appeared from that distance to be uncovered recording instruments on its roof this smaller hut was dark the larger presumably the living quarters showed two brightly lit windows beyond this hut was parked a large whitepainted helicopter jones passed the night sight to brady who studied the station briefly then handed the instrument on the last man to use it dermott took the sight from his eye and said as a target for tonight ive seen worse we go now we go now brady said and we dont treat them like human beings no warnings no fair play no sportsmanship shoot first questions afterward people who plant time bombs in aircraft or steal my jean and stella arent full of finer feelings or the rules of civilized warfare willoughby said fair enough but shoot to cripple not to kill i want those men to stand trial brady said of course the conduct and termination of the trial would be greatly speeded if we had their confessions in advance and how do you figure on getting those dermott asked simple george it all depends upon how intrepid youre feeling this afternoon fifteen the wicked wind hissed through the clump of alders some twenty yards behind the meteorological station the trees offered little in the way of cover but it was the best and closest that the men could find luckily the night was moonless the buildings showed as black lumps in the snowy landscape bulky as bears in their arctic gear the raiders silently watched another figure flattened to the snow inch his way up toward them propelled only by elbows and toes arrived in the shelter of the trees john carmody rose to a kneeling position theyre there he whispered reynolds and the ladies the ladies are handcuffed together but they seem all right dont look as though theyve been maltreated there are five other men in there smoking and drinking but not drinking too much a little room leads off the big one could be theres someone asleep in there but i dont think so the doors ajar and the lights on any person who wanted to sleep would have switched the light off well done boy said brady three other things sir at least three of the men are armed although none actually had a gun in his hand the whole group is sitting around the table listening to a radio theyre listening pretty hard too trying to catch something that made me think there wouldnt be another of them in the small room hed have been out there listening too could be the two station operators are in there said dermott tied up i mean i thought that too said carmody i know what theyre listening for brady whispered news of a certain jet having crashed in alberta this afternoon what was the third thing you saw all five men are wearing stocking masks dermott said which they wouldnt bother with if they intended to dispose of the hostages his husky murmur dropped to a whisper keep low keep quiet a rectangle of light had appeared at the side of the cabin a figure walked through the opened doorway and headed toward the smaller building moments later lights came on there one of them brady said hardly likely to let one of the operators stroll across there and send off an sos perfect come george this is where you earn your congressional medal of honor or whatever brady moved out traveling quickly and silently no trace of the comfortloving fat man left arriving at the main cabin door brady looked over his shoulder to check the smaller cabin the light was still on the door still closed brady turned back to the cabin door gripped the handle opened the door and walked inside in hand closely followed by dermott and mackenzie with their guns leveled brady advanced on the four stockingmasked men sitting around the table several started up keep your hands on that table he said if youre not entirely mad were just looking for an excuse to shoot you through the head one of you turn that radio off the good news youre waiting for has just arrived jim jim jean brady was on her feet youve come of course bradys voice held a curious mixture of irritation and smug selfsatisfaction you thought i wouldnt brady enterprises always delivers as his wife made to approach him he raised his left hand just a minute dont come too close these are desperate men mr reynolds stella sorry we took so long about this but dad stella was on her feet a desperate urgency in her voice dad a man drop your guns the deep voice came from the doorway dont turn around or youre dead do what the man says brady set the example within a second the other two guns had clattered to the floor stay where you are the same voice ordered billy billy didnt have to be told what to do his search was quick but thorough he stepped back and said clean boss so the door closed and a burly man appeared before them like the others he was masked sit on that bench there he waited until they had done so seated himself by the table and said watch them three of his men produced pistols and covered the three seated men he put away his gun the ladies i must say seem very disappointed they shouldnt really brady looked at them what he means is that things could be worse if his plan had worked we three would be dead as it is ferguson is critically ill and two others seriously injured he looked at the leader you placed that bomb in the plane i cant take all the credit one of my men did he lit a cigarette and stuck it through a hole in the stocking mask which had been cut out for that purpose so now i have mr jim brady and his two invaluable associates a full hand one might say brady said designed to blow our tail off at thirty thousand feet what else it would be interesting to know how youre alive were alive but one mans probably dying and two are seriously injured god man what are you a psychopathic killer not psychopathic just a businessman how come you didnt die because we landed before the bomb went off brady sounded very tired we got a report from a forest ranger saying that an offwhite helicopter had been seen in these parts nobody paid attention except us we knew you had a white helicopter how did you know that a lot of people saw it around the plant at athabasca no harm done he waved a hand all the aces in the pack whoever placed that explosive charge in my plane made a lousy job of securing it said brady sarcastically i can vouch for that he was interrupted the package moved forward and jammed the controls the tail ailerons the pilot had to land it was on the way down that we caught a glimpse of your helicopter we crashlanded on another lake pilot told us to get out he tried to remove the charge and the two others stayed with him i guess they felt they had to they were cops we know that too so they were expendable you had no compunction about murdering them too compunction is not a word in my vocabulary why did you come here for your helicopter of course we have to get those injured men to hospital why hold us up dont be so stupid we cant fly the damn thing the leader shrugged sorry about that and of course you people killed crawford crawford he turned to another of his men fred that lad you attended to yeah that was him and you critically wounded grigson sanmobils president and a policeman seems to have been an awful lot you didnt prevent and of course it was you who blew up the plant and destroyed the dragline a pity you had to kill and wound so many in the process look friend we dont play kiddies games too bad if someone gets in our way this is a mans world and we play for keeps brady bowed his head in apparent acceptance raised his hands to cross them behind his neck his fingers touched what should have been the tinkling of shattered glass was lost in the crash of three shots that sounded almost as one the masked men with the guns yelled out in agony and stared in shocked disbelief at their shattered shoulders the door was kicked violently open and carmody jumped in machine gun steady in his big hands he moved a couple of steps forward willoughby ran into the cabin carrying a revolver dermott said your words this is a mans world and we play for keeps carmody advanced on the masked leader and thrust the barrel of his machine gun hard against the mans teeth your gun by the barrel do you know what is my one ambition in life right now the man apparently did carmody pocketed the gun and turned to the remaining and unwounded member of the quintet who had his gun on the table before carmody could even speak to him brady said satisfactory mr willoughby the floor is yours an oscar mr brady they sang beautifully he advanced to the table i think you all know who i am nobody spoke you he indicated the person who had so hastily placed his gun on the table towels cotton wool bandages nobodys going to mind very much if your three friends bleed to death but personally i would sooner see them die legally after theyve been tried of course lets see your faces he walked around ripping off masks the first three aces apparently meant nothing to him the fourth belonging to the man hed just appointed to first aid duty clearly did lucky lorrigan willoughby said erstwhile helicopter pilot more recently a murderer on the run from calgary severely wounded a couple of officers in your breakout lucky didnt you my arent they going to be pleased to see you again he tore the mask from the leaders face well well would you believe it no less than frederick napier himself second senior supervisor in sanmobil security youve strayed a bit from home havent you freddie all five of you are hereby taken into arrest and charged with murder attempted murder kidnapping and industrial sabotage i dont have to remind you about your legal rights silence access to lawyers youve heard it all before not that it will do any of you the slightest good not after the beautiful way napier sang brady said would you say he was the best singer of the lot mr willoughby willoughby stroked his chin a moot point mr brady he had no idea what brady was talking about but had learned to listen when he suggested something brady said you really are extraordinarily naive napier i told you that mr willoughby and his officer were severely injured when our plane crashlanded yet you seemed hardly surprised to see them here perhaps youre just stupid perhaps events have moved too fast for your limited intellect our plane of course did not crashland no forest ranger pilot spotted you we never saw your helicopter on the way to our alleged crashlanding deerhorn the lake just over the hill there was our destination from the time we left fort mcmurray because we knew exactly where you were you sing like a lark napier but brinckman and jorgensen sing like angels theyre going to turn states evidence should get off with five years brinckman and jorgensen napier jumped to his feet then collapsed back in his chair with a whoosh of expelled air as the barrel of carmodys machine gun caught him in the solar plexus he sat there gasping for breath brinckman and jorgensen he wheezed and had just started in on a resume of their antecedents when carmodys gun caught him lightly on the side of the head ladies present carmody said pleasantly states evidence napier said huskily five years good god man brinckmans my boss jorgensens his lieutenant im only number three on the totem pole brinckman is the one who fixes everything arranges everything gives all the orders i just do what im told states evidence five years brinckman willoughby said would you swear to that in court too damn right i would treacherous bastard napier stared into space his mouth no more than a compressed white line willoughby said and before all those witnesses too napier shifted his gaze from faraway places towilloughby his expression was one of total incomprehension mr brady was quite right napier you really are a rather simple person but as a singer you just got raised to the rank of angel until this moment we didnt have a single solitary thing we could pin on either of them thanks to you theyll join you behind bars tonight it should be a fascinating gettogether the big white helicopter touched down on deerhorn at five fortyfive in the afternoon lucky lorrigan with a muzzle of carmodys gun screwing into his ear had flown the sevenminute hop in impeccable style the two meteorological station operators had been freed and when told why had willingly sworn themselves to secrecy for the next twentyfour hours brady was first off the plane followed by dermott and the wounded men a curious reception committee from the sikorsky headed by lieutenant fraser was there to greet them fraser said that was fast work congratulations no problems routine exercise brady was a master of the throwaway phrase some for dr kenmore though three silly people got in the way of flying bullets kenmore said ill fix them up mr brady thanks but you look mighty young to me to be an orthopedic surgeon so its like that patch them up as best you can nobodys going to take your license away from you if they peg out during the night i understand the young doctors eyes widened as the women descended the steps well well brady enterprises brady said with a smirk in his voice associates only with the best and the most beautiful well mr lowry well have to see about getting back those splendid machines of yours and now lieutenant if you will excuse me a matter of some urgency he had taken some few steps toward his aircraft when the lieutenant overtook him it got pretty cold in your plane mr brady so i took the liberty of transferring some essential supplies to our nice warm sikorsky brady turned ninety degrees without breaking stride and headed purposefully toward the skycrane he patted lieutenant fraser on the arm lieutenant a very promising future lies ahead of you dermott said to bernie the sikorsky radio operator any luck got through to all three sir your new york number and one of your anchorage numbers a mr morrison said they had no information for you yet and probably wouldnt have for the next twentyfour hours your other anchorage number a dr parker asked if you would be kind enough to call him back now would you get him please no bother bernie smiled and then youd like some privacy brady had been reduced to the discomfort of sitting on a packing box admittedly a large one in the fore part of the sikorskys cavernous hold he appeared not to be suffering too much he was speaking to a fully conscious ferguson youve made it son youre damned lucky but not nearly as lucky as we are thanks entirely to you well discuss this ah later in private sorry your eyes are still troubling you just a damned nuisance mr brady otherwise i could fly the plane with no trouble youre not flying anything anywhere kenmore said it may be two or three days before we can be sure that your eyesight is stabilized i know a specialist in edmonton thank you how are our wounded heroes by the way theyll live ah well we cant have everything two and a half hours later brady was again presiding over a cheerful company but this time rather more comfortably ensconced in the best armchair in the peter pond hotel doubtless inspired by the thought of the enormous fees he would extort he was positively maecenaslike in his hospitality reynolds had been joined by his wife the atmosphere was festive but dermott and mackenzie didnt seem very jovial dermott approached the beaming brady he wasnt beaming at anything in particular but was just sitting there wifes hand in his left daiquiri in his right and said donald and i would like to slip away for a bit sir do you mind of course not do you need me minor matters only go right ahead george the beam which had faded slightly lit up again brady would now have the field to himself and it was possible that his retailing of recent events might vary slightly from the one he would have given if his two lieutenants had been present he glanced at his watch eightthirty half an hour or so about that on their way out they stopped by willoughbys chair dermott smiled at a rather mistyeyed mrs reynolds then said to willoughby brinckman and jorgensen willoughby smiled happily are guests of the canadian government heard fifteen minutes ago look gentlemen i dont know how to wait mackenzie smiled we arent through with you yet some more matters to be attended to not in alberta but we have to cast a net again can we see you in the morning when late may we call you dermott and mackenzie spent not half an hour but an hour and a half in dermotts room talking planning and mostly telephoning when they returned to the lounge brady greeted them effusively he was totally unaware of how much time had elapsed the number of the company had increased dermott and mackenzie were introduced to a couple who turned out to be the mayor and his wife jay shore had returned from the plant and they were introduced to his wife too they were introduced to a charming lady who turned out to be mrs willoughby after that they were introduced to two other couples whose names they failed to catch jim brady was spreading his wings that night willoughby came up and spoke to them quietly another item although its just another unnecessary nail in the coffin we retrieved the prints from shores house and compared them to the ones in the kidnap truck two matching sets were found napier and lucky lorrigans at eleven oclock dermott and mackenzie approached brady again he was still in sparkling form his tolerance for rum passed mortal understanding dermott said mr brady were bushed were off off bed ill be damned he glanced at his watch the nights young he made a grandiloquent gesture with his arm look at them are they thinking of bed jean gave dermott a rueful smile which indicated that she was thinking of just that herself theyre happy theyre enjoying themselves just look wearily they looked no question brady had the right of it they were enjoying themselves not least young carmody who had discreetly withdrawn from the main body of the group to sit in a corner with stella we wish you luck you want us to collapse dramatically in front of all your guests thats the trouble with you young people of today no getupandgo when the occasion arose brady could conveniently forget that his associates and himself were of the same generation no stamina not fit he seemed totally unaware of how preposterous he sounded but they knew he wasnt wed like to talk to you in the morning you would he eyed them both suspiciously when when youre fit unlimited stamina the lark singing damn it all when noon brady relaxed in that case why dont you stay dermott went and kissed jean good night mackenzie did the same they made the rounds with good nights and left they got to bed just after one in the morning the previous two hours had been spent on the telephone dermott awoke at seventhirty by eight he was showered shaved eating off his breakfast tray and busy on the telephone at nine he was joined by mackenzie at ten they were both closeted with willoughby at noon they joined brady at his breakfast table and explained what they had in mind brady chewed through the last of his ham omelette which had originally been the size of a soup plate then shook his head in a decisive fashion its out of the question its all over okay there are a few stray threads in alaska but who am i to devote my time to that sort of small potatoes so it is in order if donald and i resign fortunately for brady he was neither eating nor drinking at the moment so he had nothing to choke over resign what the hell do you mean its donalds fault really half scots you know he hates to see good money being thrown away money being thrown away momentarily brady looked almost appalled but his recovery was swift whats this nonsense how much are you charging sanmobil for our services well im not one to prey on the misfortunes of others a half million i guess plus expenses of course in that case i reckon donald and i would rate a quarter of a million for picking up stray threads and small potatoes brady was silent his eyes fixed on something beyond infinity with your name dermott persisted one can see no reason why the prudhoe bay oil companies shouldnt also come up with a half million plus of course expenses brady brought his gaze back from outer space to the diningroom table its not as you may think that im not at my best in the morning its just that i have so much on my mind what time is this meeting tonight sixteen the meeting was held that evening in the sanmobil canteen which was drably lit and decorated in dingy cream and peagreen nevertheless the room had much to recommend it for such a gathering not least the fact that it was large and warm and a place from which the public could easily be excluded the tables and chairs had been rearranged so that the men conducting the proceedings sat in a line on stage as it were facing down the long room the rest of the seats had been set out in two blocks divided by a gangway in the middle of the top table sat willoughby acting as host in his own parish on his right was hamish black general manager of bp sohio alaska who had flown down from prudhoe bay to be present on willoughbys left sat brady overflowing a rickety wooden chair and beside him were his two trusty henchmen down on the floor the home team was represented by bill reynolds jay shore and a handful of others on the alaskan side there were eight men among them dr blake gaunt and cadaverous as ever ffoulkes the anchorage police chief and parker the police forensic surgeon morrison of the fbi had come on the same plane and behind him sat four of his agents at the back of the room were nearly thirty other men from sanmobil brought in so that they could hear the full report of what had been happening finally in an unobtrusive position at one side john carmody and a couple of fellow policemen occupied a flat bench with their backs against the wall and sandwiched between them was corinne delorme looking small and wan and rather scared willoughby stood up to open the proceedings good evening ladies and gentlemen as the senior representative of the law here in alberta and as your nominal host i would like to thank all you people whove been good enough to come from places as far afield as prudhoe bay anchorage and even new york a murmur went around the room thats right willoughby confirmed two gentlemen at least have come all the way from new york now the purpose of this meeting is to explain to the senior employees of sanmobil and bp sohio just whats been going on these past few days and if possible to clear up the few final questions to which we dont yet have the answers i call on mr hamish black general manager of bp sohio alaska to put you in the picture black rose to his feet all disapproval and severity yet when he began to speak he seemed to acquire a stature and authority that thoroughly surprised brady and his associates i hardly need tell you he began that both the alaskan pipeline and the sanmobil tarsands complex here at athabasca have recently been subjected to deadly and intensive industrial sabotage the action effectively closed down the flow of oil from both centers and in the process of the sabotage at least four innocent people have been murdered while several others have been gravely injured we devoutly hope that the savage and brutal attacks are at an end they certainly seem to be so in alberta and for this the sole credit goes to the investigation team of brady enterprises headed by mr jim brady himself and his two senior assistants mr dermott and mr mackenzie with the ghost of a smile softening the line of his pencil moustache black indicated the brady team to his dismay brady found himself blushing for the first time in years he ground his teeth and contrived to look sideways at dermott without moving his head the guy theyd treated like dirt was praising them unfortunately black went on no such happy conclusion has been reached in alaska up there we have no positive guarantee that the sabotage is at an end for the simple reason that the individuals responsible for the criminal activity have not yet been brought to justice brady enterprises have been as deeply involved in making inquiries in alaska as they have here and since they are the only people with an overall view of the present position i should like to call upon mr brady himself to give us a report brady heaved himself upright and cleared his throat thank you mr black ladies and gentlemen i promise to be as brief as possible and to waste none of your time first i will ask for a word from mr john young who is director of city services a federally backed investigative agency in new york one of its functions is to oversee and regulate the conduct of private detective and investigative agencies in the state of new york mr young in the front row of the sanmobil team seats a lean baldheaded man with thickrimmed glasses rose to his feet he looked at the papers in his hand smiled at brady and turning to face the body of the hall he began city services was asked by brady enterprises this was with governmental consent to investigate the background of a private security agency owned and run by one samuel bronowski who later became head of security on the alaskan pipeline apart from the fact that an unusually large percentage of valuables entrusted to the firms safekeeping had been missing for readily explainable reasons we found no evidence of any outright misconduct but i was further asked to find out the names and identities of any of bronowskis associates who left the firm at about the same time as he did that is to say within six months either side of his departure date we came up with ten names not a particularly high wastage rate in such an agency but brady enterprises were particularly interested in four of them here young consulted the notes in his right hand their names are houston brinckman jorgensen and napier young sat down and brady rose again to thank him well he continued for those of you who do not already know three of the four just mentioned are already in jail charged with various crimes from murder downward the other man and bronowski you can now see for yourselves he made a small sign to willoughby who nodded to one of his uniformed men at the door next moment the door opened to admit bronowski and houston manacled together they were hustled to seats in the front row of the alaska side stalls bronowski still sported his impressive head bandage and beneath it his broad strong face was sullen so brady purred i promised we would not waste time we have established that at least two security agents from the pipeline and three from sanmobil were old acquaintances that they were acting in concert organized widespread sabotage exchanged codes and were responsible for murder we have also established that bronowski was the undisputed leader these facts have been put on record by many witnesses who will testify in court but let us move on i would like to call on dr parker yes well parker paused reflectively i act in a forensic capacity for the police at anchorage mr dermott brought down three corpses from prudhole bay i examined one of them an engineer who had been murdered in pump station number four he had sustained a most unusual injury to his right index finger i understand that dr blake here attributed this to the force of the explosion which destroyed the pump station i have to disagree the finger was deliberately broken there is no other way it could have happened mr dermott dermott stood up mr mackenzie and i have a theory its our belief that this dead engineer was carrying a pistol when he was held up by the people who had planted the explosives we further believe that he recognized his assailants and they knowing this killed him before he could use his gun in selfdefense we also believe that his dead finger locked over the trigger grip that would be possible doctor indeed quite possible we surmise the criminals had to break the mans forefinger to get the gun away a dead man found with a gun in his hand would have raised serious doubts as to whether the explosion had been a genuine accident further papers seen in his coat pocket were later missing neither my colleagues nor i know what those papers were we can only assume that he had accumulated incriminating evidence against someone which would account for the fact that he was carrying a gun dermott paused then he said i would like to ask mr brady to discuss the vital question of who is ultimately responsible for this spate of crime brady hoisted himself upright again mr carmody would you be so kind as to stand by bronowski i am aware that he is handcuffed but im also convinced hes a man of violence dr parker dr parker rose leisurely and walked across to bronowski carmody was already there the doctor said to him get behind him and hold his arms carmody did so bronowski yelped with pain as parker reached forward and ripped away the bandage that covered his forehead and temple the doctor peered closely at the temple touched it then straightened this is a delicate area of the head he said a blow such as he is alleged to have received would have left a bruise for at least a fortnight probably longer as you can see there is no such bruise no sign of any contusion in other words he said pausing for effect he was never struck brady said things look rather black for you dr blake theyre going to look a damn sight blacker parker said he had resumed his place mr dermott in anchorage made what i then regarded as an extremely strange request i no longer regard it as such despite the fact that you dr blake had carried out an autopsy on john finlayson mr dermott asked me to carry out another unheard of but as it turns out justified your certificate said that finlayson had been struck on the occiput with some form of loaded salt bag as in the case of bronowski there was no sign of any contusion the skin had been somewhat abraded which could have occurred before or after death what is important is that one of my younger associates discovered traces of ethyl oxide in the blood it is difficult to conceal such trace elements on closer examination we discovered a tiny blue puncture just under the rib cage further investigation proved beyond any doubt that a needle or probe had been inserted through this puncture and pierced the heart death would have been pretty well instantaneous in other words finlayson had been anesthetized then murdered i do not think there is one medical authority in either of our countries who would dispute my findings brady said comment dr blake he appeared to have none the fbis morrison said i have hes not a doctor he was trained in an english university and flung out in his fourth year for reasons as yet undisclosed but which im sure we can readily ascertain no doubt he learned enough in that time to use a needle or probe brady said comment blake again he had none i do not know but im pretty sure that this is what happened dermott said finlayson came across bronowski and houston tampering with the fingerprint card index i suggest that bronowski was removing his own prints from the file i suggest he was substituting some other prints for his own whose i do not know but that again we can ascertain the next suggestion is straightforward and obvious the prints on an anchorage telephone booth were bronowskis we have only to take his prints to confirm brady said comment bronowski silence well brady looked around the room guilty as hell that almost wraps it up he stood up as if to end the meeting but not quite none of the accused has the intelligence or knowledge to mastermind an operation of this nature this required a highly specialized degree of knowledge someone who had the inside track willoughby asked we have an idea of this persons identity i know who he is but i think ill let mr morrison and the fbi take over here my colleagues and i had our suspicions as to the identity of the mastermind behind the killings and sabotage both here and in alaska but it was mr morrison who got the proof i got the proof morrison said but that was only because my nose was pointed in the right direction bronowski claimed to have owned and maintains he still owns an investigative agency in new york this is untrue as mr young discovered in the course of his investigations bronowski only acted in the capacity of a front man a figurehead the real source of power the owner was someone else right bronowski bronowski scowled clamped his lips and kept his counsel no matter at least you dont deny it mr young accompanied by new york detectives and armed with a search warrant examined the firms private correspondence the firm had been so naive as to file away instead of destroying fatally damaging and incriminating evidence this evidence not only revealed the identity of the true owner it also revealed the astonishing fact that this same individual owned no fewer than four other protection or investigative agencies in the city of new york morrison glanced to one side mr willoughby willoughby nodded and looked aside carmody nodded rose and walked leisurely to the back of the room this owner morrison went on was an absentee landlord but only during the past couple of years before that he was on the new york stock exchange and an investment counsellor on wall street he wasnt too successful not really a financial man at all though he liked money more like a bull in a china shop too extroverted the landlords most recent absence was caused by the fact that he had become busy elsewhere he was busy in athabasca at an inconvenient distance from wall street he was in fact working for sanmobil he was busy being sanmobils operations manager dont move keep quite still carmody leaned over reynolds shoulder and relieved him of a silenced automatic which he had begun to slide out of a shoulder holster you could cause yourself an injury whats a lawabiding citizen like you doing carrying a gun gasps of surprise broke out all around the room almost everybody stood up to get a better view reynolds face normally so rubicund had gone gray making an unpleasant clash with his corncolored hair he sat as if paralyzed while carmody slipped manacles on him this is in no way a trial brady announced so i do not propose to question him nor will i adumbrate the factors that made him turn the way he did save to say that his main grievance appears to have been that he had been passed over for promotion he found his way ahead blocked he conceived the idea that outsiders were always brought into the firm to occupy senior positions you may think his reaction a little excessive brady stopped he had at this point intended to have a dig at black by mentioning the oil companies practice of installing accountants in senior management positions as things had turned out however he decided against it and merely asked black to sum up this black did in a surprisingly warm and human manner again he praised brady enterprises effusively and he ended by reassuring everyone present that the campaign of terror and destruction was over the meeting was closed police officers escorted reynolds blake bronowski and houston away to the cells and everyone else began to disperse brady feeling unwontedly nervous sidled up to black my apologies he muttered must offer you my sincere apologies my associates were infernally rude to you that time no cause for it my dear fellow not at all said black magnanimously i daresay it was my fault anyway i hardly realized what deep trouble we were in i thought your investigations were superfluous now i know different id like to apologize too muttered dermott stiff with embarrassment trouble was if i may say so you seemed so uncooperative it was the cost that frightened me dont forget im an accountant by training to the amazement of the brady team black actually laughed they laughed too from sheer release of tension and the next second black caught them neatly on the rebound well now mr brady he said briskly as to the question of your fee oh now brady spluttered caught right offbalance i assumed all along i would negotiate that with your london office no need im glad to say black was all breezy sunshine london has empowered me to deal directly with you our chairman felt that despite your close friendship or perhaps because of it i should settle this thats well no i mean i i never discuss fees myself brady sounded lame and knew it but he pulled himself together fast i have to consult my accountant even if you dont forty love and black to serve muttered dermott as they moved away he was about to go for his coat when down one side of the room he spotted corinne delorme still sitting on a bench as if in a trance he went along to her come on honey he said gently time to go i just cant believe it she said its not possible well it happened are you upset not really no i didnt care that much about him its just that i kind of got used to believing what he said i know one does but you saw how devious he was anyone who had himself kidnapped to add verisimilitude to the proceedings anyone who does that is hardly straight forward i guess thats right all those murders too oh god its awful it was awful but its over coming i suppose so she stood up and dermott helped her into her coat you and i were the two luckiest people in the whole damn business he said we both ought to be dead without you i would be suddenly her blank eyes lit up and she smiled dermott smiled back what are you going to do now youve got no boss to work for i dont know find another job i suppose not many good jobs in fort mcmurray why not come south and work for me for you her eyes widened i havent thought of that think of it now shall we go okay id offer you my arm if it wasnt still so damned sore and i might even take it she looked upward and snuggled close against him as they went out through the door the sight seemed to occasion the most immense merriment in brady and his one remaining associate they both rolled in their seats like clowns giving vent to noisy explosions stay me with flagons donald cried brady as he recovered i am seriously in need of liquids i was beginning to think we had a romance on our hands the end
