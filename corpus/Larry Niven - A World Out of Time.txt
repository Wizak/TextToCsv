 i once there was a dead man he had been waiting for two hundred years inside a coffin suitably labeled whose outer shell held liquid nitrogen there were frozen clumps of cancer all through his frozen body he had had it bad he was waiting for medical science to find him a cure he waited in vain most varieties of cancer could be cured now but no cure existed for the billions of cell walls ruptured by expanding crystals of ice he had known the risk he had gambled anyway why not hed been dying the vaults held over a million of these frozen bodies why not theyd been dying later there came a young criminal his name is forgotten and his crime is secret but it must have been a terrible one the state wiped his personality for it afterward he was a dead man still warm still breathing even reasonably healthybut empty the state had use for an empty man corbell woke on a hard table aching as if he had slept too long in one position he stared incuriously at a white ceiling memories floated up to him of a doublewailed coffin and sleep and pain the pain was gone he sat up at once and flapped his arms wildly for balance everything felt wrong his arms would not swing right his body was too light his head bobbed strangely on a thin neck he reached frantically for the nearest support which turned out to be a blond young man in a white jumpsuit corbell missed his grip his arms were shorter than he had expected he toppled on his side shook his head and sat up more carefully his arms scrawny knobbyand not his the man in the jumpsuit said are you all right yeah said corbell my god what have they done to me i thought i wa s ready for anything but this he fought rising panic his throat was rusty but that was all right this was certainly somebody elses body but it didnt seem to have cancer either whats the date how long has it been a quick recovery the checker gave him a plus twentyone ninety your dating you wont have to worry about our dating that sounded ominous cautiously corbell postponed the obvious next question whats happened to me and asked instead why not you wont be joining our society no what then several professions are open to youa limited choice if you dont qualify for any of them well try someone else corbell sat on the edge of the hard operating table his body seemed younger more limber definitely thinner not very clean he was acutely aware that his abdomen did not hurt no matter how he moved he asked and what happens to me ive never learned how to answer that question call it a problem in metaphysics said the checker let me detail whats happened to you so far and then you can decide for yourself there was an empty man still breathing and as healthy as most of society in the year but empty the electrical patterns in the brain the worn paths of nervous reflex the memories the person had all been wiped away as penalty for an unnamed crime and there was this frozen thing your newstapers called you people corpsicles said the blond man i never understood what the tapes meant by that it comes from popsicle frozen sherbet corbell had used the word himself before he became one of them one of the corpsicles the frozen dead frozen within a corpsicles frozen brain were electrical patterns that could be recorded the process would warm the brain and destroy most of the patterns but that hardly mattered because other things must be done too personality was not all in the brain memory rna was concentrated in the brain but it ran all through the nerves and the blood in corbells case the clumps of cancer had to be cut away thea the rna could be leeched out of what was left the operation would have left nothing like a human being corbell gathered more like bloody mush whats been done to you is not the kind of thing that can be done twice the checker told him you get one chance and this is it if you dont work out well terminate and try someone else the vaults are full of corpsicles you mean youd wipe my personality corbell said unsteadily but i havent committed a crime dont i have any rights the checker looked stunned then he laughed i thought id explained the man you think you are is dead corbells will was probated long ago his widow damn it i left money to myself no good though the man still smiled his face was impersonal remote unreachable a vet smiles reassuringly at a cat due to be fixed a dead man cant own property that was settled in the courts long ago it wasnt fair to the heirs corbell jerked an unexpectedly bony thumb at his bony chest but im alive now not in law you can earn your new life the state will give you a new birth certificate and citizenship if you give the state good reason corbell sat for a moment absorbing that then he got off the table lets get started then what do you need to know about me your name jerome branch corbell call me pierce the checker did not offer to shake hands neither did corbell perhaps because he sensed the man would not respond perhaps because they were both noticeably overdue for a bath im your checker do you like people im just asking well test you in detail later i get along with the people around me but i like my privacy the checker frowned that narrows it more than you might think the isolationism you called privacy waswell a passing fad we dont have the room for it or the inclination either we cant send you to a colony world i might make a good colonist i like travel youd make terrible breeding stock remember the genes arent yours no you get one choice corbell rammer rammer im afraid so thats the first strange word youve used since i woke up in facthasnt the language changed at all you dont even have an accent part of my profession i learned your speech through rna training many years ago youll learn your trade the same way if you get that far youll be amazed how fast you learn with rna shots to help you along but youd better be right about liking your privacy corbell and about liking to travel too can you take orders i was in the army what does that mean means yes good do you like strange places and faraway people or vice versa both corbell smiled hopefully ive raised buildings all over the world can the world use another architect no do you feel that the state owes you something there could be but one answer to that no but you had yourself frozen you must have felt that the future owed you something not at all it was a good risk i was dying ah the checker looked him over thoughtfully if you had something to believe in perhaps dying wouldnt mean so much corbell said nothing they gave him a short wordassociation test in english that test made corbell suspect that a good many corpsicles must date from near his own death in they took a blood sample then exercised him to exhaustion and took another blood sample they tested his pain threshold by direct nerve stimulationexcruciatingly unpleasantthen took another blood sample they gave him a chinese puzzle and told him to take it apart pierce then informed him that the testing was over after all we already know the state of your health then why the blood samples the checker looked at him for a moment you tell me something about that look gave corbell the creepy feeling that he was on trial for his life the feeling might have been caused only by the checkers rather narrow features his icy blue gaze and abstracted smile still pierce had stayed with him all through the testing watching him as if corbells behavior was a reflection on pierces judgment corbell thought carefully before he spoke you have to know how far ill go before i quit you can analyze the blood samples for adrenalin and fatigue poisons to find out just how much i was hurting just how tired i really was thats right said the checker corbell had survived again he would have given up much earlier on the pain test but at some point pierce had mentioned that corbell was the fourth corpsicle personality to be tested in that empty body he remembered going to sleep that last time two hundred and twenty years ago his family and friends had been all around him acting like mourners he had chosen the coffin paid for vault space and made out his last will and testament but he had not thought of it as dying he had been given a shot the eternal pain had drifted away in a soft haze he had gone to sleep he had drifted off wondering about the future wondering what he would wake to a vault into the unknown world government interplanetary spacecraft clean fusion power strange clothing body paints nudism new principles of architecture floating houses arcologies or crowding poverty all the fuels used up power provided by cheap labor hed thought of those but they didnt worry him the world could not afford to wake him if it was that poor the world he dreamed of in those last moments was a rich world able to support such luxuries as jaybee corbell it looked like he wasnt going to see too damn much of it someone led him away after the testing the guard walked with a meaty hand wrapped around corbells thin upper arm leg irons would have been no more effective had corbell thought of escaping the guard took him up a narrow staircase to the roof the noon sun blazed in a blue sky that shaded to yellow then brown at the horizon green plants grew in closepacked rows on parts of the roof elsewhere many sheets of something glassy were exposed to the sunlight corbell caught one glimpse of the world from a bridge between two roofs it was a cityscape of closepacked buildings all of the same cold cubistic design and corbell was impossibly high on a narrow strip of concrete with no guardrails at all he froze he stopped breathing the guard did not speak he tugged at corbells arm not hard and watched to see what he would do corbell pulled himself together and went on the room was all bunks two walls of bunks with a gap between the light was cool and artificial but outside it was nearly noon could they be expecting him to sleep but jet lag had never bothered corbell the room was big a thousand bunks big most of the bunks were full a few occupants watched incuriously as the guard showed corbell which bunk was his it was the bottommost in a stack of six corbell had to drop to his knees and roll to get into it the bedclothes were strange silky and very smooth even slipperythe only touch of luxury about the place but there was no top sheet nothing to cover him he lay on his side looking out at the dormitory from near floor level now finally he could let himself think im alive earlier it might have been a fatal distraction hed been holding it back i made it im alive and young that wasnt even in the contract but he thought reluctantly because it would not stay buried who is it thats alive some kind of composite a criminal rehabilitated with the aid of some spare chemicals and an electric brainwashing device no jaybee corbell is alive and well if a trifle confused once he had had that rare ability he could go to sleep anywhere anytime but sleep was very far from him now he watched and tried to learn three things were shocking about that place one was the smell apparently perfumes and deodorants had been another passing fad pierce had been overdue for a bath so was the new improved corbell here the smell was rich the second was the loving bunks four of them in a vertical stack twice as wide as the singles and with thicker mattresses the doubles were for loving not sleeping what shocked corbell was that they were right out in the open not hidden by so much as a gauze curtain the same was true of the toilets how can they live like this corbell rubbed his nose and jumpedand cursed at himself for jumping his own nose had been big and fleshy and somewhat shapeless but the nose he now rubbed automatically when trying to think was small and narrow with a straight sharp edge he might very well get used to the smell and everything else before he got used to his own nose eventually he slept some time after dusk a man came for him a broad brawny type wearing a gray jumper and a broad expressionless face the guard was not one to waste words he found corbells bunk pulled corbell out by one arm and led him stumbling away corbell was facing pierce before he was fully awake in annoyance he asked doesnt anyone else speak english no said the checker pierce and the guard guided corbell to a comfortable armchair facing a wide curved screen they put padded earphones on him they set a plastic bottle of clear fluid on a shelf over his head corbell noticed a clear plastic tube tipped with a hypodermic needle breakfast pierce missed the sarcasm youll have one meal each dayafter learning period and exercise he inserted the needle into a vein in corbells arm he covered the wound with a blob of what might have been silly putty corbell watched it all without emotion if he had ever been afraid of needles the months of pain and cancer had worked it out of him a needle was surcease freedom from pain for a while learn now said pierce this knob controls speed the volume is set for your hearing you may replay any section once dont worry about your arm you cant pull the tube loose theres something i wanted to ask you only i couldnt remember the word whats a rammer starship pilot corbell studied the checkers face without profit youre kidding no learn now the checker turned on corbells screen and went away ii a rammer was the pilot of a starship the starships were bussard ramjets they caught interstellar hydrogen in immaterial nets of electromagnetic force compressed and guided it into a ring of pinched force fields and there burned it in fusion fire potentially there was no limit at all on the speed of a bussard ramjet the ships were enormously powerful enormously complex enormously expensive corbell thought it incredible that the state would trust so much value such devastating power and mass to one man to a man two centuries dead why corbell was an architect not an astronaut it was news to him that the concept of the bussard ramjet predated his own death he had watched the apollo xi and xiii ifights on televi sion and that had been the extent of his interest in spaceffight until now now his life depended on his rammer career he never doubted it that was what kept corbell in front of the screen with the earphones on his head for fourteen hours that first day he was afraid he might be tested he didnt understand all he was supposed to learn but he was not tested either the second day he began to get interested by the third day he was fascinated things he had never understoodrelativity and magnetic theory and abstract mathematicshe now grasped intuitively it was marvelous and he ceased to wonder why the state had chosen jerome corbell it was always done this way it made sense all kinds of sense the payload of a starship was small and its operating lifetime was more than a mans lifetime a reasonably safe lifesupport system for one man occupied an unreasonably high proportion of the payload the rest must go for biological package probes a crew of more than one was out of the question a good capable loyal citizen was not likely to be enough of a loner in any case why send a citizen the times would change drastically before a seeder ramship could return the state itself might change beyond recognition a returning rammer must adjust to a whole new culture there was no way to tell in advance what it might be like why not pick a man who had already chosen to adjust to a new culture a man whose own culture was already two centuries dead when the trip started and a man who already owed the state his life the rna was most effective corbell stopped wondering about pierces dispassionately possessive attitude he began to think of himself as property being programmed for a purpose and he learned he skimmed microtaped texts as if they were already familiar the process was heady he became convinced that he could rebuild a seeder ramship with his bare hands given the parts he had loved figures all his life but abstract math had been beyond him until now field theory monopole field equations circuitry de sign when to suspect the presence of a gravitational point source how to locate it use it avoid it the teaching chair was his life the rest of his timeexercise dinner sleepseemed vague uninteresting he exercised with about twenty others in a room too small for the purpose like corbell the others were lean and stringy in sharp contrast to the brawny wedgeshaped men who were their guards they followed the lead of a guard running in place because there was no room for real running forming in precise rows for scissors jumps pushups situps after fourteen hours in a teaching chair corbell usually enjoyed the jumping about he followed orders and he wondered about the stick in a holster at each guards waist it looked like a cops baton it might have been just thatexcept for the hole in one end corbell never tried to find out sometimes he saw pierce during the exercise periods pierce and the men who tended the teaching chairs were of a third type wellfed in adequate condition but just on the verge of being overweight corbell thought of them as olde american types from pierce he learned something of the other professions open to a revived corpsicle reprogrammed criminal stoop labor intensive hand cultivation of crops body servants handicrafts any easily taught repetitive work and the hours the corpsicles were expected to work fourteen hours a day and the crowding not that his own situation was much different fourteen hours to study an hour of heavy exercise an hour to eat and eight hours to sleep in a dorm that was two solid walls of people time to work time to eat time to sleep elbowtoelbow every minute the poor bastards he said to pierce what kind of a life is that it lets them repay their debt to the state as quickly as possible be reasonable corbell what would a corpsicle do with his off hours he has no social life he has to learn one by observing citizens many forms of felons labor involve proximity to citizens so they can look up at their betters while they work thats no way to learn it would take i get the feeling were talking about decades of this kind of thing thirty years labor generally earns a man his citizenship that gets him a right to work which then gets him a guaranteed base income he can use to buy education shots and tapes and the medical benefits are impressive we live longer than you used to corbell meanwhile its slave labor anyway none of this applies to me no of course not corbell youre wrong to call it slave labor a slave cant quit you can change jobs anytime you like theres a clear freedom of choice corbell shivered any slave can commit suicide suicide my ass the checker said distinctly if he had anything that could be called an accent it lay in the precision of his pronunciation jerome corbell is dead i could have given you his intact skeleton for a souvenir i dont doubt it corbell saw himself tenderly polishing his own white bones but where could he have kept such a thing in his bunk well then youre a brainwiped criminal justly brainwiped i might add your crime has cost you your citizenship but you still have the right to change professions you need only ask for another urn course of rehabilitation what slave can change jobs at will it would feel like dying nonsense you go to sleep only that when you wake up youve got a different set of memories the subject was an unpleasant one corbell avoided it from then on but he could not avoid talking to the checker pierce was the only man in the world he could talk to on the days pierce failed to show up he felt angry frustrated once he asked about gravitational point sources my time didnt know about those yes it did neutron stars and black holes you had a number of pulsars located by and the mathematics to describe how a pulsar decays the thing to watch for is a decayed pulsar directly in your path dont worry about black holes there are none near your course okay pierce regarded him in some amusement you really dont know much about your own time do you come on i was an architect what would i know about as trophysics we didnt have your learning techniques which reminded him of something pierce you said you learned english with rna injections where does the rna come from pierce smiled and walked away he had little time to remember for that he was almost grateful but very occasionally lying wakeful in his bunk listening to the shshsh of a thousand people breathing and the different sounds from the loving bunks he would remember someone it didnt matter who at first it had been mirabelle always mirabelle mirabelle at the tiller as they sailed out of san pedro harbor tanned square face laughing mouth extravagantly large dark glasses mirabelle older and marked by months of strain saying goodbye at his funeral mirabelle on their honeymoon in twentytwo years they had grown together like two touching limbs of a tree but now he thought of her when he thought of her as two hundred years dead and his niece was dead though he and mirabelle had barely made it to her confirmation the pains had been getting bad then and his daughter ann and all three of his grandchildren just infants they had been it didnt matter who it was that floated up into his mind everyone was dead everyone but him corbell did not want to die he was disgustingly healthy and twenty years younger than he had been at death he found his rammer education continually fascinating if only they would stop treating him like property corbell had been in the army but that was twenty years ago make that two hundred and forty he had learned to take orders but never to like it what had galled him then was the basic assumption of his inferiority but no army officer in corbells experience had believed in corbells inferiority as completely as did pierce and pierces guards the checker never repeated a command never seemed even to consider that corbell might refuse if corbell refused even once he knew what would happen pierce knew that he knew the atmosphere better fitted a death camp than an army they must think im a zombie corbell was careful not to pursue the thought he was a corpse brought back to lifebut not all the way what did they do with the skeleton cremate it the life was not pleasant his lastclass citizenship was galling there was nobody to talk tonobody but pierce whom he was learning to hate he was hungry much of the time the single daily meal filled his belly but it would not stay full no wonder he had wakened so lean more and more he lived in the teaching chair in the teaching chair he was a rammer his impotence was changed to omnipotence starman riding the fire that feeds the suns scooping fuel from interstellar space itself spreading electromagnetic fields like wings hundreds of miles out two weeks after the state had wakened him from the dead corbell was given his course he relaxed in a chair that was not quite a contour couch rna solution dripped into him he no longer noticed the needle the teaching screen held a map of his course in green lines in threespace corbell had stopped wondering how the threedimensional effect was achieved the scale was shrinking as he watched two tiny blobs and a glowing ball surrounded by a faintly glowing corona this part of the course he already knew a linear accelerator would launch him from the moon boost him to bussard ramjet speeds and hurl him at the sun solar gravity would increase his speed while his electromagnetic fields caught and burned the solar wind itself then out still accelerating in the teaching screen the scale shrank horrendously the distances between stars were awesome terrifying van maanans star was twelve lightyears away he would begin deceleration a bit past the midpoint the matching would be tricky he must slow enough to release the biological package probebut not enough to drop him below ram speeds in addition he must use the mass of van maanans star for a course change there was no room for error here then on to the next target which was even further away corbell watched and he absorbed and a part of him seemed to have known everything all along even while another part was gasping at the distances ten stars all yellow dwarfs of the sol type an aver age of fifteen lightyears apartthough he would cross one gap of fiftytwo lightyears he would almost touch lightspeed on that one oddly enough the bussard ramjet effect would improve at such speeds he could take advantage of the greater hydrogen flux to pull the fields closer to the ship to intensify them ten stars in a closed path a badly bent and battered ring leading him back to the solar system and earth he would benefit from the time he spent near lightspeed though three hundred years would have passed on earth corbel would only have lived through two hundred years of ships timewhich still implied some kind of suspendedanimation technique it didnt hit him the first time through nor the second but repetilion had been built into the teaching program it didnt hit him until he was on his way to the exercise room three hundred years three hundred years iii it wasnt night not really outside it must be midafternoon indoors the dorm was always coolly lit barely bright enough to read by if there had been books there were no windows corbell should have been asleep he suffered every minute he spent gazing out into the dorm most of the others were asleep but a couple made noisy love on one of the loving bunks a few men lay on their backs with their eyes open two women talked in low voices corbell didnt know the language he had been unable to find anyone who spoke english corbell was desperately homesick the first few days had been the worst he had stopped noticing the smell if he thought of it he could sniff the traces of billions of human beings otherwise the odor was part of the background noise but the loving bunks bothered him when they were in use he watched when he forced himself not to watch he listened he couldnt help himself but he had turned down two signlanguage invitations from a small brunette with straggly hair and a pretty elfin face make love in public he couldnt he could avoid using the loving bunks but not the exposed toilets that was embarrassing the first time he was able to force himself only by staring rigidly at his feet when he pulled on his jumper and looked up a number of sleepers were watching him in obvious amusement the reason might have been his selfconsciousness or the way he dropped his jumper around his anides or he may have been out of line a pecking order determined who might use the toilets before whom he still hadnt figured out the details corbell wanted to go home the idea was unreasonable his home was gone and he would have gone with it if it werent for the corpsicle crypts but reason was of no use in this instance he wanted to go home home to mirabelle home to anywhere rome san francisco kansas city brasiliahe had lived in all those places all different but all home corbell had been at home anywherebut he was not at home here and never would be now they would take here away from him even this world of four rooms and two roofs elbowtoelbow people and utter slavery this world which they would not even show him would have vanished when he returned from the stars corbell rolled over and buried his face in his arms if he didnt sleep he would be groggy tomorrow he might miss something essential they had never tested his training not yet not yet he dozed he came awake suddenly already up on one elbow groping for some elusive thought ah why havent i been wondering about the biological package probes a moment later he did wonder what are the biological package probes but the wonder was that he had never wondered he knew what and where they were heavy fat cylinders arranged around the waist of the starships hull ten of these each weighing almost as much as corbells own lifesupport system he knew their mass distribution he knew the clamp system that held them to the hull and he could operate and repair the clamps under various extremes of damage he almost knew where the probes went when released it was just on the tip of his tongue which meant that he had had the rna shot but had not yet seen the instructions but he didnt know what the probes were for it was like that with the ship he realized he knew everything there was to know about a seeder ramship but nothing at all about the other kinds of starships or interplanetary travel or groundtoorbit vehicles he knew that he would be launched by linear accelerator from the moon he knew the design of the acceleratorhe could see it three hundred and fifty kilometers of rings standing on end in a line across a level lunar mare he knew what to do if anything went wrong during launch and that was all he knew about the moon and lunar installations and lunar conquest barring what he had watched on television over two hundred years ago what was going on out there in the two weeks since his arrival he had seen four rooms and two rooftops glimpsed a rectilinear cityscape from a bridge and talked to one man who was not interested in teuing him anything what had happened in two hundred years these men and women who slept around him who were they why were they here he didnt even know if they were corpsicle or contemporary contemporary probably not one of them was selfconscious about the facilities corbell had raised buildings in all sorts of strange places but he had never jumped blind he had always brushed up on the language and studied the customs before he went here he had no handle nowhere to start he was lost oh for someone to talk to he was learning in enormous gulps taking in volumes of knowledge so broad that he hadnt realized how rigidly bounded they were the state was teaching him only what he needed to know every bit of information was aimed straight at his profession rammer he could see the reasoning he would be gone for several centuries why should the state teach him anything at all about todays technology customs politics there would be trouble enough when he came back if hecome to that who had taught him to call the government the state how had he come to think of the state as allpowerful he knew nothing of its power and extent it must be the rna training with data came attitudes below the conscious level where he couldnt get at them that made his skin crawl they were changing him around again sure why shouldnt the state trust him with a seeder ramship they were feeding him stateoriented patriotism through a silver needle he had lost his people he had lost his world he would lose this one according to pierce he had lost himself four times already a condemned criminal had had his personality wiped four times corbells goddamned skeleton had probably been ground up for phosphates but this was the worst that his beliefs and motivations were being lost bit by bit to the rna solution while the state made him over into a rammer there was nothing that was his he failed to see pierce at the next exercise period it was just as well he was somewhat groggy as usual he ate dinner like a starving man he returned to the dorm rolled into his bunk and was instantly asleep he looked up during study period the next day and found pierce watching him he blinked fighting free of a mass of data on the attitude jet system that bled plasma from the inboard fusion plant that was also the emergency electrical power source and asked pierce whats a biological package probe i would have thought they would teach you that you know what to do with the probes dont you the teaching widget gave me the procedures two days ago slow up for certain systems kill the fields turn a probe loose and speed up again you dont have to aim them no i gather they aim themselves but i have to get them down below a certain velocity or theyll fall right through the system amazing they must do all the rest of it themselves pierce shook his head i wouldnt have believed it well corbell the probes steer for an otherwise terrestrial world with a reducing atmosphere they outnumber oxygennitrogen worlds about three to one in this region of the galaxy and probably everywhere else tooas you may know if your age got that far but what do the probes do theyre biological packages a dozen different strains of algae the idea is to turn a reducing atmosphere into an oxygen atmosphere just the way photosynthetic life forms did for earth something like fifteenlimestentotheeighth years ago the checker smiled barely his small narrow mouth wasnt built to express any great emotion youre part of a big project good lord how long does it take we think about fifty thousand years obviously weve never had the chance to measure it but good lord do you really think the state will last that long does even the state think itll last that long thats not your affair corbell still pierce considered i dont suppose i do or the state does but humanity will last one day there will be men on those worlds its a cause corbell the immortality of the species a thing bigger than one mans life and youre part of it he looked at corbell expectantly corbell was deep in thought he was running a fingertip back and forth along the straight line of his nose presently he asked whats it like out there the stars youre no no no the city i catch just a glimpse of it twice a day cubistic buildings with elaborate carvings at the street level what the bleep is this corbell you dont need to know anything about selerdor by the time you come home the whole city will be changed i know i know thats why i hate to leave without seeing something of the world i could be going out to die corbell stopped he had seen that considering look before but he had never seen pierce actually angry the checkers voice was flat his mouth pinched tight you think of yourself as a tourist so would you if you found yourself two hundred years in the future if you didnt have that much curiosity you wouldnt be human granted that id want to look around i certainly wouldnt demand it as a right what were you thinking when you foisted yourself off on the future did you think the future owed you a debt its the other way around and time you realized it corbell was silent ill tell you something youre a rammer because youre a born tourist we tested you for that you like the unfamiliar it doesnt send you scuttling back to something safe and known thats rare the checkers eyes said and thats why ive decided not to wipe your personality yet his mouth said was there anything else corbell pushed his luck id like a chance to practice with a computer like the ships autopilotcomputer we dont have one but youll get your chance in two days youre leaving then iv the next day he received his instructions for entering the solar system he had been alive for seventeen days the instructions were understandably vague he was to try anything and everything to make contact with a drastically changed state up to and including flashing his attitude jets in binary code he was to start these procedures a good distance out it was not impossible that the state would be at war with something he should be signaling not a warsifip he found that he would not be utterly dependent on rescue ships he could slow the ramship by braking directly into the solar wind until the proton flux was too slow to help him then whip around sol and back out slowing on attitude jets using whatever hydrogen was left in the inboard tank that was emergency fuel given no previous emergencies a nearly full tank would actually get him to the moon and land him there the state would be through with him once he dropped his last probe it was good of the state to provide for his return corbell thoughtand then he shook himself the state was not altruistic it wanted the ship back now more than ever corbell wanted a chance at the autopilot computer he found one last opportunity to talk to the checker a threehundredyear round tripmaybe two hundred ships time corbell said i get some advantage from relativity but pierce you dont really expect me to live two hundred years do you with nobody to talk to the coldsleep treatment even so pierce frowned youve been briefed on the coldsleep procedure but you havent studied medicine im told that cold sleep has a rejuvenating effect over long periods youll spend perhaps twenty years awake and the rest in cold sleep the medical facilities are automatic youve been instructed how to use them do you think wed risk your dying out there between the stars where it would be impossible to replace you was there anything else you wanted to see me about yes he had decided not to broach the subject now he changed his mind id like to take a woman with me the lifesupport system would hold two of us i worked it out wed need another coldsleep chamber of course for two weeks this had been the only man corbell could talk to at first he had found pierce unfathomable unreadable almost inhuman since then he had learned to read the checkers face to some extent pierce was deciding whether to terminate jerome corbell and start over it was a close thing but the state had spent considerable time and effort on jerome corbell it was worth a try and so pierce said that would take up some space you would have to share the rest between you i do not think you would survive but what we can do is this we can put the mind of a woman in your computer the computer is voicecontrolled and her voice would be that of a woman any type of woman you choose a subplot enclosing the personality of a woman would leave plenty of circuitry for the computers vital functions i dont think you quite get the point of look here corbell we know you dont need a woman if you did you would have taken one by now and we would have wiped you and started over youve lived in the dormitory for two weeks and you have not used the mating facilities once damn it pierce do you expect me to make love in public i cant exactly but corbell you learned to use the toilet didnt you because you had to you know what to do with a woman but you are one of those men fortunate enough not to need one otherwise you could not be a rammer if corbell had hit the checker then he would have done it knowing that it meant his death and knowing that he would have killed pierce for forcing him to it something like ten seconds elapsed pierce watched him in frank curiosity when he saw corbell relax he said you leave tomorrow your training is finished goodbye corbell walked away clenching and unclenching his fists the dormitory had been a test he knew it now could he cross a narrow bridge with no handrails then he was not pathologically afraid of falling could he spend two hundred years alone in the cabin of a starship then the silent people around him five above his head hundreds to either side must make him markedly uncomfortable could he live twenty waking years without a woman surely he must be impotent he returned to the dorm after dinner they had replaced the bridge with a nearly invisible slab of glass corbell snarled and crossed ahead of the guard the guard had to hurry to keep up he stood between two walls of occupied bunks looking around him then he did a stupid thing he had already refrained from killing the checker he must have decided to live what he did then was stupid he knew it he looked about him until he found the slender darkhaired girl with the elfin face watching him curiously from near the ceiling he climbed the rungs between the bunks until his face was level with hers the gesture he needed was a quick formalized one but he didnt know it in english he asked come with me she nodded brightly and followed him down the ladder by then it seemed to corbell that the dorm was alive with barely audible voices the odd one the rammer trainee certainly a number of the wakeful turned on their sides to watch he felt their eyes on the back of his neck as he zipped open his gray jumpsuit and stepped out of it the dormitory had been a series of tests at least two of those eyes would record his doings for pierce but to corbell they were just like all the others all the eyes curiously watching to see how the speechless one would make out and sure enough he was impotent it was the eyes and he was naked the girl was at first concerned then pitying she stroked his cheek in apology or sympathy and then she went away and found someone else corbell lay listening to them gazing at the bunk above him he waited for eight hours finally a guard came to take him away by then he didnt care what they did with him v he didnt start to care until the guards floating jeep pulled up beneath an enormous cartridge standing on end then he began to wonder it was too small to be a rocket ship but it was they strapped him into a contour couch one of three in a cabin with a single window there were the guard and corbell and a man who might have been pierces second cousin once removed the pilot he had the window corbels heartbeat quickened he wondered how it would be it was as if he had suddenly become very heavy he heard no noise except right at the beginning a sound like landing gear being raised on an airplane not a rocket corbell thought possibly the ferry ships drive was electromagnetic in nature he remembered the tricks a bussard rainjet could play with magnetic fields he was heavy and he hadnt slept last night he went to sleep when he woke he was in freefall nobody had tried to tell him anything about freefall the guard and pilot were watching screw you said corbell it was another test he got the straps open and pushed himself over to the window the pilot laughed caught him and held him while he closed a protective cover over the instruments then he let go and corbell drifted in front of the window his belly was revolving eccentrically his inner ear was going crazy his testicles were tight up against his groin and that didnt feel good either he was falling falling corbell snarled within his mind and tried to concentrate on the window but the earth was not visible neither was the moon just a lot of stars bright enoughquite bright in facteven more brilliant than they had been above a small boat anchored off catalina island on many nights long ago he watched them for some time trying to keep his mind off that fallingelevator sensation he wasnt about to get himself disqualified now they ate aboard in freefall corbell copied the others picking chunks of meat and potatoes out of a plastic bag of stew pulling them through a membrane that sealed itself behind his pick of all the things im going to miss he told the broadfaced guard im going to enjoy missing you most you and your goddamn staring eyes the guard smiled placidly and waited to see if corbell would get sick they landed a day after takeoff on a broad plain where the earth sat nestled among sharp lunar peaks one day instead of three the state had expended extra power to get him here but an earthmoon ifight must be a small thing these days the plain was black with blast pits it must have been a landing field for decades transparent bubbles clustered near the runway end of the linear accelerator there were buildings and groves of trees inside the bubbles spacecraft of various shapes and sizes were scattered about the plain the biggest was corbels ramship a silver skyscraper lying on its side the probes were in place giving the ship a thickwaisted appearance to corbells trained eye it looked ready for takeoff he was awed he was humbled he was proud he tried to sort out his own reactions from rnainspired emotions and probably failed corbell donned his suit first while the pilot and guard watched to see if he would make a mistake he took it slow the suit came in two pieces a skintight rubbery body stocking and a helmet attached to a heavy backpack on the chest was a white spiral with tapered ends the sign of the state an electric cart came for them apparently corbell was not expected to know how to walk on an airless world he thought to head for one of the domes but the guard steered straight for the ship it was a long way off it had become unnervingly large when the guard stopped underneath a fat cylinder the size of a house swelled above the jeep the lifesupport section bound to the main hull by a narrower neck the smaller dome at the nose must be the control room the guard said now you inspect your ship you can talk yes yesterday a quick course oh three things wrong with your ship you find all three you tell me i tell him him oh the pilot then what then you fix one of the things we fix the others then we launch you it was another test of course maybe the last corbell was furious he started immediately with the field generators and gradually he forgot the guard and the pilot and the sword still hanging over his head he knew this ship as it had been with the teaching chair so it was with the ship itself corbells impotence changed to omnipotence the power of the beast the intricacy the potential thethe hydrogen tank held far too much pressure that wouldnt wait ill slurry this now he told the guard get a tanker over there to top it off he bled hydrogen gas slowly through the valve lowering the fuels vapor pressure without letting fuel boil out the valve itself when he finished the liquid hydrogen would be slushy with frozen crystals under nearvacuum pressure he finished the external inspection without finding anything more it figured the banks of dials would hold vastly more information than a mans eyes could read through opaque titanalloy skin the airlock was a tripledoor type not so much to save air as to give him an airlock even if he lost a door somehow corbell shut the outer door used the others when green lights indicated he could he looked down at the telltales under his chin as he started to unclamp his helmet vacuum he stopped the ships gauges said air the suits said vacuum which was right come to that he hadnt heard any hissing just how soundproof was his helmet just like pierce to wait and see if he would take off his helmet in a vacuum well how to test hah corbell found the head turned on a water faucet the water splashed oddly in lunar gravity it did not boil did a flaw in his suit constitute a flaw in the ship corbell doffed his helmet and continued his inspection there was no way to test the ramfield generators without causing all kinds of havoc in the linear accelerator he checked out the tell tales then concentrated on the lifesupport mechanisms the tailored plants in the air system were alive and well but the urea absorption mechanism was plugged somehow that would be a dirty job he postponed it he decided to finish his inspection the state might have missed something it was his ship his life the coldsleep chamber was like a great coffin a corpsicle coffin corbell shuddered remembering two hundred years spent waiting in liquid nitrogen he wondered again if jerome corbell were really deadand then he shook off the thought and went to work no flaws in the coldsleep system he went on the computer was acting vaguely funny he had a hell of a time tracing the problem there was a minute break in one superconducting circuit so small that some current was leaking through anyway by inductance bastards he donned his suit and went out to report the guard heard him out consulted with the other man then told corbell you did good now finish with the toppingoff procedure we fix the other things theres something wrong with my suit too new suit aboard now i want some time with the computer i want to be sure its all right now we fix it good when you top off fuel you leave that suddenly corbell felt a vast sinking sensation the whole moon was dropping away under him they launched him hard corbell saw red before his eyes felt his cheeks dragged far back toward his ears the ship would be all right it was built to stand electromagnetic eddy currents from any direction he survived he fumbled out of his couch in time to watch the moonscape flying under him receding a magnificent view there were days of freefall he was not yet moving at ramscoop speeds but the state had aimed him inside the orbit of mercury straight into the thickening solar wind protons thick fuel for the ram fields and a boost from the suns gravity meanwhile he had most of a day to play with the computer at one point it occurred to him that the state might monitor his computer work he shrugged it off probably it was too late for the state to stop him now in any case he had said too much already he finished his work with the computer and got answers that satisfied him at higher speeds the ram fields were selfreinforcing they would support themselves and the ship he could find no upper limit to the velocity of a seeder ramship with all the time in the world then he sat down at the control console and began to play with the fields they emerged like invisible wings he felt the buffeting of badly controlled bursts of fusing hydrogen he kept the fields close to the ship fearful of losing the balance here where the streaming of protons was so uneven he could feel how he was doing he could fly this ship by the seat of his pants with rna training to help him he felt like a giant this enormous phallic germinal flying thing of metal and fire carrying the seeds of life for worlds that had never known life he roared around the sun and out the thrust dropped a bit then because he and the solar wind were moving in the same direction but he was catching it in his nets like wind in a sail guiding it and burning it and throwing it behind him the ship moved faster every second this feeling of powerenormous masculine powerhad to be partly rna training at this point he didnt care part was him jerome corbell around the orbit of mars when he was sure that a glimpse of sunlight would not blind him he instructed the computer to give him a full view the walls of the spherical control room seemed to disappear the sky blazed around him there were no planets nearby all he saw of the sky was myriads of brilliant pinpoints mostly white some showing traces of colot but there was more to see fusing hydrogen made a ghostly ring of light around his ship it would grow stronger so far his thrust was low somewhat more than enough to balance the thin pul of the sun he started his turn around the orbit of jupiter by adjusting the fields to channel the proton flow to the side that helped him thrust but it must have puzzled pierce and the faceless state they would assume he was playing with the fields testing his equipment maybe his curve was gradual it would take them a while to notice this was not according to plan originally he had intended to be halfway to van maanans star before he changed course that would have given him fifteen years head start in case he was wrong in case the state could do something to stop him even now that would have been wise but he couldnt do it pierce might die in thirty years pierce might never know what corbell had doneand that thought was intolerable his thrust dropped to almost nothing in the outer reaches of the system protons were thin out here but there were enough to push his velocity steadily higher and that was what counted the faster he went the greater the proton flux he was on his way he was beyond neptune when the voice of pierce the checker came to him saying this is peerssa for the state peerssa for the state answer corbell do you have a malfunction can we help we cannot send rescue but we can advise peerssa for the state peerssa for the state corbell smiled tightly peerssa the checkers name had changed pronunciation in two hundred years pierce had slipped back to an old habit rna lessons forgotten he must be upset about something corbell spent twenty minutes finding the moon base with his signal laser the beam was too narrow to permit sloppy handling when he had it adjusted he said this is corbel for himself corbell for himself im fine how are you he spent more time at the computer one thing had been bothering him the return to sol system he planned to be away longer than the state would have expected suppose there was nobody on the moon when he returned it was a problem he found if he could reach the moon on his remaining fuel he could reach the earths atmosphere the ship was durable it would stand a meteoric reentry but his attitude jets would not land him properly speaking unless he could cut away part of the ship the ramfield generators would no longer be needed then well he would work it out somehow plenty of time plenty of time the answer from the moon took nine hours peerssa for the state corbell we dont understand you are far off course your first target was to be van maanans star instead you seem to be curving around toward sagittarius there is no known earthlike world in that direction what the bleep do you think youre doing repeating peerssa for the state peerssa corbell tried to switch it off the teaching chair hadnt told him about an off switch finally and it should have been sooner he told the computer to switch the receiver off somewhat later he located the lunar base with his signal laser and began transmission this is corbel for himself corbell for himself im getting sick and tired of having to find you every damn time i want to say something so ill give you this all at once im not going to any of the stars on your list its occurred to me that the relativity equations work better for me the faster i go if i stop every fifteen lightyears to launch a probe the way you want me to i could spend two hundred years at it and never get anywhere whereas if i just aim the ship in one direction and keep it going i can build up a ferocious tau factor it works out that i can reach the galactic hub in twentyone years ships time if i hold myself down to one gravity acceleration and pierce i just cant resist the idea you were the one who called me a born tourist remember well the stars in the galactic hub arent like the stars in the arms and theyre packed a quarter to a half lightyear apart according to your own theories it must be passing strange in there so il go exploring on my own maybe ill find some of your reducingatmosphere planets and drop the probes there maybe i wont ill see you in about seventy thousand years your time by then your precious state may have withered away or youll have colonies on the seeded planets and some of them may have broken loose from you ill join one of them or corbell thought it through rubbing the straight sharp line of his nose ill have to check it out on the computer he said but if i dont like any of your worlds when i get back there are always the clouds of magellan ill bet they arent more than twentyfive years away ships time chapter don juan i the naming of names was important to corbell alone in his little universe dissociated from all mankind with only himself and his blandvoiced computer to talk to corbell hung tags on everything he called himself jaybee corbell as he had in his former life yes it was a major decision for a while he was calling himself corbell mark ii he gave that up after the shape of his nose stopped bothering him after he got used to the look and feel of his shorter arms and slender hands his alien body there were no mirrors on the ship what he called the kitchen was a wall with slots and a menudisplay screen the opposite wall was the health club the exercise paraphernalia and the outlets that would turn this area into sauna or shower or steam bath the medical dispensary and diagnostic tools were forest lawn the coldsleep tank was also in that room the control room was a hollow sphere with a remarkable chair in the exact center surrounded by a horseshoeshaped bank of controls and approached via a catwalk of metal lace the chair would assume a fantastic variety of positions and it gave indecently good massages the spherical wall could disappear to display the black sky as if cor bell and the control bank floated alone in space it would display textbooks on astronomy or astrophysics or state history or updated diagrams of the ship corbell called it the womb room the computer could be voiceoperated from anywhere aboard there was a helmet like a hair dryer with a thick cord attached that would plug the pilot directly into the computers senses corbell was afraid to use it the computer answered to computer corbell refused to personalize it he spoke to it only to give orders and request information but he dithered for months before naming the great seeder ramship he had stolen from peerssa and the state don juan he called it for its phallic overtones trivial decisions but that was corbells problem he had already made his major decisions that was his finest hour when he broke free of peerssa and drove for the galactic core don juan should have capped his career then by blowing up twentyone years from now he could make his next major decision a year on his way and corbell was starving for the sound of another voice he dithered what could pierce say that would be worth the hearing a year ago he had hung up on pierce he had had the computer disconnect the message laser receiver as a gesture of contempt that gesture was important could pierce know never mind how that he was no longer talking to a void corbell held lengthy conversations about it can i possibly be that lonely he demanded of himself or that bored or that desperate to hear another human voice again other than my own his own voice echoed back from the womb room walls computer he said at last reconnect the message laser receiver and he waited nothing hours passed and nothing he was savage pierce must have given up somewhere in the city that pierce had never shown corbell pierce the checker would be training another revived corpsicle the voice caught him at breakfast three days later corbell hah that was strange computer had never addressed him before was it an emergency this is peerssa you traitorous son of a bitch turn this ship around and carry out your mission get stuffed corbell said feeling good get stuffed yourself said the voice of peerssa turned suddenly silkysmooth something was wrong here don juan was almost half a lightyear from sol how could peerssa computer switch off the message laser receiver that wont work corbell ive beamed my personality at your computer over and over again for these past seven months turn us around or ill cut off your air corbell yelled something obscene the silence that followed commanded attention the purr of air moving through the lifesupport system was a sound he never heard anymore but he heard its absence turn that back on he cried in panic will you bargain corbell never ill throw what was heavy and movable nothing ill pry the microwave oven loose and throw it into the computer ill give you nothing but a wrecked ship your mission shut up the voice of pierce the checker was silent corbell heard the purr of moving air what next if pierce controlled the computer he controlled everything why didnt he turn the ship himself had he corbell climbed up into the womb room and settled in the control chair full view he commanded he floated alone in space half a lightyear of distance had not changed the pattern of the stars a year of acceleration had don juan was now meeting all light rays at an angle so that the entire sky was puckered forward in his first life during nights spent aboard a small boat corbell had made a nodding acquaintance with the constellations sagittarius was just where he had left it directly overhead a ring of white flame around and below him was hydrogen guided and constricted to fuse in stellar fire the exhaust of his drive sol was a hot pink point beneath his feet and something flickered across it corbell staring made out a humanoid form barely blacker than space walking toward him across the stars coming close narrow features light hair it was pierce corbell watched barely breathing pierce was as big as don juan pierce was angry corbell said computer get that mannequin off the screen the figure vanished corbell resumed breathing pierce or peerssa or computer or whatever name you will answer to i give you your orders you will proceed to the galactic axis under one gravity of acceleration making turnover at midpoint you will take all necessary steps to guard my life and the integrity of the ship subject to this mission now speak if you like the voice of pierce the checker said i prefer peerssa corbell sighed his relief so do i are you in fact under my orders yes corbell there are things we must discuss you owe your very existence to the state youve stolen a key to the survival of mankind itself how many seeder ramships do you imagine we can build how many package probes do you think will succeed in converting alien atmospheres to something men can breathe or do you think that men will never need to leave the earth computer you will henceforth answer to the name peerssa peerssa shut the fuck up silence now corbell caught himself giggling occasionally it could happen anytime at meals or sitting in the womb room watching the sky or using the health club he would suddenly start giggling and then he couldnt stop because peerssa could hear and peerssa couldnt answer peerssa the naming of names pierce the checker was far in corbels past while peerssa was a personality imposed on a computers memory bank the distinction was worth remembering there would be major differences between the man and the computer peerssa had different senses peerssa would never suffer hunger pangs or a frustrated sex urge peerssa would never exercise or use the rest room peerssa might wel have no sense of selfpreservation that was worth finding out and peerssa was compelled to follow orders peerssa was corbels slave two weeks passed before corbell gave in to the urge for conversation seated in the control chair floating among stars that were already brighter and bluer above than below corbell said peerssa you may speak good youve instructed me to guard your life and the ship i cant maintain one gravity all the way without killing you and wrecking the ship dont lie to me corbell snapped i checked it out on the computer before i ever passed saturn the ram effect works better at high velocities because i can narrow the width of the ram fields greater hydrogen flux you used data already in the computer yes of course corbell that data was meant for jumps of up to fiftytwo lightyears not thirtythree thousand we built the field generator as strong as possible but it will not stand one gravity at your peak velocity the strains will tear it apart well have to decrease thrust starting three years from now if you want to live pierce the checker had never lied had he pierce had never bothered why lie to a corpsicle peerssa was something else again corbell said youre lying i deny it make up your mind youve ordered me not to lie am i under your orders if not why dont i just turn and head for van maanans star corbel gave up this ruins my itinerary doesnt it how long will it take us to reach the core in nearperfect safety about five hundred years give me oh a ninetypercent chance of getting there alive how long computing insufficient data on interstellar mass density well correct that on the way one hundred and sixty years four months plus or minus ten months all figures in ships time corbell felt cold that long suppose we dont go direct we could skim above the plane of the galaxy and thin out the interstellar matter computing good corbell we lose some time thrusting laterally at turnover but we stifi shave some time one hundred and thirtysix years eleven months confidence of a year and a month that still isnt good and youd have to spend the same time coming home youd get home dead corbell we could finish your original mission faster than that well for never say forget it to a computer you have your orders i now amend them your mission is to get us to the galactic axis in minimum ships time relative ninetypercent confidence of getting me there alive youll never see earth again shut up silence you may speak silence does it bother you being cut off like that yes of course it bothers me ive been silent for a week thats four weeks added to our trip time the longer it takes me to persuade you the longer it will take us to complete our mission i could order you to give up that idea i would do it snarling of my circuits might result corbell i appeal to your sense of gratitude the state created you you owe your very existence bullshit is it that easy for you to ignore your duty corbell swallowed an urge to drive his fist through a bank of dials no its not easy every time you raise the holy name of the state something in me snaps to attention then why not listen to the voice of your social conscience because its not my conscience its those damn shots you ifiled me full of memory rna and thats where my sense of duty to the state is coming from peerssa took a good dramatic pause before he said insinuatingly suppose its your conscience after all ill never know will i and thats your doing isnt it so live with it you will never see earth again your medical facilities will not keep you alive that long corbell snorted dont be silly the medicines and the coldsleep tank are supposed to keep me young and healthy for the first two hundred years the coldsleep tank has a rejuvenating effect remember it doesnt i lied you were to remain alive for the duration of your mission if the medicines had been better we would have extended the mission it rang true it fitted well with what corbell knew of the state you sons of bitches corbell listen to me in three hundred years the state may discover complete rejuvenation we could arrive home in time for noncitizens no answer were going to the galactic axis you have your orders you must enter cold sleep immediately peerssa said in a dead voice oh your optimum program is ten years in cold sleep six months to recover then cold sleep again you will survive to see the galactic axis barely uhhuh and if you happened to forget to wake me up thats your problem traitor ii raw throat cramped muscles eyes that wouldnt focus questing hands found him in a coffin with the lid still on waking from cold sleep was like waking from death he had half expected this when they froze him in and he had half expected never to wake he whispered peerssa here where would i go yeah where are we one hundred and six lightyears from sol you must eat suddenly corbell was ravenous he sat up rested then climbed down from the tank treating himself like fragile crystal he was lean as death and weak fix me a snack i can take to the womb room he said it will be waiting he felt lightheaded no he felt light he picked up a large bulb of hot soup in the kitchen and sucked at it as he continued to the womb room give me a view he said the walls disappeared the stars blazed violetwhite over his head the stellar rainbow spread out from there violet stars in the center then rings of blue green yellow orange dim red to the sides and below there was amost nothing a dozen dim red points and the feathery ring of flame that marked his drive that had dimmed to for peerssa had pulled the ram fields close and had reddened because the fuel guided into that ring was moving at near lightspeed relative to the ship peerssa was bitter are you satisfied even if we turned back now we have lost over four hundred years of earth time you bore me said corbell though he felt stabbing pain from what he would once have called his conscience what happens next next you eat and exercise in six months you must be strong and fat fat fat otherwise you could not survive ten years in cold sleep finish your soup then exercise what do i do for entertainment whatever you like naturally peerssa was puzzled the state had provided nothing for corbels entertainment yeah i thought so tell me about yourself peerssa were going to be together a long time what do you want to know i want to know how you got to be this way what was it like to be peerssa the checker citizen of the state start with your childhood peerssa was a poor storyteller he rambled he had to be led by appropriate questions but there was more than his voice to tel tales with he was an inept motionpicture director with an unlimited budget on the wall of the womb room he showed corbell the farming community where he had grown up and the schools of his childhood and the animated history texts he had studied during his final training the memories were usually hazy some were shockingly sharp and brightly colored the enormous tenyearold who bullied peerssa on the exercise roof the older girl who showed him sex and thus frightened him badiy his civics teacher corbell ate and slept and exercised he tended don juan with the halfinstinctive love and understanding absorbecj with his rammer training in between he had from peerssa all the knowledge he had not dared demand of pierce the checker he saw views of selerdor the city he had only glimpsed from a rooftop the buildings were as blocky and unimaginative inside as out the carvings at street level were in shtoring the state language they were edifying principles rules of conduct or the life stories of state heroes he grew to know peerssa as well as he had known mirabelle his wife for twentytwo years in knowing peerssa he grew to know the state the computer memory held what corbell would have called civics texts he read those with helpful comments from peerssa he learned of two brushfire wars that had half destroyed the world in ashes of war and fires of idealism the state had been born said peerssa and had rapidly grown allpowerful it was a benevolent fascism peerssa said what peerssa described had distinct overtones of chinese and japanese empire society was drastically stratified a citizens obligations to those above him were backed with his life the government built and controlled every power generator once these had been very diverse damns geothermal plants temperaturedifferential plants in the ocean depths now they were big fusion generators supplemented by rooftop and desert solarenergy collectors but the state owned them all once he asked peerssa do you know what a watermonopoly empire is pity a lot of eariy civilizations were watermonopoly empires ancient egypt ancient china the aztecs any government that controls irrigation completely is a water empire if the state controls power of all kinds they also control the fresh water supply dont they with a population of twelve billion yes of course we built the dams and rerouted the rivers and distilled fresh water for deuterium for the fusion plants and sent the excess water onward if the state had ever paused to rest half the world would have died of thirst musing corbell said i once asked you if you thought the state would last fifty thousand years i dont i think the state could last seventy or a hundred thousand see these watermonopoly empires they dont collapse they can rot from within to the point where a single push from the barbarians outside can topple them the levels of society lose touch with each other and when it comes to the crunch they cant fight but it takes that push from outside theres no revolution in a water empire thats a very strong statement yeah do you know how the twoprovince system works they used it in china say there are two provinces a and b and theyre both having a famine what you do is you look at their records if province a has a record of cheating on its taxes or rioting then you confiscate all the grain in province a and ship it to b if the records are about equal you pick at random the result is that province b is loyal forever and province a is wiped out so you dont worry about it we rarely have famines when we do it was rare for peerssa not to finish a sentence theres nothing more powerful than controlling everybodys water a watercontrol empire can grow so feeble that a single barbarian horde can topple it but peerssa the state doesnt have any outside much later corbell learned that he had changed his life again at the time he only suspected from peerssas silence that he had offended peerssa and peerssa was not pierce the checker was long dead the computer personality had never harmed corbell it was worth remembering corbell gave up talking about the state peerssa was loyal to the state corbell emphatically was not there was another topic he eventually gave up once too often he told peerssa i still wish youd sent a woman with me must i remind you that the lifesupport system is too small for two or that so is now a vast distance behind us or that your sex urge tested low if it had not you would not be here it was a matter of privacy corbell said between his teeth but the loving bunks in the dormitory were not the only test in word association you tested low your testosterone level tested low you ballless wonder how can you talk to me about low sex urge the state has a superfluity of testicles peerssa said with no particular emphasis would pierce the checker have reacted that way it was a weird response but peerssa meant it corbel stopped talking about women six months passed stars passed too a few passed close enough to show like violet windows into hell and receded like dim red fireballs corbel was fat too fat for his own tastes fat enough for peerssas when at last he climbed into the great coffin it happened seven times iii corbell is something wrong speak please corbell sighed in the coldsleep tank he did not move he had become very used to this routine the terrible weakness the hunger the six months of exercises and of forcing insipid food down his throat the climbing into the tank to start the cycle over at this his seventh awakening he felt a deadly reluctance to wake up corbell please say something i can sense your heartbeat and respiration but i cant see you have you turned catatonic shall i administer shock dont administer shock can you move or are you too weak he sat up it made him dizzy ships thrust was very low where are we beyond midpoint of our course thrusting laterally to force us back into the plane of the galaxy proceeding according to plan your plan not mine now i want to monitor your health later make me soup ill take it to the womb room he moved toward the kitchen bouncing oddly in the low gravity he had aged more than the four years he bad been awake after each awakening the exercises had taken longer to build him up again he felt brittle and ravenous the soup was good the soup was always good he settled himself in the womb room and let his eyes roam the dials some of the readings were frightening the gammaray flux would have charred him in minutes if the power of the ram fields were not guiding the particles aside other readings made no sense peerssa had told the truth the seeder ramship was not designed for velocities this close to the speed of light neither were the instruments and dials and what about peerssas senses was he flying half blind give me a full view he said the stellar rainbow had hardened and sharpened over seven decades it had lost symmetry too to one side the stars were thickly clustered the arc of bluewhites blazed like diamonds in an empresss necklace to the other the side that faced intergalactic space the rainbow was almost dark each star was sharply defined within its band of color but within the central disk of violet stars was a soft white glow the microwave background of the universe at absolute boosted to visible light by don juans terrible speed his ships drive flame had become a bloodred fan of light facing intergalactic space peerssa was thrusting laterally to bend their course back into the plane of the galaxy give me a corrected view corbel instructed now peerssa worked a kind of fiction from the universe he perceived through the senses on don jauns hull he extrapolated a picture of the universe seen at rest and he painted that picture around the wall of the womb room the galaxy was incomparably beautiful a whirlpool of light spread out across half the universe corbell looked ahead of him for his first view of the galactic core it was there just brighter than the rest and hazy without definition he was disappointed he had thought the closepacked ball of stars would flame with colors he could pick out no individual stars only a vague glow around a central bright point behind him the stars were similarly blurred im getting poor definition in the view aft peerssa volunteered the light is drastically redshifted and forward this is not according to theory i would have expected more definition within the core there must be a great deal of interstellar matter blocking the light even so i need more data corbel didnt answer a multiple star cluster had caught his eye half a dozen brilliant points whirling frantically as they came toward him they passed on the right still jiggling madly and froze in place as they came alongside the next time that happens id like to see an uncorrected view ill call you but you wont see much so here he was at the halfway point with his destination in sight no man before him could have seen the glow of the galactic core or the frantically spinning star cluster flashing past at this close to lightspeed his enemys soul had become corbells slave corbell flies toward the core suns like a moth toward a flame expecting death but he has his victories he finished his anonymous soup don juans kitchen and or chemistry lab supplied just enough taste just enough variety to keep a state noncitizen from cutting his throat on such fare he must grow fat and exercise to distribute the fat lately it tended to settle in a potbelly which was no help at all he was getting old despite the coldsleep tank and all the medicines available he would be decrepit before they reached the core suns his second life should have been more like his first he had hoped to make friends to carve out some kind of career he had been frozen at age fortyfour there would have been time time even for a marriage children things would look better when he had built up some strength he could go on an oxygen drunk on request peerssa would fill the cabin with pure oxygen while lecturing corbell on the adverse medical effects for as long as corbell would let him about now you usually start telling me my duty he said theres no point said peerssa were decelerating now well be among the core suns before we can brake to a stop corbell smiled anyone but you would have given up sooner expand my view of the core suns please the hub of the galaxy rushed toward him dark clouds with stars embedded in them surrounded a bright core they looked like churning storm clouds they had changed position since his last waking period but the core itself was a flat featureless glow except for a single bright point at the center the interstellar matter must be almighty thick in there can our ram fields handle it if we give up thrust and settle for shielding the lifesupport system and nothing else youll be amazed at what we can handle ill be dying anyway of old age corbell there is a way you can go home again dammit peerssa have you been lying to me calm down corbell there is a way to make you young if youre willing you can understand why i didnt raise the subject before i sure can why now why would you do this for someone who betrayed your precious state things have changed corbell by now we may be the last remnants of the state and you werent even a citizen and you are i am a human personality imposed on a computers memory banks i could never be a citizen you could have been such as you are you may well represent the state the state may not survive the seventy thousand years we will be gone you are worth preserving thank you unreasonably corbell was touched the state may exist only in your memory im glad you forced me to teach you speech im glad i told you so much about myself you must live make me young corbell said with the fervor of a man growing old much too fast what does it take we have the equipment to take a clone from you you surely find nothing strange about the concept of cloning we knew about it cloning of carrots anyway but we can clone men we can clone you let the individual grow in sensory deprivation in your coldsleep tank we can record your memories and play them into the clones blank mind how oh of course the computer link the link was a direct telepathic control over the computer corbell had never dared use it he had been doubly afraid of it since the computer became pierce the checker peerssa might use it to take him over peerssa said we must also have injections of your memory rna corbell yelped youre talking about grinding me up into chemically leeched hamburger im talking about making a young man of you it wouldnt be me you madman the new individual would be as much jerome branch corbell as you are thanks thanks a lot you told me what happened to the real corbell ground up for hamburger and eeched for rna and injected into a brainwiped criminal the real corbell must have been insane or stupid at seventy degrees and below the phospholipids in the glia in the brain freeze the synapses are destroyed any educated man knows this said peerssa he and the other corpsicles never had a chance you are an improvement on that corbell i will make the clone an improvement over you i thought you might no thanks there isnt going to be a corbell mark iii six months later he was not ready for the coldsleep tank youve been shirking your exercises peerssa said corbell had just finished an exercise period tendonitis had led him to favor his arms these past two months but they hurt anyway two hot wires in his shoulders its your schedule he grumbled i would have to thaw you early coming out of cold sleep is a trauma you want to reach the galactic core in optimum condition take another two months awake fine i hate that damn tank anyway corbell slumped in a web chair in near freefall he was too prone to lose muscle tone his potbelly protruded he had nobody else to talk to and peerssa had endless patience it should have been good timing when peerssa said have you given any thought to regaining your youth corbell shuddered forget it hastily i dont mean that literally if you wipe it from your memory banks youll only think of it again later i take it youve canceled your command what is your objection its ugly as things stand now you will die of aging on the return voyage the coldsleep treatment is not enough i will not be ground up for hamburger not again you know the details of don juans excrement recycling system do you find that ugly since you ask yes but you eat the food and drink the water corbell didnt answer you would be a young man when it was over no no i would not corbel was shouting i would be hamburger contaminated hamburger garbage to be recycled for the bb benefit of your damn clone he wouldnt even be a good copy because youd be shoving some of your own thoughts in through the computer link you have no loyalty to anything but yourself corbell thought i can shut him up anytime he said whatever it is i am ill settle for it the only man who ever saw the galactic core a wonderful thing peerssa had had time and practice to develop that sarcastic tone what will you do afterward once your sole ambition in life is satisfied will you order me to selfdestruct a grand funeral pyre for your ending a fusion flame that alien eyes might see then corbell did peerssa an injustice is that whats been bothering you tell you what he said after we have our look around the core suns why dont we drop some package probes on appropriate planets you can reach earth alive by the time the state sends ships the algae will have turned some reducing atmospheres to oxygen atmospheres you can take my mummy home too in the coldsleep tank maybe theyll want it for a museum you will not be young again weve been through that very well will you go to the womb room please i have a great deal to show you mystified and suspicious corbell went peerssa had set up displays on the womb room walls there was a greatly enlarged slightly blurred view of the gaactic core as corbell had seen it six months ago drastically flattened the glow of the suns blurred by interstellar matter there was a contrasting enlargement of the center of the spiral galaxy in andromeda there was a diagram an oddly contoured disk cut down the center corbell frowned wondering where he had seen that before peerssa spoke as he settled himself in the control chair i have never known why you chose the galactic axis as your destination i may never understand that the core of andromeda galaxy glowed with colored lights corbell pointed for that for beauty for the same reason i once went through the grand canyon on muleback can you imagine a planet on the edge of that sphere the nights i can do better i can put it before you by extrapolation and peerssa did corbells chair floated above a dark landscape the sky was jammed with stars competing for space big apd little red and blue and pure white and a spinning pair that threw out a spiral of red gas the sky turned a wall of blackness rose in the east ten thousand cubic lightyears of dust cloud and then the womb room was as it had been while corbell was still gaping i could have done that before your first term in the coldsleep tank we could have completed your mission seeded the worlds assigned to you and i could have displayed that sky for you at any time why didnt you say something its not real peerssa didnt any of your aristocrats ever go cruising through say saturns rings just for the joy of it for the mining possibilities mining if they said that they lied are you sorry you came why had he kept on knowing that the trip would take more than twentyone years that it would take his life had not changed his mind corbell the reconstituted corpsicle would never carve out a normal life for himself very well he would do something memorable no why should i be sorry i expected strangeness in the galactic core i was right wasnt i its nothing like other galaxies and im the first to know it youre insane imagine my amazement never mind your choice has had unforeseen consequences state astronomers expected a closepacked sphere of miffions of suns averaging a quarter to half a lightyear apart with red giant suns predominating instead we find this the matter in the core forced into a disk that flattens drastically toward the center with a tremendously powerful source of infrared and radio energy at the axis like your diagram yes very like this diagram which i find in my data banks a representation of the structure of the accretion disk around the black hole in cygnus xl oh he had not seen that diagram during his rammer training his rammer training had not even told him how to avoid stellarsized black holes because there were none to be expected on his planned course he had seen something very like that diagram in an article in scientific american yes corbel your wonderland of lights is being absorbed by a black hole of galactic mass its spin must be enormous from the way it has flattened the mass of stars around it eventually the entire galaxy may disappear intocorbell are you ill no corbel said his hands covering his face muffling his voice dont be depressed this is our chance for life what a thin chance to see earth again before you die a unique experience win or lose isnt that what you want let me explain iv at the thirteenth awakening he tried to sit up too fast he woke again dizzy flat on his back in the coffin with peerssa calling in his ear corbell corbell here where would i go be more careful lie there for a minute lean as death he was and old arthritis grated in his knobby joints with the familiar hunger came nausea he ran a hand over his scalphe had been half bald when lie entered forest lawnand more of his hair came away where are we one month from the black hole and closing the view will please you he emerged from the coldsleep tank like a sick dracula he made his limping way to the kitchen then to the health club his muscles were slack and tended to cramp the exercises were hard on him but the pain and the nausea and the creeping years meant little he felt good at worst he had found a brandnew way to die he asked of the ubiquitous microphones suppose we go too far in we wont ever die will we wed be stopped above the schwarzschild radius only to an outside observer not to ourselves are you about to change my orders some minutes later he eased himself into the womb room chair he sipped the last of the broth full view don juan raced above a sea of churning stars in a normal galaxy they would have been crowded enough here forced into a plane by the spin of the giant black hole at the center they were crowded to death dying stars burned with a terrible light they stood like torches in a field of candles it must be common enough for star to ram star here or for tides to rip stars apart commoner toward the center corbell thought the center of the sea burned very bright ahead of him he could see no dark dot at the axis he hadnt expected to how far away are we in normal space rest space three point six lightyears no problems i believe i can hold us above the plane of the disk until we have passed that very active swelling ahead of us between two and three lightyears from the singularity corbell looked down at his drive flame a dim wisp of white between his feet there was very little matter above the disk he guessed suppose you cant suppose we have to go through it youll never feel a thing that region is where the stars lose their identity they become streamers of dense plasma with nodules of neutronium in them most of the light comes from there beyond there is very great flattening and some radiation due to friction in the matter spiraling inward what about the black hole itself i still dont have a view of it i estimate a circumference of two billion kilometers and a mass of one hundred million solar masses the ergosphere will be large we should have no trouble choosing a path through it you said circumference should i have given you the radius the radius of a black hole may be infinite there was simply no grasping the size of that disk of crushed stars it was like flying above another universe at two billion kilometers the black hole would almost have contained the orbit of jupiter but if corbell could have seen past that sweffing ahead that ring of fire he would have found the black hole invisibly small light caught the corner of his eye and he turned to see a supernova glaring whiteonred hed just missed seeing a sun torn apart by tides its tenmilliondegree heart spilled across the sky he asked what he had never asked before peerssa what are you thinking i dont quite know how to answer that im not thinking anything my decisions are made they are mathematically rigorous i face no choices how are you going to find earth i know where so will be in three million years three wont it be more like seventy thousand were diving deep into a tremendous gravity field time will be compressed for us the black hole is large enough that tides will not tear us apart but well lose almost three million years before i fire the fusion motor what more can i do the odds are finite that we will find sol or the state may have spread through a million cubic lightyears of space before we arrive the odds are finite peerssa youre strange but corbell felt no urge to laugh seventy thousand years bc there had been neanderthal man and a few cromagnon humans three million years ago nothing but a clubswinging meateating ape what would inhabit the earth three million years from now corbell spent most of his time in the womb room watching the accretion disk swirl past he liked the uncorrected view the display that showed the universe distorted by don juans velocity since turnover the ship had shed most of its enormous relativistic mass don juan had been moving faster after corbells first term in the coldsleep tank but it was still traveling near ightspeed and accelerating steadily under the pull of a pointsource one hundred million times the mass of the sun the accretion disk showed rainbowcolored ahead of him with the ring of fire a violetwhite hill coming near the stars were jammed together you couldnt tell one from the next unless the next had exploded they graded back through the rainbow until the sea of flame behind don juan was deep red and frozen in place with the occasional supernova showing yellowwhite or greenishwhite the ring of firethe swollen region where the heat trapped within the streaming starstuff grew even more powerful than the black holes compression effectcame near it was blindingbright before corbel gave up reduce that light he said half covering his eyes ive cut it to ten percent let me know when i must cut it again are you all right will it burn out your cameras i think not remember you were to dive almost into so to decelerate at the end of your mission we can hanзlle high intensities of light the ring of fire was a flattened doughnut twenty lightyears in circumference a quarter of a lightyear thick four or five cubic lightyears of greentobluewhite star with every possible grade of fusion and fission going on in it as if hel were a tremendous mountain coming near and don juan crossed it on a fan of fusion flame thrusting hard corbell felt the thrust drop away he sat forward as the ship dropped along the inner gradient and left the ring of fire behind a dull red wall the inner accretion disk was drastically thinner savagely compressed corbell peered toward where the black hole ought to be all he saw was more starmatter hurtingly violetwhite at the center it was all happening terribly fast now minutes left or seconds peerssa was firing the attitude jets at strange angles there were no stars to see in this inner disk no detail at all it was as uniform as peanut butter its all neutronium said peerssa it even has some of neutroniums crystalline structure but that structure is constantly breaking up i can see the xray flashes like ripples i wish i had some of your senses the computer link behind them the ring of fire reddened further and was gone the inner disk grew brighter and bluer and was suddenly past in the last instant corbell saw the black hole the onboard fusion drive roared beneath him slammed him down into his chair light exploded in his face it resolved a blaze of violet light ahead of him a broad ring of embers around it elsewhere black peerssa said there is something we must discuss wait a minute give me a chance to resume breathing peerssa waited corbell said its over we lived through that yes well done thank you whats happening now firing a reaction drive within the ergosphere of a black hole has driven us dangerously near lightspeed i am using the ram fields to ward interstellar matter from us i wont be able to use them as a drive until we can shed some velocity we will reach the vicinity of sol in thirteen point eight years ships time unless we overshoot did we really lose three million years yes corbell i must have your opinion will the state have collapsed over three million years corbel laughed a little shakily well be lucky if theres anything like human beings left i cant guess what theyll be like three million years i wish thered been another way to do it he stood up he was suddenly ravenous peerssa answered i was ordered to preserve your life and the integrity of the ship but never your convenience my loyalty is to the state corbell stopped whats that supposed to mean there was another way to use the black hole once we knew it existed at midpoint we could have continued to accelerate we would have spent perhaps eighty years reaching the galactic hub if we passed near enough to the black hole its spin would have bent our hyperbolic path back upon itself though we would still have been well outside the ergosphere another eighty years of ships time would have returned us to sol seventy thousand years after your departure you thought of that and you didnt do it corbel i have no data on the nature of watermonopoly empires i had to take your word entirely what are you talking about his answer came in corbels recorded voice think the state could last seventy or a hundred thousand see these watermonopoly empires they dont collapse they can rot from within to the point where a single push from the barbarians outside can topple them the levels of society lose touch with each other and when it comes to the crunch they cant fight but it takes that push from outside theres no revolution in a water empire corbel said i dont a water empire can grow so feeble that a single barbarian horde can topple it but peerssa the state doesnt have any outside i dont understand the state could last seventy or a hundred thousand years because all of humanity was part of the state therз were no barbarians waiting hungrily for the state to show weakness the state could have grown feeble beyond any precedent feeble enough to fall before the hatred of a single barbarian you corbell you me did you exaggerate the situation i thought of that but i couldnt risk it and i couldnt ask hes a computer perfect memory rigid logic no judgment i forgot i talked to him like a human being and nowyou have heroically saved the state from me ill be damned was the danger unreal i couldnt ask you might have lied i never wanted to overthrow the damn government all i wanted was a normal life i was only fortyfour years old i didnt want to die you never could have had what you called a normal life it was already impossible in twentyone ninety aimo domini i guess not i just didnt didnt see it lets go home chapter the house divided i he remembered posters he had bought them in a little shop in kansas city and taped them to his bedroom wall they had been there for a year before he tired of them blownup photographs of the planet earth taken from close orbit and from behind the moon by apollo astronauts in his memory earth was all the shades of blue frosted with masses and clots of white cloud even the land was blue tinged with other colors except where a rare redbrown patch of desert showed through jerome branch corbell bald and wrinkled and very thin from his time in the coldsleep tank hovered in black space in a contour couch surrounded by an arc of lighted dials and gauges clouds and landscape raced past three hundred miles below it could have been earth even the shapes of seas and continents seemed vaguely familiar there was far too much reddishbrown in the mix but after all three million years he tried his voice it was husky rusty with long sleep and pitched too high is it earth i dont know said peerssa peerssa thats silly is this the solar system or isnt it try not to get excited corbell i dont know if this is sol system the data conflict this is the system from which came messages i followed them to their source lets hear these messages why didnt you wake me earlier before we were committed we were committed before i found the anomalies i waited until we had achieved orbit before i woke you i was afraid you might die of the shock you cant tolerate another spell in cold sleep corbell you would not live to reach another star corbell nodded this last of his thawings was the worst yet it was like waking with asian flu and a brandy hangover he felt sick and ugly less than ten years ago by the evidence of his memory the state had brought a young man to life ten years awake plus a century and a half in cold sleep had left of the young man a withered stack of bones he had grown mortally afraid of senility but his thoughts seemed clear lets deal with the messages he said what appeared on the womb room walls was not quite reality peerssa controlled those images peerssa projected what his senses picked up from the world below now peerssa made a window appear in what had been deep space through the window corbell saw two translucent cubes slowly rotating within the cubes were shapes and figures formed in much tinier cubesabout a hundred per side a laser was beamed at me while i was still thirtytwo lightyears distant from this star system said peerssa there were two separate messages two sequences of dots and gaps each totaling one million thirty thousand three hundred and one bits each one hundred and one cubed one hundred and one is prime there is some ambiguity of course i may have reversed left for right it was not the best way to make pictures but corbell could recognize a man and a woman holding hands the same figures in each cube there were polygons of assorted sizes in rows and rough spheres peerssa created a red arrow for a pointer in your opinion are these intended to represent human beings sure he indicated the similar figures in the righthand cube and these yes the arrow returned to the lefthand cube this was the first message to arrive these figures may represent atomss carbon and hydrogen and oxygen do you agree for all of me they do why would they be there they form the basis for protoplasmic chemistry this bigger row might it be a solar system the large nearly spherical hollow object would be the sun the symbols inside may be four hydrogen atoms next to a helium atom the row of smaller polygons would be planets all right is it the solar system not unless the solar system has changed radically what about this second cube why are these human figures different from the others corbell looked from one to the other in the first message the figures were solid except for hollow bubbles to mark the lungs the cubistic figures in the second group were hollow and there was an x of small cubes running through them i think i see theyre crossed out in that second message and those rows of polygons look like eight more stellar systems suns and planets drawn smaller some double suns what message do you see eight star systems two with double stars crossedout hollow people all right read it this way to whom it may concern we are human we fit the given model our chemistry is based on carbon and water we come from a star system that looks like this the similar people who come from these eight other systems look human but they arent accept no substitutes does that sound right i agree well its a very human thing to say i could see your precious state sending a message like that except except the state didnt have any natural enemies everyone belonged to the state so this is the message you followed home yes i felt that human beings must have sent it and i was not sure of finding sol otherwise how did they find us whoever sent that beam would have had to find us a couple of hundred lightyears out we were still moving at near lightspeed werent we the exhaust from a ramship would be most conspicuous to the right instruments but the returning beam was very powerful sending it required strong motives corbell smiled in evil satisfaction the strongest heresy your state came apart peerssa the colonies revolted the state around sol must have wanted to warn any returning starships dont stop at the colonies the state was a watermonopoly empire as you told me such entities do not die by internal revolution they die only by conquest by an outside force corbell laughed he didnt like the sound a highpitched cackle im not a history teacher peerssa you idiot im an architect it was a friend who told me about watercontrol empires and hes one of he was one of these guys who say everything in absolutes because it gets more attention i never knew how seriously to take him but you believe him oh a little but what empire ever lasted seventy thousand years if you hadnt taken me so damn seriously wed have been home two million nine hundred and thirty thousand years ago corbell was studying the pattern of the sun and planets in the lefthand cube were in a system that matches that picture yes there was the sun then three small objects then a large object with a conspicuous lump on it then three mediumsized objects the earth isnt there otherwise do you see the body now rising beyond this worlds horizon for a split second corbell thought it was the moon rising above the worlds hazy edge it was half full it showed bigger than the moon it glowed in white and orangewhite bands along the lighted side what should have been the dark side glowed just at red heat peerssa said this oxygenatmosphere world we circle is in orbit about that larger body the primary is a massive gas giant hotter than theory would account for there are other anomalies in this system were in orbit about a moon of that thing i said that yes corbells head whirled all right peerssa show me peerssa showed him with diagrams and with photographs taken during don juans fiery fall through the system the sun was a young red giant swollen and hot of about one solar mass but with a diameter of ten million kilometers peerssa showed him the inner planet next to a map of mercury granted the two planets resembled each other but this systems version was scarred and gouged in a different pattern the second planet had considerably less atmosphere than venus and what there was included some oxygen but it was the right size and in the right place there was nothing in earths orbit the third planet remarkably resembled mars but for the lack of moons and the great featureless mare marring one face there are curious parallels all through the system peerssa remarked corbells reaction to these revelations was a slowly mounting anger had he come home or hadnt he right curious what about earth a moon much like the earth circled this fourth planet a world as massive as jupiter but far hotter than a world at this distance from its primary ought to be even given the hotter sun it was pouring out infrared radiation in enormous quantities and more dangerous radiation too and th other moons their orbits would be funny anyway theyd have been altered when the earth was moved into place if thats earth i thought of that but i can find no moon of this world analogous to ganymede the biggest of the jovian moons all right go on the fifth planet was an unknown an ice giant in a drunken skewed orbit that took it from just inside the jovians orbit almost out to the sixth planets it was near the jovian now nakedeye visible from don juan peerssa showed him a close view of a marble banded in pale blues this system may be much younger than sol system peerssa said the skewed orbit of the fifth planet has not had time to become circular via tidal effects the jovian is hot because it only recently condensed from the planetary nebula the star has not yet settled down to steady burning what about this earthlike world could it have evolved that fast i didnt think so and that third planet looked a lot like mars but not enough dammit then observe the sixth the sixth planetwell it looked like a target don juan had crossed nearly over the north pole nestled within banded white rings was the fainter banding of an icegiant planet in very pale blues and greens the oval shadow of the planet lay across the rings rendering the transparent inner ring invisible the sharpedged rift must be cassinis divide corbell thought he found other lesser rifts probably caused by tides from smaller moons saturn he said it resembles saturn most remarkably i went to some effort to take our course near this sixth planet i tried to find discrepancies thats saturn but nothing else matches my memory somebodys been mucking with the solar system three million years a lot could have happened the sun so could not have become a red giant in three million years it is too young theory will not allow it theory does allow a similarity in the formation of planetary systems that is saturn and that is earth corbell is it not possible that state citizens settled a moon of a jovian world might they have recreated saturns rings for nostalgia and the love of beauty you tell me is the love of beauty that powerful it was a strange concept it bad its attractions but no it doesnt hold up theyd have put the rings around the jovian for a better view and why would they build another mars why would the state destroy the topography of mercury what removed twothirds of the atmosphere of venus and changed its chemistry uranus is missing ganymede is missing a body bigger than mercury a gas giant more massive than neptune orbits nearer the sun in a skewed orbit that hotter sun could have burned away part of venuss atmosphere mercury hmmm what changed the sun how could the earth have been moved at all corbell i cant decide there might have been agony in the computers voice indecision was bad for men but men could live with it a mans memories could fade and grow blurred but not peerssas they moved the earth because the sun got too hot corbell speculated what do you imagine did the state moor huge rocket motors at the north pole and fuel them with venuss atmosphere the ocean would have flowed to cover the northern hemisphere the earths surface would have ripped everywhere exposing magma i dont know i dont know maybe they had something besides rockets but that was mars you showed me and thats saturn and thats earth there couldnt that be the coast of brazil it does not match my memory with evident reluctance peerssa added if other evidence were not considered that shoreline could be the edge of the brazilian continental shelf altered by the shifting of tectonic plates the ocean must have dropped maybe some megatons of water vapor got left behind when they moved the earth the state could not have moved the earth there would have been no need because sol was not an incipient red giant computer you cant go against your theories can you what if we were in the ergosphere of a black hole longer than we thought we might have lost more than three million years in tens of miffions of years could the sun be a red giant nonsense we would never have found sol at all that was the last straw because it was true corbell was an uncomfortably old man with a coldsleep hangover all right he said between his teeth you win the argument now for purposes of discussion we are going to assume that that planet is earth at long last we have come home to earth now how do i get down it developed that peerssa had that all figured out ii corbells pressure suit looked clean and new it was formfitting with a bulging bulb of a helmet and a pointyended white spiral on the chest he would not have been surprised to find it rotted with age it had been waiting for nearly two hundred years ships time he went out the airlock with the suspicion that he was going to his death he had never done this before and in fact the suit held up better than he did panting perspiring with his pulse thundering irregularly in his ears be maneuvered himself at the end of a tether and turned for a look at don juan the silver finish had dulled corbell winced at the sight of a gaping hole in one of the probes peerssa had never mentioned a meteor strike it could as easily have hit the lifesupport system four of the probes were missing the biological package probes were what made don juan a seeder ramship each of the probes held a spectrum of algae with which to seed the unbreathable reducing atmosphere of some nearby earthlike world to turn the atmosphere into breathable air and the world into a potential colony of course they had never been used for that purpose deprived in detail of his civil rights corbell had stolen the ship and lit out for the galactic core there had been ten probes mounted around don juans waist now there were six i ran the onboard hydrogen tank nearly empty peerssa explained i had to use four of the thrust systems in the probes to make orbit around earth afterward i put the probes in orbits as relay satellites you will be able to call me from the surface wherever you are good how do you feel can you survive a reentry not yet im out of shape give me a month youll have it youll have exercise too we must make ready one of the probes for your descent im going down in one of those they are designed to enter an atmosphere don juan is not i should have thought of that i never did figure a safe way to get down arent you coming down yourself not unless you so order small wonder if he sounded reluctant it came to corbell that peerssas body was the ship he would be a total paraplegic if he survived reentry corbell said thomas jefferson freed his slaves on his death can i do less after im down living or dead magnanimously i free you from all orders previous or subsequent thank you corbell he had trained to work in a pressure suit under orders from pierce the checker but hed been suspended in a magnetic field not in actual freefall and he had trained in a young body long ago the work was hard on the second day he hurt everywhere on the third he was back at work he would stop only when peerssa insisted we wont try to build you a lifesupport system peerssa told him well put what you need in the capsule with you and fill the capsule with plastic foam your suit will be your lifesupport system but emptying the probe warhead involved moving large masses and manhandling the bulky cutting laser for hours at a time the algae tanks and the machinery that served them had to be removed in inspectionhatchsized pieces corbell dared not rip the hull his life depended on its integrity he needed long rest periods he spent them in the womb room watching ifims of don juans entry into what peerssa now called the solar system for a computer peerssa had been starkly ingenious corbell would not have thought of using the package probes as thrusters he would not have looked for earth as a big new moon of what peerssa now called jupiterand peerssa nearly hadnt either peerssa came that close to departing sol with corbell still in cold sleep to search nearby systems for remnants of the state corbell probably would have died en route apparently the question of where they were no longer bothered peerssa it had only required corbells order to stop his worrying about it but at the time corbell gathered peerssa was frantic he had used fuel he couldnt spare to make close flybys past saturn and mercury now corbell looked down at the earth and yearned all the mistakes i made and still i got here the mistakes all canceled if i hadnt turned the receiver back on you couldnt have beamed your personality into the computer id have wrecked the ship trying to run all the way at one gravity if id been right about the galactic core id have died of old age that far from home its like something led me back here your records call you an agnostic yeah im whistling in the dark i keep thinking ill just barely get killed landing he was taking a long rest period in celebration he had finally finished cleaning debris out of the probe warhead with a meal in his handa layered sandwich baked like a cakehe watched the landscape roll below him a dull red highlight gleamed on the nightside ocean below jupiter where do i want to land is there any sign of civilization down there there is evidence of the generation and use of power in three places on the huge blue face of the planet a green arrow suddenly pointed at a green grid pattern here and on the other side of the world and in antarctica my orbit does not cover antarctica but i can land you there no thanks isnt that just about california thinking wait a minute the west coast ought to bulge and wheres baja california from what seemed to be central mexico the coast was a convex sweep all the way up to what must be alaska most of what you called california and baja california wifi be an island near the north pole i can land you there too no wherever someone is generating power thats where i want to land there where you put the grid pattern which looks a little like a city doesnt it right angles there are many clustered buildings yes but no strong evidence of preplanning your era would have called it a city i advise against your landing there if theyre the ones who sent the messages they probably wont kill me i served their ancestral state it might be nevada he thought or arizona it was on the seacoast now the differences between peerssa stopped corbell got angry thats earth earth the screwedup solar system bothered him too when he let it peerssa that was earths plate tectonics you were describing did you find the island that used to be california i found two islands that might have been california three miffion years ago well then did that happen by coincidence no peerssa lied call that area where you put the grid one city call the antarctic area three city now what about two city where is that bordering the sea of okhotsk in russia land me in one city then more calmly corbell added i must be nuts looking for civilization why do i want to spend my last days fighting a foreign language but maybe ill have time to find out what happened here corbell filled the probe nose cone with medicines food a tank of fresh water tanks of oxygen the plastic foam would hold them he moored more solidly the ultrasonic whistle controlled by signal from peerssa that would melt the foam he had put on muscle weight the heart attack he feared and thought he was prepared for had never come don juans twentysecondcentury medicines had given him that but he lived with hot wires in his shoulders tendonitis at the lastbraced in the middle of the ravaged nose compartment with one hand on the spigot of the foam tankhe hesitated peerssa can you hear me yes what will you do after im down i will wait until i am sure you are dead then i will search other systems for the state youre no crazier than i am he wondered how long peerssa expected him to lastand didnt ask he opened the spigot foam surrounded him and congealed thrust built up under his back held for a time then eased to almost nothing presently there was turbulence it was a powered landing not a meteoric reentry the thrust built up again held died the probe rotated and there was a jar that drove him two inches into the foam peerssa spoke in his suit radio may i consider myself free of your commands corbell suffered a quick vividly detailed nightmare melt the foam first he cried but peerssa was no longer bound by his orders peerssa would take vengeance on one whom the state considered a criminal and archingrate the foam would not melt corbell would die here embedded like a fly in amber his freedom mere yards away he felt a lurch then another the nightmare ended he sank through melting foam blind to a solid bulkhead the foam ran from his faceplate and he saw that the inspection hatch was wide open corbell stepped into the opening and looked out and down peerssa had landed the big cylinder on its side on attitude jets the sun high overhead was nonetheless a sunset sun red and inflated the land ran flat to a range of sharpedged granite hills it was all dead browns and grays dead rock and dust heat made the air shimmer like water the state had not provided exit ladders for a package probe peerssa had been clever again the foam had run out the hatch and congealed into a foam plastic slope corbeli walked down it and his boots crunched as on snow partly thawed and refrozen he stepped out onto the soil of earth the soil had died three million years wars erosion loss of water when earth fled inexplicably from an inexplicably expanding sun at this moment he didnt care he raised his hands to his faceplate do not try to take off your suit corbell have you left the probe ready for his first breath of fresh air in a long time why not have you left the probe yeah good for purposes of discussion i have spoken of this world as earth now i may speak of the differences you have landed on a world marginally habitable at best in a region uninhabitably hot what corbeli looked down the outside temperature register was set at chin level below the edge of his faceplate it didnt look bad not bad atcentigrade the state used centigrade peerssa said its too hot corbell temperatures in the equatorial zone range from fiftyfive degrees centigrade upward the oceans are above fifty degrees i find little chlorophyll absorption in the oceans and none on land barring certain mountain valleys you would have done better to land near one or the other pole somehow corbell was not even shocked had he half oxpected this my death is the end of the worlda very human attitude and three million years after all so thats what happened to the oceans the atmosphere holds thousands of megatons of water vapor enough to support the hypothesis that earths continental shelves have become dry land what remains of the oceans should be very salty corbell we still dont know what about those mountain valleys in a mountain range corresponding to earths himalayas there are valleys between one and two kilometers high some life has survived there corbell sighed all right which way is civilization define civilization one city no just point me at the closest place where someone is using power four point nine kilometers distant there is minor usage of power i doubt you will find people or even living beings the power level has not varied since we made orbit i think you will find nothing but machines running automatically ill try anyway which way west i can locate you i will guide you iii corbell had not gone hiking in a long time the suit was not uncomfortable most of his equipments weight rested on his shoulders the boots were not hiking boots but they fit he set out in a rhythmic stride breathing the canned air letting his attention rove the sceneryand bad to stop very soon hed chosen too quick a pace he rested then set out in a more leisurely stroll it was level land not anklebreaking country though he had to watch his footing it was packed earth with rocks inset and there were gentle windcarved risings and failingsoff peerssa led him to the range of hills and apparently expected him to walk straight across them corbell turned left until he could find an easier slope he found he was grumbling subvocally he had had to grumble subvocally for lo these eight years waking time in which he had grown one hundred and eighty years old while three million years passed on earth grumble aloud and you couldnt know what peerssa might pick up and take as an order goddamn literal computers he grumbled sleep tanks and supermedicines that dont keep you young air and cooling equipment getting heavier with each step why couldnt they have put a belly band in this suit a belly band was the greatest invention since the wheel it let a hiker carry the weight on his hips instead of his back if the state had had its head screwed on right which was silly the suit was designed for freefall and use aboard ship not hiking and if peerssa took orders it was a damn good thing and he was lucky to be on earth at all and corbell thought as he topped the crest he was damn glad to be here puffing bent over so he could pant better half listening for the heart attack hed been expecting for so long it came to him that he was happy yeah in three million years probably no human being had ever done what he had done be nice if there were someone to brag to he saw the house it was on a higher crest of hills beyond this one otherwise he might not have noticed it it was just the color of the hills gray and dustbrown but he saw its regular shape against the blue of sky it was set against the rock slope it took him another two hours to reach it he was being careful with himself even so he knew how his legs would hurt tomorrow if there was a tomorrow he was twothirds of the way up that second range of hills when he found the remains of a broken road then it was easier the house was extravagantly designed the roof was a convex triangle almost horizontal with the base against the hill itself below the roof were two walls of glass or of something stronger the houses single room was exposed to this single voyeur who perched precariously on the slope and clutched at a boulder with thick gloves it was he thought a hell of a place to build a house he pressed his faceplate against the glass the floor was not level either the hill itself had settled or architectural styles had changed more than corbell was willing to believe he was looking into a livingroomsized area with what had to be a bed in the middle but the bed was two or three times bigger than king size and it had the asymmetrical shape of a sstyle hollywood pool the curved headboard was a control panel fitted with screens and toggles and tall grills like hifl soundboxes and a couple of slots big enough to deliver drinks or sandwiches in the darkness above the bed hovered a big wire sculpture or mobile or possibly some kind of antenna he couldnt tell which two pinpricks of yellow light lived in the control panel this is your power source all right corbell reported im going to find the door twenty minutes later he reported theres no door a house must have an opening look for an opening that doesnt look like a door from your description there must be more to the house than you can see a toilet at least perhaps an office or a food dispensary theyd have to be under the hill mmm all right ill keep looking he found no trace of a trapdoor in the roof could the whole roof lift up in one piece on signal corbell couldnt guess whether the architect would have been that wasteful of power if there was an entrance in the road itself then hard dirt covered it corbell was getting annoyed the house couldnt have been used in a hundred years possibly a thousand conceivably ten thousand likewise the door wherever it might be maybe the house had a second lower story now buried in the hill door and all ill have to break in he said wait might the house be equipped with a burglar alarm im not familiar with the design concepts that govern private dwellings the state built arcologies what if it does have a burglar alarm im wearing a helmet itll block most of the sound there might be more than bells let me attack the house with my message laser will it will it reach stupid it was designed to reach across tens of lightyears go ahead i have the house in view firing looking down on the triangular roof from his post on the roadway corbell saw no beam from the sky but he saw a spot the size of a manhole cover turn redhot a patch of earth below the house stirred uneasily rested stirred again then a ton or so of hillside rose up and spilled away and a rusted metal object floated out on a whispering air cushion it was the size of a dishwasher with a head a basketball with an eye in it the head rolled and a scarlet beam the thickness of corbells arm pierced the clouds peerssa youre being attacked can you handle it it cant hurt me it could hurt you id better destroy it the metal object began to glow it didnt like that it fled away in a jerky randomized path while the red beam remained fixed on one point in the sky its upper body glowed bright red verging on orange it was screaming its frantic warbling voice sang through corbels helmet suddenly it tilted and arced away down the hill it struck the plain hard turned over and over and lay quiet there was a hole in the roof now corbell said you think there are more of those insufficient data corbell climbed down to the roof and looked through molten concrete or whatever had set the bed afire corbell jumped down onto the flaming bedclothes prepared to get off fast wrong again it was a water bed and his feet went right through it he waded out then pushed the burning bedclothes into the puddle in the middle with his clumsy gloved hands the fire went out but the room filled with steam im in the house he reported peerssa didnt bother to answer corbell the architect looked about him this room the visible part of the house was a triangle the bed in the center had the pleasing asymmetry of a puddle of waterand it was pleasing an arc of sofa occupied one corner facing the bed in front of the sofa was a slab of black slate or a good imitation arced like the sofa but broken in the middle corbell bent and lifted one end of the slab something on the underside solid circuitry at a guess this had been a floating coffee table until whatever was holding it up burned out from inside the room he still couldnt see any doors there was only one opaque wall to inspect he moved along it rapping it sounded hollow door controls on the headboard nuts youd have to walk clear around to the other sidewait there was something on the back side three thumbsized circular depressions of chrome yellow against black headboard corbell pushed them the back wall slid up in three unequal sections the biggest one was a closet corbell found half a dozen garments in it all onepiece longsleeved garments with lots of pockets some had hoods a layer of dust at the bottom of the closet was two to three inches thick the second section was smaller no bigger than a telephone booth with a freeform chair in it corbell stepped in he found another chromeyellow despression on the wall and touched it the door shot up behind him a chair funny now he saw the great hole in the seat of the chair a toilet but there was no water in the bowl and no toilet paper nothing but a glitteringly clean metal sponge attached to the chair by a wire he left the cubicle by any terms it was pretty basic for a house with this complexity of design the owner should have been able to afford something better he turned to the clothing still hanging on shaped hangers funny he couldnt tell if they were made for a man or a woman he tugged at the fabric it was amazingly resilientand very dusty he tugged harder then tried in earnest to tear the cloth it stood his full strength this clothing seemed new but the dust say there were temporary clothes meant to be thrown out when styles changed and clothes meant to last longer how long if that layer of dust was the temporary clothes he still hadnt found a door the third cubicle looked promising there was nothing in it at all except for one unmarked switch like the yellow circle in the bathroom and a panel of four whiteglowing touch points i think ive found an elevator he said im going to try it he used the yellow touch point the door came up he turned on his helmet lamp peerssa said dangerous what if the elevator takes you down and then breaks down then you beam me another manhole to climb out of corbell pushed the top button nothing happened hed expected that he must be at the top he pushed number two peerssas voice came unnecessarily loud corbell answer if you can yeah there had been no sense of motion yet something had changed there were eight more whiteglowing touch points two additional vertical rows beside the first set closer together and each of these was marked with a black squiggle corbell jabbed at the door button peerssa said you have changed position by four point one miles southwest and two hundred feet loss of altitude i place you in one city yeah corbell looked out into a different room he was beginning to feel like a wandering ghost everything was spooky unreal he stepped out round what once must have been a floating desk but was now only kneehigh screens and pushbutton panels set into the desk made it look like the control board in the womb room but they were ruined it must have rained here for hundreds of years there was a rug like halfmelted cotton candy deep as his ankles it squished beneath his boots and tore and stuck to his suit fabric he stepped to the edge of an empty picture window frame and looked out and down thirty stories of windows and empty frames dropped away beneath his toes he saw much taller buildings around him there to the right a masonry behemoth had fallen taking buildings and pieces of buildings with it beyond that gap beyond the mist and rain he thought he could trace a grayongray outline a cube impossibly large whose walls had a slight outward curve peerssa did the state ever have any kind of instant transportation like a telephone booth but you dial and youre there well these people did i should have guessed me of all people that house wasnt a house it was only part of a house ive found the office its in the city there ought to be a bathroom and a dining room and maybe a game room god knows where what we broke into was the bedroom its likely that the machinery has not been tended for a long time bear that in mind yeah corbell stepped back into the cubicle where next he pushed the third down in the row of unmarked buttons a light flared to life in the ceiling the extra buttons had vanished corbell stepped out and smiled definitely this was the bathroom the outside temperature register at his chin was dropping i think this place is airconditioned he said you have traveled three point one miles west by southwest and have lost six hundred feet of altitude okay corbell opened his faceplate just for a moment hed close it fast if but the air was cool and fresh it came to him as he let the heavy backpack section fall that he was exhausted he pulled himself out of the rest of his armor and crouched at the edge of a bathtub almost big enough to be called a pool he couldnt read the markings on the water spigot he turned it all the way in one direction and pushed it on hot water splashed into the tub he turned it the other way boiling water spurted out spitting steam he recoiled if hed been in the tub okay the cold water was hot but it wasnt too hot to stand it flooded out and around him as he lolled on the curv ed bottom a tiny voice called corbell answer he reached and pulled the helmet to the edge im taking a rest break check back in an hour and send me a dancing girl iv a tiny voice peeped can repeating corbell answer if you can repeating corbell corbell opened his eyes every texture was strange to his sight and his touch he was nowhere aboard don juan then where ah hed found two projections at the edge of the sunken tub soft mounds like a pair of falsies just right to rest his head between his neck was still between the pilows lukewarm water enveloped him hed gone to sleep in the tub if you can repeat corbell puled the pressuresuit helmet to him here your hours gone and another hour and six minutes are you sick no just sleepy hang on he pulled the spigot on hot water spurted through cool water and mixed corbell stirred with his foot im still on a rest break anything new at your end somethings watching me i sense radar and gravity radiation gravity gravity waves going through my mass sensor yes im being probed by advanced instruments which must have learned a great deal about me they could be automatic they could also be from whoever sent the messages where is all this action coming from from what would be tasmania if this were earth the probing has stopped i cant detect the source if it starts throwing missiles at you youll have to pull out fast yes il have to change my orbit i didnt want to use the fuel but my orbit does not take me over antarctica do that corbell stood up and waded dripping from the warm water a line of thick dust against the base of a wall might have been the remains of towels he stopped before a picture window the day had darkened he looked down across a shallow slope of beach sand downhill into haze that thickened to opaque mist was that a fish skeleton down there glimmering white through haze it looked far distantand big lightning flared waited flared again the rain fell like an avalanche corbell turned away he put on his undersuit then his pressure suit piece by piece feeling the weight and the chafe spots the bath had been good he would have to come back here when he got the chance there was even a sauna not that hed need yeah a sauna this place was old if it had been built after the earth grew hot the sauna would have been a door to the outside he stood in the booth dithered and decided not to push the bottom button peerssa was right the machinery had been untended for a long time so bedroom or office he knew those circuits still worked bedroom he stepped out next to his chin the temperature readout rose in blinking numerals he stepped around to the headboard confirmed a memory he had seen a television screen and controls he turned it on the screen lit first graywhite then it was a fuzzy view of the ruined bed showing his own armored legs he tried switches until he found the playback the scene ran backward suddenly the bed was whole and four figures writhed on it at flickering speed the scene jumped to a different foursome or to the same foursome differently dressed before he found a way to freeze it corbell i have tried to signal the source of the probes to no effect okay listen if you have to run just do it well both be safer if you dont stop to call me about it what will you do now im watching home movies corbell chortled this place is like the playboy mansion theres an invisible video camera focused on the bed a degenerate civilization then small wonder they could not save themselves you should not degrade yourself by watching what are you what about the loving bunks in the dormitory in selerdor that wasnt degenerate it was not thought polite to watch the loving bunks corbell swallowed his annoyance i want to know if theyre still human are they the tapes faded and theyre wearing clothes loose suits with lots of openings in them in pastels if they arent human i cant see the differences but theyre thin and they dont seem to carry themselves right he paused to watch and theyre very limber the situation isnt quite what i thought in what way i thought it was an orgy for four it isnt its like in ancient china two of them are servants theyre helping the other pair get into those advanced sexual positions maybe theyre not servants maybe theyre trainers or teachers he watched some more or even theyre as limber as dancers maybe thats what they are i wish i had a view of the couch there might be spectators corbell yeah are you hungry yeah i may have to use that fourth button i wouldnt bother if a thousandyearold kitchen is your only food source youll die quickly your suit will only recycle air for another seventyone hours your foodsyrup reserve is trivial i suggest you try to reach the south pole i am over it now i see a large continental mass and forest well fine corbell switched off the stag movie and made for the booth the second button down created a panel of eight buttons beside the smaller panel he studied it the symbols on those eight buttons might be letters or numbers he reached then drew back im afraid of it of what of this panel in the office see there are four white buttons in all the booths i think thats an intercom a closed circuit you couldnt get into it except from the office or by breaking in the way we did but there are eight buttons with squiggles on them here in the office i think they must be more like a telephone dial and theres a private number that lets you into the office reasonable well what happens when you dial a phone number at random in my time there was a recorded voice to tell you you had made a mistake yeah we had that too but in this instant transportation setup you might be sent nowhere pool that would be poor design can you find a telephone directory there was nothing like that in the booth corbell opened the door rain and howling wind were blowing into the office fat drops plated themselves across his faceplate he walked around the desk waited a minute for the water to run off the glass then began puffing at desk drawers they didnt want to open he pried one open and found it half full of graygreen mold an abandoned apple machines were set into the desktop telephone picturephone computer link what no telling now time and rain had destroyed them ill have to try pushing buttons at random he told peerssa good luck why did you say that to be polite corbell examined the array of eight buttons by the light from his helmet the booth could kill him so fast hed never know it punch at random he could do better than that he chose a buttonthe fifth counting across and down whose symbol looked like an upsidedown l a gallows he pushed it once pause twice pause thrice four did it suddenly there was indirect lighting around the rim of the ceiling the door wouldnt open annoyed he chose another button an hourglass on its side and compressed from both ends you have changed position twice peerssa informed him this time the door opened there were disintegrating skeletons in identical uniforms loose garments short pants sleeveless shirts with rolls of fabric at the shoulders under the dust the garments looked new in bright scarlet with black markings the bones inside were crumbled with age but they could not have been big men five feet tall or thereabouts corbell moved among them looking for bullet wounds no holes in the garments or the skulls but from the way they sprawled they seemed to have died in a firefight and they seemed to be human he found desks and what looked like computer terminals a thick sliding door had been melted out of the wall beyond it were cells their gridwork doors were decoratively lacy and different on each cell but they were locked and there were more skeletons in the cells police station he reported to peerssa i was trying for a restaurant i pushed the same button four times he heard irritation in his voice getting tired see what i didnt want was a number that went nowhere the numbers the restaurants fight for are the ones that are easiest to remember at least they used to be the state restricts those numbers to important municipal functions police stations hospitals ombudsmen corbell stepped through another larger melted door doors beyond retracted before him and he stepped into a waterfall of rain hed finally made it outside he couldnt see much a city street and occasional heaps of clothing peeking through the mud skimpy onepiece shortsandundershirt garments in every pattern and color save scarlet ill have to try the other repeating numbers he said without moving i think it is safe if you find a number not in use you will not go nowhere youre willing to risk that huh he still hadnt moved the rain ran down his faceplate and drummed on his helmet there is an alternative i have probed the city with my senses there is hollow space a system of tunnels underground leading away in many directions i can lead you to the underground space where they converge whats the point of you think its a subway system theyd have stopped using it when they invented the booths if they no longer used the subway cars they may have kept the buildings as a transportation nexus economy v he walked through pelting rain on packed dirt covered by thin mud it sucked at his boots he couldnt afford the energy that cost him he was already too tired the streets and buildings were largely intact he found no more scenes of mass death there was a bubble half glass and half metal like a christmastree ornament twelve feet across it had smashed against the side of a building and was half full of rainwater corbell looked inside he found spongy upholstery and a pair of seats one was occupied mud with lumps of bone in it oozed from within a yellow shortsandundershirt garment corbell forced himself to search the big patch pockets what he found he stowed in his tool pouch he could examine it later he walked on later there was an intact bubble abandoned it looked intact the brightwork in the interior gleamed he tried to start it but nothing he tried seemed to work he gave up and went on now there was a tremendous empty lot to one side with windweathered stumps of trees and traces of curving paths a park to his other side was a wall that went up and up curving away from view it curved away from before and behind him too so that he had no idea how high it was or how wide in the mists beyond the office picture window he had thought to trace the outlines of a cube bigger than belief so it had been real streets why streets and cars corbell began to suspect what he would find at the transportation nexus you are over the hollow space said peerssa thats good im tired corbell looked around him mummified park to the left wall to the right ahead the wall turned to glass an entire wall of glass doors he pushed through into gloom lit by his helmet lamp the ceiling gave no sense of distance only of random colors that changed with his position the place was wide his beam got lost in it he glanced down at another confusing light the glow of dials at his chin the temperature was down to c airconditioned he said good your suit batteries will last longer there could be anything in this place he argued with himself he opened his faceplate no heat sniffed a touch of staleness that was all ive got to get out of this suit im tired drink from the syrup nipple he laughed hed forgotten it was there he sucked until his belly felt less empty peerssa was right half of his tiredness had been hunger he pulled himself out of the rest of the suit stepping into the rug was a sudden thrilling shock it might be the same as the rotted rug in the office but it was dry intact and ankledeep like walking on a cloud it felt damned expensive but there must have been an acre of it here in the foyer of a public building going to sleep he told the helmet he sprawled out in the cloud of carpet and let it close around him vi gray dawn he wriggled a little in the luxury of the rug the ceiling was thousands of shades of color in what seemed to be whorl patterns you could go crazy staring into it and never know how far away it was he closed his eyes and dozed again came down to die he thought he said peerssa how do you expect me to die heart attack no answer the helmet was out there by his fingertips he pulled it close and repeated the question i think not said peerssa why the states wonderful medicines yes if one counts contraceptives as medicines after the founding of the state there was a generation in which no man or woman subject to inherited diseases might have children the population fell by half famine ended heart patients his father had died of a coronary certainly the children of heart patients were not allowed to have children your genes are those of a criminal but a healthy one you arrogant sons of bitches what about my children their father was cancerprone so theyd edited corbells genes from the human race and it was three million years too late to do anything about it corbell got up stretched against stiff muscles and looked about him there were rings of couches around freely curved tables that still floated the couches looked like humps in the rug nuts said corbell i could have slept on a couch he pushed down on a floating table finally putting his full weight on both hands hed lowered the table an inch when he released it it bobbed up again set within one wall was a row of booths corbell went to examine them the rugstuff flowed delightfully around his toes in each booth were rows of pushbuttons marked with squiggles a dozen buttons with the eight marks hed seen already and four new ones he pushed a button larger than the others and got no response then he noticed the slot from the tool pouch of his empty pressure suit he spilled the items he had stolen from a smashed car a seamless silver lipstick did nothing for him handkerchief faint colors seemed to swirl in the material candy wrapper the hard candy must have melted in untold years of rain or it could have been drugs or medicine or he could be wrong on every point a handsized disk of clear plastic its run also plastic embedded with green ornamental squiggles that looked about right which way was up he tried it in one of the booths it wouldnt fit in the slot with the markings up with the markings down it did he pushed the larger button and the screen lit up now what the screens might be the phone books he needed all he had to do was punch for information without reaching a nonexistent number and read the answer in squiggles corbell was sweating he hadnt thought this out he lowered his hands and stepped out of the booth well no hurry his twodaysplus air reserve was not being used there was time to explore and there far at the back of the lobby were the stairs hed expected broad well designed by the principles he had learned in his first life carpeted in cloudrug a ffight of stairs going down into darkness he went back to tuck his helmet in the crook of his elbow and to retrieve the lensshaped key credit card then he started down the stairs playing his helmet lamp ahead of him humming with her head tooked underneath her arm she waaaiks the bloody tower the stairs unexpectedly lurched into motion throwing him back ward he sat up cursing he hadnt hurt himself but get crippled here and it would be his death light grew below him at first he thought this was the last gasp of an emergency power system the light blossomed when he reached bottom it was bright as daylight he was in a vast open space with a high ceiling and alcoves he thought were shops a place with the feel of a european train station but with touches of sybaritic luxury more appropriate to a palace there were fountains and more of the ankleenveloping rug swelling to rings of couches along one entire wall peerssa ive found a map please describe it its two polar projections damn i wish i could show you the continents are about the way they were when i was in school these maps must have been made before all that ocean water evaporated there are lines across them all fromhe checkedthis point think most of the lines are dark peerssa the only lines still lighted run to antarctica and the tip of argentina and uh alaska alaska had been twisted north so had the tip of siberia the lines run right through oceans or under them he saw that what hed taken for shops were alcoves with couches and fooddispensing walls he tried one when he inserted the plastic disk a womans voice spoke in tones of regret he tried other slots and got the same reedy voice repeating the same incomprehensible words next stop down there at the far end that line of doors thick doors with slots for credit disks he went back for his pressure suit the stairs carried him up how the heck did they handle streams of commuters going both ways he rode back down with the heavy suit draped over his shoulder there were lighted squiggles on the map next to the lighted lines he memorized the pattern that marked the route he wanted not to the center of the thawed antarctic continent but to the nearer shore shores get colonized first the doors yes there was the pattern of squiggles he wanted the disk he found it turned it blank side up and inserted it the door opened he retrieved the disk glanced at it and smiled the squiggles had changed hed been docked the price of a ticket he faced glass within glass within concrete the end of the subway car protruded slightly from its socket in the wall it was a circle of glass eight feet across with an oval glass door in it through the glass corbell saw a cylindrical car lined with seats facing each other and padded in cloudrug the front of the car was metal he found a disksized slot in the glass door he used it the door opened he entered and pulled the disk out of the other side the door closed here i am he said into the helmet where in one of the subway cars i dont know what to do next wait i guess you arent going to use the instanttransportation booths no i think that was a dead end maybe they were toys for the rich too expensive to be practical or too shortrange why else would there be streets with cars on them the streets were too good and there were too many cars i wondered peerssa said four digits in base eight gives only four thousand and ninetysix possible booth numbers too few yeah there was room for about eight people he decided on benches of cloudrug tinted at intervals in contrasting pastels to mark off the seats he found another food dispenser which spoke to him regretfully when he tried it behind a halfdoor that would barely hide ones torso he found a toilet again equipped with one of the glitteringly clean metal sponges he tried that too his best guess was that the sponge had an instantelsewhere unit in it it cleaned itself miraculously there were arms for the benches they had to be pulled out of a slot along the back and locked there is increased power usage from your locus said peerssa then somethings happening corbell stretched out on the cloudrug bench to wait no telling about departure time he would wait twentyfour hours before he gave up his stomach growled chapter the norm i somebody spoke to him corbell jerked violently and woke with a scream on his lips who but peerssa could speak to him here but he was not aboard don juan the voice had stopped peerssa spoke from his helmet i do not recognize the language did you expect to play it again for me he listened to peerssas recording of a boyish voice speaking in reassuring liquid tones afterward he sighed if that guy was waiting to meet me himself what could i tell him what could he tell me ill probably be dead before i could learn his language your story has wrung my heart most of your contemporaries only had one life to live yeah your selfcentered viewpoint has always bothered me if you could see yourself as no wait a minute youre right youre dead right ive had more than most men are given more than most men can steal for that matter im going to stop bitching new file you amaze me will you now dedicate your services to the state what state the states dead my seifcenteredness is as human as your fanaticism the strangers voice spoke again in beautiful incomprehensible wordsand corbell saw him his face was beyond the cars forward wall beyond the metal as if the metal were transparent a hologram corbell leaned forward it was the bust of a boy fading below the shoulders he was twelve or so corbell guessed but he had the poise of an adult his skin was golden his features were a blend of races black yellow white and something else a mutation perhaps that left him half bald he had only a fringe of tightly curled black hair around the base of the skull and over the ears and an isolated tuft above the forehead the face smiled reassuringly and vanished the car shot forward and down corbell was on a roller coaster he pulled out a chair arm and hung on the car fell at a slant for what felt like half a minute then there was high gravity as car and tunnel curved back to horizontal light inside darkness outside corbell was beginning to relax when the car rolled surged to the left rolled surged to the right steadied what was that changing tunnels his ears popped peerssa spoke your speed is in excess of eight hundred kilometers per hour and still accelerating a remarkable achievement how do they do it at a guess you are riding a gravityassisted linear accelerator through an evacuated tunnel you are about to pass beneath the pacific ocean can you still hear me barely corbell answer if you can corbell answer peerssas voice faded completely peerssa nothing corbells ears and sinuses felt pressure he worked his jaw there was no reason to panic he told himself peerssa would pick him up when he reached antarctica the hissing sound of motion was sleepinducing corbell was tempted to lie downpreferably with his feet forward because there would be deceleration at the end to sleep perchance to dream what kind of dreams does the last man on earth shave while traveling beneath the pacific ocean at mach oneandahalf in a subway system that hadnt been repaired in hundreds of years he could be stopped beneath the pacific to suffocate slowly while an almost human ghost reassured him that service would be resumed as soon as possible peerssa could wait forever for him to emerge too much imagination and ill scare myself to death too little and ill get myself killed corbell worked his jaw to relieve pressure in his ears had peerssa said evacuated he poked his head into the helmet to see the dials air pressure was down and still dropping he panted as he worked his way into the pressure suit vacuum tunnel right he gasped stupid stupid the car leaks and what else had deteriorated in this ancient system of tunnels but now the ride was superlatively smooth presently corbell emptied his bladder then emptied his suits bladder into the toilet the urine ran boiling through the bowl without leaving a trace a frictionless surface hours passed he dozed sitting up woke lay down on his face didnt like that lay down on his back with the backpack a bulge under his shoulders and a chair arm under his head better he slept a surge woke him he sat up he sucked syrup sucked the last of it and it was almost enough he felt acceleration was he going uphill half a minute of low gravity a final surge backward he felt himself at rest there was an almost subsonic thump beyond the metal end of the car the glass door and the metal door beyond it both popped open at the same time corbell had just stood up when the thunderclap slapped him backward sometimes you would end a long backpacking trip with aches in every muscle and a mind void of everything except the determination to keep walking no matter what in much the same frame of mind corbell got to his feet and limped toward the doors his ears rang his head hurt where hed bumped it on his helmet hed twisted his back he felt stupid the thunderclap of air slamming into vacuum should not have surprised him peerssa he called this is corbell for himself answer if you can nothing where the hell was peerssa there was nothing blocking him now was there corbell shook his head all he could do was keep wading through the surprises until they stopped him there were dim lights far back in a great open space he picked out couches and alcoves and the faintly glowing lines of a wall map numbers at his chin showed pressure normal or a bit higher temperature warm but bearable he opened his faceplate the air was warm and musty he smelled dry rot he lifted his helmet sniffed again a trace of animal smell meep he jumped then relaxed where had he heard such a sound it was friendly and familiar motion caught at his eye left meee the beast came questing through dusty cloudrug it was a snake a fat furred snake it came toward him in an sshaped flow its fur was patterned in black and gray and white it stopped and lifted its beautiful cats face and asked again like a cat meep ill be damned said corbell something rustled behind him he forgot the furred snake he was sleepy so sleepy that in a moment he knew he would pass out but there were furtive sounds behind him and he turned fighting to stay on his feet under a hooded robe of white cloth with a touch of iridescence in it a bent human form while the catsnake distracted him she had struck he saw her in shadow tall and stooped gaunt her face all wrinkles her nose hooked her eyes deepset and malevolent in the shadow of the hood her swollen hands held a silver cane aimed at corbells eyes he saw her for a bare moment while the numbness closed over him he guessed he was seeing his death ii he was on his back on a formfitting surface his legs apart his arms above his head the air was wet and heavy and hot sweat ran in his crotch and armpits and at the corners of his eyes when he tried to move the surface surged and rippled and soft bonds tightened round his wrists and ankles his pressure suit was gone he wore only his onepiece undersuit on a world uninhabitably hot he felt naked and trapped light pressed on his eyelids he opened them he was on a water bed looking at gray sky through the jagged edges of a broken roof he turned his head and saw more of a bedroom curved headboard with elaborate controls arc of couch with floating coffee table to match these bedrooms must have been massproduced like prefab houses but a tornado had hit this one the roof and the picture windows had exploded outward the old woman was watching him from the arc of sofa he thought norn fate in the shape of an old woman she was vivid in his memory and so was the silver cane in her hand he watched her stand and come toward him and the fur boa round her shoulders raised a prickeared head and watched him back it was curled one and a half times around her neck the tip of its tail twitched dammit that was a cat he remembered a cat like that lion though hed forgotten the boyhood friend who owned it lots of luxurious fur and a long rich fluffy tail if lions tail had been multiplied by three and attached to lions head this beast would have been the result but how could evolution cost a cat its legs he didnt believe it easier to believe that someone had tampered with a cats genes sometime in these last three million years the woman stood over him now her cane pointed between his eyes she spoke he shook his head the bed rippled her hand tightened on the cane he saw no trigger but she must have pulled a trigger because corbell went into agony it wasnt physical this agony it was sorrow and helpless rage and guilt he wanted to die stop he cried stop communication had begun her name was mirellylyra zeelashisthar she must have had a computer somewhere the box she set on the headboard was too small to be more than an extension of it as corbell talkedmeaninglessly at first babbling merely to stop her from using the canethe box functioned as a translator it spoke to corbell in corbells own voice to mirellylyra in hers they traded nouns mirellylyra pointed at things and named them corbell gave them his own names he had no names for many of the things in the room cattail he called the furred snake phone booth he called the instantelsewhere booth she set up a screen a television that unrolled like a poster another computer link he guessed she showed him pictures their vocabularies increased give me food he said when his hunger had grown more than his fear when she understood finally she set a plate beside him and freed one of his hands under her watchful eye and the threat of her cane he ate and belched and communicated more she took the plate behind the headboard a minute or so later she brought it back reloaded with fruit and a slice of roasted meat hot and freshly cut and a steamed yellow root that tasted like a cross between squash and carrot as he shoveled down the first plateful of food he had hardly noticed what he was eating now he found time to wonder where did she cook it and to guess that she used the phone booth to reach her stove the cattail dropped from the old womans shoulders onto the bed corbell froze it wriggled across the bed and sniffed at the meat mirellylyra thumped it on the chest and it desisted now it crawled up onto corbells chest reared and looked him in the eyes corbell scratched it behind the ears its eyes half closed and it purred loudly its belly was hard leather ridged like a snakes but its fur felt as luxurious as it looked he finished his second helping feeding some of the meat to the cattail he dozed off wondering if mirellylyra would shake him awake she didnt when he woke the sky was black and she had turned on the lights his free hand was bound again his pressure suit was nowhere in sight even if she freed him she would still have the cane he didnt know if the phone booth worked at the back of his mind he wondered if peerssa thinking him dead had gone on to another star what did she want with him they worked on verbs then on descriptive terms her language was of no form he had ever heard about but the screen and mechani cal memory made it easy for them soon they were trading information take off the ropes let me walk no why i am old so am i said corbell i want to be young he couldnt read expression in her voice or in the translators version of his own but the way shed said that jerked his head up to look at her so do i she shot him with the cane guilt fear remorse deathwish he cried and writhed and pulled at his bonds for eternal seconds before she turned it off then he lay staring at her in shock and hurt her face worked demonically abruptly she turned her back on him his thrashings had frightened the cattail it had fled i want to be young and blam and now her back was rigid and her fists clenched did she hide red rage or tears why is it my fault shes old one thing was clear she was keeping him tied up for her protection and his own if she used the cane on him when his hands were free he might kill himself the cattail crawled back onto his chest coiled and reached to rub noses with him meee it demanded an explanation i dont know he told the beast now rumbling like a motor on his chest i dont guess ill like the answer but he was wrong she freed one of his hands and fed him it was more of the same two fruits a steamed root roasted meat she fed the cattail while she was at it the fruit was fresh the meat was like overdone roast beef sliced moments ago she had been out of sight behind the headboard for no more than a minute even a microwave oven wasnt that fast or hadnt been in it stuck in his mind and he had to go to the bathroom she was irritatingly embarrassingly slow to understand he knew she had the idea when she began to pace scowling dithering as to whether to leave him in his own ifith eventually she freed him first his wrists then his feet she stood well back covering him with the cane while he went into the middle closet alone at last with the door blocking her eyes he let out a shuddering sigh he wouldnt try to escape not this time he knew too little it wasnt worth the risk that she wouldnt let him go to the bathroom again it wasnt worth the risk of the cane the cane it had reduced him to a groveling slave instantly twice he had never even considered keeping his dignity in that the cane lost half its power he could feel no shame still he knew that too many applications of the cane would leave him nothing like a man he was a shell of a man reanimated by electrical currents and injections of memory rna he had been changed again and again but whatever he was he was still a man what the cane might do to him was cruder more damaging he would cooperate but she was mad even if sane by the standards of her time unlikelyby corbells she was mad and dangerous old and feeble as he was he would have to escape before she killed him the phone booth must be working hed seen no microwave oven here in the bedroom good calling peerssa would have to wait he dared not ask after his pressure suit it might show that he was thinking dangerous thoughts and even if peerssa were still in the solar system how could he help corbell left the booth and returned to his spreadeagled position on the bed mirellylyra moored his hands from behind the headboard then his ankles they resumed their conversation the translator skipped words he missed some of it before he realized what he was hearing then he asked questions got her to back up for the blank spots he heard it in bits and pieces she was mirellylyra zeelashisthar a citizen of the state in her youth she had been supernaturally beautiful men went incomprehensibly mad over her she never understood the force that drove men to such irra tionality but she used her sex and her beauty as she used her mind for advancement she was born hyperactive and ambitious by the age of twenty she was high in the ranks of intrasystem traffic control because she was now in a position of responsibility the state conditioned her after conditioning her ambition was not for herself alone but for the good of the state the conditioning was routine and corbell gathered from later data it didnt quite take if she advanced the states ambitions by guiding the courses of spacecraft within the solar system certainly she advanced herself and she came to the attention of a powerful man in a collateral branch of the bureaucracy subdictator corybessil jakunk was not her direct superior but he could do her some good so powerful a man was allowed some leeway for his personal desires that he might serve the state more readily his personal desire was mirellylyra zeelashisthar he told me that i must be his mistress she said i wished more stature for myself than that i refused he told me that if i would share his life for a fourday period he would gain for me a position in full charge of the bureau i was only thirtysix years old it was a fine chance she played him as she had played other men it was a mistake corbell had wondered why he was being made captive audience to an unsolicited soap opera he began to find out three million years later at what looked to be eighty or ninety years old she was still wondering what had gone wrong the first night i used a chemical to help to make one want sex an aphrodisiac it went into the computer memory i needed it the second night he would not let me use chemicals he used none himself i had a bad time but i did not complain then or on the third night on the fourth day he begged me to change my mind give up my position become his woman i held him to his promise for seven months she was head of the bureau of intrasystem traffic control she was then informed that she had volunteered for a special mission a glorious opportunity to serve the state it was known that there was a hypermass a black hole at the center of the galaxy mirellylyra was to investigate it after some preliminary use of automated probes she was to determine by experiment whether such a black hole could be used for time travel if possible she was to return to her starting date why did he do it she wondered i saw him once before i left he said that he could not bear to have me in the same universe if i was not his but this was not what he offered at all he may have thought said corbell that four days of ecstasy would do it youd throw yourself into his arms and beg not to be sent away for a moment he feared she would use the cane then she broke into dry cackling laughter he saw something likable reflected there before her face drooped in brooding hate now she looked like death itself the norn he sent me to the black hole i saw the end of everything so did i she didnt believe him at her urging he described it as best he could the colors the progressive flattening of core suns into an accretion disk the swelling of the ring of fire the final drastically flattened plane of neutronium flecked with smaller black holes i only went in as far as the ergosphere he said and that was only to get me home fast did you really go through the singularity she was long in answering no i was afraid when the time came i did not think i owed the state that much her conditioning had worn off to that extent at least she had circled the black hole using its mass to bend her course back on itself and headed for home she was eighty years old still healthy and still beautiful due to the rejuvenation medicines in her ships dispensary when she reached firsthope he checked the times with her did her bussard ramjet accelerate at one gravity all the way yes twentyone years each way her ship was far superior to corbells don juanand looked it it was a toroid bigger than don juan and with a cleaner design firsthope was a colony just being established around another star when mirellylyra left so she hoped that firsthope would not have records of her defection firsthope fired on her what she at first thought was a message laser carried no modulation at all it was an xray laser designed to kill she tried again the next system resembled firsthope it held a world of earths mass and earths approximate temperature range whose reducing atmosphere had been seeded when the state was still young perhaps it had been colonized in the seventy thousand years she had been gone and it had been she was fired on and she fled i was bitter corbell i thought it was because of me because of what i had done all the worlds would have my record there was no hope for me i went to sol system to die there she had already recognized stars in sols projected vicinity at sol she was not fired on but the sun was expanding toward red giant status and earth was missing bewildered she investigated further she recognized saturn and mercury and venus uranus was in a wildly altered orbit between saturn and jupiter if that was uranus mars bore a tremendous scar a fresh mare probably left by the impact of deimos the state was going to move deimos she told corbell it was too close something must have happened she found earth orbiting just inside the orbit of mars corbell asked any idea how they did that no deimos was to be moved by fusion bombs successively exploded in one crater moving an inhabited planet could not be done that way or who did it i never learned i landed my ship and was arrested at once on my record by children children yes i was in a bad position she told corbell smiling wanly even at the last when i landed on earth itself it may be that i hoped my beauty would sway a judge but how could i sway children but what happened earth was ruled by children twenty bifiion children aged from eleven years to enormous it was youngforever that did it the state had discovered an ideal form of youngforever the old woman said parents can see to it that their children stop growing older at an age just belowwhat is your word when girls begin their cycle of blood puberty just before puberty they are stopped they live nearly forever there is no resultant rise in numbers because these children do not have children the method was far better than the older method of staying young forever older method of immortality tell me about that one suddenly she was enraged i could not find out i learned only that it was for the few for the dictator class alone when i arrived it was no longer used my lawyer knew about it he would not discuss it what happened to the solar system he asked i was not told he laughed and desisted when she raised the cane so the state hadnt let her play tourist either she let the canes tip fall they told me nothing i was treated as one not entitled to ask questions all that i learned i learned from my lawyer who seemed a twelveyearold boy and would not tell his true age they learned my crime from my ships log they sentenced me to untranslated what was that they stopped time for me there was a building where some criminals went to be stored against need the bitter smile again i was to be flattered only unusual breakers of the law were thought to be of future need to the state people of high intelligence or with good genes or interesting tales to tell to future historians the building would hold perhaps ten thousand no more i was lucky they let me keep my medicines at that i could only choose as much as i could carry she leaned close above the water bed never mind this corbell i want you to know that there was an earlier form of immortality if we find it we can both be young again im ready said corbell he pulled at the soft bindings on his wrists im on your side id love to be young again so why not untie me it cant be this easy we may search a long time i have already searched for a long time i must have your youth drugs corbell they may not be as good as the dictators immortality but they must be better than mine oh he had to answer theyre aboard ship in orbit they cant help you anyway youre probably older than i am not counting the time i gained in cold sleep he felt discomfort from the sweat pooled under him he felt more sweat starting he felt his helplessness he saw her raise the cane she waited until he had stopped thrashing before she said i understand you you come from a time earlier than mine your medicines are more primitive than mine i cannot use them so you say its true listen i was born before men landed on the earths moon when the cancer in my belly started eating me alive i had myself frozen there was frozen she didnt believe him frozen yes there was the chance that medical science would find a way to heal the cancer and the damage done by broken cell walls and his defense ended in a howl she held the cane on him for a long time he heard open your eyes he didnt want to ill use the cane his eyes were clenched like fists his face a snarl of agony a frozen man is a preserved corpse you wont lie again will you he shook his head his eyes were still closed now he remembered what peerssa had told him about phospholipids in the glia around brain nerves they froze at f and that was the end of the nerves hed been committing suicide and why not but hed never never convince the norn let me speak this right said mirellylyra zeelashisthar i wont tell you about the first time i was taken from the zerotime jail the second time happened because the zerotime generator had used up its power source more than a thousand of us came suddenly into a world that was baked and without life the weather was hot enough to kill it killed most of us the rain came down like floods of bath water but without rain we would all have died many of us reached this place where days are six years long and nights are six years long but life is still possible i was old i didnt want to die resigned he opened his eyes what happened to the others the boys captured them i dont know what happened after i escaped boys dont be distracted for many years i used my time only to stay alive i searched for the dictator immortality but i never found it and i grew old i was half lucky i found a small zerotime a storage place for records in the forms of tape and of chemical memory and for genetailored seeds at first i kept my medicines in it later i emptied it out to make a zerotime jail just for myself then i altered the subway system to take any passenger from the hot places directly to me i made warning systems to free me from zerotime when the subway system was in use do you understand why i did all of this my only hope was the advanced medicines that must be carried by any longrange explorer one day an explorer would come back from another galaxy or from one of our sateffite galaxies he would know no better than to land in places of earth that are too hot he would need to come to the polar places immediately she stood above him like a great bird of prey the subway system would send him to me carrying the medicines developed in my future that will let me grow young when my own medicines have only let me stay old corbell you are that man look at me she shrugged you may be a thousand years old or ten thousand what you must know is this if you are what you say you are useless to me i will kill you why but he believed her she said we are the last of the state we are the last of people those who remain are not people anymore if we could grow young we could breed and raise more people but if you do not have the medicines of what use are you he heard her try to soften her voice his own voice said to him consider you are too old for even your advanced medicines to affect you i am different give me back my health and i will search out the real immortality that the dictator class used you are old and frail you will rest while i search all right he said the old woman was a norn right enough she was both life and death to him now my medicines are in orbit ill take you to my landing craft ill have to contact my ships computer she nodded she raised the cane and he flinched if you break your word you will take your own life when i let you iii when she was safely on the other side of the headboard corbell let himself relax an almost silent sigh of released tension followed by a woffish grin and an urge to whoop savagely repressed at last corbell had set himself a goal he had come down to die on earth but this was better his hands came free he sat up but she gestured him back with the cane she made him put his wrists together and bound them before she freed his ankles the cloth stuck to his wrists like bandages he didnt think he could pull loose the bedrooms picture windows had stretched before they broke the edges were like lines of daggers curved outward he followed mirellylyra stepping carefully through the daggers into kneehigh grass she gestured him ahead of her toward a bubblecar like those he had found in one city where his feet fell big insects fled whirring it was even hotter outside but at least there was a breath of breeze the sun sat on the horizon huge and red casting long blurred shadows a hardtosee red circle on the red sky smaller than the sun must be jupiter the car seemed to rest on the very tips of the grass blades it did not shift as corbell climbed in mirellylyra gestured to him to slide over and climbed in beside him she bent to the console hesitated then punched numbers we go for your pressure suit said the translator at her belt the car moved smoothly away mirellylyra half relaxed she was not steering already corbell knew that he could not return by car he didnt know the destination number of the house down the hill and into a narrow valley the car drove accelerating now they were moving at hellish speed corbell gripped a padded bar on the dashboard and wished he dared close his eyes she was studying him you did not use such cars no inspiration made him say we didnt have such things on dogpatch she nodded the knot in corbells belly eased open god help him if she came to believe that he had left sol system ahead of her he had to convince her that he came from her own future but there must have been inventions he would know nothing about things humanity would not have forgotten like what a bathtub designed to fit human beings a cold cure a permanently sharp razor blade or a treatment to stop the beard growing at all a hangover cure that works if only id read more science fiction well coming from another plaret gives me some leeway i really thought i was the first man to reach the galactic core he said your trip wasnt even in the records how old are you about six hundred he said offhandedly our years in earth years thats about dont get tricky count on her not knowing much about the earth she came back to five hundred and thirty how about you nearly two hundred my years not jupiter years im surprised you never ran out of medicines the children let me take my supply with me into zerotime i keep them there so that they will not spoil a thrill ran up corbells neck shed keep the food there too cooking it in large batches and then stopping time for it that way her meals would always be freshly cooked and that private jail of hers must be very close to one of the phone booth termini what was your sun she asked the only sun he could even spell was sirius i never heard it called anything but the sun he said just how much did you learn about the real immortality the one the dictators used only that when a dictator died it was through violence she cow cd such events were remembered my lawyer told me stories of one dictator warring on another of war spreading to their families old stories from far before his time from the sound of it the dictators no longer served the state even then only themselves like greek gods he sad he heard the gap mirellylyras box had not translated his remark powerful and quarrelsome he amplified mortals did well to bow when the gods passed and otherwise try not to get caught in the wheels he glimpsed details of scenery as they flashed past greenandbrown hills groves of dwarf trees he looked for birds but saw none they went over a sharp crest and corbells stomach dropped away the car sped down toward what even peerssa would have called a city it showed black outlined in red with the red sun almost behind it there had been a geodesic dome a piece of the frame a dozen linked hexagons lacythin still stood along one city border but the city itself retained the dome shape in the center of a polar coordinate grid of streets sat an enormous cube with bulging sides the transportation nexus spires and glass slabs sloped away from it the tips of the tallest buildings defined the shape of the lost dome a tall glass slab near the center had fallen against the great cube where bent in the middle it leaned for support like a drunk against a hree friend otherwise this city four city was almost undamaged one city had largely been ruins perhaps four city was younger than one city perhaps its dome had protected it from the elements longer green dwarf forest and greenandgold grassland the vegetation ran downslope to surround the city on three sides it stopped sharply at a nearly straight borderline that ran past the citys far edge beyond that line a fivetotenmile width of barren borderland stretched to meet the bright blue of ocean strange corbell thought then it came to him that four city must have been built before the world grew hot and the oceans receded it was that old anyway but something else was strange about four city it had not spread out along the shore what must once have been a curved line of beach was bare of buildings no roads joined it to the city corbell peering made out regularly spaced black dots that might have been phone booths he asked do you know this city well play tour director wheres your private jail mirellylira she said yes he dropped it from here we go to the west caost of i know my machines watched your landing he had almost grown used to the cars reckless speed but when they swooped into the city his composure selfdestructed the streets had teeth big chunks of fallen masonry jagged sheets of glass the car swerved around them tilted fortyfive degrees and more to take corners straightened and tilted again while corbell strangled the padded bar the norn studied him with shrewd old eyes youre badly frightened i wonder what your people used for transport phone booths he said at random for longdistance travel we used dirigibles lighterthanair craft you traveled so slowly sweating he said we werent in a hurry we lived a long time for an instant he considered telling her the truth get it over with her deal could work for him they would use her medicines to make him young young corbell would search out the dictators immortality while frail old mirellylyra waited it out in a rocking chair it made good sense but mirellylyra was crazy the car swerved violently ducked under something huge and solid corbell looked back embedded in the street like a titans spear was a girder of zshaped cross section it was as long as the average four city skyscraper was tall the car slowed and eased to a stop beneath the great rectangular face of an office building corbell let his death grip relax the old woman was prodding him with the cane gesturing him out he got out she followed the design of windows on the face of the building was not rectangular the panes were laid out like a pattern in stained glass and there were curlicues above the great glass doors corbell still shaking in the aftermath of terror pulled himself together he needed to remember these they might be an address two commas crossed an s reversed an hourglass on its side and pushed inward from the ends and a crooked pi two sets of doors dropped into the floor to let them through then slid back up mirellylyra took them through a lobby padded in cloudrug then through a corridor lined with handleless doors the lifting boxes dont work she explained they climbed stairs three flights with pauses to rest they were both panting when mirellylyra turned down a hallway corbells fingers worked steadily at a button on his undersuit hed been wearing it since don juan took off ed washed it several hundred times he twisted and twisted at the button one thick flexible thread joined it to the fabric it would have to part all at once more doors without handles mirellylyra stopped beside the sixth door she pressed something in her hand against the center of the door as the door swung open she put the unseen thing back in a pocket and gestured corbell passed through ahead of her he dropped the button as his fingers brushed the jamb it was the first big risk hed taken he had no choice he had to be able to reenter this place mirellylyra kept her eyes on corbell as the door closed behind her it closed on the button and she didnt notice corbell was looking around him everywhere but at the door desk covered with widgetry cloudrug phone booth picture window the offices were mass produced too there were minor differences the phonebooth door was transparent the picture window was intact and rain had not ruined the desk or the rug corbells pressure suit and helmet had been dumped on the desk he picked up the helmet in his bound hands he called peerssa this is corbell for himself calling peerssa for the state there was no answer peerssa please answer this is corbell calling peerssa and don juan nothing not a whisper and mirellylyra was watching my ship may be around the other side of the planet he told her but peerssa set up relays or the autopilot may still be holding an equatorial orbit but he wasnt hed changed it where was peerssa then he remembered mirellylyra had altered the subway system wherever corbell had come out wherever he was now it wasnt where peerssa had aimed his instruments as far as peerssa was concerned corbell had never emerged from the subway system i will wait until i am sure you are dead peerssa had said then i will search other systems for the state he would have to bluff if hes still in equatorial orbit well have to call from my landing craft he had to explain equatorial orbits to her by drawing in the dust on the desk then she understood she said we must use the tunnel cars take your pressure suit mine is in the terminal the phone booth was too small mirellylyra clearly did not trust corbell that close to her she held him covered while she drew a symbol in the dust the crooked pi push this key four times she said then wait for me you cannot outrun my cane he nodded she watched him through the door he paused to note that four of the eight symbols on the keyboard matched the four hed seen over the entrance he pushed the crooked pi four times zap he was elsewhere the world beyond the door snapped into another shape vast empty space rings of couches humping from the floor here was another intercontinental subway terminal corbell fumbled in the belt pouch of his pressure suit found a circle shape his hands were trembling violently clear plastic disk right with both hands he guided it into the coin slot he stabbed at the compressed hourglass symbol nothing at all happened the phone booth in the four city police station must be out of order mirellylyra zeelashisthar stepped into view from another booth and looked about her eyes narrowed and jaw thrust forward she saw him still in the booth with the door closed he jabbed frantically at the crossed commas remorse terror guilt deathwish flashed in his brain and were gone and so was the light in blackness he rammed his shoulder against the door and ran blindly out into corridors corridors with palegreen walls and glowingwhite ceilings wide doors with no knobs only small plates of golden metal that might have been electromagnetic key plates he turned right left right and stopped face to a wall sucking air fatigue soaked into his legs like an acid solvent would she know how to trace his call he couldnt know he ran a bigger door at the end of the corridor dropped open to reveal stairs one long ifight ran diagonally between a sheer wall and the tinted glassmosaic face of the building with doors at landings along the ffight he froze in fear if she was out there shed see him then he remembered theyd passed a building with this pattern on its face from the outside it was a mirror he was three stories up he still didnt know what kind of place this was but it must be some kind of public service facility all right by the time she got here if she ran as hed been running the old lady would be exhausted shed want to go down so did he and shed guess that he went up at the fourth story the door dropped for him then closed as he passed it he climbed another ifight then looked back and saw footprints in the dust he stopped resting listening no sound he walked backward down the stairs stepping in his own footprints as best he could when the fourthfloor door dropped he threw his helmet through then his pressure suit then he jumped for it hed left a pair of sloppy footprints but no other tracks and now he was on cloudrug he stooped to brush away two dusty footprints picked up his suit and helmet and staggered on he couldnt seem to get enough air chapter stealing youth i he staggered through clean geometric empty sounddeadening corridors doors did not drop for him twice he tried holding his plastic disk against what he thought were entrance plates it was all he could think of and it didnt work whatever this place was heor the dead man corbell had robbedwas not authorized to pass these doors the pressure suit became too heavy for him he dropped it he talked to the helmet but it didnt answer where the hell was peerssa corbell had freed peerssa from all orders past and future corbell had gone unprotected into an unknown environment had later dropped out of communication jaybee corbell mark ii missing presumed dead by now peerssa could be rounding the sun on his way to some nearby star searching for the state peerssas interstellar laser beam could have burned the old woman down as she crossed a street but corbells computer had abandoned him and corbell hurled the helmet viciously into the cloudrug but not as hard as he wanted because his hands were still bound the blind faceplate stared after him as he went on his legs were starting to cramp the clean air was turning musty with the old smell of something truly dead when corbell came at last to an open door he thought the mechanism had failed and then he saw why a small hole had been burned through the gold plate beyond the doorway was cruder damage and a richer smell it had been a surgery he guessed at least that looked like an operating table with machinery suspended above it and the machinery included scalpels on jointed arms there were crumbled brown skeletons one naked lay in a pooi of dust on the table two others sprawled against a wall their stained and damaged uniforms were in better shape than the bones within the cloth bore charred slashes that continued into the bones as if men had been hacked by a whitehot sword these men had been mansized corbells size the wall behind the desk had a hole in it big enough to drive a car through bombs corbell heaved himself up on the table with the skeleton he rubbed the bandages against a scalpel edge and behold his wrists were free now he moved to the great gap in the wall he was getting his breath back but his heartbeat was fast and fluttery what he wanted most was a chance to lie down and rest until he looked down into the vault it was two stories high and windowless to the left a thick circle of metal almost the height of the wall with a stylized ships wheel set in it it looked for all the world like a bankvault door there were guard posts glass cubicles set just below the ceiling and in the cubicles were skeletons armed with things like spotlights with rifle butts a bank vault seemed out of place in a hospital there were shelves on all three walls floor to ceiling the few items still on the shelves were not gold bars they were bottles the floor ten feet below corbell was covered with broken glass there was a hallmelted metal thing an animated dishwasher very like the machine that had attacked corbell and peerssa as burglars other machinery looked intact there was an instrument console that might have been diagnostic equipment there was a matched pair of transparent phone booths glass cylinders with rounded tops corbell saw these and lusted the invaders had brought a ladder he climbed down carefully treating himself as fragile four skeletons at the bpttom showed that the invaders had not had things all their own way he stepped carefully among the bones as a hospital the place made a good crypt better than most in fact cool clean no insects no scavengers no fungus but it wasnt death corbell was running from it was a silver cane and a change more humiliating than death the lights were still on in the vault indicator lights glowed on the console with luck the booths would work too he stepped into one and looked for a dial no dial just a button set in a slender post no choice about where he was going corbell wondered if the norn would be waiting at the other end he made himself push the button anyway nothing happened he cursed luridly pushed out of the booth and tried the other the second booth didnt even have a door and there was fine dust floating in it what the hell what was this place the drugs on the shelves must have been incredibly valuable four human guards and a metal killer a single door that looked like it would stand off an atomic attack an instantelsewhere booth with only one terminal and another booth you couldnt get out of an invading army wiffing to go up against all that with bombs and suddenly he knew where he must be it was a double jolt those shelves must have held dictator immortality and they were bare everything fitted of course youd store geriatric drugs in a hospital the booths must lead directly to dictator strongholdsand even they could only appear in the closed booth if the man in the booth wore the right face someone outside could dial him into the booth that had a door if not he was a sitting duck for the laser weapons and the vault door might well stand an atomic attack but thieves had come through a walland maybe theyd used atomics too did mirellylyra know about this place she must shed have kept looking until she found it and so would corbell and she knew it the norn herself had told him about dictator immortality he had to get out of here exhaustion had become an agony he would climb the ladder if he must if he could but he tried the vault door first and it was open all of his strength andweight were just enough to swing it wide the invaders must have left by the door they could not enter so did he very gratefully the line of phone booths was on this floor he had walked a zigzag path from there he might have trouble finding his way back he saw the booths as he rounded a corner and he saw mirellylyra zeelashisthar holding her cane like a gun and squinting at something in her other hand just before he ducked back he saw her look up at the ceiling with her teeth bared it wasnt him she was tracing it was his pressuresuit helmet peerssa goodbye corbell counted to thirty then stuck his nose around the corner she wasnt there he tiptoed through the cloudrug to the next intersection and peered around it she wasnt there either and he crossed the intersection at a leap and was in the nearest booth with the disk in his hand mirellylyra would not have liked the way he was smiling two commas crossed an s reversed an hourglass on its side and pushed inward from the ends a crooked p the corridors vanished in blackness he thumbed the door open and stepped out into blackness a gust of warm damp wind whipped at him and at the same time he saw dim light a slender hotpink crescent with the horns down at eye level he stood still while his eyes adjusted a world took form around him he was on a flat roof looking into a solar eclipse they must be fairly common these days with both sol and jupiter occluding so much of the sky but the effect was beautiful a hotpink ring lighting sea and city with red dusk he wished he could stay mirelylyra must be finding his pressuresuit helmet about now there were stairs he would have been happier knowing how tall the building was but he didnt he had to walk all the way to the bottomand he was reassured to recognize the building that housed mirellylyras office he paused for a precious moment of rest then climbed back up three flights next question had the nom noticed that the office door wasnt closed the sixth door was open a crack blocked by a fallen button the door resisted his weight then gave slowly let him in they must have turned these offices out like popcorn boxes he thought did it connect to the exploded bedroom he had bet his life on it he stepped into the phone booth and looked for the intercorn panel five buttons he pushed the top one through the glass door he saw salt dunes running downslope to a distant line of brilliant blue he was in one of the seashore booths he pushed the second button back in the office he pushed number three in redtinged darkness he saw a triangular floor plan walls and roof exploded outward a dark doughnut shape coiled just where he would have stepped on it raised a white face questioningly he shouted yeeehaa meep he jabbed the fourth button down the startled cattail vanished sunken tub shower he thought of hot water and comfort and sleep and the hell with it would the old woman set her private zerotime jail next to a turkish bath why not but he pushed the bottom button anyway to see what there was to see thoughts of sleep returned his knees sagged his muscles and bones seemed to be melting but he saw ovens and cupboards to left and right a long dining table floating and lines of floating chairs the hooded norn at the far end and the silver cane foreshortened endon behind her shards of a picture window and a bundle of thick cables running over the sill he stabbed two buttons and kicked out at the door ii he was trying to remember something it was urgent see now i hit an intercom button then the door button then kick out or the other way around intercom door kick out didnt waitcouldnt waitnever thought so fast in my life pressure on his ankles he thrashed a bit got his elbows under him to lift his head the door of the phone booth was trying to lift under his ankles beyond the great red sun was almost whole again a chunk still missing behind black jupiter closer a desk floated above cloudrug he smiled and closed his eyes it was seconds or minutes before he stirred himself the sun was still cut by jupiter he stood on the edge of the door while he looked for something to wedge it hed got out by the skin of his teeth with the silver cane pushing him down into unconsciousness hed hit the intercom button to take him to the office the button to open the door then got his legs across the door to wedge it so far so good but assume the morn was still guarding her zerotime device and her drug supply he hadnt seen the marvelous machine he couldnt even guess what it looked like but what else could the cables be for it must be there and now mirellylyra knew he was after her drugs by now she would know that the intercom to the office wasnt working she would assume corbell had blocked the door open he couldnt let the door close shed be out of it an instant later right on his heels corbell began to panic hed barred her from the general phonebooth system by barring her from the office she couldnt use that she couldnt come after him in the car theyd left it here just outside the entrance so yeah her fastest route to him was by intercom to the beach jog down to someone elses intercom booth thence to someone elses office dial for this building by now she could be trotting down from the roof and he still hadnt found anything to block the door he stripped off his undersuit and wedged it in the door it was cool for a moment until the sweat dried on him now he was nakedand ashamed what he saw when he looked down was not a self to be proud of but who would see him but mirellylyra the old woman was probably in no better shape his personal possessions had dwindled to an ancient withered body and a single plastic credit card disk he took them down three ifights of stairs and out the car was where they had left it it wouldnt start he looked for a key or a key slot if the norn had taken the key he would have to walk he found a slot empty and said a bad word before he noticed its size the plastic disk fit it perfectly the cars must be public taxis that was convenient now if the cars destination codes resembled the booths all he had to do was punch for the police station and get a gun as he reached for the keyboard his hands started to shake then other muscles were twitching and suddenly he was in convulsions strange noises came from his mouth in fury and despair corbell realized that the felons corpse had finally failed him he was dying and the timing was wrong wrong please no not till the battles over he locked his hands together and forced them at the keyboard he punched the compressed hourglass tried again and missed again and hit had to stop for a minute neck muscles locked and twisted his head backward agonizingly and he saw a car coming around the gently curved drive like a homing missile the convulsions were getting worse he stabbed at the hourglass key again and again and he didnt know how often hed hit it when the car began to move he let the convulsions have their way mental agony unconsciousness now convulsions maybe he ought to be compiling a list of what the silver cane wouldnt do it wouldnt stop a bubblecar the convulsions eased presently he could turn his head mirellylyra was far behind him out of her car still firing his motion carried her around the curve of the drive he tried to relax random muscles locked and released in his legs his back his neck his eyelids he wasnt just feeling the aftereffects of the silver cane he had been through too much nightmare he was too old for this kind of thing he had always been too old to play monster and villagers through a maze of cityscape with an armed madwoman behind him come on calm down he whispered its all over unless unless there was a tracking device in mirellylyras dashboard or in her cane he would still get there ahead of her allow say one minute to search the police station for a gun then cut his losses get out via the booths dial at random and keep running oops the booths didnt work he had tried to dial the police station earlier the car tilted far over rounded a corner and was on one of the radial streets corbell watched the rear his chin propped on the back of the seat it was less unnerving than watching rubble come at him he saw the edge of the hexagonal dome go past him the street ended he was crossing sand corbell turned to see barren salt dunes flowing past him far ahead the blueandwhite line of ocean came toward him the car ran straight toward frothing white breakers crossed them and headed out to sea at something like ninety miles per hour iii corbells voice was a rusty querulous whine he didnt like it it was interfering with his search it said all right corbell you won the argument if your medicines were better you wouldnt have tried to steal mine now lets talk it wasnt much of a search he had hoped that mirellylyra might have stored food in her car but hed opened the glove compartment and hed looked under the seats and where else was there slit the upholstery corbell was hungry youll find the talking switch on the far right of the panel just push it upward corbell sure and then youll track me down and but corbell was tempted he could ask her about food he could ask her how to turn off the receiver the car zipped over the waves toward whatever destination its idiot brain had read from corbells spastic directions beneath the edges of a thick grayblack cloud deck the sun and crescent jupiter had drifted apart along the horizon the sun was lower now its underside flattened something lifted out of the red sunglare he thought it was a botthenosed dolphin until its size registered it was halfway to the horizon and lifting like a blimp released its head tilted just a bit and it looked him over while it slowly settled back into the frothing red sea a dolphin the size of a whale so we killed the whales off after all he thought and later there was an ecological niche i must guess youre hearing me corbell im tracking you toward the southernmost continent toward what used to be the boys capital city you cant lose me from your path because you cant leave your car talk to me it seemed she was tracking him anyway he flipped the switch up and said is there any food aboard this car hello corbell if you try to steal my drugs again you will kill yourself ive placed traps then i wont then we will be searching in separate places i give you a year to find the dictator immortality i wish i could give more but you know my condition if you will find the drug i will become your woman otherwise i wifi kill you he laughed a difficult choice you have not seen me when i was beautiful i am the only woman for you corbell there are no others left dont count on too much peerssa says im low on sex urge that upset her have you never desired women corbell i was married for twentytwo years what is married mated under contract was there sex did you enjoy it suddenly corbel missed mirabelle terribly he mourned her not because she was dead but because she was gone and her other half went on and on through a world grown more and more hallucinatory if only he could have talked it over with mirabelle in sex and in all ways our life was purest ecstasy as is usual in marriage corbell said with a ifippancy he did not feel im sorry i brought it up i had to know just to stick a pin in her he said has it ever occurred to you that i might not want the dictator immortality maybe im content to grow old gracefully you tried to steal my drugs youve got me there there is no grace to growing old one year corbell hey dont hang up have you any idea where im headed i dont even know where we were there is a continent that covers the south pole you are aimed there as for where we were there is a continent whose long tip points at the southernmost continent we were nearly at the tip i suspect your target to be the city of and for a moment her own voice broke through before his resumed sarashzillish the capital of earths last civilization departing cape horn for antarctica he thought where in antarctica what destination did you type he risked telling her i was trying to get to the police station what with the way my muscles were jumping around i really dont know what i hit could you have struck the key more than four times five would send you to world police headquarters in sarashzillish maybe he laughed well it got me away from you one year corbell in a year he could be dead though in fact he felt pretty good the aches the exhaustion the twitchies were going away but the hunger had attained a fine cutting edge in an hour ill be dead of starvation is there any food in this car what do i eat when you reach sarashzilhish go to the park she gave him an address for the keyboard of his taxi the park is untended now but any fruits you find are edible and most of the animals can be eaten if you can catch them okay you will not find dictator immortality there there were never adults in sarashzillish hey mirellylyra how long have you been looking perhaps ten years of my life he was startled i got the impression youd been at it for a century or so i was unlucky when the children revived me from zerotime they told me they would search out the dictator immortality f or me i had no choice but to believe them but they lied there was a vault in the hospital she laughed there is a vault in every hospital in every city that remains on earth i have searched them all what vaults havent been rifled contain nothing but poisons the medicines have decayed with time and wet heat tell me more what did you learn about this dictator immortality after you landed before they locked you up almost nothing only that it was there tell me tell me all the wrong answers so i dont have to waste my time on them iv the children had been waiting when mirehlylyra descended from her spacecraft her first guess was that they must be the result of a state breeding program dignified selfpossessed articulate they displayed an adult wisdom she took for supernormal intelligence later she realized that it was the result of lifetimes of experience she had never seen their like they had never seen hers there were adults in the world but they were a separate breed she never met any but she gathered that there were no more than a few thousand of themall dictator class by courtesy all using the dictator immortality they kept themselves apart from the billions of children children boys and girls together integrated she thought nothing of it then later she remembered the children tried her by her own law for treason she gained the impression that the proceedings were a farce for their amusement perhaps that was paranoia they were punctilious they did not mock her they did not deviate from laws seventy thousand years old for her part mirellylyra kept her dignity at all times as she was at pains to inform corbell they sentenced her to the zerotime jail didnt you ever hear anything about the interstellar colonies no nothing it figures they must have broken away from the state long before you landed thats probably why they fired on you not because you were mirellylyra but because you were from earth there was a silence then i never understood that are you saying that the state broke apart yeah it took a hell of a long time thats all the state was a watermonopoly empire corbell was talking half to himself now they tend to last forever unless something comes in from outside and breaks them up but there wasnt anything outside the state the collapse had to wait till the state made its own barbarians hesitantly mirellylyra said you talk as if you have known many kinds of state i predate the state i was a corpsicle a frozen dead man when the state was a century or so old they turned a condemned criminal into jerome corbell oh pause then maybe you know more than i do how could the state break apart look at it this way first there was the state expanding through the solar system later much later there were a lot of copies of the state one for each star all belonging to one big state run from earth then well im guessing i think it was childrens immortality you made a big thing out of the advantages of making elevenyearolds immortal okay fine what if the other states didnt accept that look at how different your childrens state would be the other states probably claimed they were the original state that makes the solar system state hereticsits citizens unbehievers what would happen then would they stop talking to each other corbell laughed sure right after the war right after both sides tried to exterminate each other and failed thats got to be the way it happened its inevitable why it just is then she said slowly thats what happened to what when they took me out of zerotime there was more than one state on earth maybe that was inevitable too let me tell you the children led mirellylyra to the peak of a squat silver pyramid widgets of silver and clear plastic floated around her threedimensional television transmitters and weapons that affected the mind and will they turned off the pyramid its mirrorcolored sides became black iron they put her in an elevator and sent her down she joined a despondent rabble some tried to talk to her in gibberish she watched the elevator rise and sink again with another prisoner none spoke her language the elevator never stopped rising and falling bringing prisoners down rising empty the styles of those about her were wildly different they continued to change with every new prisoner there was no provision for feeding the prisoners it became obvious nobody had been here long enough to become hungry the twelth to descend was not a prisoner a girl of eleven dropped to just above their heads small machines floated around her one a silver wand mounted in a larger base twitched this way and that like a nervous hound eager to be loosed the girl was naked and strangely decorated transparent butterfly wings sprang from her shoulders she called in a sweet peremptory oddly accented voice mirellylyra zeelashisthar are you there so mirellylyra returned to the world after perhaps a quarter of an hour of subjective time her hosts were half a dozen children all girls the girl who had come for her choss was in some ways the leader their social organization was complex their minds were not the minds of children they walked like the lords of the world mirellylyras translator gave corbell her emotional inflections as well as her words the emotions were awe and fear and hatred these were not little girls they were girls neuter and immortal they were arrogant and indulgent by turns and mirellylyra learned to obey them they trained her with the floating silver wand a variant of the silver cane she carried much later the box she carried constantly at her belt was the same translator she carried now they made her wear it long after she knew the language they thought her accent ugly it grated on her to think that they regarded her as a social inferior later she changed her mind they regarded her as a house pet a prized property that could do tricks with the children she watched shows put on by other groups of children some they attended live others were broadcast as threedimensional illusions like holovision sets arbitrarily large once they floated in interplanetary space for hours and mirellylyra wondered at the grim intensity with which chosss girls watched a dull and repetitious planetarium show she understood their rapt concentration later during the voting but most of the shows were bids for prestige some of the bulky floating widgets that followed her around were cameras and emotional sensors mirellylyra was another show because of her the prestige of chosss group was high her medicines had retarded but not prevented menopause the change in her body was a nearkilling blow to mirellylyras faith in herself she was a trained seal and aging one thing kept her going somewhere out there was dictator immortality at first she welcomed the chance to talk to the girls but that was the trouble mirellylyra did all the talking her own questions were not answered questions the girls put to her she was expected to answer in full if she didnt lecture at length they became annoyed then once she found choss in an indulgent mood choss told me that the dictators took care of their own medical problems said mirehlylyra the dictators were ruled by the boys who made shows with them and saw to it that chemicals in their food kept them from having children i think choss was jealous that the boys would not let girls play with the dictators im telling this badly she said suddenly these girls were all older than i they were decadent aristocrats not children yeah i get the impression the girls and the boys stayed apart yeah and that made it difficult for me the boys and girls they didnt have sex to hold them together they were two separate states on earth each with its territory and its rights they must have been separate for a long time choss said that the girls ruled the sky and the boys ruled the dictators i would have to go to the boys to find out about dictator immortality the girls ruled the sky that sounded like nonsense but choss said so i think it was true corbel i saw them vote not to move the earth we watched an astronomical light show and then there were hours of discussion and they voted but i was more concerned with dictator immortality choss promised to learn what i wanted from the boys i was valuable to them corbel they gained prestige from the stories i told and the shows they made about me anger crackled in the translators voice as mirellylyra relived evil memories they were forever amused by what i did not know other groups of girls began reviving other prisoners after many years i decided that choss had done nothing to get me what i wanted i would have to reach the boys it figures what choss couldnt go to the boys theyd claim you as a dictator their property i never thought of that i was a fool go on the boys held the land masses of the southern hemisphere they had built heated domes in the south polar continent they held two other continents and many islands but the girls ruled more useful land and more power too if they really ruled the sky i knew that the earth had been moved there were times when jupiter shone so brilliantly that one could see the banding and pick out the moons i was afraid of these girls i was trying to find a safe way to steal an aircraft but i waited too long one day choss told me that they were tired of me that i must go back in zerotime i was no longer a new thing i took a plane that night they let me fly a long way before they brought me back with the autopilot i learned that they had made a show of my escape fun people your girls they put you back in the box yes they let me keep my translator it was the only thing they did for me later they lowered two boys they had caught during a fight the girls had given them soul whips she said with grim amusement and i was the only one who could talk to them soul whip i used one to make you docile it didnt work a few more applications may help finish your story we waited a long time nobody came to free us finally the machinery stopped everything was killinghot the boys ruled us with the soul whip and i was their translator but there was little cooperation some of us lived to reach the southernmost continent there they were captured by boys all but me i fled back across the water alone it was a long time before i learned enough to feel myself safe i had to learn what could be eaten what foods would not spoil how to hide from storms all things you wifi have to learn too i was old when i could begin searching again for ten years i searched for dictator immortality through the ruins the boys and girls left me then i emptied out my small zerotime storage place and went into it to wait for you nice try when you are young again then mock me i dont expect that will happen we cant give up corbell laughed i can give up i guess i dont believe in your dictator immortality have you ever seen anyone get young no but do you even know what makes people get old fires dont burn backward lady i am not a doctor i only know what anyone knows inert molecules gather in the cells to clog them like like silt and garbage and the poisons of industry gather in a great inland sea until the sea becomes a great inland swamp the cells become less active some die one day there are too few active cells living too slowly other inert matter accumulates to block the veins and arteries but i have medicines to dissolve them cholesterol sure but getting the dead stuff out of a living cell without killing it would be something else again i think you were hoaxed said corbell choss and her friends acted like nasty children why not your boy lawyer too remember you asked the girls they didnt raise the subject but why oh just to see what youd no everyone dies your lawyers dead choss is dead even civilizations dlie there was a civilization here that could move the earth now theres nothing after a longish silence came the calm voice of the translating box there are boys where youre going i tried to talk to them once they know nothing of dictator immortality do they know what happened to civilization you said it yourself there were two states on earth they must have fought it could have happened war between the sexes had always seemed silly to corbell too much fraternizing with the enemy haha but if sex didnt hold them together the boys know nothing she repeated perhaps there was never dictator immortality in the south polar continent youve got a onetrack mind if it ever existed you found it in every city in the world used up rotted one year corbell might as well try it how does this sound let me use your medicines i can travel faster and look further if im young and healthy another long pause then yes that makes sense i thought youd say no here was his chance but nuts no i just cant risk it you scare me too much this way at least i get a year she screamed something that was not translated the receiver went dead a year he thought in a year ill be dug in so deep shell never find me at all chapter the changelings i corbell came to the antarctic shore in near darkness the vanished sun had left dark red splashed across the northern horizon and a redonred circle that was jupiters night side to east and west he picked out tiny jovian moons ahead dark woods caine down to a dark shore the trees came at him spreading out then the smooth ride was bouncing brownian motion and the car was dodging tree trunks at maniac speed he gripped the padded bar to keep himself from bouncing around inside he dared not close his eyes the chase scenes through four city should have burned away his capacity for terror but they hadnt they hadnt the old trees forced their way through a tangle of burgeoning life vines underbrush big mushrooms everything living on each other a pair of huge birds ran screaming from the car the c rode high but branches slashed at its underside the forest thinned and showed masonry half hidden in vines the car was already racing through sarashzillish soil and grass and small bushes had invaded the streets if this was three cityif this was the antarctic source of industrial activity peerssa had sensed from orbitthen it was far gone the car was slowing thank god it scraped slowly over crackling brush stopped in the open and sank corbell got out onto moist grass he stretched he looked about him in the darkness it was barely possible to pick out two distant curved wails of hexagonal filigree where a dome must have stood corbell found no sign of the great black cube the subway station that had been the center of every city hed seen so far he was parked beside what must be world police headquarters a great wall of balconies and dark windows with a row of large circular holes at the top holes big enough to be access ports for flying police cars there must be weapons in there but there was certainly food in the park and corbell was faint with hunger with some reluctance he climbed back into the car and tapped out the number mirellylyra had given him inverted l inverted l nameless squiggle delta like the woods beyond the city the park was spreading into the streets the car stopped over a patch of tangled vines he stepped out having precious little choice and found himself thighdeep in the tough vines they pulled him back like a nest of snakes he waded out hunger had never done anything for corbells disposition it made him irritable unfit to live with a wall of greenery twice his height ended just ahead of him on the theory that there was a real wall under that tangle of vines corbell walked to the end turned and entered the park proper there was no obvious difference it was as dark as the inside of a mouth jupiters horizontal light couldnt reach through trees and buildings corbell wished for a flashlight or a torch but he didnt even have a match corbell mark ii bareass naked against the wilderness would not be hunting prey tonight but fruit now these could be fruit trees the norn had said they were corbell stood beneath a tree and ran his hands through the branches something round bounced against his wrist it was pearshaped bigger than a pear with thick rough skin with his teeth he stripped some of the covering away he bit into creamy avocado flesh milder in taste than avocado he ate it all he threw away the skin and pit and felt through the branches for another a furry tentacle dropped familiarly around his neck corbell grabbed sharp teeth closed between his neck and shoulder the pain sickened him his closing right hand slipped along fur was stopped by a thickening a head he wrenched at it the teeth came loose the tentacle came loose and immediately wrapped new loops around his forearm by starlight he saw a small snarling face he was strangling a cattail the little beast could as easily have torn his eyes or his jugular it was trying to bite him now even so he didnt especially want to kill it he banged its head against a branch its grip loosened a pitchers fastball gesture flung it away it coiled on the ground lifted a head to study him he was too big it went away he had suffered a muscletissue wound but it wasnt bleeding badly stifi it hurt corbell sent a curse to follow the cattail he found and ate two more avocados good enough he went back to the car locked himself in and went to sleep the first day corbell made his breakfast on tiny apples and applesized grapefruit the cattails had disappeared he sat quietly while he ate and was rewarded squirrels popped into view and vanished a bird ran out of the woods stopped short in front of himit was as tall as his shoulder dressed in the autumn colors of a turkeysquawked in terror and fled presently he picked up a thick branch knobbed at the end a machete was what he really had in mind but the club had a nice heft he went exploring the park was a jungle of delights he found fruit trees and nut trees and trees that grew fistsized warty things whose taste he would have to try later pineapples and coconut palms fought for room string beans grew on vines that were strangling some of the trees on a hunch corbell pulled up some smaller plants and found fat roots potatoes or carrots or yams maybe he was seeing them by reddened light for a million years they had been adapting to that reddened light and the twelveyear antarctic day of course they were unrecognizable but they might be edible if he could cook them if he could start a fire or find one the ground floor of world police headquarters was clean and empty corbel found no dead bodies no guns left lying about no uniforms even the desks were gone he was disappointed he had hoped at least to clothe himself he tried an elevator it worked over several hours of exploring he found that the twentystory building was bare to the walls from the empty hangars under the rooftop landing pad to the wonderfully filigreed cells in the fifth through seventh floors to the offices on the second nothing remained that wasnt part of the structure itself but the elevators worked he kept looking where desks had been he found slots for trash he tracked them to their outlet metal trash cans empty he carried a can out to the car it was the closest thing hed found to a cooking pot now if he could find water and fire hed already been through the big room on the tenth floor there was an acre of flat surface in here tabletop along all four sides a big square table in the middle with bins under it doors with shelves behind them now searching more carefully he opened long panels and found knobs under them he turned all the knobs as far as they could go hoping to turn on a burner this could be a kitchen he went down to the car he came back with a generous armful of dried grass and the club most of the kitchen mechanisms must have stopped working a snug and solid door proclaimed a cupboard to be a refrigerator some of the flat surfaces had to be griddles but they werent hot a small glass door with a shelved recess behind it was hot an oven corbell stuffed the grass into it and waited and waited while the grass smoldered smoldered more and suddenly burned he opened the door and set the club in the burning grass when the grass burned out the knob on the end was barely smoldering by then corbell had found an exhaust fan he let that blow on the coals until he had a small flame the rain started as he reached the car the car refused to move unless the doors were closed with the club inside with corbell smoldering the small flame had gone out the rain fell tremendously as if it wouldnt stop until the world was all water smoke inside and rain outside corbell couldnt see at all fortunately the ride was short the car settled over the exact same patch of tangled vines corbell pushed the trash can out into the rain but he stayed in the car with the doors open blowing on the coals the afternoon rain went on and on when the club stopped smoldering corbell didnt care all the wood in the park would be soaked by now he waded out into the wet and got his dinner of assorted fruits before the light was quite gone again he slept in the car a cramped damp wakeful night followed a miserable day in this jungle of delights this wilderness in which everything that grew seemed intended to serve man corbell had failed to make fire even with the help of a kitchen oven robinson crusoe would have sneered but the cattail bite was healing no fever he had escaped rabies and tetanus tomorrow try again tomorrow the second day was bigger better faster he took the car to world police headquarters he carried two armfuls of damp scavenged wood into an elevator and up to the kitchen he put them in the oven hed forgotten to turn it off yesterday it saved him time now he turned on the exhaust and left a little searching found him a second trash can he took it up the logs were smoldering burning in places but still wet he left them to it the kitchen was full of smoke despite the exhaust fan impatience got to him there were not even flames on the blackened logs now he opened the oven door letting in air the gasses caught with a soft whoosh corbell leapt back slapping at his hair and eyebrows but no they hadnt caught he had to tear a door off a narrow cupboard it was the only tool he could find with the door he harried the logs out of the oven and into the trash can he took the cupboard door along too flat metal it might serve somehow his way back to the park was slower three times he had to open a door to let out the smoke each time the car slowed as if it had rammed invisible taffy but he got back and maneuvered the trash can out of the car into the patch of vines under a threatening sky the logs had gone to coals he turned the can on its side and braced the bottom higher than the lip he pushed the coals into a pile at the back he found more wood not too damp which he set in the trash can to be dried by the heat when the warm rain opened up on him it didnt bother him it was not especially uncomfortable and now his fire was safe this time a million years ago this time two miffion years ago corbell the spaceman had already crossed tens of thousands of lightyears and at the core of the galaxy was skirting the edge of a black hole massive as a hundred million suns corbell the naked savage went forth to hunt his dinner living things rustled around him but he saw nothing it didnt matter he didnt have anything to kill with not so much as a kitchen knife he kept his eyes open for another club while he pulled up roots he pulled up quite a number of different roots hed roast them all and taste them he spent more time gathering nuts the rain stopped this rain seemed regular enough starting just after noon lasting two or three hours it was nice to be able to count on something in the customary red sunset light he sat down to cook his dinner he had to throw away half the roots he got in rough and approximate terms one potato one very large beet a combination yam and carrot and a more nearly pure yam he burned most of the nuts but some survived and were delicious he went back for more then night was upon him he set the trash can upright and set some dead tree limbs in the coals and settled down to sleep in a patch of nearly dry moss the third day corbell half woke in darkness he felt fur and a warm spot against his back but elsewhere he was chilled he curled more tightly around himself and went back to sleep sometime later the memory snapped him awake fur there was nothing against his back now a dream or had a friendly cattail stretched against him for warmth the touch hadnt wakened him fully he and mirabelle used to share their kingsized bed with a kitten until the kitten became a tomcat and started behaving like one well he was awake now he did easy exercises until the stiffness was gone he breakfasted on fruit what else perhaps he ought to be looking for nests and eggs the fire was still going he built it up with twigs then went looking for larger pieces he wished for an ax the little stuff burned too fast the big stuff was too heavy to move and he would soon use up all the dead limbs in the area he spent part of the morning dragging a huge limb to his replenished fire after he had tilted the trash can on its side and pushed the big end of the limb into it he decided hed created a fire hazard he moved the whole arrangement onto a nearly buried outcropping of granite it was meat he hungered for if he could find a straight sapling perhaps he could fireharden it into a spearprovided he could sharpen a point what he really needed was a knife he thought for that alone it was worth exploring sarashzilhish four crossed commas brought the car to the sarashzihish hospital corbell recognized it at once from outside it was identical to the four city hospital civilization must have become awfully stereotyped before its collapse corbell fantasized a great pogrom in which all the worlds architects had died afterward humanity had been reduced to copying older buildings detail for detail it didnt make a lot of sense hed look for other reasons for the duplication he saw everywhere inside the place kept reminding him of his nightmare flight from mirellylyra clean corridors doors with no handles cloudrug the only difference was the lack of a vault he found a central place a twostory room lined with shelves and occupied by a computer that must be diagnostic equipment but there was no vault door and no double phone booth no precautions against thieves no mummified losers if mirellylyra had not lied the boys had owned this city they would not have needed to steal dictator immortality only dictators adultswould need that he found more locked doors which would open with a kick he found an operating room two flat tables with straps attached and clusters of jointed arms above them tipped with scalpels and suction tubes and needles and clamps the metal showed the stains of neglect and age the stiffly extended insectile arm that was his target corbel climbed up on a table leaned out to grip the arm at its end he swung outward and hung suspended the arm sagged then broke in the middle and dropped him to the floor corbell the hunter left the hospital carrying three feet of metal spear with a scalpel at the end again the rains caught him on the way back he made his way to his fireplace checked to see that the fire was still going then sat down to wait it out there were several inches of water in his other trash barrel he was killing time by trying to shavevery carefully but the weight of the handle was awkward and he wasnt doing a good job of itwhen he saw the giant turkey it was pecking under a nut tree looking bedraggled and unhappy he froze it hadnt seen him he debated as to whether he might sneak up on it probably not he eased forward onto the balls of his feet spear held lightly in both hands he sprinted the bird looked up squawked turned and fled cotbell swung the spear and chopped at its foot the bird stopped to peck at whatever had bitten it corbell chopped again at the neck and felt the satisfying shock in his shoulders the bird was hurt and in panic it ran in clumsy circles squawking while corbell chased it he got two more shots at the neck and then he had to stop gasping his pulse thundering in his ears the bird was spouting blood it hadnt slowed down but its ifight was brownian motion sheer blind panic it had not gone far when corbell recovered his breath and resumed the chase he was moving in for the kill when the bird turned and ran straight at him a lucky swing as he sprawled backward and the bird was headless it ran right over him and kept going he tracked it until it fell over the patch of bare rock was nearly dry corbell spilled his fire across it added more wood then went back for the bird he pulled feathers until he was exhausted rested pulled more feathers he opened the birds belly and cleaned it tugging twohanded at internal organs his feet braced on rough rock the cupboard door from the police station became his griddle he fried the liver on it and ate it while parts of the rest of the bird were roasting afterward he worked at cutting into the joints he couldnt build his fire big enough to roast the whole bird but he could roast a drumstick and broil thick slices of breast on a stick meat it was good to taste meat again there was far too much for tonight he had roasted both drumsticks he could eat them cold tomorrow he could cut up parts of the carcass and boil them for soup in the other trash can with some of the roots ii the northeast was turning gray but in the black northwestern sky one star still glowed corbell had watched it on several nights it did not twinkle and it did not move against the stellar background that made it a planet a big object dimly lit possibly the world whose skewed orbit had disturbed peerssa now it twinkled now it was marginally brighter corbell blinked just his imagination now it was fading before the coming dawn corbell closed his eyes he didnt want to wake up there was no special reason why he should he wasnt hungry or uncomfortable hed learned much about the empty city during these past twenty days but there were mysteries still to be explored his encampment had become comfortable he had a fireplace a soup pot and the car for shelter he had tools he had used the scalpel to carve wooden cooking implements he didnt need clothes for two full days he had practiced throwing rocks and taken his reward in squirrel meat yesterday he had killed another giant turkey his third big deal obscurely depressed he curled tighter in his bed of moss corbell the architect and corbell the interstellar explorer seemed equaly dead in his pride he had called himself a naked savage but he wasnt that a savage has his duties to the tribe his tribes duties to him he has legends songs dances rules of conduct permitted and unpermitted women a place for him when he grows old but corbel was alone he could make firewith the help of a super sophisticated kitchen he could feed himselfnow that practically everything he could touch was edible some park in the beginning it must have held only food plants and meat animals city surrounding a farm the cattails could hardly have survived vain and decorative though they were in the presence of real predators domed cities mirellylyra had spoken of the boys building domed cities here in land that the more powerful girls hadnt held but of course sarashzilish must have been domed against blizzards and subzero cold before the world turned unaccountably hot as for the park the boys could hardly have grown beans and citrus fruit in the permafrost outside the girls ruled the sky controlled earths orbit they must have made a mistake somewhere what could have turned jupiter into a minor sun it must have shocked the girls as badly as it later shocked peerssa it must have because the change left boy territory habitable and made girl territory into scalding deserts overturning a balance of power tens or hundreds of thousands of years old corbell shifted then sat up it was the present that ought to concern him three cattails were tearing at his turkey carcass when he moved they jolted to attention corbell reconsidered his first intention they were eating the raw meat they had left the roasted drumsticks alone that left plenty of meat for corbell they studied him three snakes with solemn cat faces furred in brown and orange intricately patterned as beautiful as three butterscotch sundaes corbell smiled and gestured hospitably as if they understood they went back to their meal breakfast he ate fruit and drumstick meat and thought about coffee afterward he tended his fire the scalpel was razorsharp despite age and eighteen days of blunting but it was no ax he went far afield to find wood the exercise was good decades in the coldsleep coffin had preserved him better than he had hoped hed gone soft despite the exercises but the savage life was toning him up he took the other trash can to what had been a fountain and was now a pond ifiled it with not especially clean water dragged it back and wrestled it into place over the fire he turned to the turkey carcass he cut chunks small enough to fit the trash can meat gnawed by cattails went in and so did bare bones while it heated he foraged for roots to flavor the soup potatoes carrotyams hed found nothing that resembled an onion unfortunately he added beans and experimentally a couple of grapefruit he stirred it all with a wooden paddle as usual noon looked like sunset which was endlessly disconcerting corbell rested the water was beginning to bubble granite was uncomfortable beneath his buttocks corbell was mildly depressed and he couldnt understand why and then he did last day of a camping trip youve worked your tail off your belt has come in a notch and a half you havent had to think much youve seen some magnificent scenery there were damn few people on the trails and they didnt rub your nerves its been good but now its back to work mirellylyra knew where he was he was healthier than hed known he could live a jovian year if nothing killed him the tourist in him liked that thought the mad old woman had promised him one year an olde earth year he could believe as much of that as he cared to but a sane man would choose the jungle could a man survive in the jungle outside sarashzillish it would depend corbell had come to antarctica in either spring or fall of a year twelve years long an olde earth year from now the day might last twentythree hours or one it would be much warmer than this or much colder for the world still had its tilt and its twentyfourhour rotation odd that the girls had not corrected that but maybe they were traditionalists much odder that they had not moved earth further out from the growing heat of jupiter what concerned corbell was this he could not take a world twenty degrees colder not without clothing and an endless night might drive him mad soup odors were beginning to permeate the wood smoke this sense of urgency was silly he had a year to get moving he could make foraging expeditions to the edge of the city keep his camp here whatever was out beyond the domes had had to be imported how dangerous could it be it might well be thousands of square miles of sarashzillish park an endless vacation and he could use it in his second life corbell mark ii had suffered enough future shock to kill a whole cityful of alvin tofflers tomorrow then he could take the car as far as the hospital it was near a standing fragment of dome then into the wild with spear and drumstick over either shoulder if the drumstick kept that long without refrigeration he remembered to scrape some of his fire into his trashcan fireplace he stretched out on the warm granite warm rain hammered at him he turned over fast rose to hands and knees and coughed out a tablespoonful of rainwater first time that had happened his bonfire must be out but had the soup cooked first was rain getting into his fireplace he looked up and forgot all of these crucial questions a dozen or so boysapproximately a big boy scout troop but uniformed only in breechcloutssquatted in a circle around corbell and his fire they were passing around a drumstick bone nearly clean by now while they watched him as if they had been watching him in perfect silence for hours their hair was rich where they had hair on some it was black and woolly on others black and straight dripping to their shoulders the crowns of their heads were bald but for a single tuft on the forehead they ignored the pounding rain and watched half smiling i should have known said corbell the cattails theyre half tame all right he made a sweeping gesture welcome to the kingdom of corbellforhimseif have some soup they frowned all of them one got up a long lanky boy a budding basketball player corbell would have judged he spoke sorry said corbell the boy spoke again command and anger that was no boys voice though it was highpitched corbell was hardly surprised these were the boys mirellylyras immortals i dont speak your language corbell said slowly with an instinct that went against sense the natives will understand if you speak slowly and clearly the boy came forward and slapped him across the face corbell hit him flush in the mouth his right cross hit ribs instead of solar plexus and the following left missed completely somehow then the whole circle converged on him his memory thereafter was a little hazy there was weight on his knees and forearms granite ground into his back the basketball star sat on his chest and spoke the same senteilce over and over through a split lip he would say it and wait and slap corbel twice and say it again corbell replied with obscenities he could feel the bruises now the tall boy got off his chest he said something to the others they all frowned down at corbell they discussed the matter in complex consonants spat like mouthfuls of watermelon seeds corbells head still rang it had been beaten against granite four boys were stil sitting on his forearms and knees rain splashed in his eyes it all tended to muddle his thinking did they think he was a strayed dictator but corbell was showing his age they couldntwrong no dictator immortality here the dictators must grow old as corbell had grown old the discussion ended four boys got off corbell he sat up rubbing his arms one took a theatrical pose pointed at the ground before him and spat one harsh word stay or heel his message was plain and corbell was in no shape to run the tall boy still studied corbell as if trying to make up his mind the others clustered around corbells soup pot they scooped soup into halves of coconut shells the tall boy finally offered him something else a ceramic cup from his belt corbell waited for room then moved in he sat and drank cattails moved among the tribe like a plague of snakes rubbed against ankles and were petted tore at the raw turkey carcass what was left of it corbell felt fur against his ankle he stroked a pureblack cattail a rumbling vibration went through his shin shall we say that corbell has been captured again or corbell asked himself shall we say that fate has given me guides through antarctica put that way the decision was easy iii the soloist sang in a strong rich tenor he sang to background music eight boys humming in at least four parts one more beating with turkey bones on corbells trashcan fireplace alien music improvised overly complex against the simple melancholy tune corbell listened openmouthed the back of his neck tingling he had feared this and it was true three million years had increased human inteffigence the night after his capture he had tried singing as a way to enhance his entertainment value since then he had sung medleys of advertising jingles or theme songs from movies or the clean and dirty folk songs he and mirabelle had sung on the boat songs three million years out of date but the boys liked them they didnt like it when he repeated a song theyd heard before he wondered why but he obeyed their wishes oh we got a new computer but its quite a disappointment ktollisp sang cause it always gives this same insane advice oh you need little teeny eyes for reading little teeny print like you need little teeny hands for milking mice the flavor or mockery in his singing was for corbell he couldnt know what the words meant but his pronunciation was accurate corbell had sung that song once beside him was the boy who had attacked him that night a week ago the leader in some respects skatholtz was broad of nose and lip woollyhaired longlimbed and emaciatedlooking he might have been a black preteen but for the partial baldness and the prison pallor he shared with the others he said in english he sings well do you think and laughed at what he found in corbels face now you know you remember everything everything even whole songs in another language yes you need to learn my speaking more than i need to learn your speaking but i learn yours first this is why you are different corbell older i think you are older than anything almost anything i will teach you how to talk when you tell your tale we all want to listen i make a mistake with you do you know why i hit you we thought you are only a dikt who broke with rules you did not skatholtz jumped suddenly to his feet he stood at parade rest for a moment then he shrank back hands raised half in supplication half to ward a blow i didnt cringe said corbell yes cringe it is a formal show of respect ktollisp sang so we got an expert genius and he rewrote all the programs but we always got results that looked like these oh you need little teeny eyes for reading little teeny print like you need little teeny license plates for bees it was pinkandblack dusk in the park the boys had returned early this day they spent most of every day in sarashzillish going through buildings like a flock of wild birds exploring corbell had thought savages swarming through ruins they could tiot understand hed soon lost that illusion a pair of boys had escorted him outside the hospital operating room while the others worked inside when he was allowed back in corbells scalpelspear had been reattached the manyjointed arms above the operating table were carefully carving a phantom patient he was not allowed to watch repairs but he had seen the results the refrigerator in the police building restored a factory tested run through its cycle until it had built two phone booths the boys did corbell the signal honor of letting him test the booths he had not tried to balk another factory had produced a bathroom a complete unit with pool and sauna the boys had repaired and tested the city lighting now the sides of many buildings glowed with soft yellowwhite light others remained dark the effect was eerie a citysized chessboard they lived like savages but apparently it was from choice in camp corbell had done his share of the work hauling firewood and digging up roots they had given him a loincloth but they would not give him a knife to replace his scalpelspear he still didnt know what place he held among them he feared the worst they were too intelligent they would see him as a lesser being an animal he needed them it wasnt just company he needed he could not travel safely until he knew something about this new continent the boy was singing all the verses to the muted laughter of his companions corbell said sooner or later ill run out of songs sooner skatholtz shrugged it is all the same we leave here when light comes again we go to other tribes to tell them that sarashzilish is ready for the long night you come with us night is it night thats coming had he landed in autumn then yes so you came from space unready i thought that yes the long day is ended and the short daynights are with us and the long night comes near in the long night we live in the city hunters go to the forests around and food will keep in the cold boxes in day we live more as we like whats it like out there you will see skatholtz picked up a passing cattail and stroked its fur we have time to teach you some speaking he said and he switched to the language corbell had tagged boyish corbell was agreeable he enjoyed language lessons morning they moved out there was incredibly little fuss they all seemed to wake at once soup had been simmering all night made to corbels recipe which they liked breakfast was soup in coconut shells they picked up pots cloth the fire starter half a dozen edged weapons one an albino boy with pink eyes and cottony golden hair handed corbell twenty pounds of jerked meat wrapped in cloth they left corbell woke fully marching the rest of the way he had to drive himself to keep up though the boys made no attempt to set a steady pace they ambled some dodged into buildings then jogged to rejoin the tribe savages they were not they carried an idiosyncratic variety of edged tools no two alike scimitars machetes sabers shapes that had no name all with carefully sculpted handles they had made the jerky the way corbell would have in an oven set on low the cloth they carried was indestructible stuff as thin as fine silk krayhayfts flashlight fire starter projected light of variable intensity in a conical beam or a beam no thicker than a pencil organized they were not but they had broken camp in minutes they tramped through silent streets ingrowths of jungle grew thicker about them until the city became jungle they passed a straight tree trunk that corbell suddenly realized was vinewrapped metal he looked up to see where it joined other members in a hexagonal array a part of the old dome the jungle bore fruit small oranges breadfruit several kinds of nuts the boys ate as they walked and picked raw nuts to replace the roasted nuts they carried they talked among themselves corbell couldnt follow their conversation it went too fast he strode along in their midst keeping the pace hed set himself incredible the way his old body bad healed tomorrow the aches would come tomorrow he might not be able to move except hed damn well better today he felt fine he felt like a scoutmaster leading his troop memo dont test your authority three hours or so into the hike and that could almost be a fight developing up ahead skatholtz and another boy were spitting syllables at each other with unwonted vehemence last nights singer loped to join them ktoffisp was a burly bigchested boy with skatholtzs black mans features and everybodys pale skin he snapped one word at the two and they shut up ktolisp looked about him frowned pointed the troop went off in that direction they found a clearing a few bushes growing on otherwise bare ground corbell watched not understanding as the troop formed a circle and skatholtz and the other boy stepped into it what was this a duel the two dropped their knives and breechclouts they circled like wrestlers the challenger kicked at skatholtzs heart skatholtz swerved clear and now it was happening too fast to follow fists and feet and elbows struck to kifi a momentary hold broken by an elbow between the eyes the challenger kicked off balance and handspringing clear skatholtz jumping full over a bush and then using it as a shield it looked like a damned dance but skatholtz was favoring one leg and the other boy was circling faster he was going to run him down he caught a kick in the face as he closed skatholtz moved in for the kill ktoffisp barked one word the bloodynosed boy cringed before skatholtz held the pose a moment then straightened everyone got up and started moving again someone else was carrying skatholtzs cumbersome pack of cloth his opponent was grinning and wiping at a bloody nose in midafternoon skatholtz said two words corbell recognized he said stop talk they did now the silence of their march was uncanny skatholtz dropped back to walk beside corbell very quietly he said in boyish you walk too loudly i cant help it are we hiding from something from dinner we hide earlier was too early we did not want to carry food so far if something moves let me know corbell nodded he didnt expect to see anything it would be months before his brain could train his eyes to see what the boys could see in familiar territory the keeneyed indian sees things the white man cant but only in his own environment two boys transferred their loads to others and slipped away corbell couldnt see where they had gone but presently there was a weird and terrifying sound like a clarinet screaming for help every boy instantly moved off the trail to flatten against a tree corbell copied them the tortured clarinet sounded nearer they heard branches snapping what would emerge a tentacled monster descendant of aliens enslaved by a younger spacetraveling state the monster burst from the trees it was crippled its forelegs running blood hamstrung the boys followed it first the hunters and then the rest slashing at its hind legs a baby elephant corbell caught up in time to see it die it was murder it left him sick to his stomach he fought his squeamishness and moved close to examine the corpse the beast was wrinkled and marked by old scars no baby this it was an adult elephant four feet tall at the shoulder he asked skatholtz can i help you may not butcher i cannot let you touch a knife you are not a dikt corbell you are nothing we know today i kill nobody he meant it as a joke but he didnt know enough boyish to phrase or inflect it that way skatholtz said and tomorrow i think you make fictiontoentertain but lives might end if i am wrong do you understand my speech i will learn he knew that skatholtz was using baby talk for his benefit do you know the chkint elephant when i was young they were bigger higher than your head at the shoulder he wondered how elephants had come to antarctica not as meat animals surely maybe there had been a zoo skatholtz looked dubious there are larger beasts in the sea but how could such a beast live on land without support still i have wondered why the elephants legs are so thick was it to support larger weight yes the legs were more thick when i was young the beast was the biggest on land five million years ago he had divided by twelve for jupiter years there were beasts far larger we have found the bones turned to rock in the earth skatholtz laughed skeptically and left him having finished butchering the elephant they departed corbell carried a rack of ribs for awhile but it slowed him down a disgusted tribesman finally took it away from him the forest ended far across a prairie of waving yellowishred vegetation corbell saw a last sliver of the departing sun jupiter was a pinkishwhite disk rising here they made camp presently corbell ate roasted elephant for the first time in his life he was too tired to sing for his supper someone was telling a storyit was krayhayft who had oriental eyes and gleaming white patches in his straight black hairand the others were listening in intense concentration when corbell dropped off to sleep they tramped all the next day through waving pinkishyellow grain corbell judged it wheat who grows this he asked skatholtz and was answered with laughter wheat took cultivation didnt it maybe it had been genealtered four genealtered cats still lived among the tribe they took their turns riding the necks of various tribesmen a wheat that grew wild would be worth having more useful than a cat that was all tail all day corbell saw kangaroos and ostriches bounding through the wheat they were fast and wary once there was a lone man with a spear far ahead a pale figure at a dead run behind a fleeing ostrich the pair was long gone when the tribe got there late in the day krayhayft found the tracks of something large the tribe followed near sunset their quarry came in sight a big shambling mass that ran from them on four legs until it turned at bay on two it was a bear its skin was hairless and yellow but for a mane of thick white fur a nude polar bear and no dwarf either it waddled toward the hunters and tried to maul them with its great claws but it was fighting homo superior in the prime of health and youth they danced around it slashing it fought on long after it should have bled to death they ate bear meat that night while the cattails hunted at the edge of firelight jupiter was full banded and orange corbell was dozing with a full belly when ktollisp dropped beside him he spoke slowly enunciating do you sing tonight if i choose then no acceptable what was this about growing grain the grain we used didnt grow without human help like skatholtz i do not read your face well if this is fictionforentertainment you do it well we will be sorry to lose you how do you lose me the boy might mean only that dikta die sooner or later like cattails no ktollisp said when we reach the dikta we lose you corbell hadnt counted on that how many days four five if we stop for amusement somewhere you wifi like the dicta corbel there are men and women and the making of new boys between them they have a city and some country around but they are not smart enough to make the machines go in day we fix the things that go wrong at night theyre not smart enough they are the same kind you are their heads should be built the same they have the brain the stuff inside the heads just like us they do not have the time we do not tell them how to fix machines they do not live long enough to learn and they might break the machines learning and we punish them if they leave so they stay in the dicta place they need us we know where to find them we must know this because we must bring new boys to the tribes what happens to the small ones not boys the girls they grow some boys grow too we choose the best the smartest and the strongest one from each tribe for each year and we send them back to the dikta we do not do the thing to them that makes them stay the same forever planned breeding for superior boys and it would tend to cow the young turks to the benefit of the leaders corbell said there must be a lot more women than men ktollisp grinned you like that anger tied his tongue youyou joke i die of being too old soon i cant make more boys ktollisp had corbell by the hair his knife was drawn before corbell could do more than gasp he slashedslashed away a thick handful of corbells hair and held it before his eyes your lies are for the newly born we are offended he said can you lie as to this the thin white hair he held in firelight was dark brown for half an inch at the roots corbell gaped the tribe surrounded him they must have been listening all the time yes they looked offended skatholtz said no dikt grows hair like that you have found the dikta way to live long like boys that we know only in tales we must know what and where it is corbell had forgotten his boyish every word in english he cried i havent the remotest idea ktollisp slapped him corbell tried to block with his arms wait wait youre right i must have taken dikta immortality i just dont know where maybe maybe its in something i ate the dikta did a lot of gene engineering they made the cattails and the wild wheat maybe they made something that grows dikta immortality something that grows in sarashzillish listen i didnt know it was happening i cant see my own hair skatholtz was gesturing the rest back you could not feel your youth returning i thought i was getting adapted to the rough life i spent like a hundred and thirty years in a coldsleep tank ten years at a time my years not yours i couldnt know what it did to me listen theres an old woman whos been searching every city in the world for dikta immortality if she doesnt know how could i we know nothing of this woman all right corbell tell your story leave nothing out he had been sleepy now he was scared bonelessand still bonewearyand in that state corbell told his lifes story whenever he paused for breath skatholtz spat complex phrases in boyish translating telling savages about a black hole at the center of a galaxy was easier than he had expected telling mirellylyras tale was wearing they kept backing him up for points she hadnt mentioned for points she hadnt even noticed in her thirst for dictator immortality they found her lack of curiosity incomprehensible questions what had he eaten drunk breathed could immortality have been in the bath in one city it was a mistake to mention the fountain of youth but no the dikta themselves used baths dawn came and corbell was still talking it could have been any of the things i tried the fruits the nuts the roots the meat the soup even i mean the combination of a lot of things plus the heat hell it could even be the water in the fountain skatholtz stood and stretched we can find out when we return to sarashzillish we will take a dikt shall we go go corbell saw that the other boys were getting up collecting gear oh please ill fall over you are stronger than you think corbell for too long were you a dikt sick with age they marched the wheatcovered prairie went on forever they camped early after the afternoon rain corbell sprawled in the wet earth and slept like a dead man iv he woke early a cattail had crawled along his ribs lilting the warmth tickling him it mewed in protest as he rolled away there was more protest from his overused muscles the fire had died jupiter white with a thin red crescent edge made the night seem bright well im in trouble again he thought imagine my amazement everyone in the world wants dictator immortality and they all think ive got it and theyre all half right why do the boys want it maybe they want to destroy it its the biggest difference between them and the dikta he let his hand stroke the orange cattail it draped itself over his knee and rumbled contentedly what is it if its edible its in sarashzillish everything i ate in four city mirellylyra ate too one kind for women and one for men and mans immortality doesnt affect women at all dont believe it so something in the park holds dictator immortality in the sap or the juice or the blood and i ate it what did she eat when she searched sarashzillish the boys eat almost no vegetablesand vegetarians eat no meatbut she led me both and fruit toe insects i dont eat insects if i could get her to sarashzillish id know watch her see what she doesnt eat the stars were bright tonight a few unwinking stars had a pinkish tinge small jovian moons the boys were sprawled far from where the fire had been a boy on guard looked around as corbel sat up it was krayhayft the only boy with white in his hair heady smells reached corbell wet earth and growing things traces of young supermen who hadnt washed recently a ghost of broiled meat that corbell hadnt shared suddenly he was hungry and suddenly he was elated what the hell am i complaining about he whispered the cattail stopped purring to listen im young if nothing else works i can outrun the bitch i should be dancing in the streets if i could find a street young again that made twice if he could find out how he did it he could stay young for the rest of his life everybodys dream and even if he couldntthe grin died on his face now he had fifty years to protect half a century of lifespan that the norn would rip from him if he couldnt show her the tree of life in sarashzillish something that tasted funny everything tasted funny different soil three million years of change it was too damn simple anyway immortality and you drink it like fruit juice an injection might have been more plausible if he had received any kind of injection or had he inhaled it like marijuana in the smoke from the wood of a carefully genetailored tree corbell do you enjoy the morning corbell jumped violently the sentrys approach had been perfectly silent he settled beside corbell by jupiter light the pale threads gleamed in his hair corbel had wondered at the grace with which he moved krayhayft who carried the fire starter krayhayft the storyteller how old are you twentyone said krayhayft thats old said corbell jupiter years i wonder why you arent the leader the old ones learn to avoid that chore and to avoid the fighting that goes with it skatholtz can beat me skill in fighting has an upper limit one is born with ones greatest possible strength corbel i think i have found your spacecraft what there the boy was pointing low on the northern horizon where a few stars glowed in the grayblack of coming dawn one showed pink among bluetinged stars the one that might be a moon except that it does not move is that your spacecraft no i dont know where my ship went don juan wasnt balllike it would look more like a thick spear krayhayft was more puzzled than disappointed then what is it i have seen it twinkle oddly it does not move but it grows more bright every night the whole system of worlds is messed up i cant explain it i think thats the next world out from jupiter i wish it had been your spacecraft said krayhayft he fell to studying the steady point of light entranced the cattail slithered from corbells knee and disappeared into the grain corbell saw two more low shadows slipping after it a cat screamed simultaneously something much bigger vented a much lower coughing roar krayhayft shouted alert it bounded out of the grain and leapt at corbells throat something as big as the biggest of dogs corbell threw himself to the side he saw a spear plant itself solidly in the open mouth and then the boys were on it it was a dwarf lion male magnificently maned it died fast even the first spear might have killed it corbell got up shaken the female could be out there skatholtz said yes and joined the others who were fanning out into the grain corbell spearless and superfluous stayed where he was presently he noticed something small in the path the lions charge had left through grain he found a small butterscotchsundae corpse the other cattails had returned to the fire they seemed unusually subdued at dawn he helped two boys build a fire he saw the reason later when four more trekked in with ostrich eggs they set the eggs on the coals carefully cut the tops off and stirred the contents with spear hafts scrambled eggs still no coffee corbell strode along in pink sunlight feeling good the slapping around was a bitter memory with bruises to corroborate it but he set next to it another memory ktoffisps fist holding white hair with darkbrown roots oh for a mirror he was a slave if not worse but he was young with an outside chance to stay that way a long time they had crossed a row of big badly weathered rocks oddly textured big as houses and bigger now the land sloped down and corbell found skatholtz marching beside him skatholtz said in english what do you know of the girls there was a boyish word for girlchild and another for dikta woman but girl was a third word and it carried a certain emphasis corbell answered mirellylyra told me something about them there was a balance of power between boys and girls and somehow it fell apart by her tale the girls ruled boys as boys rule dikta no look at it with more care the girls ruled the sky they could move the world by implication they controlled the weather they couldnt change the worlds rotation but they could decide how far the world should be from the sun in fact they first moved the world because the sun was getting too hot the boys ruled the dicta they could see to it that no more boys or girls were born an interesting role reversal that in itself that isnt a lot of power not in a crowded world where everyone expects to live forever anyway but our land was less rich the tales tell it so yeah look at it from the other direction suppose the boys let the dikta breed like rabbitsbreed fast they kill most of the girlchildren and hide most of the boychildren the boychildren grow up they get dikta immortality as long as they behave now the boys have an army they invade the land had leveled out ahead it sloped upward again skatholtz mulled it over then our tales tell nothing of this thats because it never happened the boys couldnt feed such an army poor land so the balance of power lastedoh tens of thousands of your years i see partly i am not used to thinking like this what went wrong somehow the girls lost control yeah weather our tales tell of a great thawing when green things grew for the first time in our land the girls tried to take it the thaw happened when the girls grew too proud in their pride they lost a moon and with the moon they lost their power corbell laughed they lost a moon hey just how accurate could those tales be after a hundred thousand years we live long we remember well details may be lost but we do not add fiction the land sloped upward in the distance corbell could see another line of big meltedlooking rocks a moon it sounds completely silly but peerssa told me the moons of jupiter were out of their orbits but thats not too strange dropping the world into their midst could have done that but he also said ganymede is missing completely ganymede the biggest moon hell i dont see how it fits in and the sun is too hot you said and king jupiter is too hot and the weather is screwed up said corbell it all comes down to a change in the weather it wiped out the balance of power then the boys wiped out the girls we tell tales of that war weapons as strong as a meteor strike look corbell such a weapon was used here skatholtz swept an arm behind him they had crossed a shallow dishshaped depression a couple of miles across rimmed by these halfmelted just a minute said corbell he dropped his load of jerky and scrambled up a rock twenty feet high and of oddly uniform texture there at the top he found lines of rust red making a great z the remains of a girder these were buildings he said it must have been a boy city when i was young i wanted to use weapons like that skatholtz laughed boyishly now i cringe at what they must have done to the weather but we destroyed the girls they did you some hurt too corbell climbed down from the melted building theyd have to trot to catch up to the tribe the tale tells that they destroyed us said skatholtz i never understood that saying corbell and skatholtz marched on in silence for a time boys chattered ahead it was just past noon too early to hunt very far away a great brown carpet flowed away from the noise they were making thousands of animals too distant to recognize too numerous to count skatholtz said in boyish soon we reach the border to the great water a days march broad is that border thea word is corbell learned the words for shore and sea the near village holds a pleasant surprise and skatholtz used another unfamiliar word i cant describe it we must do work for it all right in his youth corbell had never liked muscle work but oh it was good to have the muscles now he asked why were we talking english because i must know you i must learn when you are telling fiction corbell chose not to protest the injustice i wonder about the cattails what do you wonder in sarashzilish they rule here there are things bigger and more violent how can they live soon or late a predator kills them until then they are pleasant to keep near soon or late everything dies except boys before this evil you control your rage skillfully will we find more cattails among the dikta no we never leave cattails with the dikta why it isnt done corbell let it drop there was a thing he dared not ask yet but he would have to find out how carefully were the adults guarded the dikta place was the second place mirellylyra would look for him he couldnt stay long the moment she saw him darkhaired that moment he would have to produce dictator immortality and maybe he could one simple test made carefully he did not want the boys chopping down the tree of life v they reached the village at noon it was a strange blend of primitive and futuristic an arc of baths identical to the bath corbell had found by the shore in one city half surrounding the village square and surrounded in turn by sod huts and granaries there was great variety among the sod structures but they matched the village as a whole was beautiful corbel was beginning to get the idea the ancient factories would build the boys buildings for certain purposes it was very easy to go on using them century after century for other purposes they made their own and lavished labor and ingenuity on them he was not entirely surprised when krayhayft spoke for the tribe and called it krayhayfts tribe he who spoke for the vifiage had krayhayfts strange grace and gray in his long golden hair they worked all that afternoon a couple of boys of the village went with them to supervise shouting their orders with malice aforethought corbel and krayhayfts tribe used primitive scythes to reap grain from the fields and carry it in bundles into the village square until there was a great heap of it there until the boys of the village were satisfied after their labor the boys went whooping to the baths corbell waited his turn with impatience he went the full route bath and steam and sauna and back to the bath this time with the jacuzzistyle bubble system turned on when he emerged it was dark they were starting dinner the surprise skatholtz had promised was bread of course several kinds of bread plus rabbit meat the villagers had hunted corbell ate his fill of all the varieties of bread the taste brought on a nostalgic mood his eyes were wet when ktoffisp had finished singing corbells version of poisoning pigeons in the park the bread had surprised him less than the phone booth at one end of the arc of baths he dithered but skatholtz knew he knew about phone booths while krayhayft started one of his long tales corbell sought out skatholtz and asked him the skeletal boy grinned were you thinking of leaving us through the prilatsil not especially of course not well youve guessed right this village trades their grain for other breadmakings all across the land i didnt think the prilatsil would send anything that far the land is crossed by a line of prilatsil closespaced do you think we would handle emergencies by traveling on foot look skatholtz drew a ragged circleantarcticaand a peace symbol across it if there were serious reason to travel these lines of prilatsil exist since the time of the girls they have been used four times more if tales have been lost we keep them in repair corbel kept his other questions to himself he hoped he would not have to use the prilatsil they were too obvious they would be guarded when the tribe left in the morning they carried loaves of bread in their cloth bags there had been an exchange three of krayhayfts tribe had stayed behind and three villagers had replaced them no big deal was made of it and corbell had to examine faces to be sure it had happened now there was no more grain the land dropped gradually for twenty miles or more and ended in mist nothing grew on it but dry scrub off to the right of their path was a cluster of sharpedged shapes promontories all alone on the flat lifeless ground nature sometimes imitates that regular artificial look corbell asked anyway they are artificial skatholtz told him i have seen them before i have my guess as to what they are but shall we look at them some of krayhayfts tribe have not seen them the troop veered the structures grew larger some lay on their sides disintegrating but the nearest stood upright its narrow bottom firmly set in the ground the tribe clustered beneath a great curved wall leaning out over their heads ships said corbell they carried people and things over water what are they doing so far from the ocean perhaps there was ocean here once yeah yeah when the world got so hot a lot of the ocean went into the air this used to be seabottom mud i think krayhayft said that fits with the tales can you guess what they might have carried too many answers is there a way in he didnt understand when krayhayft untied the fire starter from his belt he would have stopped him otherwise krayhayft twisted something on the fire starter pointed it at the great wall of rusted metal the metal flared corbell said nothing it was already too late he watched the thin blue beam spurt fire until krayhayft had cut a wide door the metal slab fell away tons of mud spilled after it aeons of dust and rainwater they waded up the mud slope joking among themselves and corbell followed the hull was one enormous tank there were no partitions to prevent sloshing corbell sniffed but no trace of the cargo remained oil or something more exotic or only topsoil for the frigid antarctic cities topsoil wouldnt slosh around the surprise was on deck and above deck masts there was no place here for human sailors there were only proliferating masts reminiscent of clipper ships and cables all running to a great housing at the bow a housing for motors and winches and a computer the hull had appeared to be sound the masts were in fine shape but time had reduced the computer to garbage that was a pity it was as big as don juans computer which had housed peerssas personality conceivably it could have told them a great deal they marched down into the fog and the fog swallowed them corbell heard regular booming sounds that he failed to interpret then suddenly they had reached the sea breakers roared and hissed across a rocky shore they rested then while others collected brush for a fire three of the boys swam out into the breakers with spears and the rope it looked inviting the water would not be cold but corbell had seen the boys hunt and he wondered what toothy prey waited for them two came back they swam ashore with the rope twitching behind them and collapsed panting heavily while others dragged the rope in with its thrashing burden they beached twelve feet of shark the third boy didnt come back corbell couldnt believe it how could immortals be so careless of their lives the boys were subdued but they held no kind of formal ceremony corbell ate bread that night he had no stomach for shark he had seen what came out of the sharks stomach he lay long awake puzzling it out he had been old and young and middleaged in no intelligible sequence with any luck he would stay young he had fought for his life and his lifestyle against the massed might of the state he had never given up not with all the excuse in the world did they get tired of too much life corbell didnt doubt that they could build machines to kill off the sharks the factories that kept turning out identical bedrooms and baths and offices were a tribute to their laziness but they were also briffiant then why were the sharks still here tradition maschismo in the morning the boys were cheerful as ever in the afternoon they reached the dikta chapter seven the dictators i six city dikta city showed first as a bar of shadow along the shoreline then as half a mile of blank wall with a low windowed structure peeking above the center dikta city showed its back to the approaching boys as they rounded the end of the wall corbell saw its face dikta city was a single building four stories tail half a mile long and as wide as a luxury hotel ts faзade looked north toward the sea and the sun and was rich with windows and balconies and archways between city and sea was a semicircle of low wail over which the tops of trees were visible a garden the dikta were emerging through an arch in the low garden wall in scores now they waited dikta city could never have been under a dome it was the wrong shape it must have been built late specifically to house the adults long after antarctica became a hothouse and the seas receded across the continental shelf topsoil must have been spread over the salt dunes and walled against the winds fish from the sea and whatever the walled garden produced would be the only sources of food for miles around it would be difficult to leave this place corbell thought a couple of hundred dikta waited until the boys were a few yards away until corbell had counted seven men among a horde of women then they cringed all of them at once they held the cringe as krayhayft stepped forward we come to repair your machines krayhayft said and to take your boychildren to ourselves good said one among them he had a white beard and shoulderlength white hair very clean and curly he straightened from the cringe as did all the others and now corbell was impressed by their general health and dignity they didnt act like slaves the cringe had been a formality corbell wondered what would have happened if he had cringed naturally that fourth day in sarashziffish the boys might have killed him as an escapee all of the dikta were studying corbell krayhayft noticed he spoke at length in a voice that carried corbell couldnt follow everything he said but he was telling a condensed version of corbells history the spaceflight the long voyage some complex phrases that might have related to relativistic timecompression the flight from mirellylyra no mention of the mad dikta womans motives no mention of dikta immortality corbell was sure of that he listened for it the old man listened and laughed he was vastly entertained at the end of the narrative he came forward and said welcome to our refuge corbell you will have interesting things to tell us i am gording do i speak slowly enough a pleasure to meet you gording i have a lot to learn from you yes i can understand you will you join us tonight then we have room in the dikta place for many more children it will be instructive to see what your children are like i corbell choked up the women were examining him and speculating in whispers it wasnt just his browline though even the women were half bald his brownandwhite hair must have caught their attention too and his answer was rudely delayed im happy you accept me for that important purpose he said what he was was nervous abruptly he was very conscious of his nearnakedness the dikta were entirely naked one of the womenher long black hair was just showing gray said it must be long since you made children with a woman corbell laughed divide by twelve a quarter of a million years what she asked then raised laughter corbell shook his head i may have forgotten how there is only one way to know he helped the boys set up camp a grove of trees occupied the center of the semicircular garden within the wall which was far more orderly than the jungle in sarashzillish the boys set up camp under the trees and built their fire with wood brought by dikta women you may go to the dikta skatholtz told him then but you must not tell them of dikta immortality it didnt seem to occur to him that he might be disobeyed what about my hair i know damned well they noticed it skatholtz shrugged you are an early type of dikt from before stories were told tell them all dikta once grew hair like yours if any learn what you know their minds will be all that they know will be taken from them ill keep my mouth shut skatholtz nodded corbell was dismissed the prospect of an orgy was making corbell jumpy he had tried to lie with a woman three million years ago in the state dormitory the night before they took him to the moon to board don juan all those staring eyes had cowed him left him impotent it might be the same tonight but he had half an erection now dikta citys ground floor was a row of long halllike public places each roomy enough for two hundred the dining room was one of these it had some of the trappings of a cafeteria corbell found trays and utensils at one end of a counter a dozen women and a man cooked food in large batches and served it as the line passed others finished eating and took their places weird differences the single utensil was a large plastic spoon with a sawtoothed cutting edge and the metal trays floated at elbow level sinking slightly under the weight of food food was a variety of vegetables cooked in elaborate combinations with very little meat in that sense it was like chinese cooking the old man named gording escorted corbell through the routine tables were of different sizes seating four to twelve at a table for six with gording and four women corbell had a fair chance of following a conversation they asked him about his hair he told them skatholtzs lie and expressed surprise at their monochromatic hair and receding hairlines maybe they believed him observing his dinner companions up close he noted that like the boys they showed pallid almost translucent skin coupled to all the shapes natural to human beings noses broad or narrow lips thick or thin bushy eyebrows or eyes with epicanthic folds or both bodies burly and invulnerable or slender and fragile vitamin d hed spoken aloud they looked at him waiting its only a theory corbell tried to explain once all dikta were dark brown when the sun was hot and bright some dikta went far north where it was so cold that they had to cover themselves or die they were smiling nervous incomprehension but he went doggedly on our skin makes a thing we need from sunlight when dikta cover themselves for warmth their skin must let more sunlight through or they die my people grew lighter skin i think it was the same with your people after the sun turned red they were still smiling dark brown gording said your tale is strange but our skin does make a lifechemical kathope but how do you live in the long night almost six years kathope seed we press it for the oil escaping dikta city should have been easy during the long night when the boys all gathered in sarashzillish but fugitives would have to carry their own kathope seed yeah and boys would tear it up if they found it growing anywhere but here or in sarashziffish corbell was beginning to worry maybe he really was trapped he asked about the coming festivities we take sex in company tteeruf told him at a wild guess she was sixteen or so her face heartshaped her eyes large and expressive her mouth full and made for laughter her hair a tightly coiled ruff even she was half bald sex is the only pleasure we have that the boys cant ever understand that and giving birth her eyes dropped shyly i havent done that yet ii the orgy hall was an afterthought it seemed the boys hadnt thought of putting one in when they built dikta city the dikta had repaired the omission by building a kind of infinity sign on the roof composed of twelve of the massproduced triangular bedrooms arranged like two pies of six wedges each with two baths set between they had knocked out all the inner walls the small toilets that belonged to the bedrooms still had doors but the closets didnt and the phone booths had been ripped out of course when corbell arrived there were dikta on every horizontal surface beds and couches and coffee tables and more coming in half a dozen women gestured invitation from one of the beds corbell accepted his nervousness left him quickly rippling water bed and warm womanflesh formed his pillows and it was altogether delightful out of courtesy and because she was nearest he lay with an older woman first she expressed no disappointment but he was too quick and he knew it after all that time to hurry and still it felt like a mighty victory i gave this up forever he said and thanked her with his eyes now he beat his chest and warbled the challenge of the great ape and took a woman with pronounced oriental features and warm skilled hands this time it was longer better the partial baldness of these women made them more exotic their breasts were alike large in diameter but flattened even in older women they did not sag they asked him about his sensations even with his wife corbell had had difliculty analyzing his own reflexes and he had trouble now they probed delicately with questions and with stroking fingertips exploring his ancient nervous system and telling him about their own a younger man joined them two women left were replaced by two more corbell scratched tteerufs back while she was in sexual congress with the other man was he through for the night evidently not the man was using his hands and toes attempting to satisfy five women at a time reminding corbel of old paintings from india egotist but it seemed fair given the proportion of women to men when inspiration came corbell tried those variations himself it took some concentration and he had never been in practice he was tentative a bit clumsy one of the women asked him about it he told her one woman to a man monogamy no childrens immortality the faces around him closed down like masks and the woman changed the subject he hardly noticed he was drunk on the hormones bubbling in his blood he watched the other man and two women trying to follow what they were doing but it all came out as a tangle of arms and legs there are lost skills tteeruf told him a bit wistfully positions used in freefall now they exist only in the tales he tried the sauna and the bathtub hot water churned with bubbles and the currents generated by a couple on the far side gording and the older woman who had been his first since the corpsicle tank wet women rubbed against him a watersplashing war erupted and died out corbell and a young woman with golden hair made love sitting crosslegged in the tub facing each other that was when he looked up and saw the boys half a dozen of them seated on the edge of an open airwell with their feet hanging down toward the tub they passed comments to each other while they enjoyed the show ktoffisp caught him looking and waved the girls eyes followed corbells upward then dropped in disinterest okay it didnt bother her when ktolisp waved again corbell waved back in the bedroom in one city there had been an old videotape of two couples demonstrating lovemaking positions even then corbell had sensed the presence of an audience now he knew they had been there at the coffee table boys or girls watching borrowed dikta or even boys and girls mixed before the great rift the orgys impetus dwindled now half of dikta city clustered on the beds and couches and coffee tables in half of the bedroom complex questioning corbell his audience thinned as some left by the stairwell others went by twos and threes to the other half of the multiplebed complex and came back later corbell talked on and on the first man to see the bottom of the universe he had his audience at last euphoria suddenly he was yawning uncontrollably no they didnt use the bedrooms for sleeping they slept in a groundfloor room gording volunteered to walk him over the fresh air cooled his damp body and cleared his head the stars were slightly misted over gording pointed to a steady pinktinged star in the north corbell you came from space recently what is that a world like a little jupiter it shouldnt be there but it is it grows brighter but it does not move against the pattern of fixed stars that bothered krayhayft too it was brighter wasnt it listen im too tired to think the sleeping room was a kind of greenhouse the sleeping surface was tall grass living grass already covered by bodies gording and corbell found space lay down and slept the sun shining through glass walls woke him four women were still curled on the grass isolated the rest were gone he had daydreamed of nights like last night when he was much younger without the bald heads of course so what he was lucky they saw him as human lucky he could still see them as human too their bodies hadnt changed much their minds had changed more they seemed geniuses and they seemed placid in their slavery if they hadnt freed themselves from the boys in all those aeons how could corbell corbell remembered that there was a possible answer which had to be tested a ceremony was in progress at the boy encampment eight dikta males were presenting five boychildren to the tribe of the three cupbearers krayhayft who seemed to be the oldest now seemed to be in charge the rest of the boys watched solemnly three carried the remaining cattails around their necks corbell decided against joining them he took a place by himself and kept his mouth shut his chance would come the children appeared to be five to seven years old they were overawed and immensely proud of the adults it was gording who named each child and described him his strength his accom plishments his habits good and bad for a moment corbell thought one of the children was being rejected and that didnt fit his preconceptions at all then he realized that the boychilds name had been rejected he was being given a new one the ceremony broke up suddenly the boychildren stayed with the boys the men went off talking together krayhayft called to corbell i know that walk and that look corbell went over the walk means you have used muscles in unaccustomed labor i know the bright smile and red eyes too corbell grinned youre right you had fun youll never know i never will some of the boychildren we take try to be the best so that they can be dikta do you believe that sure did you krayhayft scowled it didnt matter i was not best at anything i burnt food my spear missed the prey i dont like to remember that long ago i remember that i wanted to go home what does a yearling know of the difference between living five years or six and living forever and sex what does a yearling know of sex what does a boy know of sex he can only watch krayhayft grinned suddenly last night was the first time i ever saw he beat his chest with his fists and gave an ululating yell i was a little crazy that seems normal what happens next how long do you stay here if some machine needs to be repaired we stay otherwise we leave tomorrow we have many tribes to meet to tell them that we have made sarashzillish ready for them time was constricting for corbel but he dared not hurry at the moment he had nothing at all to do and everyone else was busy on the second floor the boys had opened what might be a power generator they ordered him away from their secrets in another room women wove cloth of exceptional beauty and color during the long night we cover ourselves one told him she refused to teach him how to weave the thread might cut off some of your fingers its that strong what would be the point of making cloth less durable he stole a loop of the thread held it a moment then put it back sure itd make wonderful strangling cord but where would he hide it he wound up in the kitchen dining room complex serving food and watching the cooks he had been a pretty good cook once but no sane chef would try to use someone elses kitchen without exploring it first and it was bad news the implements and measuring spoons were unfamiliar of course but the basic foods and the spices were also unfamiliar if he intended to pay his way here he would have to learn to cook all over again in midafternoon a woman offered to relieve him at the serving counter she took a second look and said you are unhappy right i am charibil can i help he couldnt tell her all his problems theres not much here im good for men dont have to work if they dont want to you do have one useful talent you can make greater the variety of traits among us their gene pool was a little skimpy yeah though there was variety charibil herself had the epicanthic fod and delicate features of an oriental though she was corbells height the uniformity was there too pae skin breasts wide and flat halfbald scalp and curly black topknot slender frame she jumped suddenly to her feet come to the orgy room corbell you need cheering up is it displacement from your tribe that bothers you or fear of the ancient dikt and her cane all of the above right i need cheering up if he thought to be alone with charibil he was wrong she called to three friends as they passed and one joined them and then a small goldenhaired woman invited herself into the group and four women presently reached the bedroom complex with corbel others were there a man and a single woman who seemed to want to be alone charibil and the other women suddenly picked corbell up by arms and legs swung him wide and slung him through the air laughing at his startled hey the surface surged as he splashed down surged again as they joined him he laughed with them for a moment the laugh caught in his throat there was a mirror over the bed he couldnt have missed that last night and he hadnt the others had those mobile sculptures over them had the women noticed anything corbell pulled charibil against him rolled onto his back with her on top and looked up at himself long thinning white hair sprang from a military haircut in chestnut brown in the damndest hairdo corbell had ever seen in the face there were frown lines around the mouth and eyes he saw a lean wellmuscled middleaged version of one well known to him a certain brainwiped state criminal theyd noticed his tension they turned him over and massaged it away the kneading of muscles gradually became eight hands caressing him and corbell was seduced twice to his own amazement he felt that he was faffing in love with four women an impossible thing for corbell mark i in postcoital sadness corbell knew at last that corbel was dead he distracted himself with questions no all nights are not like last night charibil told him the men would tire of us last night was special we stayed away from this place for five short days we like to give the boys something to watch why why they rule us and they live forever but there is one joy they cant know she gloated you can live forever it was on the tip of his tongue but instead he said what do the men do when theyre not up here i mean if they dont work they make decisions and let me see privatht is perhaps our finest cook cording deals with the boys in all matters in fact he is with them now charloop makes things to teach and entertain children gording is in the boy camp yes he and the boys had some important secret to discuss they wouldnt ive got to be there corbell rolled off the bed if gording and the cattails had come together then corbell had to be there too im sorry if im being rude but this is more important than i can tell you he left behind him he heard tinkling laughter iii it was near sunset boys and boychildren were roasting a tremendous fish over coals ktollisp was telling them a tale the children were making much of a pair of indolent furred snakes corbell looked for gordings white hair he found gording and krayhayft and skatholtz a good distance from the main group they were spitting boyish too fast for corbells understanding he caught the word for girls and his own word ganymede and he saw the third cattail curled in an orange spiral on a rock almost behind skatholtz they saw him gording said good corbells sources of knowledge are different from ours krayhayft scoffed he did not even see the implications skatholtz said gording is right corbell in one of our tales there is a line with no meaning the tale tells of the war between girls and boys the line tells that each side destroyed the other corbell sat down crosslegged next to skatholtz could this have something to do with our strayed planet yes with the mere fleck of light that grows brighter but does not move against the background of fixed stars do you understand what that might mean hed been assuming that that dot of light was the banded gas giant peerssa had shown him but that didnt have to be true if something in the sky grew brighter without moving grew closer with no shift sideways its coming down our throats well phrased said skatholtz but it was monstrously unfair that corbell should have found eternal youth just before the end of the world youre guessing he said of course but the girls ruled the sky krayhayft said when the girls knew they had lost they may have aimed your missing ganymede on a long path to smash the world he couldnt let this moon thing distract him when his chance came he had to be ready but did it matter what if don juan had brought him home just in time to face impact with a lost moon wait a minute why not a short path krayhayft shrugged skatholtz said who can know the mind of a girl they are long dead they werent stupid the longer the path the more chance the moon would miss the world its been divide by twelve a hundred thousand years after all we do not know how they moved worlds how can we know what difficulties they faced perhaps the long path was their only choice corbell stood up he stretched then sat down on the smooth rock behind him a big boulder with a cattail sleeping on top well behind his head he braced his feet against a smaller halfburied boulder i dont like it i dont like my place in it any minor design change in don juan and i could have been back a hundred thousand years sooner or later what are the odds id get here just in time for all the excitement gording laughed at him what an odd bit of luck that i should be alive at this time and i skatholtz cried corbel flushed could the tale have meant something else of course no detail is given skatholtz said okay the girls knew theyd had it they were looking for revenge but why in the sky they must have lost control of the sky already otherwise they would have put the earth back where it belonged further from jupiter where it wouldnt get too much heat so they couldnt have thrown a moon at earth long path or short path the moon is coming anyway said krayhayft but skathotz said let him speak did i tell you what mirellylyra told me she he tripped on the boyish phrases then she left zerotime with a thousand prisoners some of them lived to reach this place she says the boys took them but she escaped youve lost the thread of thought krayhayft reproved him no it fits in look if the girls were that close to ruined there wasnt much they could do but if the boys were keeping all the dikta in the same place the girls could wipe them out and as he said it he knew he was right they all saw it and their minds were better than his without the dikta there would be no more boys only a dwindling population of immortals dying one by one by accident and boredom and act of god your mirellylyra escaped said skatholtz because there were too few boys left to hunt her down the new dikta became pampered pets they who had been criminals in prehistory he barked bitter laughter but the moon still comes if it is a random result of the girls loss of control still it could destroy us even a near miss his boyish went into high gear and the others joined in faster and faster excluding corbell suddenly the boys got to their feet and left they had excluded cording too for an instant gording let his fury show and then he relaxed and corbel tested his footing butt on smooth rock feet in front of him against rock that seemed steady and he dared not look behind him it would not do gording said bitterly for boys to discuss such important matters with a dikt what was that about they must choose you see if the moon strikes the world time ends but if the moon comes by mischance it may still pass close by the world tides earthquakes oh dikta citys right on the ocean theyll have to move you move us how where they cant let us go free we are their treasure their source their valued property gording was angry already almost angry enough to strike out at the nearest target now maybe theyll just take some women the best they can find mate them with the boychildren theres no scarcity of boys they can wait till the stock builds up again after all they have to be fairly careful with their breeding considering that their original stock was a bunch of rejects from unexpectedly soon unexpectedly fast gording leapt for his throat corbell pushed hard against the rock kicked himself out from under gordings leap he reached over his head startled from sleep the cattail tried to leap away corbells hand closed on its tail gording hit ground and came at him again face calm hands outstretched for murder he wasnt quick enough corbel swung the cattail into his face the beasts teeth closed in cordings neck in that moment of distraction corbell swung a haymaker at his jaw gording jerked aside the cattail was a tight fur collar its teeth were still in his neck but he hadnt been as distracted as corbell had thought hopelessly off balance himself corbell watched the old man set himself and lash out the hard fist sank into his solar plexus corbel doubled over lightning exploded at the nape of his neck his belly hurt his neck hurt he was curled on his side in crushed strawberries he tried to uncurl they were standing around him a lot of boys looking down skatholtz was shaking his head and smiling magnificent corbe then said corbell why am i lying on the ground hurting never mind he uncurled a little more cording stood relaxed his hand covering the flesh torn by cattail teeth he showed no inclination to resume hostilities corbell said im sorry i shouldnt have said that maybe its jealousy youre all like youre all smarter than i am and it shows there was blood beneath the hand gording held to his neck he breathed heavily he said i understand you were careless with an unfamiliar language i should not have taken offense it will be best if i rejoin the dikta for tonight he turned away and took two stumbling steps before hands closed on his arms krayhayft was smiling his hands made a wiping motion that wont serve you cant go back to them cording what would they think when your hair changed color cording laughed it was worth trying corbell said shit no no corbell you did a fine job of acting it was the set of your muscles that betrayed you everywhere i couldnt know why you wanted me to attack you and i had to find out im sorry i couldnt think of any other way i still dont know krayhayft said well know soon enough the logic holds a cattail bit you some days before we found you we saw the mark our tradition is that the dikta may not enjoy the company of cattails we know that long ago it was possible to change the nature of a living thing and we know that it was done to cattails why should they not make dikta immortality as boys make spit but well watch you as we go cording to see if you grow young and as we go corbell we will think of some useful punishment for your deception abeady i have an idea and we go now iv by dead of night the tribe moved along the shore they carried neither food nor water jupiter showed a bright gibbous disk above the dark sea the mystery planet showed too near jupiter corbell picked out other moons and a moon shadow on jupiters banded face one of the children had gone to sleep and was being carried the others asked a thousand questions of laughing boys corbell listened to the answers details of the march ahead other bands of boys wondrous machines the gathering in sarashzillish nothing he hadnt heard or guessed he waited his chance to talk to gording alone it never came cording marched at the head of the line under escort when corbell tried to catch up he was barred with spear butts by morning they were thirsty by noon they were very thirsty and loud were the complaints of the boychildren cording was showing the strain of unaccustomed hiking but he showed it silently in the slight weave to his walk and the occasional stumble in the afternoon they reached a river the splashing was loud as boys and boys drank and then swam here they camped corbell and others caught fish with makeshift hooks and lines of thread that might have come from dikta city corbell was not allowed to clean his fish he was not allowed a knife and this was the thread that would make wonderful stranglers cord if it didnt cut the stranglers fingers as he considered his fishline he caught krayhayft grinning at him krayhayft held out his hand corbell put the fishline in it the river had cut a deep gorge into the former sea bottom leaving high sheer cliffs of layered sandstone all day they followed the twisting beautifully colored walls at sunset where the cliffs constricted and took a sharp turn they came on a hidden village the village occupied both sides of the river joined by a wide bridge beyond the village the desolation continued to the horizon the villagers made them welcome and fed them corbell entertained with a medley of advertising jingles afterward krayhayft began a tale while corbell made himself comfortable against a convenient boulder it seemed to him that the village was a wellplaced trap if dikta followed a band of boys from dikta city they would have to go around the village climbing cliffs to do it and leaving traces of themselves and into more desolation unless they wanted to risk raiding the village there was a phone booth at one end of the bridge the bridge was a wide arch of prestressed concrete or something better its lines singularly beautiful it was the only sign of advanced technology among basic and primitive structures there had been bread and corn with tonights fish there must be a working phone booth here to bring them but was that a working booth it was too blatant it might be a trap a voice behind corbels ear whispered we will not let you use the prilatsil corbel turned to stare rudely at the intruder he had not been watching the booth the boy was of the village a pinkeyed goldenhaired albino with a narrow ferret face he almost lost his footing as he squatted next to corbell his loincloth was animal skin he was young then corbell had learned to tell the older boys were never awkward and they did not brag of their kills by wearing the skins he grinned and said try it if you like we would bruise you i think theyll bruise me anyway corbell said hed been wondering about krayhayfts punishment damn krayhayft corbell would be a bag of nerve ends before the blade fell yes you lied said the golden boy i am to be there when punishment comes sadist corbell said in english i can guess the meaning no we do not make pain for pleasure only for instruction your pain will be instructive to you and to us the boy chuckled gloatingly making a liar of himself and got up now what was that all about corbell expected to die as soon as gording began to grow young he knew too much or would they only wipe his memory he shivered it would still be death though it would let them use the ancient felons genes they left carrying provisions one of the boychildren stayed behind half a dozen villagers came with them including the young albino the continental shelf had been wider in this area it was still barren the day was nearly over before they reached first fruit trees then cornfields they camped in the corn they passed a larger tribe on the third day for a time krayhayfts tribe mingled with tsilliwheeps tribe exchanging news tsilliwheep was a strange one large pudgy sullenfaced a classic schoolyard bully with pure white hair he issued no orders and he mingled with nobody when his tribe veered away it took two of krayhayfts tribe and two boychildren they passed single human beings at a distance loners skatholtz told corhell they tire of others around them for a time they go alone krayhayft has done it six times why maybe to know if they stifi love themselves maybe to know that they can live without help maybe they want to give up talking tsilliwheep will be a loner soon i think he had the look corbell it is very bad manners to speak to a loner or interfere with him or offer him help through waisthigh corn they marched in early afternoon a herd of dwarf buffalo passed tens of thousands of them blackening the land and raising continuous rolling thunder the trampled path was a quarter hours march across corn churned into the dirt along with the corpses of aged buffalo unable to keep up for the first time corbell saw vultures vultures had survived unchanged skatholtz bent their path to take them through a ruined city an earthquake or girl weaponry had shattered most of the buildings and time had weathered all the sharp edges corbell saw sandblasted public prilatsil he ignored them hed seen no evidence that power was still coming to this ruin boys had made a semipermanent camp at the far edge of the ruined city krayhayfts tribe joined them and contributed ears of corn to their dinner corbell saw what they were using for cooking what the locals had mounted on rocks above their fireplace was a piece of clear glass seven feet across curved like an enormous wok a good enough frying pan except for the dangerous jagged edges it had to be a piece of a bubblecar on the fourth day they passed two tribes and joined with them for a time and left them behind with the second of these groups went the last two boychildren corbell couldnt help wondering if that related to his situation there are things you dont do in front of cliiidren gording was having less trouble keeping up if the chance came the old man would be able to run but running wouldnt do it the boys were faster corbell wanted transportation phone booths didnt send far enough useful for hiding in a city but not for reaching safety not unless he could get into the emergencytransport network skatholtz had diagrammed for him a car would be better or what did the boys use to lower a dozen bedrooms onto the roof of dikta city a giant helicopter some big flying thing anyway he wouldnt find any of those things outside a city maybe they existed in sarashzillish alone he would reach sarashzillish too late cordings hair would be showing black by then past noon on the fifth day far across the corn they watched a loner hunting sprint walk a bit sprint walk the loner must be tired but the kangaroo was exhausted hop and waddle hop and waddle look back at the closing loner hop hop hop until at last it waited for the loner to walk up and kill it krayhayfts tribe veered to give the loner room but the loner had other plans he did a fast butchering job on the kangaroo slung the meat over his shoulder and loped to join the tribe at an angle he was dirty he bled where the kangaroo had snapped at his forearm he had lost his loincloth somewhere but he grinned white flashing through the dirt and he talked at electrictypewriter speed corbell caught some of it hed been out a year and a half since the end of long night the previous year had gone places done things seen wonders had studied the kchint herds from hiding knew more of them than any boy his rapid speech ran down as his eyes locked on corbell corbell tried to listen to what the boys were telling the loner about him unfamiliar words and the sudden drumming of the afternoon rain made understanding impossible but the wanderer derived much amusement from what he was hearing when the afternoon rain ended the clearing sky disclosed reaching towers whose tops sketched a dome shape they camped a mere hours distance from what seemed an intact city the loner had cleaned the mud out of his hair revealing it as brown streaked with white and had found a loincloth he did all the talking that night was that why boys turned loner nothing to talk about anymore corbell slept badly the towers made a broken arc against the stars if he could break loose to reach the city alone but every time he looked around him someone was watching him as if they could read his mind v parhalding was bigger than sarashzillish moth and rust had done their work and invading soil and grass and trees and vines the buildings still stood most of them their flat roofs sprouted green heads grapevines and blackberry vines swathed their waists corn and wheat grew mixed where soil was shallow where soil and water could pooi there were gnarled old trees bearing varied fruit and walnuts corbell picked what looked like a puffy lemon the fruit tasted like lemonade like lemon with sugar parhalding was what an abandoned city looked like in sarashzillish he had taken the state of preservation for granted foolish he should have been looking for caretakers the vines bulged oddly near the corner and something glinted within the bulge light shifted as he walked and corbell became certain that there was a bubblecar under the bulge how badly damaged corbell caught cordings fractionofasecond glance had anyone else caught it the boys couldnt know everything but the tribe had clumped inward as they walked he might have thought they were afraid of ancient ghosts they converged to a corn new file pact mass with corbell in the middle and it was corbell who was afraid that building ahead no vines no green top someone had maintained it corbell knew it by its shape a hospital the hospitals big double doors opened for them now the dozen boys around corbell were close enough to trip over one another though they didnt indirect lighting came alive slowly showing an admissions desk a shattered picture window with a few curved transparent teeth still in it cloudrug and sofas cleaned of slivers and a wall covered by twin polarprojection maps with the polar ice caps prominent a panicky choking sound pulled his eyes around corbell saw yesterdays loner fall to his knees in the doorway his head was gone his neck jetted bright blood gording was at bay the albino stood bentlegged and snarling between gording and the double doors as the young albino came at him gording threw a rock sidearm to miss corbell tried to make sense of what he was seeing the rock passed behind the albinos neck turned sharply and circled his throat gording jerked hard on the other rock still in his hand then it made sense the albino screamed without sound and clawed at the air between them his neck parted cleanly the doors opened for the headless corpse as it stumbled backward gording brushed past it and was gone corbell became aware that two boys were holding his arms and the rest were charging after gording corbells military training was far in the past but he remembered stamp down along the shin the enemy doubles up you twist and bring your elbow up his captors faded like ghosts from his blows and a swinging arm caught him precisely across the eyes he was dizzy and half blind as they led him up flights of stairs they have him soon he heard skatholtz say hes got thread well have to test every doorway said krayhayft thread is too near invisible and if it caught a boy across the throatcome corbell they had climbed four ifights of stairs and gone down a corridor corbell looked into an operating room four tables and spidery metal arms above them nooo corbell thrashed your pain will be instructive to you and to us they were going to dissect him they pulled him to an operating table and fastened him spreadeagled face up you cant be sure you know everything i know he called to krayhayfts receding back nuts he was gone but skathotz hoisted himself to sitting position on another table skatholtz if you destroy my brain you lose the only viewpoint that isnt just like your own now think about that were not going to ruin your brain at least i think were not there is that risk what are you going to do were going to entertain each other then krayhayft came jogging back with a flask of blood plasma clear fluid anyway he reached over corbells head and nested it somehow among the tooltipped steel arms corbell thought tell them about the car he swallowed the idea if his sympathy lay with anyone besides himself it was with the dikta let gording escape if he could a spidery steel arm descended its hypodermic tip hesitated above him then dipped into his neck krayhayfts strong hands held his head immobile for an endless time then the hypo withdrew and the arm retracted into its nest corbell waited would the stuff put him to sleep or only paralyze him but skatholtz was releasing his arms and ankles and puffing him to his feet corbel swayed the stuff was doing something to him they took him up three more flights of stairs and down a corridor and into a small theater they dropped him into a cloudrug chair dust puffed up around him he sneezed and tried to get up but he was too dizzy something was happening to his mind krayhayft was at work behind him somewhere the theater went dark lights glowed in the dark infinitely far away stars the black sky of interstellar space corbell found familiar constellations distorted and then something told him where he was rna you shot memory rna into me you dirty sons of bitches he cried in english you did it again corbell whatll i be this time what have you made me into youll keep your memory said skatholtz also in english youll remember things you never lived through youll tell us watch the show he was nearly sixty lightyears from sol viewing what had been the state a voice spoke in a language corbel had never heard he didnt try to understand it he watched with a familiar fascination goodbye corbell mark ii he thought in the back of his mind in thin defiance but im still a lousy loser certain stars glowed more brightly than others and planetary systems circled them greatly enlarged for effect now all but two of these systems turned sullen redturned enemy these were the worlds that had turned against the state one of the red systems sparkled and faded into the background its colony destroyed the two neutral systems went red another system faded out the view closed on so system on more of so system than corbell had known with three dark gas giants beyond pluto and countless swarming comets fleets of spacecraft moved out toward the renegade colonies other fleets invaded sometimes they came like a hornets nest many ships clustered around a bussard ramjet core sometimes like a portuguese manofwar thousands of ships as weights around the fringe of a great silver lightsail early fleets included hospital ships and return fuel later there were massive suicide attacks it went on for centuries the state utopia became a subsistence civilization turning all its surplus energy to war the fleets moved at just less than ightspeed news of success or failure or need for reinforcements moved barely faster the state was boys and girls and dictators all united for the common good corbel hurt with the loss of that unity he watched a beam of light bathe sol system laser cannon firing from farside colony farside launched warships by lightsail at terrific accelerations the ships dropped their sails and decelerated most of the way to sol arriving just behind the beam itself long before the state could prepare corbell squirmed in his chair he wanted to cry warning for the state beat the invaders back but failed to stop their hidden treachery the war continued farside economically ruined by its effort fell before the counterattack it took a mans lifetime too much time before astronomy noticed what the farside traitors had done in the dark outside their dazzling light beam in the distraction provided by the invasion the state had looked for the light of fusion spacecraft not the dim watery light of a new planet the transplutonian planet called persephone had had a peculiar orbit tilted nearly vertical to the plane of the solar system its new path had already taken it deep into the system tons of hydrogen and hydrogencompound ices were aimed to strike the sun at solarescape velocity earths oceans would boil the state did what it could tens of thousands of fusion bombs so systems entire armory were set off at the dawn side of persephone just above the atmosphere a thick rind of the planets atmosphere peeled away and streamed off like a comets tail its mass pulling at persephones dense core a streamer of gas far more massive than the earth broke free and rounded the sun and sprayed back toward the cometary halo if the bombs could have been placed earlier persephones core would have done the same it was rock and iron yellowhot and it glowed xray hot as it streaked into the solar photosphere and disappeared the sun grew bright oceans shrank crops withered tens of millions died before the state could place a disk of reflecting tinsel between earth and sol it was a temporary measure the suns new heat was permanent at least on the human scale of time fusion would run faster in sols hotter interior the buried heat would leak to the photosphere and out the state had one chance for survival it could move the earth by the method farside had used to stop persephone cold in its orbit do you understand what youre seeing corbell made a shushing gesture yeah good we were afraid the light show and the bottled memory are both very old they date from the end of the rule of the girls they have been stored in zerotime for perhaps a hundred thousand years perhaps more we feared they must have decayed said skatholtz so you tried it on me but his anger seemed impersonal remote the state had had to abandon the mercury mines a serious industrial handicap nonetheless they were building something out there in the asteroid beltsomething huge like a starship big enough to carry the whole human race to safety but no that wasnt it corbell was fascinated he knew it might be the memory rna but he was fascinated anyway he hardly heard what skathotz was saying it was sensible corbell the girls who made the light show ruled the sky you are familiar with such things do you know now who hurled a moon at us not yet shut up and let me they had finished the thing two tubes concentric each a hundred miles long the inner tube a mile wide with thick walls of complex construction the outer tube thinner and twice as wide at one end a bellshaped rocket nozzle at the other corbell knew more than he was seeing reworked military laser cannon and vents and a flared skirt and thick stubby fins there at the bottom end now temporary liquid hydrogen tanks were attached now the structure moved under its own power it was a tremendous fusion motor moving outward circled by tiny ships yeah corbell said how do you climb down off an elephant should i know that you dont climb down off an elephant you climb down off a duck why its so much safer how do you move the earth small wonder if the light show meant little to skatholtz watching the construction of the motorin the naked sunlight and sharpedged totally black shadows of spacewas bewildering the diagrams made sense to an architect but they were only rotating lines to skatholtz but without bottled memory and without corbells career in space skatholtz was still bright enough to make some sense of what he was seeing you move something else skatholtz said the damage done by the rockets thrust and by mistakes you might make will not kill anyone if nobody lives on the working body then the working body can be moved until the world falls toward it as a rock falls to the ground what was the working body ganymede uranus can you stop the light show at that picture the lecture froze on an artists conception a blurred curved arc of uranuss upper atmosphere the motor looked tiny floating there corbell said you see its a doublewalled tube very strong under expansion shock it floats vertical in the upper air vents at the bottom let in the air which is hydrogen and methane and ammonia hydrogen compounds like the air that the sun burns you fire laser cannon up along the axis of the motor using a color hydrogen wont let through you get a fusion explosion along the axis i dont understand all your words fusion fusion is the way a star burns you probably used fusion bombs against the girls okay the hydrogen fusions in the middle of the motor and the explosion goes out and up its hottest along the axis cooler when it reaches the walls of the motor the whole mass blasts out the top through the flared end it has to have an exhaust velocity way higher than uranuss escape velocity the motor goes smashing down into deeper air you see theres a kind of flared skirt at the bottom the deep air builds up there at terrific pressure stops the tube and blasts it back up you fire it again elegant said skathotz yeah nobodys there to get killed control systems in orbit the atmosphere is fuel and shock absorber bothand the planet is mostly atmosphere even when its off the motor floats high for awhile because its full of hot hydrogen compounds if you let it cool off it sinks of course but you can bring it back up to high atmosphere by heating the tube with the laser firing it almost to fusion start the light show again will you skatholtz barked something at krayhayft corbell watched earth held out barely heatsuperconducting cables had to be run to the north polar cap to borrow its cold the cap melted millions died anyway no children were born there wasnt shelter for them it took over a century to drop uranus into place six million miles ahead of the earth in earths orbit the planet accelerated slowly drawing earth after it and then sped up to leave earth behind in a wider orbit they lost the moon the sun expanded via its own internal heat light was reddened but the greater surface lost more heat to space to earth by now the girls had charge of uranus and the floating fusion motor they moved the earth again five times the earth had to be moved at one time it was circling precisely opposite mars later further out internally sols fusion furnace had stabilized but the photosphere was still growing and the earth must be moved a sixth time with rnaaugmented intuition corbell said heres where they have their trouble the earth was too warm there is a region around any stable sun a rather narrow band in which an earthilke world can have earthlike temperatures but sols idea temperature band had moved too close to jupiter the giant world would have pulled earth out of orbit perhaps into a collision course put earth in orbit around jupiter itself but the suns heat output was leveling off the earth would suffer a permanent ice ageunless jupiter could be made to shine hotter i cant figure that last part said corbel run it again krayhayft ran it again two nearly identical astronomical scenes divided by a wall across space corbell watched uranus pull away from earth drop behind ganymede and coast outward ganymede fell twice in one scene it grazed jupiter flaring as it passed through the atmosphere a dozen times and finally decaying in a prolonged burst of hellfire in the second scene the fleck of light dropped straight in one flare and gone yeah they tried to be clever said corbell they thought they were good enough to do a twoshot they used uranus to pull the earth past jupiter slowed it to put the earth in jupiter orbit then dropped uranus deep into the moon system the idea was to stop ganymede almost dead in its tracks of course the maneuver fouled up a lot of lunar orbits what went wrong im not sure the girls wanted a grazing orbit instead the moon dropped straight in but so what skatholtz made no answer it was hard to think the deep knowledge of giant fusion pulsejets and uranuss atmosphere and interstellar war hadnt been in his head until now it let him understand the history tape but when he tried to think with the new data it came out all jumbled damn skatholtz anyway why should corbell tell him anything but the problem f ascinated him the rna carried that fascination and corbel knew it and couldnt bring himself to care lets see jupiter puts out more heat than it gets from the sun thats heat left over from when the planet fell in on itself out of the original dust cloud four billion years agomy years so the planet could hold heat and leak it out for a long long time but the energies should be the same no matter what angle the moon fell at this impact would it cause fusion would jupiter bum jupiters too small to burn like a star not enough mass not enough pressure but yeah thered be a hell of a lot of pressure in the shock wave ahead of ganymede and heat difficult to add up what skathotz said the numbers of the heat made by a grazing fall should be simple they knew the mass of ganymede and the height of the fall the girls could add up just how much hotter jupiter would become to warm the world just enough but the heat made by fusion is too complicated to add the girls made their numbers simple with the grazing orbit would the heat added be great corbell was nodding look the center of jupiter is compressed hydrogen really compressed to where it acts like a metal ganymede drops straight in the fusion goes on in the shock wave and it adds it builds up the continuous fusion explosion makes the shock wave greater and greater the heat has been leaking out ever since i cant picture this corbell does it make sense to you yeah they lost a moon and it killed them uranus was on its way into interplanetary space the girls couldnt bring it back in time their territory was too hot they tried to take boy territory corbell became aware that the show had ended new memories settling in his brain still dizzied him but he felt like jaybee corbel his personality seemed intact skathotz said then the new moonlike object is uranus some girls must have survived what can we do we dont have spacecraft we cant build them fast enough corbell could we use your landing craft no fuel corbel laughed suddenly what would you do with a spacecraft ram uranus or learn to fly it youre hiding something i dont believe in your girls if they survived this long they would have done something long ago uranuss arrival was too dramatically fortuitous such a coincidence had to be explained away and corbel had thought of an explanation well try inisdirec tion could they have held out in the himalayas theres life in some of the high valleys theyd be a long time building industry there your place names mean nothing skathotz helped him stand up can you point out this himalayas place on a picture of the world there was one downstairs chapter dial at random i the stairway was a long diagonal across the buildings glass face the bannister jogged to horizontal at six landings otherwise it ran straight down to the admissions room skatholtz and krayhayft spat boyish at each other corbell caught some of the exchange skatholtz telling the tale as it had come from corbell krayhayft checking it against tales memorized over several hundred years of life there was something italian in the way their hands jumped and their mouths spat syllables but their faces were blank scared corbell thought the tales matched too well corbell tried to set his thoughts in order hed been given far too much to assimilate all at once girls could have survived this long peerssa had found pockets of life in isolated places but they would have acted unbelievable that corbell could have returned just in time for their millionyeardelayed vengeance he had to escape it had been urgent it was more urgent now could boys slide down a bannister unlikely that theyd ever practiced but corbell hadnt practiced recently they were fools krayhayft was saying they should have chosen several smaller moons to drop one by one youre the fool corbell snapped surprising himself it would have taken too long to bring uranus back each time it would have fouled up too many orbits were talking about a planet ten times as big as the world so big that the girls lost track of its path krayhayft sneered skatholtz was saying the dance of jupiters moons is very complex while corbell was saying you arrogant ballless idiot casual contemptuous krayhayfts backhand swipe caught him under the jaw and lifted him and flung him back on the steps the bottled memory has given you too much of the girls view krayhayft said and whose fault is that skatholtz pulled corbell to his feet his elbow hurt furiously but he thought he hadnt broken anything and that was fiercely important now still it was just as well he hadnt tried the bannister two boys were waiting below them in the admissions room they waited for the leaders to descend one was young two or three jupiter years old by corbells estimate he burst into speech as if he wanted to get it over with gording is still loose he has not used a prilatsil the thread he took was mine he must have brushed against me and taken it from my belt i didnt notice where is he skatholtz demanded he went north and east until we lost his track toward the edge of parhalding it may be he doesnt know about the something corbell couldnt catch search the streets but not the buildings that way he cannot trap you with thread he may be trying to reach the dikta place on foot we can stop him then or he may try to take a tchiple an unfamiliar word look for undamaged tchiples damage them tell the others now the younger boy ran eager to be gone what was a tchiple a bubblecar how did the boys know whether gording had used a phone booth you must retrace our path skathotz told the other boy warn all you meet that a dikt is loose gording must not return to the ditka place he wheeled suddenly and barked you are staring corbell do we fascinate you very much couldnt gording use a prilatsil without your knowing no skatholtz smiled he pointed at the wall map that is a picture of the world isnt it an old one made when ice still covered this land yes can i use your spear that was sheer bravado he wanted to see what would happen what happened was that skatholtz handed corbell his spear the younger boys were gone but skatholtz and krayhayft betrayed no obvious tension corbell pointed with the haft these are the himalayas mountains there are valleys high up where it is cooler from orbit i saw green things growing there further north here on the sea of okhotsk energy is being used for industry it may be only machines left running but it could be girls would it be too hot for them no the pole is near enough but you dont think so corbel no why would they wait so long how would they build spaceships we dont know how spaceships are built skatholtz looked through the broken picture window toward where the new planet would appear at dark if uranus is falling free we can do nothing if the girls are guiding it what will they do smash the world make it cold again and take back their land you knew girls corbell i knew dikta women there may be girls still in the world we can threaten them or can we uranus will be upon us before we can reach these places krayhayft far down the street corbel caught motion your spear he said holding it out skatholtz turned to take the spear in that position he missed seeing what corbell saw a bubblecar skimming trees at ninety miles per hour dropping and slowing krayhayft must have caught something in corbells face he ran forward crying alert startled skatholtz glanced back corbell jumped out the window the boys had quick reactions as corbell crossed the splinters of glass a spear haft rapped his ankles hard threw him off balance he curled tight and hugged his knees instead of landing on his head he fell on his shoulders in high corn skatholtz was coming through the window in a graceful swan dive corbell rolled found his feet and ran krayhayft threw his machete it slashed viciously at corbels calves as it spun past krayhayft screamed stop or die skathotz barked from close behind him veto he knows something corbell dug in the bubblecar had stopped just at the entrance through the torn vines that still wrapped it corbell saw white hair and white beard gording reached across to open the door he was holding a stick against the doorpost why hell with it he threw himself in thrashed to turn around skatholtz was right theregaping in horror as he skidded to a panic stop corbell slammed the door in his face that stick across the door gording must have strung thread across the door and was holding it back with the stick it could have cut corbels hand off hell with that too go i dont know the codes oh for corbell jabbed five times at the compressed hourglass figure it was the first thing he thought of and it was good enough the world police headquarters in sarashzillish the car surged away corbell looked backstraight into skatholtzs eyes before the boy prudently dropped from the car hed lost his spear it should have been lying in the street behind him but it wasnt blood was running from corbells calves into the spongy stuff that lined the cars interior nothing he could do about it he didnt even have clean cloth to bind his cuts they stung gording said wind the thread around the rock do it now before you cut yourself corbeil obeyed the thread was thin as cobweb hard to find he was careful the car jerked to left and right dodging bushes trees random rubble ii he had fled from the norn in a car that was deathly silent except for the wind but now he heard a low almost subliminal whine how old is thistchiple was it in good shape i didnt think to ask i dont repair tchiples they must have safety devices the boys who built them expected to live forever where are we going sarashzillish where the boys spend the long night its got machines we can use maybe next question is does it have boys not yet i think i dont really know well have to risk it my god corbell was staring at something that could have meant his death by stupidity the disk i never thought of it at all i didnt have a credit disk how was i going to run a car he asked how did you happen to have one the tales tell that name coins were used when the girls ruled i reasoned that when the land thawed the bodies of the dead would be buried outside the city to make the land fertile there i fled and there i dug and i was right boys and girls must have died by the thousands when the girls came i found bones and bones all tangled together and some wore clothes and in the clothes i found name coins i tried them in the slot of a tchipe one coin still kept its pattern he regarded corbel dubiously you did not remember that you would need a name coin corbel flushed there was a lot to think about i might have been luckier in my ally i guess thanks for coming back for me i had to because you made another mistake does this car guide itself the cars motion had settled down now corbel saw that they had left parhalding and were skimming across an endless rippling field of wheat he said unless skatholtzs spear yeah it guides itself then look at my hair there was nothing at a peculiar about gordings hair it had grown a little tangled a little greasy but it was uniformly white five days after the cattail had bitten gording gording broke an embarrassed silence will i go back to the dikta will i tell them that there is dikta immortality but corbel has lost it we have to find it corbell i dont believe it the cattails werent i dont believe it danm it gording there was no kind of injection except that cattail bite something you ate or drank or inhaled you may have felt odd afterward sick elated disoriented getting old is more complicated than that there are do you know how people get old gording sprawled comfortably in his seat facing corbel the old man showed no sense of urgency if i knew everything about aging i would make dikta immortality i know genera things substances build up in the body like the ashes of a dying fire some the body can handle without help it collects them into garbage places for storage and ejects them some harmful stuff can be removed from the walls of blood vessels and the tissues of the brain by the right medicines dust and smoke that collects in the lungs can be washed away without the hospital we would die much faster but some ashes collect in the smallest living parts of the body no organ can remove them i can imagine a chemical a medicine that would change these substances to other substances that dissolve more easily without killing the without killing the cell youre just guessing arent you we know theres dikta immortality but we dont know how it does what it does how does a boys body do it gording gestured negation a brushing stroke with the hand thats the wrong line of thought dikta immortality came first it must be more primitive less indirectcorbe relax nothing can happen until the tchiple stops we should rest i feel a strong urge to beat my head against something hard when i think of how i pushed you into jumping me and then threw a cattail in your face teeth first he didnt know boyish for im sorry how oddly you think you know what you expected young and strong and blackhaired gording would throw his arms around your knees and cry wetly into your incredibly hairy chest and offer you his women gording laughed yes i know you think that way no they are not my women they are their own and i am my own as and when the boys let us rule ourselves do you remember how the women acted when you spoke of one man to every woman ah vaguely you must have lived strangely dont you know that there are times when a woman doesnt want a man what does he do then borrow a woman whose contract is to another man gording was thoroughly amused and his relaxation was contagious corbell settled himself lower in the recline chair he said youll find out if we get our dikta immortality gording looked startled i think youre right we would have to free ourselves from the boys raise our boychildren to immortal adults slowly the number of women to each man would drop toward one but he smiled it would take centuries they could see the rain sweeping toward them across the wheat it exploded against the front of the car against the thunder of the rain corbell raised his voice have you ever tried to escape we sent scouts many were dikta men in their second year come recently from rejection by the boys they were too young to be wise of course but they could shave their groins and faces and pass as boys some were brought back with their memories gone i think the others would have returned if they could some women tried to scout for us during the long night none of them came back the rain drummed out the hum of the motor corbel asked did you ever think of escaping by sea of course but how could we hide a sea vessel from the boys corbell youve been across the sea is there land does life grow there or is it too hot theres life but it doesnt grow as thick as it does here and its different life i know you can eat some of it because mirellylyra fed me a fair variety it was hot there but not killinghot and listen ive seen sea vessels big enough to hold all of dikta city whether they stifi float is something else where on what used to be the seabed a short days march from where the sea is now gording mulled it over three problems getting the sea vessel to the sea the risk we take if the boys catch us at it third and worst what will we tell our men when they are grown that we stole them from immortality if we find the dikta immortality corbel we can make the dikta flee across the sea it itches at me i had it all figured out briffiantly everything pointed to the cattails listen are you willing to be bitten again maybe its only the male cattails or only the females or only the gray striped whatever the boys didnt take along to the dikta place flay me alive if you must the stakes are high youd be dead long since if you didnt guess right sometimes corbell settled further into the spongy material the drumming rain was a comfortable homey safe sound presently he fell asleep in his dream he was running running iii something threw him violently forward something soft exploded in his face and threw him back now pressure pinned him fast while he spun violently head over heels he tried to get up and found he couldnt so much as twitch a finger he tried to scream and he couldnt breathe nightmare running down the hospital corridors cant get enough airthe booths in the vault dont work out of the vault searching for instantelsewhere booths turn a corner andthe norn paralyzed even to his diaphragm and closed eyelids his sense of balance gone crazy he tries again to scream the cane but his scream blew air through through the stuff across his face he gasped and some air leaked through slowly porous stuff across his face right and the hospital was a long time ago the spinning stopped he thought he was upside down lets see hed been with gording in a car the pressure was easing up he thrust forward with his hands the stuff gave like a balloon he worked an arm sideways found the door then the handle wrestled it open he squirmed against the porous balloon edged sideways and finally dropped out on his head the car was upside down in wet scraggy wheat it had torn a clear path in its rolling fall gording was around in back looking at a broken spear haft that had been jammed under the edge of a closefitting hood i knew there were safety devices he said cheerfully relief made corbell babble too many great escapes lately im getting them mixed up lord what a nightmare for a time there i thought i was back running from mirellylyra gording looked at him she really frightens you the old dikt she really does worse than the boys there were some very hairy moments the city was full of prilatsi see and you never knew where shed be or where id be the best i could do was find a prilatsi and dial at random over and over and even then some of them didnt work and all the time she was tracking my pressuresuit helmet shes probably still got it at least i hope she does why does it matter ill tell you as we go corbel paused for a moment there something something connected in my primitive brain and instantly got lost again never mind itll come back corbell sighted along the line torn through the wheat then extended the line sarashzillish is that way i wish i knew how far there were nothing but rolling wheat fields to be seen when we come to forest were close gording carefully retrieved skatholtzs broken spear he found the rock with the thread tied to it found another rock and rebuilt his weapon the tchiples safety balloons had nearly deflated gording felt around inside until he had located the plastic disk the sun was a fiery flying saucer settling on clouds they set out into the wet wheat and corbel began the tale of how the girls had lost a moon toward morning they found a stream jupiter had lighted their way in horizontal orange beams that made the land look brighter than it was corbell walked into the water before he knew it was there the stream was shallow and sluggish marsh grass was growing in it possibly a mutant form of wheat or rice corbell knelt to drink he rubbed his calves to wash away dried blood when he looked up gording held a flopping fish in his hands gording youre quick dinner such as it is he was scaling the fish do we dare build a fire no we must not be seen were just the wrong number we cant pass as boys at any distance well eat the fish raw no thanks as you like the unwinking point of light had grown no brighter odd that it could have come so fast but uranus had been nearing jupiter in the random orbit the girls had left it in when don juan arrived in sol system he said as much to gording gording nodded his pale head i have not added the numbers but i think the paths of jupiter and uranus must cross forever if it was left free after the girls dropped ganymede but why would they let it free they would have been trying to turn it to correct their mistake maybe they heard there was a war they took their ships home to bomb the boys from orbit they never came back gording had eaten everything but the bones of the fish he said it is unlikely that the girls waited their revenge for your return it is unlikely that uranus faffing free crosses the worlds path just after your return i think your explanation is right corbell we must go to four city and find the old dikt who has your pressuresuit helmet otherwise we will see the end of all life i was afraid youd say that all right theres a working tchiple in sarashzillish it took me there from cape horn i wish i knew the code for getting back but i dont dial at random maybe id like to check the subway system first there are maps in the subway building he stood lets go dawn came with a marrowfreezing roar it whipped corbells head around he faced a dwarf lion twenty yards away on a rise of ground roaring challenge skathotzs broken spear slapped against his palm attack cried gording and he charged the greatdanesized beast corbell pelted after him the lion seemed taken aback but he decided he charged gording somehow gording danced aside the lion turned broadside to corbell corbell threw all his weight behind the spear leaned into it as it punched into the lion behind the ribs the lion screamed turned and slashed and missed because one of its forelegs was unaccountably missing gording did his trick again and both the lions forelegs were gone now run gording cried they ran toward sarashzillish in the clear air they could see the bluish line where trees began male lion drives the prey toward the female gording panted corbell looked back and saw something wheatcolored bounding through the tall wheat a glance at the old man made him say youll wear yourself out well have to fight they stopped blowing the females caution gave them time to breathe she stalked out of the wheat to find them facing her like statues of athletes eight feet apart she roared they didnt ifinch she thought it over she roared again corbell stood poised confident happy the female departed twice she looked back thought it over and kept going corbel walked now with a silly smile plastered across his face he couldnt help it everytime he let his face relax it came back any normal pair of men would have been bragging unmercifully but gording clearly considered the incident closed he didnt even show relief at corbels competence which was flattering in a way finally corbell said real lions would have torn us up why are there so many small versions of big animals are there yeah lions elephants buffalo there must have been about ten thousand jupiter years of famine here before the soil turned fertile the big animals must have starved faster or maybe they died of heat prostration too much volume not enough surface i believe you i look at you and i see a different kind of dikt we have had time to adapt to reddened sunlight and long days and long nights animals and plants and dikta and boys adapted through the dikta if uranus widens the worlds path now it will all be lost i know are you ready to face mirellylyra yeah corbel shivered though the morning was not especially cool it would get cooler corbell tried to visualize six years of night and saw mirellylyra stalking him in the dark he said itd be nice if we could find dikta immortality before we meet her shed do damn near anything for that if we ever find it my turn comes first corbell laughed theres bound to be enough of it otherwise it would have been guarded why did you pause guarded the hospital vault in sarashzillish wasnt guarded were the boys that sure a dilct couldnt get to it it looked just like the other vault except for the guard systems the vault door and the oneway prilatsi and the armored glass cubicles in the roof what of it what if one dikt or three found dikta immortality the guarded chamber in four city was protected from dikta by dikta who owned it or so you assumed i was wrong four city was old but not like parhalding more like sarashzillish i think the boys built four city the trees were closer now fruit trees corbel was hungry he shrugged that off he had the tail end of something ashes of a dying fire most of it comes out in the feces and urine but not all of that urea can build up in the joints and cause gout cholesterol can build up in the veins and arteries but even when all these are washed away there are still the inert molecules that accumulate in the cell itself picture the miracle that can remove those now tell me what it looks like there was nothing to guard i dont under there was nothing to guard in sarashzillish i had it turned around heeeyaa ive got it dikta immortality gording backed away a bit you had it once before what fierce beast is to bite me this time i dont have to say i made a fool of myself once not this time come on the trees were close and corbell was hungry iv corbel walked alone through the streets of sarashzillish his face itched his scalp itched his chest itched he was trying to ignore an acid stomach how did loners walk hed seen only one loner close enough to tel that one had been certain of welcome his walk had been springy and confident boyish corbel tried to keep his walk springy and confident the windows of sarashzillish were dark the streets were empty and silent this whole charade could turn out to be unnecessary itches and all they had filled their beffies with fruit in the forest outside sarashzillish there corbel had used the head of the brpken spear to shave his face and his chest and four inches of his scalp around a topknot gording had cut away his long white hair gording had shaved too for all the good that would do there were whitehaired albino boys but they didnt move like their joints hurt laughing joking boys spilled out of a probable department store corbel turned a corner to avoid them just like a loner would maybe at a distance he should pass as a loner close up no chance dikta immortality be damned he was no twelveyearold he wished gording were beside him but that would have torn it two was just the wrong number to pass the brush clogging the street thickened corbell waded into it here were tangled vines rising almost vertically to a wall corbel turned along its length the wall he found had a gentle curve to it probably it formed a circle or an ellipse here there was a break and near the break the shrubbery thickened and grew taller as if the park spilled out through the opening corbell passed it and kept going there were park sounds tree limbs rustling in the breeze small birds whistling a sudden loud squawk followed by a burst of laughter boys boys on the other side of the wall and the wall opened ahead of him beyond the opening a twelvefoot christmas ornament floated above kneedeep vines corbell thought it through then within sight of the car he began searching for a straight sapling most of the bushes were of the wrong kind but he found one that would do even if it was a bit short he hacked at the base with the truncated spear until he could break it loose he sat down crosslegged what was keeping gording gording was well behind him tracking him if anyone noticed two loners happened to be moving in the same direction their target a reasonable one the park squatting crosslegged corbell disengaged the spearhead from the broken haft and used it to shave the sapling he barely glanced up as boys came wading through the tangle in what had been a park gate two five ten boys with a giant turkey carcass slung on poles where were they going with that a kitchen in a nearby building effete that was he heard a louder voice followed by a pause and judging that he had been hailed he glanced up held a grinning boys eye for a moment then deliberately went back to his work couldnt they see he was alone a loner would damn well make the first overtures as and when he felt like it maybe the new halt was shaping nicely he tried the end against the spearhead a bit too big hed shave it down a little and carve a notch and wedge it in the rusthng of the boys diminished moving across the street but two quiet puzzled voices were speaking too near him he glanced up under lowered brows they were near and looking at him as they talked the car was gording was crouched behind the can how had he gotten there corbel hadnt heard a sound he must have spotted the car gone over the wall circled inside the park and gone over the wall again now he crouched immobile but looking guilty as hell if anyone should see him the tall boy with hair like a black puffball hailed corbell again perfunctory apologies because we interrupt may we examine your work corbel unfolded his legs and slowly stood up then sprinted for the car the door was open as he had left it by that much did the boys fail to intercept him gording was ahead of him sliding in the other door corbel slammed his door and clung to the handle leaning back to hold it shut while gording jabbed at the keyboard the blackhaired boy ran alongside pulling at the door for longer than corbel would have believed possible finally he dropped away you said four of anything said gording i pushed that crossed commas i dont know where that takes us lets see if we can change it he jabbed four times at the crooked pi i dont even know if there is a subway terminal here theres no giant cube everywhere else it was a giant cube rest if we dont find the subway we still have a tchiple dial at random i lost my spear i stifi have the thread thats not what i meant i thought i was repairing it right but the way those boys acted i must have messed it up somehow skip it on their crooked run through the city they saw only one other boy on the wreck of a skyscraper near the citys center a lean and ragged loner was mountainclimbing three stories up as the tchiple zipped beneath him his sunken eyes locked on corbels and held them until the tchiple turned a corner with the big dark still an olde earth year away one loner and the two bands near the park might well be the total population of sarashzillish it would be nice to think so but stupid sarashzillish had to be on that pattern of closespaced phone booths it was too important not to be corbel said some of krayhayfts tribe probably got here ahead of us they wont know where were going will they they dont know why we want to get to cape horn id hate to underestimate them the car slowed and settled bending shrubbery and stopped they got out gording asked where are we the sparse greenery in the street thickened to jungle as it climbed the slope to their right corbell sprang to the rounded top of the tchipie the patch of citrus jungle was unnaturally flat and rectangular some of the trees looked very old i dont know but why did the tchiple bring us here where is the subway itd be towering over our heads every city ive seen the subway building was a tremendous cube gording joined him on the car together they surveyed the rectangle of jungle but a subway is below ground gording said why would it need to be so high i never found out what was in the upper stories maybe places of government or offices for rent no way to say that in boyish maybe they made a subway and left off the subway building the patch of jungle was about as wide as the great cubes in one city and four city corbel said could be they put a park on it instead then the ice cap thawed and a lot of dead dust fell all over everything where did they put the entrances though escalators in the center no the trees grew thickest there where the ground sloped up from the street there in midsiope was a dip water pooled there forming a small dirty weedgrown pond corbell expressed himself under his breath i dont know those words said gording corbell pointed under the weeds and the water and the scum and the mud thats where well find steps leading down to the doors after we dig it out after we find shovels and dig all that stuff out of there then we get to find out if anything still works under all that no they wont let us gording pointed the sharpfaced loner was trotting toward them from across the wide street he carried an oddly curved broadbladed sword well behind him other boys spilled out of a building do you think you can take him with your rocks no said gording hes ready he knows were dangerous hell catch the thread on his blade into the car then they clambered down and in in frustration corhell demanded iow did they get here so fast not by car are there prilatsil in sarashzillish oh sure thats how they did it can we use prilatsil yeah yeah we wont have to dig assuming the damn things still work the subway hasnt been maintained the loner was very close now corbell dialed a number he remembered two commas crossed s reversed hourglass on its side crooked pi the car sped smoothly away eleven boys watched it go they tracked us somehow theyll track us again corbell said well have some time but not much from outside it was a copy of the office building in which mirellylyra had returned corbells pressure suit in this version the elevators worked still following the pattern corbell tried the third floor it held lines of office doors all closed my name coin doesnt open them gording reported they kicked at doer it was solid gording asked are there prilatsil not locked behind doors yeah on the roof the boys could be there by now did you at least keep the spear blade corbell handed it over then it occurred to him that there might be indicators for the elevators he slipped back into the elevator and punched all the buttons if it stopped on every floor theyd have to check them all he got out on the fourth floor as he tiptoed down he heard a pattering above him like a swarm of rats gording had disengaged the thread from the rocks he had tied one end to the blade and the other to his loincloth now he chopped with the blade at the cloudrug where it ran beneath an office door guard the stairs he said with what gording didnt answer didnt even look up corbell stood barehanded at the stairwell door the first boy through would kill him he knew it maybe gording would get away what was gording doing gording was pushing the blade under the door with his fingers he pulled upward on the ends of the loincloth he heaved sounds forced their way between his teeth now he pulled sideways toward the doorjamb now he kicked at if door it shuddered another kick sent it crashing inward the blade was stronger than the door the thread had cut the metal around the lock through the office window corbell glimpsed two boys working under the tchiples motor hatch then he crowded into the phone booth with gording when he shut the door there was no light he opened the door a crack found the crooked pi and kept his finger on it as he closed the door he pushed it four times nothing obvious happened he opened the door and slipped out into a blackness like the inside of a stomach he whispered well have to bet that this is really a subway stay here ill find the stairs and call you good said gording corbell slipped away he moved with his hand lightly brushing the wall once he found a cloudrug couch by stumbling over it he clutched at the stuff to stop his fall and a sheet of cloudrug ripped away in his hand rotted a sound behind him he said what was that gording didnt answer corbell kept moving he could feel mirellylira in the dark he kept expecting to hit the stairs but the wall went on and on he circled another couch ant kept going there was no sound in this place cloudrug cushioned his feet and blotted up the sound of his breathing stairs here he said no longer whispering good gording said from a foot away corbel jumped like a man electrocuted a boy stalked you until i killed him with thread i think it must have been the loner from his smell this place may be dead if the stairsah the stairs moved beneath him disoriented off balance he sat and let the stairs carry him down into the darkness the stairs stopped gording said what next follow the sound of my voice i know where the cars are all the way in the back he walked with his hands in front of him how was he going to find the right car he felt his way around cloudrug couches he brushed a solid wall off course he couldnt hear gording or anything else were there boys in the dark stalking him as gording stalked them was gording already dead corbell was moving too fast stumbling only the very oldest boys would know the layout of this place but they wouldnt need to theyd follow him by his breathing he had found the doors gording light flashed for an instant at the far end where had that come from gording called all right corbell waited in the dark and the quiet presently gording spoke next to himhere felt for corbells hand and put something heavy in it i robbed the loner take his sword i took his fire starter too where is the picture of the world along corbel guided gordings hand that wall the flashlight beam revealed two polar projections with the ice caps still showing there were no glowing lights or numbers to mark the routes gording asked which is our door i dont know the boys have our tchiple we cant surrender because weve killed the loner the boys may have a way to shut down the prilatsil do something corbell all right give me the name coin he took it inserted it in the ticket window nothing happened he tried the next door nothing he was beginning to panic but the stairs had worked the third door let them through the transparent door to the subway car let gording through closed after him and wouldnt open until corbell had pulled the disk out and reinserted it they sat down opposite each other now we sit here for awhile al right i dont know how you can be so calm i risk less than you do half a jupiter year he had borrowed corbells phrase and ill be dead against this i balance dikta immortality and freedom from the boy rule unless corbel can we find dikta immortality where were going or will we have to make constant raids on antarctica i know its in four city maybe its in other places too the risk is good shall we sleep corbells laugh was shaky good luck v gording woke when the door went up the car slid into the vacuum tunnel curved downward straightened out rolled right rolled left so far so good gording watching his face relaxed i did not want to ask where are we going it doesnt matter anywhere theres a picture of the world that lights up that tell us how to get to four city a good decision said gording and he went back to sleep maybe he was faking but his breathing was very gentle and regular corbell stretched out he wedged his ankles under a chair arm there was no sound but gordings breathing corbel dozed he twitched and jerked in his sleep running running when the car turned upward he came half awake then dropped off again but he felt it when the car slowed and groggy as he was he remembered that first ride he put his hands over his ears turned to see gording copy him the car stopped doors popped open automatically air puffed across them hot and wet like boiling maple syrup in the throat corbel cried come on and went through the great ha was a ruin six or seven stories of the great cube had fallen in leaving a cross section of whatever was up there corbell didnt care he kept his breathing shallow the scalding air was thick with a taste and smell half chemical half mildew sweat sprang out in droplets all over his body the wall map was cracked across and dark he tried his credit disk in three doors before he found one that worked gording pulled at his arm and spoke like a man holding his breath wait where does this go come on they entered the subway car it didnt help you can die locked in a steam room corbell thought he stretched out on the row of seats mirellylyra rigged the subway system to take anyone from the hot part of the world straight to her we can hope she didnt skip this terminal lie still and dont try to exercise breathe shallow he lay on his back and waited the sweat tickled as it ran down his ribs but he didnt wipe at it something ticked on air blew across him too warm and then cooling corbel sighed the co must have triggered something he told himself the air grew coo cool a long time later gording said i left the fire starter damn silence then until the door went up there were the usual surges then the ride straightened out corbell tried to sleep again but something was holding him back he didnt know what it was until gording said my ears hurt that was it the car leaks said corbell just a chance we had to take lets hope weve got enough air to get to the end it hurts can i do anything hey gording had never been in an airplane corbel said work your jaws he demonstrated his ears popped the car slowed it had come sooner than corbell had expected but they were both panting and gording was uneasy corbell felt guilty satisfaction it took a lot of unknown danger to disturb gording he covered his ears with his hands and opened his jaws wide and waited for gording to do the same his skin was clammy he was unbearably tense the doors popped open the air that slapped across them was only warm through the door he saw lights dim at the back cloudrug humping into couches he reached for the loners broadbladed scimitar motion flickered in the gate corbells brain flashed mirellylyra too soon he pulled the car door shut as something darted through the gate he had what she wantedthey could negotiate it was krayhayft the grayhaired boy stopped short he looked at them through the glass he raised the fire starter gording threw himself back toward the inadequate protection of the toilet corbel sensed it but he himself was frozen krayhayft fired past him light blazed behind corbel and he smelled chemical smoke as part of the couch burned krayhayft shouted come out or ill burn off your feet corbels hand was still on the door but i cant do it youd chop down the tree of life for an instant krayhayft was puzzled then thats not what we want we only want to know where it is corbel suppose a disaster wiped out most of the dikta and the only survivors were half a dozen old ones we could keep them young and breeding meanwhile they never get a smell of it flame burst from the rug beside corbells right foot krayhayft said we need your pressuresuit helmet too speaking of disasters krayhayft stopped his face changed corbell had never seen that look on any boy it frightened him guilt and remorse and fear krayhayft moaned the sound faint through the glass his eyes darted left and right seeking escape he found it brighter than human he found it at once and used it krayhayft raised the fire starter to his head and fired flame burst from that side of his head then from the other krayhayft fell and kicked spasmodically and lay still corbell spared himself one flicking glance back gording was still hidden crouched behind the toilet door then mirellylyra zeelashisthar stepped through the gate shapeless robe white touched with iridescence and a withered face within the bright eyes fixed on him and then the cane mirellylyra its me the shock almost kified her he hoped she would faint she recovered she gestured peremptorily with the cane come out he reached for the scimitar she gave him just a touch of what had killed krayhayft moaning he came through she spoke gibberish an old mans voice translated you found it where is it give me the cane and ill tell you her answer was a wave of guilt and mental agony corbell waded through it hands outstretched for her throat she backed away corbel moaned and caine on suddenly she turned something on the canes handle sleep dragged him down toward the cloudrug sleep and red rage warred in him he was on his knees but he waded toward her two steps three musty smell soft stuff cradling his cheek mirelylyra was in one of the shapeless couches corbell got his arms under him and lifted himself out of the cloudrug he pulled himself toward her she tried to cringe back without moving terrified i caught her from behind said gording he was seated facing her holding the silver cane the old woman spoke rapidly an old mans voice translated you dont dare kill me i have something you want corbel got to his feet with some effort the pressuresuit helmet he said give it to me or ill let you live as you are her mouth compressed immortality first how many settings are there on that cane five two that kill others might kill me can you find the helmet then probably corbell smiled he saw by her face that he was right but so what ill make you young then ill kifi you if i dont get what i want he changed to boyish hold the cane ready but i think she wont try to escape now were going to get dikta immortality gording looked dubious corbell wasnt about to trust the norn in a phone booth they wedged themselves into a tchipe with mirellylyra between for a cramped ride through four city as the car swerved and darted through glass and concrete rubble corbell wondered should he have forced the helmet from her first yes but he couldnt wait that long he had to know they unfolded themselves out of the car gording said i might have known it would be a hospital did your hospital have a guarded place on the third floor mirellylyra was looking up at the glassmosaic face but i searched this place you were desperate too corbel said smugly you just werent desperate in the right way he led the way up the stairs dust puffed beneath their feet at the third floor he found two sets of footprints to remind him of his panic flight through these halls he glanced back but mirelylyra seemed docile enough and gording was behind her with the cane he turned into the hallway and was lost mirellylyra where are the phone booths to your left at the next corner they found the line of prilatsil a moment to orient himself there was the corner where hed been hiding when the norn came to hunt him down he led off and here was the vault door open gording said they guarded their immortality well wouldnt you corbell pointed to the skeletons and the hole smashed high up in the wall but not well enough were lucky they didnt use it and then wreck it maybe they thought theyd be back in fifty years gording looked around at the guard emplacements the empty shelves the computer console the pair of phone booths where is it if they didnt destroy it not through the prilatsil unless the destination was equally we guarded through the prilatsil give me the cane first would gording balk he didnt he handed corbell the weapon then stepped forward to study the pair of glass booths only one had a door he stepped inside mirellylyra snarled something the box translated are you mocking me corbell waved the cane under her nose suppose i am she came at him with her fingernails he didnt bother with the trigger he rapped her on the head with the cane twice before she backed out of range gording had found the button on the post he pushed it corbell shouted heeeyaa the other booth danced with drifting dust motes gording opened the door and said nothing happened not quite true said corbel to mirellylyra he said you dont have to if you dont want to you can trust me or not gloat gloat he mocked himself and was a little ashamed but hed fought for this she swallowed whatever words were on her tongue she was truly desperate as she entered the booth corbell caught gordings eye and pointed to the booth with no door the dust floating in the booth suddenly thickened gording smiled and said ah the norn had caught it too but she didnt understand and corbell was bubbling with it inert molecules from your cells chemical medicines wont reach that stuff but the phone booth does it takes just those dead molecules and does the instantelsewhere trick with them just the stuff that builds up over ninety years of life see it now i dont fee any different she said uncertainly you should i did it was like id caught my second wind of course i was moving at a dead run its nothing obvious what did you expect in a couple of days youll find dark roots in your hair red she said fiery red wheres the helmet she smiled she still looked like an old woman but was there something malicious in that smile chapter peerssa for the state i the cattail sprang from the desk as they entered mirelylyras office its greyandwhite face watched them mistrustfully from the safety of a ceiling light fixture corbels pressure suit sat limp in one of the guest chairs gording and mirellylyra watched him detach the helmet and set it on his head he cleared his throat and said this is corbell for himself calling peerssa for the state come in peerssa nothing nothing nothing hes got to be in range by now peerssa dammit answer gording pushed the suit aside and took the chair the silver cane remained fixed on the old woman she didnt notice malice and victory she gave corbell the shivers corbel jumped when the cattail abruptly dropped from the ceiling into the old womans lap it landed soft as a snowflake and coiled there ears up watching corbell make a fool of himself nothing nothing nothing n the voice came faintly fading in spots peerssa for the state peerssa for the state calling jaybee corbell please allow for a delay of sixtyseven seconds in transmission corbel i have a great deal to tell you yeah you do ive got a great deal to tell you too i can tell you most of the history of the solar system tel me first have you taken control of the planet uranus if so what do you plan to do with it to gording he said im asking him now well know in a minute what takes so long speed of light uranus must be thirtythree and a half lightseconds away gording nodded he was not impatient even his handling of the cane seemed negligent but it never left the old woman good because she still had that look when peerssa spoke he was irritatingly placid yes i am guiding a planet i believe to be uranus you were right in guessing that this is the solar system after losing contact with you i flew to investigate the most easily available anomaly the new planet between jupiter and saturn i found a sateffite with control systems which would respond to i know all about the motor the question he bit it off the delay was going to drive him nuts peerssa was still talking my broadcasts i was able to probe the failsafe programs first otherwise i might have damaged something eventually i found an object in the planets upper atmosphere radiating strongly in the infrared i found a tremendous motor a fusion pulse drive clearly intended to move the entire planet oh you know about the motor all right ive already started the braking sequence in twentytwo days uranus will be inserted into orbit two million miles ahead of the earth im going to move the earth further from jupiter well cool it down to normal dont do it corbell barked he remembered uneasily that he had never been sure of peerssas motives listen life on earth has been adjusting to this situation for a million years or more if you screw it up now most of the biosphere will die including what passes for humanity these days the old woman already looked younger if only in a tightening of the muscles in her face a smoothing of the pouchy look corbel looked away from the malicious catsmile he lifted the helmet and said in boyish we were right no coincidence at all peerssa dropped me here then went to look uranus over hes going to put everything back the way it was when he left earth gording stared but the ice the ice would cover bear with me a little longer will you he lowered the helmet on gordings answer peerssas delayed reply came i do not take your orders corbel i take orders from mirellylyra zeelashisthar who was once a citizen of the state he should have known better but it took him by surprise he screamed you traitor mirellylyra threw back her head and laughed corbell laid the helmet on the desk it took him a moment to find his voice no wonder you were smirking what happened she was thoroughly enjoying herself i tried to call your autopilot no luck a few days ago i tried again it may have helped that my translator uses your voice peerssa and i talked for many hours about the state and the world and you she broke off because peerssas reply had arrived my loyalty has never wavered corbell was there ever a time when you could say the same drop dead corbel told the helmet stand by mirellylyra is with us now well try to talk her into changing your orders to gording he said she rules my autopilot she rules uranus im tired you must persuade her not to let it carry out its mission this is urgent corbel i thought of that corbell closed his eyes and leaned back he could watch it happen as long as he could survive at all he would be young he could watch glaciers cover antarctica until the ice was a mile thick he and mirellylyra could watch the dwarf buffalo and the nude polar bears and the boys and the dikta flee north until they froze in snowstorms or starved in land baked bare of life or died for lack of the vitamin d in kathope seed maybe that was an angle did the old retread want the earth all for herself or would she prefer company but shed fled the boys once and lived alone hmmm where did she get her food was there anything she couldnt stand to see extinct he opened his eyes gording was looking concerned for him oddly so was the old woman nothing hurts gording said i was used to things hurting sometimes my breath would come short always my joints and ten dons and muscles ached corbell youve found it were young again yeah good play on her gratitude i cant talk to her it has to be you youre capable the fate of the world is on your shoulders thats all i need he closed his eyes for a moment just for a moment and then he asked mirellylyra how do you feel i fee good i fee strong maybe i only want to believe your lie okay pay attention corbell set the helmet between them he talked half for peerssas benefit the world is baked and dead everywhere except in antarctica whats left alive is all tropical stuff evolved for six years of daylight and six years of night if antarctica gets covered by ice again everything will die the ruling population is he used the boyish word boys elevenyearolds who live forever theres a minor population of adults for breeding the men look like gording or younger theyre human there are some minor changes he began to describe them the pale skin the receding hairline mirellylyra regarded gording without favor but she must see him as human the biggest difference the receding hairline looked natural on an old man he hadnt impressed her yet he went on if we ever expect to get a state established again itll be with the adults the dikta the boys are too different what im getting at is there is a chance right now there are about ten women to every man but in a hundred years itll be nearly onetoone an angle there he definitely had her attention of course your role wouldnt be very important at first with that big an imbalance but youd be the only woman with a full head of hair and the only redhead just a minute corbell isnt it true that boys rule the adults i dont want to be a slave and what about the girls the girls are long dead ahhh mirellylyra must have hated the girls right its boys and dikta now we can get the dikta to move here because weve got the dikta immortality theyll come i know where to find a ship she was shaking her head frowning now corbell knew that shed bought half of what he was selling against halfbald women her great beauty would rule the men who ruled the dikta but how long have the boys ruled ever since you brought the dikta to antarctica as escaped convicts whenever the hell that was say a million years oncoming youth put music in her laugh and now the dikta will break free that suddenly the sheep will become wolves because we offer them a sufficient bribe dammit she did have a point he changed languages gording will the dikta revolt yes they never did before the dangers were too great the rewards were too small maybe corbel switched to english he says they wifi i believe him now just a minute let me tell you why first they have not been bred for docility theyve been bred to produce a better strain of boys and theyve got the genes secondhow do i put this you know what a cringing man looks like she grinned shed seen corbel cringe damn her okay they cringe but its a gesture a formality the next second theyre walking as tall as ever the boys cringe to each other too i think the dikta havent revolted for a million years because the odds werent right now they are she sat silent frowning what did you think youd get out of peerssa moving the earth i thought were the last of the state corbell i thought we could start the human race over adam and eve with eve in charge mirellylyra wed better hope we can mate with the dikta because frankly im terrified of you i dont think i could get it up low sex urge yeah would you like to rule the dikta instead youll have one thing going for you you rule the sky once again a girl rules the sky he saw the beginnings of a smile and he pushed it home but youve got to give peerssa his orders now hes already started the braking sequence move the earth now and its the end of the world she leered teasingly i should make you wait peerssa has aheady started the give me the helmet goddamn braking sequence here wait a minute he didnt let go of the helmet corbell isnt this what you wanted i just had the damndest thought dont blow this the fate of the worldshaddup give me a minute to think it through when a man commands a djinn he tends to be careful with his phrasing all right peerssa im going to describe what i want to happen then you tell me if you can make the course change and you tell me what side effects we can expect after that we can put it up to mirellylyra i want cape horn and the region around it to be about fifteen centigrade degrees cooler ii from the roof of the office building they watched uranus pass the planet must be smaller than it had been at corbells birth its drive was not all that efficient it must have blown away megamegatons of atmosphere during aeons of maneuvering for all that a gas giant planet was now passing two million miles from the earth it was tremendous it glowed half full near the horizon a white halfdisk touched with pink banded and roiled with storms and a night side black against the stars from the black edge a tiny intense violetwhite flame reached out and out lighting the night side expanding reddening dissipating mirellylyra said something that was pure music no wonder she had been able to persuade men to do her bidding her white robe was a shapeless pale shadow in the dark corbell stood a little apart from her now that she was no longer an old woman he was more afraid of her than ever in truth the norn now ruled the fate of the world corbell was very twitchy tonight he called into the helmet in his hands peerssa how goes it and waited for the response nothing nothing green bird the autopilot was indecently calm it was difilcult to plot a new path that would not intersect a moon but i did it earths new orbit wifi be somewhat eccentric her average temperatare will vary around ten degrees lower good enough corbell set the helmet down his urge was to call peerssa every two minutes a giant planet faffing that close wasnt glorious it was terrifying she said it again glorious to think that the state reached such heights and now there are only savages well be back he said and laughed too loudly gording doesnt know it but what hes doing in dikta city is forming the basis for a population explosion in three thousand years well be building interstellar spaceships again well need them earth will be too crowded i hadnt thought of that perhaps gording did do you really think the dikta will come a million years of slavery after all theyll have to come hed thought it out in all its intricate detail in a few months cape horn and four city will be in the temperate zone plants that grow well in antarctica will grow well here once we transport them in antarctica it be colder than the boys expect theyll huddle in sarashzillish through six olde earth years of darkness meanwhile the dikta will be setting themselves up here al very well if the boys wait youve said theyre very intelligent they may attack immediately let them wait a few months and well give them a nasty shock well have peerssa in orbit then didnt he tell you hes got a thing that can blast them from orbit while they try to cross the ocean theyll think its the girls theyll try to wipe out the himalaya valeys and the sea of okhotsk but if they wait long enough theres going to be rain a lot of rain when the earth cools off itll probably swallow dikta city the boysll think the dikta drowned uranus jetted violetwhite flame peerssas path through jupiters moons was a complicated one the night was vivid with lights dayside uranus the pinpoint flare on uranuss night side jupiter the swarming moons the air was hot and humid and redolent with some rare scent not quite musk not quite flower shop corbell wondered where it came from were whales holding a mating season offshore the air went to his head corbell yeah what if the dikta are content to grow old gracefully in the dark he could barely make out her impish smile he said they still wont have a choice a nasty thought came to him then and he made haste to correct himself they wont have a choice about coming here they can take dikta immortality or leave it all the same he had manipulated the diktafor their own goodand would not peerssa say the same to corbell id better be right if theyve got complaints in a hundred years ill still be there to hear them the shadow in the dark asked wifi the dikta men find me beautiful yes beautiful and exotic if the women liked me the men wifi like you she turned to him but you dont find me beautiful my sex urge is supposed to that is no answer she flared you lay with the dikta women he flinched back if you must know ive always been a little afraid of a beautiful girl and im scared stiff of you my hindbrain thinks youre still carrying that cane corbell you are well aware that the dikta may not survive the change in their biological rhythms the sun shows every day in four city all through the year she touched his arm even if they live we are the last human beings if we die without children he wanted to shrink away but something in him simultaneously wanted to move closer he suppressed both urges youre moving too fast there may be dikta women already carrying my children thatll tell us if theyre humanand even if they arent theyre close enough lets go inside the heat when he gestured toward the garish intruder in the sky she tugged at his arm if it falls on the earth do you really want to be watching yes but he picked up the helmet and followed her she didnt have the cane anymore all she had to wave at him was a planet ten times the size of the earth it was cooler in the elevator air conditioning his nerves still tingled whether from uranuss passing or from the nearness of the norn he sniffed suddenly and had to swallow a laugh that was what he had smelled on the roof she had never worn perfume before her hood was thrown back her hair was exotic long fine white hair flowing out of a fiery red undercoat of the wrinkles of age there were only traces left her breasts were exotic yeah high and conical delightfully pointed under the robe would the dikta see them as powerfully sensual or as evidence of animal origin the elevator had stopped the doors opened but corbel was flattened against the wall and mirellylyra wasnt moving either she watched him uneasily as he took in great ungsful of air using all of his strength to hold himself stifi he wanted her it was a madness in him and he was terrified perfume he said and his voice was a croak she said yes shame on you for forcing me to such means if it gives you pleasure to attack my pride youve won i dont understand pheromones i altered my medical system to make pheromones to affect your sex urge pheromones are biochemical cues she stepped forward put her hands on his shoulders do you think i wanted it this and the touch of her was all it took the fastenings on her robe werent fastened save one which ripped he had more trouble with his own loincloth his hands were shaking so and he howled with frustration she had to do it for him he took her on the floor of the elevator quickly violently maybe he hurt her maybe he wanted to and his head still bubbled with the perfume he had not had time to notice the differences in her now he did even fifty thousand years had wrought changes her ankles were heavier her body was thicker in every dimension than the standard of beauty in ad and she had the damndest eyes with a tilt that was not oriental and a soft womans mouth he took her again she wasnt passive but she wasnt wholly enjoying it either she was frightened of what she had unleashed afterward he was calmer they moved out of the elevator onto the cloudrug floor the third time it was she who mounted him he tried to hold himself back to let her find her own way but when it was over he could see his handprints bone white on her hips he said belatedly are you all right she laughed stifi straddling him she ran her hands through her hair im young i heal you used an aphrodisiac on me yes aphrodisiac the pheromones were peerssas suggestion what peerssa ill kill him heand you you used me like a bundle of reflexes the pair of you he wanted to cry not like something that thinks its just like that damn cane forget the damn cane we have to have children were the last ones what do you want from me corbell i dont know ask me when my head starts working again i want peerssa dead i want pierce the checker dead would he kill himself if you told him to he did what he had to he has to make the state again corbell isnt this better than the cane isnt it all right its better than the cane then what do you want will you mate with me without the pheromones shall i tell peerssa to follow your orders he wanted mirabelle he wanted the old ritual dinner at a new restaurant recommended by friends and brandy aexanders afterward and the kingsize bed theyd bought a water bed a little before the cancer came to tear up his belly now here he was on his back in cloudrug in a corridor outside an elevator with the strangest of strange women not your fault he said i want to go home she shook her head want to go home too we cant we have to build our home again they were already doing that corbell thought maybe theyd even do it well he said even love stories arent the same pheromones jesus what a way to save the world will you please fix that translator so it talks to me in your voice all right tomorrow said an old mans voice and put me in control of peerssa if you value my sanity rm sick of him running my life now tomorrow one more thing he would have liked to do he would have iked to destroy the cane by smashing it repeatedly into peerssas brain case but they might need peerssa and the cane against the boys if they came too soon so he rolled aside and looked for his loincoth and then changing his mind he leaned close to mirellylyra and inhaled deeply uranus must have passed by now and earth was on its way into a wider orbit and worldsaving could wait until tomorrow maybe the pheromone perfume could be used judiciously in much smaller quantities
