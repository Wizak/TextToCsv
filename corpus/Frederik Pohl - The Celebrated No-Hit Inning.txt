 the celebrated nohit inning this is a true story you have to remember you have to keep that firmly in mind because frankly in some places it may not sound like a true story besides its a true story about baseball players and maybe the only one there is so you have to treat it with respect you know boley no doubt its pretty hard not to know boley if you know anything at all about the national game hes the one for instance who raised such a scream when the sportsvmters voted him rookie of the year i never was a rookie he bellowed into three mil lion television screens at the dinner hes the one who ripped up his contract when his manager called him the hittinest pitcher i ever see boley wouldnt stand for that foureighteen against the best pitchers in the league he yelled as the pieces of the contract went out the window fogarty i am the hittinest hitler you ever see hes the one they all said reminded them so much of dizzy dean at first but did diz win thirtyone games in his first year boley did hell tell you so himself but politely and without bellowing somebody explained to boley that even a truly great halloffame pitcher really ought to show up for spring training so in his second year he did but he wasnt con vinced that he needed the training so he didnt bother much about appearing on the field manager fogarty did some extensive swearing about that but he did all of his swearing to his pitching coaches and not to mr boleslaw there had been six rippedup contracts already that year when boleys feelings got hurt about something and the front office were very in sistent that there shouldnt be any more there wasnt much the poor pitching coaches could do of course they tried pleading with boley all he did was grin and ruffle their hair and say dont get all in an uproar he could ruffle their hair pretty easily since he stood six inches taller than the tallest of them boley said pitching coach magiu to him desper ately you are going to get me into trouble with the manager i need this job we just had another little boy at our house and they cost money to feed wont you please do me a favor and come down to the field just for a little while boley had a kind of a soft heart why if that will make so much difference to you coach ill do it but i dont feel much like pitching we have got twelve exhibi tion games lined up with the orioles on the way north and if i pitch six of those that ought to be all the warmup i need three innings magill haggled you know i wouldnt ask you if it wasnt important the thing is the owners uncle is watching today boley pursed his lips he shrugged one inning bless you boley cried the coach one inning it is andy andalusia was catching for the regulars when boley turned up on the field he turned white as a sheet not the fast ball boley please boley he begged i only been catching a week and i have not hardened up yet boleslaw turned the rosin bag around in his hands and looked around the field there was action going on at all six diamonds but the spectators including the owners uncle were watching the regulars i tell you what ill do said boley thoughtfully lets see for the first man i pitch only curves for the second man the screwball and for the third manlets see yes for the third man i pitch the sinker fine cried the catcher gratefully and trotted back to home plate hes a very spirited player the owners uncle com mented to manager fogarty that he is said fogarty remembering how the pieces of the fifth contract had felt as they hit him on the side of the head he must be a morale problem for you though doesnt he upset the discipline of the rest of the team fogarty looked at him but he only said he win thirty one games for us last year if he had lost thirtyone he would have upset us a lot more the owners uncle nodded but there was a look in his eye all the same he watched without saying anything more while boley struck out the first man with three sizzling curves right on schedule and then turned around and yelled something at the outfield that crazy by heaven shouted the manager hes chasing them back into the dugout i told that the owners uncle clutched at manager fogarty as he was getting up to head for the field wait a minute whats boleslaw doing dont you see hes chasing the outfield off the field he wants to face the next two men without any outfield thats satchell paiges old trick only he never did it except in exhibitions where who cares but that boley this is only an exhibition isnt it remarked the owners uncle mildly fogarty looked longingly at the field looked back at the owners uncle and shrugged all right he sat down remembering that it was the owners uncle whose sprawling factories had made the family money that bought the owner his team go ahead he bawled at the right fielder who was hesitating halfway to the dugout boley nodded from the mound when the outfielders were all out of the way he set himself and went into his windup boleslaws windup was a beautiful thing to all who chanced to behold itunless they happened to root for another team the pitch was more beautiful still i got it i got it andalusia cried from behind the plate waving the ball in his mitt he returned it to the pitcher triumphantly as though he could hardly believe he had caught the boleslaw screwballafter only the first week of spring training he caught the second pitch too but the third was unpredictably low and outside andalusia dived for it in vain ball one cried the umpire the catcher scrambled up ready to argue he is right boley called graciously from the mound i am sorry but my foot slipped it was a ball thank you said the umpire tp next screwball was a strike though and so were the thiee sinkers to the third manthough one of those caught a little piece of the bat and turned into an intothedirt foul boley came off the field to a spattering of applause he stopped under the stands on the lip of the dugout i guess i am a little rusty at that fogarty he called dont let me forget to pitch another inning or two be fore we play baltimore next month i wont snapped fogarty he would have said more but the owners uncle was talking i dont know much about baseball but that strikes me as an impressive performance my congratulations you are right boley admitted excuse me while i shower and then we can resume this discussion some more i think you are a better judge of baseball than you say the owners uncle chuckled watching him go into the dugout you can laugh said fogarty bitterly you dont have to put up with that for a hundred fiftyfour games and spring training and the series youre pretty confident about making the series fogarty said simply last year boley win thirtyone games the owners uncle nodded and shifted position un comfortably he was sitting with one leg stretched over a large black metal suitcase fastened with a complicated lock fogarty asked should i have one of the boys put that in the locker room for you certainly not said the owners uncle i want it right here where i can touch it he looked around him the fact of that matter is he went on in a lower tone this goes up to washington with me tomorrow i cant discuss whats in it but as were among friends i can mention that where its going is the pentagon oh said fogarty respectfully something new from the factories something very new the owners uncle agreed and he winked and id better get back to the hotel with it but theres one thing mr fogarty i dont have much time for baseball but its a family affair after all and whenever i can help i mean it just occurs to me that possibly with the help of whats in this suitcase that is would you like me to see if i could help out help out how asked fogarty suspiciously well i really mustnt discuss whats in the suitcase but would it hurt boleslaw for example to be a little more well modest the manager exploded no the owners uncle nodded thats what ive thought well i must go will you ask mr boleslaw to give me a ring at the hotel so we can have dinner together if its convenient it was convenient all right boley had always wanted to see how the other half lived and they had a fine dinner served right in the suite with five waiters in attendance and four kinds of wine boley kept pushing the little glasses of wine away but after all the owners uncle was the owners uncle and if he thought it was all right it must have been pretty strong wine because boley began to have trouble following the conversation it was all right as long as it stuck to earnedrun averages and batting percentages but then it got hard to follow like a long twisting grounder on a dry september field boley wasnt going to admit that though sure he said trying to follow and you say the fourth dimension he said and you mean a time machine like he said but he was pretty confused the owners uncle smiled and filled the wine glasses again somehow the black suitcase had been unlocked in a slow difficult way things made out of crystal and steel were sticking out of it forget about the time machine said the owners uncle patiently its a military secret anyhow ill thank you to forget the very words because heaven knows what the general would think if he found out anyway forget it what about you boley do you still say you can hit any pitcher who ever lived and strike out any batter anywhere agreed boley leaning back in the deep cushions and watching the room go around and around any time bat their ears off have another glass of wine boley said the owners uncle and he began to take things out of the black suit case boley woke up with a pounding in his head like snider mays and mantle hammering threeeye league pitching he moaned and opened one eye somebody blurry was holding a glass out to him hurry up drink this boley shrank back i will not thats what got me into this trouble in the first place trouble youre in no trouble but the games about to start and youve got a hangover ring a fire bell beside a sleeping dalmation sound the charge in the ear of a retired cavalry major neither will respond more quickly than boley to the words the games about to start he managed to drink some of the fizzy stuff in the glass and it was a miracle like a triple play erasing a ninthinning threat the headache was gone he sat up and the world did not come to an end in fact he felt pretty good he was being rushed somewhere by the blurry man they were going very rapidly and there were tail bright buildings outside they stopped were at the studio said the man helping boley out of a remarkable sort of car the stadium boley corrected automatically he looked around for the lines at the box office but there didnt seem to be any the studio dont argue all day will you the man was no longer so blurry boley looked at him and blushed he was only a little man with a worried look to him and what he was wearing was a pair of vivid orange bermuda shorts that showed his knees he didnt give boley much of a chance for talking or thinking they rushed into a building all green and white opaque glass and they were met at a flimsylooking elevator by another little man this ones shorts were aqua and he had a bright red cummer bund tied around his waist this is him said boleys escort the little man in aqua looked boley up and down hes a big one i hope to goodness we got a uniform to fit him for the series boley cleared his throat series and youre in it shrilled the little man in orange this way to the dressing room well a dressing room was a dressing room even if this one did have color television screens all around it and machines that went wheepetyboom softly to themselves boley began to feel at home he biinked when they handed his uniform to him but he put it on back in the steel coal league he had sometimes worn uniforms that still bore the faded legend lbs best fortified grochick and whatever an owner gave you to put on was all right with boley still he thought to himself kilts it was the first time in boleys life that he had ever worn a skirt but when he was dressed it didnt look too bad he thoughtespecially because all the other players were wearing the same thing there is nothing like seeing the same costume on everybody in view to make it seem reasonable and right havent the paris designers been proving that for years he saw a familiar figure come into the dressing room wearing a uniform like his own why coach magill said boley turning with his hand outstretched i did not expect to meet you here the newcomer frowned until somebody whispered in his ear oh he said youre boleslaw naturally im boleslaw and naturally youre my pitch ing coach magill and why do you look at me that way when ive seen you every day for three weeks the man shook his head youre thinking of grand daddy jim he said and moved on boley stared after him granddaddy jim but coach magill was no granddaddy that was for sure why his eldest was no more than six years old boley put his hand against the wall to steady himself it touched something metal and cold he glanced at it it was a bronze plaque floor to ceiling high and it was embossed at the top with the words world series honor roll and it listed every team that had ever won the world series from the day chicago won the first series of all in untiluntil boley said something out loud and quickly looked around to see if anybody had heard him it wasnt some thing he wanted people to hear but it was the right time for a man to say something like that because what that crazy lump of bronze said down toward the bottom with only empty spaces below was that the most recent team to win the world series was the yokahama dodgers and the year they won it in was a time machine thought boley wonderingly i guess what he meant was a machine that traveled in time now if you had been picked up in a time machine that leaped through the years like a jet plane leaps through space you might be quite astonished perhaps and for a while you might not be good for much of anything until things calmed down but boley was born calm he lived by his arm and his eye and there was nothing to worry about there pay him his class c league contract bonus and he turns up in western pennsylvania all ready to set a league record for nohitters his first year call him up from the minors and he bats against the best pitchers in baseball set him down in the year and tell him hes going to play in the series and he hefts the ball once or twice and says i better take a couple of warmup pitches is the spitter allowed they led him to the buupen and then there was the playing of the national anthem and the teams took the field and boley got the biggest shock so far magill he bellowed in a terrible voice what is that other pitcher doing out on the mound the manager looked startled thats our starter padgett he always starts with the numbertwo defensive lineup against righthand batters when the outfield shift goes magui i am not any relief pitcher if you pitch bole slaw you start with boleslaw magill said soothingly its perfectly all right there have been some changes thats all you cant expect the rules to stay the same for forty or fifty years can you i am not a relief pitcher i please please wont you sit down boley sat down but he was seething well see about that he said to the world well just see things had changed all right to begin with the studio really was a studio and not a stadium and although it was a very large room it was not the equal of ebbetts field much less the yankee stadium there seemed to be an awful lot of bunting and the ground rules con fused boley very much then the dugout happened to be just under what seemed to be a complicated sort of television booth and boley could hear the announcer screaming himself hoarse just overhead that had a familiar sound but and here roared the announcer comes the all important nothingandone pitch fans what a pitchers duel this is delasantos is going into bis motion hes coming down hes delivered it and its in there for a count of nothing and two fans what a pitcher that tiburcio delasantos is and here comes the allimportant nothingandtwo pitch andandyes and he struck him out he struck him out he struck him out its a no hitter fans in the allimportant second inning its a no hitter for tiburcio delasantos boley swallowed and stared hard at the scoreboard which seemed to show a score of their favor his teammates were going wild with excitement and so was the crowd of players umpires cameramen and announcers watching the game he tapped the shoulder of the man next to him excuse me whats the score dig that tiburcio cried the man what a firststring defensive pitcher against lefthanders he is the score could you tell me what it is fourteen to nine did you see that boley begged please didnt somebody just say it was a nohitter why sure the man explained the inning its a nohit inning and he looked queerly at boley it was all like that except that some of it was worse after three innings boley was staring glassyeyed into space he dimly noticed that both teams were trotting off the field and what looked like a whole new corps of play ers were warming up when manager magiu stopped in front of him youll be playing in a minute magill said kindly isnt the game over boley gestured toward the field over of course not its the thirdinning stretch magill told him ten minutes for the lawyers to file their motions and make their appeals you know he laughed condescendingly they tried to get an injunction against the basesloaded pitchout imagine hahhah boley echoed mister magill can i go home nonsense boy didnt you hear me youre on as soon as the lawyers come off the field well that began to make sense to boley and he actually perked up a little when the minutes had passed and magill took him by the hand he began to feel almost cheerful again he picked up the rosin bag and flexed his fingers and said simply boleys ready because nothing confused boley when he had a ball or a bat in his hand set him down any time anywhere and hed hit any pitcher or strike out any batter he knew exactly what it was going to be like once he got on the playing field only it wasnt like that at all boleys team was at bat and the first man up got on with a bunt single anyway they said it was a bunt single to boley it had seemed as though the enemy pitcher had charged beautifully off the mound fielded the ball with machinelike precision and flipped it to the firstbase player with inches and inches to spare for the out but the umpires declared interference by a vote of eighteen to seven the two leftfield umpires and the one with the field glasses over the batters head abstaining it seemed that the first baseman had neglected to say excuse me to the runner well the rules were the rules boley tightened his grip on his bat and tried to get a lead on the pitchers style that was hard because the pitcher was fast boley ad mitted it to himself uneasily he was very fast he was a big monster of a player nearly seven feet tall and with something queer and sparldy about his eyes and when he came down with a pitch there was a sort of a hiss and a splat and the ball was in the catchers hands it might boley confessed be a little hard to hit that particular pitcher because he hadnt yet seen the ball in transit manager magiu came up behind him in the ondeck spot and fastened something to his collar your inter com he explained so we can tell you what to do when youre up sure sure boley was only watching the pitcher he looked sickly out there his skin was a grayish sort of color and those eyes didnt look right but there wasnt anything sickly about the way he delivered the next pitch a sweeping curve that sizzled in and spun away the batter didnt look so good eithersame sickly gray skin same giant frame but he reached out across the plate and caught that curve and dropped it between thirdbase and short and both men were safe youre on said a tinny little voice in boleys ear it was the little intercom and the manager was talking to him over the radio boley walked numbly to the plate sixty feet away the pitcher looked taller than ever boley took a deep breath and looked about him the crowd was roaring ferociously which was normal enough except there wasnt any crowd counting everybody players and officials and all there werent more than three or four hundred people in sight in the whole studio but he could hear the screams and yells of easily fifty or sixty thousand there was a man he saw behind a plate glass window who was doing things with what might have been records and the yells of the crowd all seemed to come from loudspeakers under his window boley winced and concentrated on the pitcher i will pin his ears back he said feebly more to reassure himself than because he believed it the little intercom on his shoulder cried in a tiny voice you will not boleslaw your orders are to take the first pitch but listen take it you hear me boleslaw there was a time when boley would have swung just to prove who was boss but the time was not then he stood there while the big gray pitcher looked him over with those sparkling eyes he stood there through the windup and then the arm came down and he didnt stand there that ball wasnt invisible not coming right at him it looked as big and as fast as the wabash can nonbau and boley couldnt help it for the first time in his life he jumped a yard away screeching hit batter hit batter cried the intercom take your base boleslaw boley biinked six of the umpires were beckoning him on so the intercom was right but still and all boley had his pride he said to the little button on his collar i am sorry but i wasnt hit he missed me a mile easy i got scared is all take your base you silly fool roared the intercom he scared you didnt he thats just as bad as hitting you according to the rules why there is no telling what incalculable damage has been done to your nervous sys tem by this fright so kindly get the bejeepers over to first base boleslaw as provided in the rules of the game he got but he didnt stay there long because there was a pinch runner waiting for him he barely noticed that it was another of the grayskinned giants before he headed for the locker room and the showers he didnt even re member getting out of his uniform he only remembered that he boley had just been through the worst experience of his life he was sitting on a bench with his head on his hands when the owners uncle came in looking queerly out of place in his neat pinstriped suit the owners uncle had to speak to him twice before his eyes focused they didnt let me pitch boley said wonderingly they didnt want boley to pitch the owners uncle patted his shoulder you were a guest star boley one of the alltime greats of the game next game theyre going to have christy mathewson doesnt that make you feel proud they didnt let me pitch said boley the owners uncle sat down beside him dont you see youd be out of place in this kind of a game you got on base for them didnt you i heard the announcer say it myself he said you filled the bases in the all important fourth inning two hundred million people were watching this game on television and they saw you gpt on base they didnt let me hit either boley said there was a commotion at the door and the team came trotting in screaming victory we win it we win it cried manager magitt eightyseven to eightythree what a squeaker boley lifted his head to croak thats fine but no body was listening the manager jumped on a table and yelled over the noise in the locker room boys we pulled a close one out and you know what that means were leading in the series eleven games to nine now lets just wrap those other two up and he was interrupted by a bloodcurdling scream from boley boley was standing up pointing with an expression of horror the athletes had scattered and the trainers were working them over only some of the trainers were using pliers and screwdrivers instead of towels and liniment next to boley the big grayskinned pinch runner was flat on his back and the trainer was lifting one leg away from the body murder bellowed boley that fellow is murdering that fellow the manager jumped down next to him murder there isnt any murder boleslaw what are you talking about boley pointed mutely the trainer stood gaping at him with the leg hanging limp in his grip it was completely removed from the torso it belonged to but the torso seemed to be making no objections the curious eyes were open but no longer sparkling the gray skin at closer hand seemed metallic and cold the manager said fretfully i swear boleslaw youre a nuisance theyre just getting cleaned and oiled bat teries recharged that sort of thing so theyll be in shape tomorrow you understand cleaned whispered boley oiled he stared around e the room all of the grayskinned ones were being some how disassembled bits of metal and glass were sticking out of them are you trying to tell me he croaked that those fellows arent fellows theyre ballplayers said manager magill impatiently robots havent you ever seen a robot before were allowed to field six robots on a nineman team its per fectly legal why next year im hoping the commission er let us play a whole robot team then youll see some baseball with bulging eyes boley saw it was true except for a handful of fleshandblood players like himself the team was made up of manshaped machines steel for bones electricity for blood steel and plastic and copper cogs for muscle machines said boley and turned up his eyes the owners uncle tapped him on the shoulder wor riedly its time to go back he said so boley went back he didnt remember much about it except that the owners uncle had made him promise never never to tell anyone about it because it was orders from the defense department you never could tell how useful a time ma chine might be in a war but he did get back and he woke up the next morning with all the signs of a hangover and the sheets kicked to shreds around his feet he was still bleary when he staggered down to the coffee shop for breakfast magill the pitching coach who had no idea that he was going to be granddaddy to magill the serieswinning manager came solicitously over to him bad night boley you look like you have had a bad night bad repeated boley bad magiu you have got no idea the owners uncle said he would show me some thing that would learn me a little humility and magill he came through yes he did why i saw a big bronze tablet with the names of the series winners on it and i saw and he closed his mouth right there because he re membered right there what the owners uncle had said about closing his mouth he shook his head and shud dered bad he said you bet it was bad magill coughed gosh thats too bad boley i guess i mean then maybe you wouldnt feel like pitching an other couple of inningswell anyway one inningtoday because boley held up his hand say no more please you want me to pitch today magill thats about the size of it the coach confessed i will pitch today said boley if that is what you want me to do i will do it i am now a reformed char acter i will pitch tomorrow too if you want me to pitch tomorrow and any other day you want me to pitch and if you do not want me to pitch i will sit on the sidelines whatever you want is perfectly all right with me magill because magill ihey hey magill what are you doing down there on the floor so that is why boley doesnt give anybody any trouble any more and if you tell him now that he reminds you of dizzy dean why hell probably shake your hand and thank you for the complimenteven if youre a sports writer even oh there still are a few special little things about him of coursenot even counting the things like how many shutouts he pitched last year or how many home runs he hit but everybody finds him easy to get along with they used to talk about the change that had come over him a lot and wonder what caused it some people said he got religion and others said he had an incurable disease and was trying to do good in his last few weeks on earth but boley never said he only smiled and the owners uncle was too busy in washington to be with the team much after that so now they talk about other things when boleys name comes up for instance theres his little business about the pitch ing machinewhen he shows up for batting practice he insists on hitting against real live pitchers instead of the machine its even in his contract and then every march he bets nickels against anybody around the training camp thatll bet with him that he can pick that years series winner he doesnt bet more than that because the commissioner naturally doesnt like big bets from bauplayers but even for nickels dont bet against him because he isnt ever going to lose not before
