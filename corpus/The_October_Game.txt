 ray bradbury the october game he put the gun back into the bureau drawer and shut the drawer no not that way louise wouldnt suffer it was very important that this thing have above all duration duration through imagination how to prolong the suffering how first of all to bring it about well the man standing before the bedroom mirror carefully fitted his cufflinks together he paused long enough to hear the children run by switftly on the street below outside this warm twostorey house like so many grey mice the children like so many leaves by the sound of the children you knew the calendar day by their screams you knew what evening it was you knew it was very late in the year october the last day of october with white bone masks and cut pumpkins and the smell of dropped candle wax no things hadnt been right for some time october didnt help any if anything it made things worse he adjusted his black bowtie if this were spring he nodded slowly quietly emotionlessly at his image in the mirror then there might be a chance but tonight all the world was burning down into ruin there was no green spring none of the freshness none of the promise there was a soft running in the hall thats marion he told himself mylittle one all eight quiet years of her never a word just her luminous grey eyes and her wondering little mouth his daughter had been in and out all evening trying on various masks asking him which was most terrifying most horrible they had both finally decided on the skeleton mask it was just awful it would scare the beans from people again he caught the long look of thought and deliberation he gave himself in the mirror he had never liked october ever since he first lay in the autumn leaves before his granmothers house many years ago and heard the wind and sway the empty trees it has made him cry without a reason and a little of that sadness returned each year to him it always went away with spring but it was different tonight there was a feeling of autumn coming to last a million years there would be no spring he had been crying quietly all evening it did not show not a vesitge of it on his face it was all hidden somewhere and it wouldnt stop the rich syrupy smell of sweets filled the bustling house louise had laid out apples in new skins of toffee there were vast bowls of punch freshmixed stringed apples in each door scooped vented pumpkins peering triangularly from each cold window there was a water tub in the centre of the living room waiting with a sack of apples nearby for dunking to begin all that was needed was the catalyst the impouring of children to start the apples bobbing the srtinged apples to penduluming in the crowded doors the sweets to vanish the halls to echo with fright or delight it was all the same now the house was silent with preparation and just a little more than that louise had managed to be in every other room save the room he was in today it was her very fine way of intimating oh look mich see how busy i am so busy that when you walk into a room im in theres always something i need to do in another room just see how i dash about for a while he had played a little game with her a nasty childish game when she was in the kitchen then he came to the kitchen saying i need a glass of water after a moment he standing drinking water she like a crystal witch over the caramel brew bubbling like a prehistoric mudpot on the stove she said oh i must light the pumpkins and she rushed to the living room to make the pumpkins smile with light he came after smiling i must get my pipe oh the cider she had cried running to the dining room ill check the cider he had said but when he tried following she ran to the bathroom and locked the door he stood outside the bathroom door laughing strangely and senselessly his pipe gone cold in his mouth and then tired of the game but stubborn he waited another five minutes there was not a sound from the bath and lest she enjoy in any way knowing that he waited outside irritated he suddenly jerked about and walked upstairs whistling merrily at the top of the stairs he had waited finally he had heard the bathroom door unlatch and she had come out and life belowstairs and resumed as life in a jungle must resume once a terror has passed on away and the antelope return to their spring now as he finished his bowtie and put his dark coat there was a mouserustle in the hall marion appeared in the door all skeletons in her disguise how do i look papa fine from under the mask blonde hair showed from the skull sockets small blue eyes smiled he sighed marion and louise the two silent denouncers of his virility his dark power what alchemy had there been in louise that took the dark of a dark man and bleached the dark brown eyes and black hair and washed and bleached the ingrown baby all during the period before birth until the child was born marion blonde blueeyed ruddycheeked sometimes he suspected that louise had conceived the child as an idea completely asexual an immaculate conception of contemptuous mind and cell as a firm rebuke to him she had produced a child in her own image and to top it she had somehow fixed the doctor so he shook his head and said sorry mr wilder your wife will never have another child this is the last one and i wanted a boy mich had said eight years ago he almost bent to take hold of marion now in her skull mask he felt an inexplicable rush of pity for her because she had never had a fathers love only the crushing holding love of a loveless mother but most of all he pitied himself that somehow he had not made the most of a bad birth enjoyed his daughter for herself regardless of her not being dark and a son and like himself somewhere he had missed out other things being equal he would have loved the child but louise hadnt wanted a child anyway in the first place she had been frightened of the idea of birth he had forced the child on her and from that night all through the year until the agony of the birth itself louise had lived in another part of the house she had expected to die with the forced child it had been very easy for louise to hate this husband who so wanted a son that he gave his only wife over to the mortuary but louise had lived and in truimph her eyes the day he came to the hospital were cold im alive they said and i have a blonde daughter just look and when he had put out a hand to touch the mother had turned away to conspire with her new pink daughterchild away from that dark forcing murderer it had all been so beautifully ironic his selfishness deserved it but now it was october again there had been other octobers and when he thought of the long winter he had been filled with horror year after year to think of the endless months mortared into the house by an insane fall of snow trapped with a woman and child neither of whom loved him for months on end during the eight years there had been respites in spring and summer you got out walked picknicked these were desperate solutions to the desperate problem of a hated man but in winter the hikes and picnics and escapes fell away with leaves life like a tree stood empty the fruit picked the sap run to earth yes you invited people in but people were hard to get in winter with blizzards and all once he had been clever enough to save for a florida trip they had gone south he had walked in the open but now the eighth winter coming he knew things were finally at an end he simply could not wear this one through there was an acid walled off in him that slowly had eaten through tissue and bone over the years and now tonight it would reach the wild explosive in him and all would be over there was a mad ringing of the bell below in the hall louise went to see marion without a word ran down to greet the first arrivals there were shouts and hilarity he walked to the top of the stairs louise was below taking cloaks she was tall and slender and blonde to the point of whiteness laughing down upon the new children he hesitated what was all this the years the boredom of living where had it gone wrong certainly not with the birth of the child alone but it had been a symbol of all their tensions he imagined his jealousies and his business failures and all the rotten rest of it why didnt he just turn pack a suitcase and leave no not without hurting louise as much as she had hurt him it was simple as that divorce wouldnt hurt her at all it would simply be an end to numb indecision if he thought divorce would give her pleasure in any way he would stay married the rest of his life to her for damned spite no he must hurt her figure some way perhaps to take marion away from her legally yes that was it that would hurt most of all to take marion hello down there he descended the stairs beaming louise didnt look up hi mr wilder the children shouted waved as he came down by ten oclock the doorbell had stopped ringing the apples were bitten from stringed doors the pink faces were wiped dry from the apple bobbling napkins were smeared with toffee and punch and he the husband with pleasant efficiency had taken over he took the party right out of louises hands he ran about talking to the twenty children and the twelve parents who had come and were happy with the special spiked cider he had fixed them he supervised pin the tail on the donkey spin the bottle musical chairs and all the rest amid fits of shouting laughter then in the triangulareyed pumpkin shine all house lights out he cried hush follow me tiptoeing towards the cellar the parents on the outer periphery of the costumed riot commented to each other nodding at the clever husband speaking to the lucky wife how well he got on with children they said the children crowded after the husband squealing the cellar he cried the tomb of the witch more squealing he made a mock shiver abandon hope all ye who enter here the parents chuckled one by one the children slid down a slide which mich had fixed up from lengths of tablesection into the dark cellar he hissed and shouted ghastly utterances after them a wonderful wailing filled dark pumpkinlighted house everybody talked at once everybody but marion she had gone through all the party with a minimum of sound or talk it was all inside her all the excitement and joy what a little troll he thought with a shut mouth and shiny eyes she had watched her own party like so many serpentines thrown before her now the parents with laughing reluctance they slid down the short incline uproarious while little marion stood by always wanting to see it all to be last louise went down without help he moved to aid her but she was gone even before he bent the upper house was empty and silent in the candleshine marion stood by the slide here we go he said and picked her up they sat in a vast circle in the cellar warmth came from the distant bulk of the furnace the chairs stood in a long line along each wall twenty squealing children twelve rustling relatives alternatively spaced with louise down at the far end mich up at this end near the stairs he peered but saw nothing they had all grouped to their chairs catchasyoucan in the blackness the entire programme from here on was to be enacted in the dark he as mr interlocutor there was a child scampering a smell of damp cement and the sound of the wind out in the october stars now cried the husband in the dark cellar quiet everybody settled the room was black black not a light not a shine not a glint of an eye a scraping of crockery a metal rattle the witch is dead intoned the husband eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee said the children the witch is dead she has been killed and here is the knife she was killed with he handed over the knife it was passed from hand to hand down and around the circle with chuckles and little odd cries and comments from the adults the witch is dead and this is her head whispered the husband and handed an item to the nearest person oh i know how this game is played some child cried happily in the dark he gets some old chicken innards from the icebox and hands them around and says these are her innards and he makes a clay head and passes it for her head and passes a soup bone for her arm and he takes a marble and says this is her eye and he takes some corn and says this is her teeth and he takes a sack of plum pudding and gives that and says this is her stomach i know how this is played hush youll spoil everything some girl said the witch came to harm and this is her arm said mich eeeeeeeeeeee the items were passed and passed like hot potatoes around the cirle some children screamed wouldnt touch them some ran from their chairs to stand in the centre of the cellar until the grisly items had passed aw its only chicken insides scoffed a boy come back helen shot from hand to hand with small scream after scream the items went down down to be followed by another and another the witch cut apart and this is her heart said the husband six or seven items moving at once through the laughing trembling dark louise spoke up marion dont be afraid its only play marion didnt say anything marion asked louise are you afraid marion didnt speak shes all right said the husband shes not afraid on and on the passing the screams the hilarity the autumn wind sighed about the house and he the husband stood at the head of the dark cellar intoning the words handing out the items marion asked louise again from far across the cellar everybody was talking marion called louise everybody quieted marion answer me are you afraid marion didnt answer the husband stood there at the bottom of the cellar steps louise called marion are you there no answer the room was silent wheres marion called louise she was here said a boy maybe shes upstairs marion no answer it was quiet louise cried out marion marion turn on the lights said one of the adults the items stopped passing the children and adults sat with the witchs items in their hands no louise gasped there was a scraping of her chair wildly in the dark no dont turn on the lights oh god god god dont turn them on please dont turn on the lights dontlouise was shrieking now the entire cellar froze with the scream nobody moved everyone sat in the dark cellar suspended in the suddenly frozen task of this october game the wind blew outside banging the house the smell of pumpkins and apples filled the room with the smell of the objects in their fingers while one boy cried ill go upstairs and look and he ran upstairs hopefully and out around the house four times around the house calling marion marion marion over and over and at last coming slowly down the stairs into the waiting breathing cellar and saying to the darkenss i cant find her then some idiot turned on the lights
