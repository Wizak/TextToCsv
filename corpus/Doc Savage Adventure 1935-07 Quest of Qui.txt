 chapter i the dragon ship there was no wind and the authorities later decided this accounted for what occurred for had there been a wind many things would doubtlessly have been different had there been a wind a baffling mystery might never have come to the notice of the world and to the attention of doc savage a number of men might have gone on living and a scheme of consummate horror would probably have been executed with success it was however dead calm on the atlantic ocean off the outer tip of long island the calm had persisted since dawn and it was aggravating weather for sailboats and at the same time very nice weather for power boats the sea scream was a power boat all eighty feet of her mahogany teak and brass and she bowled along at almost twenty knots the sea scream was a yacht and she had cost somewhat less than a quarter of a million which made her owner an important man on the principle that any one who can pay nearly a quarter of a million for a plaything is important but neither the sea scream nor her wealthy owner nor her guests were of special importance to the world that day as far as news was concerned millionaires and their yachts are a dime a dozen as concerns news around long island sound what happened to those on the sea scream was important it was also amazing so much so that citizens in london paris and elsewhere read about it in their newspapers that afternoon the sea scream was barely out of sight of land when the sailor at the wheel shaded his eyes squinted then picked up a pair of binoculars and focused them something dead ahead sir he called the sea scream lunged on bows knocking up spray owner guests and crew glanced idly ahead not nearly so interested as they were going to be soon the helmsman used the binoculars again staring very hard this time after which a blankness came on his face i hope to swab a deck he grunted captain sir have a look the snappily uniformed captain took the binoculars and stared through them bless me he said and hastily went to the owner want to have a glance at an unusual vessel he asked and presented the glasses the owner looked so did the guests one a lady they murmured interested strangelooking thing said the owner never saw one like it offered a guest i have said the lady a picture i mean in my history books when i was a girl more to be polite than anything else for his job depended on that to an extent the skipper asked what would you call the craft miss a viking dragon ship replied the woman the men laughed for the idea was of course a little preposterous viking dragon ships having gone out of style shortly after the days of eric the red and other noted norsemen but the woman was correct the sea scream swept up to the strange craft doubleended perhaps sixty feet long the vessel had some of the aspects of a giant fat canoe bow and stern reared up to support platforms and amidships was deck planking while along the rail on the outside were fastened round things of rusty steel objects which certainly resembled shields such as were carried by ancient warriors there was a mast and a sail draped around it unfilled because there was no wind the sail seemed to be made of animal skins from which the hair had been removed there was not a soul in sight on the decks of the weird craft one of the yacht guests had an idea bet it broke away from some water carnival he laughed lets go aboard suggested the lady of course agreed the owner it should be interesting interesting so it was to be the sea scream captain shouted orders and the yacht slowed her engines and nosed up alongside the viking dragon ship the sea being so calm that there was no necessity for going aboard in the tender surprising aspects of the viking craft became evident on closer inspection for one thing the vessel appeared very old and it could be seen that the hull had been put together with thongs of hide some of the hide seemed new as did the sail but the shields along the rail were amazingly rusted the viking ship had a smell too a very strong one it was not a smell of death hut rather that distinctive aroma that arises where men live for a long time with no bathing facilities available take a line aboard the sea scream captain ordered a sailor the sailor sprang aboard the dragon ship with the line which he made fast around the mast then things happened the sailor thrust both arms high over his head and screamed most horribly after which his head slued forward hanging with a hideous slackness and he fell to the deck sticking in the mans back was a spear which had a thongwrapped haft no more than three feet long fantastic figures swarmed out of the dragon ship hold they were men but what men they wore helmets of burnished steel each helmet adorned with a fearsome pair of horns the faces under the helmets might have been bearded visages of the very norse freebooters of a day ten centuries past vikings the lady on the yacht gasped the whiskered horde on the dragon ship now boarded the sea scream there was not a firearm among them but they gripped spears and swords which were sharp and which they showed no scruples about using the yacht captain tried to run to his cabin where he had a gun but a spear ponderously cast impaled one of his legs and he upset on the deck and lay there making faces the bearded raiders from the viking ship began to bawl hoarsely not a word they said was understood by those on the yacht but there were accompanying gestures which conveyed full meaning the yachtsmen were being ordered to change ships there was some more fighting first after which the yachtsmen whipped obeyed they were ordered into a stuffy forward hold and the hatch slammed down on them the yachtsmen now heard sounds which were later the source of much newspaper conjecture they heard some kind of a cargo being moved from one craft to the other they never were able to decide what the cargo was but some of them voiced the impression that it was something alive when the yachtsmen were finally released it was because the bearded freebooters could not get the yacht sea scream going the whiskered ones made faces and bawled and finally collared the engineer of the yacht he wore greasy coveralls which indicated his profession and hauled him onto the yacht the frightened engineer put the engines in full speed ahead and the yacht pulled away leaving the former occupants on the dragon ship the bearded pirates now threw the engineer overboard and he swam to the dragon ship the sea scream made several wild circles while the hairy thieves danced and howled on deck and apparently experimented with the modern steering apparatus it was during this that the goldenhaired girl was glimpsed descriptions of the fair companion of the bearded freebooters as later given varied greatly the lady off the yacht declared she was a shetigress with the devil written all over her and as homely as sin but most of the men turned in a favorable report on her charms in fact they agreed generally that she was very personable entirely too sweet a thing for such company as she was keeping the engineer who had been taken aboard to start the yacht made a startling revelation he had seen the girl at close range she was a knockout furthermore the young woman was an unwilling guest of the whiskered men they were leading her about by a long thong tied to one of her ankles at any rate the sea scream was soon lost to sight of her frightened owner who with his guests had been left aboard the dragon ship the yacht all noted was headed toward new york city about noon a breeze came up the yachtsmen sailed the dragon ship into a harbor near the tip of long island finding in doing so that the ship was extremely seaworthy the yachting victims of this twentieth century viking raid promptly found themselves once they convinced their listeners they were not crazy or lying objects of feverish interest both to the coast guard and the newspapers a swarm of photographers and reporters arrived a news reel cameraman came in a plane he got shots of the dragon ship and his plane flew them back to new york where that very night they were shown in the movie theaters the news reel shots of the viking dragon ship got william harper littlejohn interested william harper littlejohn was a very erudite gentleman but he occasionally attended the cinema for relaxation johnny was archaeologist enough to recognize even in the news reel shots the undoubted genuiness of the viking dragon ship he left the theater in haste he called doc savage doc was out of town johnny took a plane the next morning for the harbor where the dragon ship lay the arrival of johnny on the scene created a furor among the newspapermen who needed new angles for their stories anyway since absolutely no trace had been found of the yacht sea scream the sea scream had vanished as completely as if sunken appearance of johnny to the newspapermen meant doc savage was on the job for every one knew johnny was associated with doc and doc savage man of bronze mental wizard physical giant extraordinary was big news all the more so because doc shunned publicity most effectively johnny did not even bother to deny that doc was interested in the viking dragon ship he went ahead and examined the craft he used his monocle magnifier on the ponderous oars almost too heavy for one man to lift and on various hammered copper cooking utensils he scrutinized the plank fastenings he studied the stitching which held the skins composing the sail those watching him realized he was very interested indeed a news reel cameraman took pictures of his every move finally johnny secured from his plane several ponderous and rare volumes on history which he had brought along he poured over these intently he seemed to be learning things the news reel men asked him for a statement they had asked numerous times but on this occasion johnny consented oracular cognoscence of certain recondite aspects i will hypothesize said johnny who never used a small word where he could insert a big one the news reel man looked stunned by the verbal flow but hastily got his camera and voice recorder going johnny fingered his monocle and began disquisitional recapitulation of imperspicuous symptomatology tends to an unequivocal belief he announced twenty million moviegoers were destined to choke over those words the news reel concern finally had to run a summary by a commentator at the end translating the erudite johnnys remarks for the american hoi polloi the gist of it was that johnny was thoroughly convinced that the viking dragon ship was genuine and that it had been built many centuries ago and repaired more recently furthermore certain markings coats of arms in effect discernible on the craft proved it had belonged to the fleet of one certain ancient viking freebooter tarnjen by name tarnjen stated johnny had been the bad boy of his day so bad indeed that he had been chased out of viking land with a number of ships and what loot he had amassed which was probably considerable a year or two later tarnjen had returned with only one ship a vastly humiliated soul his other ships and men had been taken by the qui just who the qui were historians did not seem certain some history tomes suggested that qui was a name tarnjen had given to some savage tribe on some remote continent whoever or whatever qui was they had taken most of tarnjens men and ships all of his loot and sent him back thoroughly broken qui then was a mystery such was the gist of johnnys recital this was the beginning of the mystery of qui a mystery from which amazing things came johnny returned to new york but he was still interested and since doc savage was still out of town overseeing the construction of a charity hospital somewhere and since there was no excitement brewing johnny had nothing to do but dabble with the mystery of qui and the viking dragon ship and the vanished yacht sea scream which still had not been found the raid of the vikings was unusual news it went far and wide reports came in a liner captain had seen the dragon ship off cape cod he reported a fisherman claimed he had seen such a vessel in the nova scotia fog johnny digested those two reports they intrigued him it seemed the dragon ship had come down from the north had met the sea scream and the freebooters had traded their craft for a more modern one which did not depend on the wind the upshot of it was that some days later johnny was alone in a plane flying along the labrador coast johnny had many accomplishments besides big words flying was one of them doc savage had taught him and doc had an amazing faculty of transferring some of his own skill to those whom he instructed it was late afternoon a snow blanket was beneath johnnys plane to the right lay a jagged rockfanged shore line this was a wilderness primeval cold unpopulated a fishing village passed hours ago had been the last sign of human habitation on the bleak labrador coast johnny peered overside often he used binoculars his ship cruised along a bare five hundred feet above the white terrain an ice floe out at sea held his attention for a time mainly because of its ominous aspect and also because there was a school of seals on its edge natural life always interested johnny johnny was not quite sure what he was looking for so he kept an eye open for anything of interest that was why he went to investigate the smoke column the smoke was actually not a column it was small a gray yarn which whipped in the frigid arctic gale but it was the only trace of life the bony archaeologist and geologist had seen in hours so he banked his plane over in that direction the fire was in the lee of a cathedrallike spire of stone snowdrifts were all about the beach was close a necklace of rocks icecrusted which rimmed the shore line johnny was close overhead before he saw the man the man lay on his back and the snow was red beside him his arms made feeble horrible motions movements that were not a supplication to the plane above for the man seemed not to know that the ship was moaning over him the man on the snow was obviously in a bad way the red patch was certainly leakage from a wound no dogs no sleeping roll could be seen johnny now made one of the biggest mistakes of his life he landed his plane chapter the devils of qui it was a rocky region but there were stretches free of boulders the snow was deep and obviously covered with a hard crust the wind it was a fair breeze was picking the loose flakes up and carrying them along in small detached clouds johnny looked at the plane thermometer and saw that it was very close to zero cold for this time of year even this far north since down in new york it was early summer johnny landed by the simple expedient of cranking the streamlined landing gear up he absentmindedly cranked it partially down before he thought and sat the plane down on its belly the craft was designed for that but the nose had to be kept up throughout to protect the propeller johnny had not landed on snow for a long time and he miscalculated the distance the plane would slide with the result that he almost but not quite coasted into a nest of boulders the minute the plane stopped the crust on the snow collapsed letting the ship sink down to its wings and johnny got out muttering bigworded imprecations he foresaw some trouble in leaving the place had he known exactly how much trouble he was going to have the knowledge might conceivably have turned his hair white johnny walked to the wounded man one peculiarity about the mans face struck johnny distinctly it was a full crude face equipped with a horses mouth small bird eyes and a nose of no consequence but that was not what stood out distinctly many men have ugly faces not so many however have their forehead nose and eye area weatherbeaten until the skin resembles the top of an old shoe while the rest of their cheeks jowls and neck remain the paleblue color of skim milk johnny absently decided this man had worn a very heavy beard for a long time and had only recently shaved it off then johnny began his examination the man had collapsed and with good reason for he had been shot three times no four johnny found the fourth through the mans foot where he had not bled much the other bullets were in his body and they had bled plenty of scarlet blood the bullet victims parka of fur bearskin pants and big pliable hightop moccasins looked extremely new and johnny curious twisted back the hood until he could see the collar band nothing there he looked at the parka skirt no eskimo squaw had made these garments they bore the label of a highclass sporting goods house on new yorks madison avenue there was nothing else on the wounded mans person to give the slightest indication of who he was or what had befallen him johnny ran back to the plane saw it had sunken even deeper in the snow expressed his opinion of that happening with several glossologic gems and got a firstaid kit out of it the bullet victim was talking quite calmly when johnny skittered across the snow crust to him the secret of qui is twelve hundred years old kettler he said you got the breaks when you found the place the first time but youll never find it again without that goldenhaired girl in a rational sounding measured voice the man talked to the one named kettler and he looked straight at bony johnny as he talked as if he had mistaken johnny for the person kettler but it was not that the man was delirious out of his head he would talk for a while then he would collapse johnny knew how it went kettler i tell you i didnt let her go deliberately the man said earnestly she banged me on the head with a rock look you can see where she hit me he did not point but johnny looked then blinked for there was a fearsome bruise on the mans forehead but the wounded man was still talking she ran away the man said i dont know where she went i think she went north back toward qui she aint normal that dame but what else can you expect from qui the man stopped and breathed a little deeper than usual and the result was a gurgling explosion that shot a crimson spray through his teeth and over the surrounding snow from the number of blood spots frozen in the snow that must have happened before it was more than a minute before he went on kettler you cant find qui again without the goldenhaired dame he had said that before i couldnt help her scramming kettler he said dont shoot me he said that much too calmly damn you kettler he said youve shot me you left me here to croak i hope you never get a smell of qui again it was like listening to a story from fully conscious lips but it was horrible because of the dead quality of the tone the man was dying but dying so slowly that he might go on thus for hours for days if he got proper treatment he might not die even you wont find qui kettler said the man dont like that do you too bad aint it qui will go on like it is for maybe another twelve hundred years sure it will when you dont get back to do your killing damn your killing kettler i didnt like that part of the scheme then so suddenly that it surprised johnny a little the wounded mans mumbling became unintelligible a gout of scarlet had worked up in the fellows throat and it bubbled there making the words inarticulate johnny turned him over and as one would drain out a drowning man cleared the victims bronchial passages so more words could come newspapers full of stuff about that viking ship the man said lot of guessing nowhere near truth never connect it with qui johnny again tried to clear his throat but it was no go for the internal wounds must have opened with bandages and and opiate johnny went to work it was cold he had some trouble keeping snow from blowing into the wounds while he bandaged them the wind in the rocks sounded like violins playing far away out of the fiddling of the wind in the rocks the moan of the airplane motor came so gradually that it was quite loud before johnny noticed it it was a lowwing monoplane fitted with pontoons for landing on water and the pontoons in turn equipped with ski like runners the ship had two engines fitted with shutter cowls and their exhausts must be carried through some cabinheating attachment judging by their hissing quality an all metal ship johnny concluded the plane was coming down the wind and johnny staring toward it was bothered by snow which the wind swept into his eyes he stepped backward to get in the lee of a boulder only somewhat smaller than a suburban garage where there was some shelter it chanced thus that he saw two grooves in the snow deep grooves and more than a dozen feet apart there was one point where they had not filled with snow although they must have been made hours ago johnny looked at them closely ill be superamalgamated he murmured the grooves had been made by the landing gear of the plane above or one amazingly like it the particular marks of the ski runners attached under the pontoons could be picked out the other plane moaned overhead its color was the aluminum alloy of its natural metal and it looked new men in the cabin they numbered several were all looking down the men all wore masks the instant he saw the masks johnny sprinted for his own plane he had suddenly become in the greatest of hurries he was in a jam he did not need the twang of a bullet off a nearby rock a sound he now heard to tell him there was trouble johnny reached his plane which had broken through the soft crust its nose was almost against boulders he grabbed the tail and tried to turn the ship around by main strength no go he only broke through the crust and floundered the aluminum ship had spun away but now it came streaking back again and men were cocked out of its windows using highpowered rifles johnny could see their shoulders jerk as the rifles recoiled he heard characteristic little patting noises of bullets into the snow about him johnny crawled under the tail of his own ship burrowing deep into the snow got under the cabin scrambled up and was inside bullets hitting the cabin sounded like firecrackers exploding the cabin was encased in a membrane of armor alloy which due to the metallurgical genius of doc savage was light and proof against ordinary missiles the aluminum plane went over with a gusty whoop so low that its air disturbance rocked johnnys plane a little and sucked up a vortex of loose snow bullets came down like rain johnny jacked the selfstarters and got his engine going his propeller was not only adjustable pitch but could be reversed he reversed it not sure that it would do any good but not wanting to be pulled forward into the rocks where the prop would club itself to pieces the aluminum ship was coming back johnny produced a weapon which resembled an oversized automatic pistol with a big drum of a magazine this was a supermachine pistol perfected by doc savage and its chief wonder was not its incredible rapidity of fire but the variety of bullets which it could discharge johnny searched through a case which held ammunition drums all neatly designated with numerals he was hunting one which held bullets charged with a particular chemical that vaporized even in air as cold as this and gave off a gas that when drawn into a carburetor rendered the mixture unexplosive the chemical was another of doc savages gems whooom the plane jumped a full twenty feet in the air its back broke in the middle it fell in two parts smoke and snow made a cloud all about it johnny was out of the plane he was not sure how that had happened too much flame smoke noise he was in snow up to his neck outflung arms supported him on the crust the smoke fumes stung his nostrils dynamite he mumbled the other plane boomed off wind pulled the smoke away parts of the plane its contents were scattered about the other ship stood on a wingtip came about in a vertical bank and started back johnny hoisted himself out of the snow handfuls of snow jumped up around him bullets he ran he saw a metal case to the left it had spilled out of the ruined plane he recognized it whipped to it gathered it up with both arms and sprinted a big rock lured him snow was encrusted near it he went through under but the stones sheltered him plane guns bullets made a hell of a noise then the plane went on johnny burrowed deeper snow among the boulders he discovered ranged from six to fifteen feet in depth it was soft cold enough to be dry the metal box which johnny carried was heavy he used it to ram through the snow that pleased him he could make fair progress he heard the plane come back picked out the ratty sounds which rifle slugs made running around from rock to rock in the snow drifts then came a great roar and the earth shimmied as more dynamite was dumped out of the other plane johnny kept going conditions were perfect for what he was doing he encountered a rock and worked around that his flying suit was full of snow so were his ears nostrils he stopped finally and listened the plane motor had dropped in volume of noise at first he thought it was far away then it blasted out a grating and rasping quite distinct came through the snow the ship had landed they would have trouble finding him johnny decided grimly why were they trying to kill him because he had found the wounded man obviously but what was behind their action what were they up to and could he johnny finally escape he thought so but just in case there was a precaution he could take johnny worked himself from side to side in the snow and made a small cave there was not much light but he did not need much he opened the box some snow fell in he brushed it out carefully the box held a radio outfit which transmitted and received on an extremely shortwave length despite its compactness the apparatus had a range under favorable conditions of a good many hundreds of miles johnny turned a switch a generator operated by a very sturdy light storage battery made some little noise he fumbled with the microphone and headset he set the dials to the wave length employed by doc savage and his men in their communications then he heard about the most unpleasant sound possible under the circumstances dogs barking the other men had landed their plane they had unloaded dogs probably sled dogs johnny let out a long word expressive of disgust the dogs would smell him out like a partridge under the snow chapter killers all no one had ever honestly believed johnny did not have an agile mind and he used it now he thought swiftly his first conclusion was that it was just as well if these men seeking his life did not know about the radio transmitter and receiver they would be certain to destroy that link with civilization johnny in common with some other scholarly men was a bit absentminded however when he left the radio set and burrowed away hurriedly under the snow he overlooked something he might have done had he thought of it johnny forgot to turn the radio transmitter off men were shouting they sounded angry dogs were barking and they sounded joyful as if they had been cooped up on the plane for some time johnny found himself in snow which was particularly dark decided that that meant the drift was deep and he was near the bottom and concluded to lie still the dogs at least would not hear him then he might even get away entirely after he had stopped johnny heard a faint whine which puzzled him it was almost two minutes before he abruptly remembered he had forgotten to turn off the radio and this must be the generator he was hearing it would run for hours the generator delivering high voltage drew little current and the special storage battery had a high amperehour capacity during the next few seconds johnny entertained ideas of burrowing back and turning the radio off but put that out of his mind as being too risky they might not hear it anyway johnny grinned once but not joyfully it was the kind of a grin put on by a man who has just been run over by a car and is too dazed to be sure how badly he is hurt and johnny employed the grin because he had thought of how unbelievable his present position was a viking dragon ship filled with bearded freebooters had captured a yacht off long island and that was somehow connected with a plane load of men who were now trying to kill johnny there was also something named qui of which no man had known for twelve hundred years it did not quite make sense johnny had encountered some strange unbelievable and mysterious things during his association with doc savage but this one thus far made less sense than a dog went wurrroo over johnnys head another canine barked more sharply they had sniffed him out johnny wished fervently that he had taken a bath more recently than the previous saturday it might have helped a coppernickel slug came clubbing down through the snow jarred the frozen ground close to johnnys fingers and the report of the gun which had fired it sounded far less muffled than johnny had expected the drift must not be as deep as he had thought men were crunching up johnny had made himself a little cave the weight of those above collapsed that snow got into his eyes mouth only the most heroic effort kept him from sneezing wheres that machine gun bawled a voice which reminded johnny of the sound one got by pulling a resined string through a tight drumhead comin kettler called some one more distant kettler rasped hurry it up hes somewhere under here where the dogs are sniffin and barkin there was a pause feet crunched in the snow heres the gun said a voice dont set it up on the tripod directed kettler three of you hold the damned thing so the recoil wont knock you down well get this guy under the snow whoever he is johnny reached a hurried decision hold it he shouted i am coming out he half expected them to pay no attention but thanked his stars when they did and scrambled not without difficulty to the surface men grabbed him yanked him with the result that they all went through tile crust and there was much cursing and floundering around johnny perceived that a large stone upthrust near by east a shadow and it was this which had deceived him into thinking the snow was deep some one hit him with a fist and that jarred snow out of his eyes so that he got a good look at his captors he abruptly felt as if something colder than snow water were running down the back of his neck they were a hard evillooking crowd and in size they averaged neither unusually large nor particularly small but about what one might expect from a group assembled not because of their size but because their brains had the same twist if it is a brain twist that makes a criminal one thing johnny did note that all had in common their foreheads noses and central cheek area was weatherbeaten until it brought thoughts of the back of a toad the rest of their visages where a beard would have protected the skin were quite pale all of them like the wounded man johnny had found had recently cut off heavy beards let im have it ordered kettler kettler was the tallest man in the crowd and he had a doglike face he was wearing a muskrat cap with earfiaps that hung down and gave him a hound aspect he bent forward too giving the impression that he might be more at home on all fours a man lifted a rifle he looked closely at johnny over its sights unconscionable intempestivity johnny said hastily the man with the rifle all but dropped the weapon oh hell he choked oh hell kettler put out his doglike jaw and said go ahead pop im off a man began maybe we better better what better find another way what other way is there kettler rasped he talked to that fool we shot didnt he and the fool was talking his head off wasnt he this guy is sure to have heard plenty wasnt he now ask me what can we do but butter him up and put him away aw k said the voice whew gulped the man with the gun whew whats eating you gritted kettler this guy the rifleman jabbed his gun muzzle at johnny this pile of bones an uncomplaisant appellative snapped johnny thats it exploded the rifleman thats what i remembered i mean i thought there was something familiar about this pile of bones on account of me having seen his picture somewhere then he sprung that word that jawbreaker and i remembered remembered what yelled kettler this guy is william harper littlejohn said the other that apparently meant nothing to kettler and who he queried might william harper littlejohn be one of doc savages five righthand men announced the other glory be and i almost shot him johnny who really had no slightest idea of capitalizing on the suggestion ventured now perhaps you will turn me loose sure grated kettler ill turn you loose from this earth he hooked a bony hand down inside the waistband of his trousers got a revolver pointed it at johnnys stomach johnny shifted an eye at the machine gun he was wearing a bulletproof vest which would protect him momentarily and there was a bare chance that he might reach the rapidfirer it was one of the big heavy oldfashioned type developed and manufactured during the great war wait a man exploded and why should i kettler rasped more than ever kettlers voice reminded johnny of a resined cord on a drumhead he seemed to recall that in radio sound effects men used such a device to imitate roaring lions and such this guy the objector jerked a frantic thumb at johnny this guy howd he get up here howd he find the guy we bumped for letting that yellowhaired dame blow i think we might ask the guy some questions kettler mulled that over he uncocked his revolver yeah he said ive heard of this doc savage if hes on the job it might help if we knew about it help exploded a man in the background when doc savage comes in i go out none of that damned talk kettler growled he stared at johnny with small eyes how much does doc savage know doc savages knowledge is indeterminable magnitudinous said johnny kettler shot his jaw out you mean he knows about the whole caper howd he get wise that guys kiddin you kettler advised some one who knew the meaning of the words johnny had used kettler instantly knocked johnny down the man could move with shocking speed johnny could recall but few times when he had been hit so suddenly and with such blinding force johnny buried head and shoulders in the snow when he fell and lying there was conscious of a whining in his ears he thought it was aftermath of the blow then remembered the radio transmitter he had abandoned he got up hastily and staggered away from the spot until they cornered him look said a man and pointed twentyfive yards away the man who had been shot the fellow whose presence had drawn johnny to a landing was sitting up he was talking loudly and coherently to no one that bird is tough some one muttered kettler saying nothing took a deliberate aim with his revolver the gun let out noise fire and jumped a hole round and blue appeared in the wounded mans forehead and started leaking red the victim fell back silent unmoving he aint tough enough to stand that i betcha said kettler johnny nearly shuddered himself off his feet it was the coldest kind of a murder kettler emitted a stream of profanity he sprang to johnny jabbed him in the stomach with the murder gun whats doc savage know about this he gritted breath steam it stood out very distinctly in the cold air ran a long plume out of johnnys mouth and then there was no more breath steam for so long a time that it seemed certain he must collapse from want of breathing out with it kettler roared doc savage dont know anything johnny said his words small halting it was the truth kettler did not believe it dont lie to me he yelled has savage figured out about them vikings in that dragon ship figured what out about them johnny queried figured what they were psst kettler a man hissed hes pumping you uhm kettler scowled and shifted his gun from johnnys stomach to his mouth with the result that the gaunt geologists moist tender mouth tissues clung to the gun steel most agonizingly and tore when kettler yanked the weapon hah kettler leered does doc savage know about qui johnny spat crimson said nothing damn im gonna shoot him kettler proclaimed wait a minute grunted a man i aint so anxious to stir this doc savage up wed be prize suckers to get him on our necks by croakin this bony guy we may have already gotten him on our necks grunted kettler m reply how we gonna know this mug wont talk i know mugs who wont talk when i see one listen said the other they drew aside where johnny could not hear their pssst of whispering then both departed shuffling carefully over the snow crust those behind guarded johnny with careless efficiency when he tried to talk they kicked him and used their fists he fell silent he heard distant chopping noises some fifteen minutes later a shout came from kettler and johnny was hauled over the snow crust kettler stood beside a stream this was frozen over but there was running water under the ice it could be heard the ice had cracked during the intense cold of winter and pressure had shoved it up at the edges causing a number of larger cracks johnny was hauled over the rugged ice to the middle of the stream the ice was thick and they had chopped a trench in it seven feet long three wide and almost three deep johnny was now bound hand and foot wrists and ankles were lashed together so that he could not stand erect he was thrown into the bottom of the trench chunks of chopped ice which had not been scooped out gouged his bony frame some one brought a heavy rock which had been pried from its frozen bed with difficulty the rock was so heavy that they rolled it into the pit instead of lifting it and lowering it it knocked air out of johnnys lungs with such violence that almost a minute elapsed before he could start breathing again whats idea he managed to gulp youre gonna tell us where doc savage hooks into this he was informed johnny only glared he could hear them chopping the ice near by their axes no doubt had been brought from their plane the chopping sounded hurried the men appeared to be no great lovers of physical labor because there was plenty of grumbling dogs they were big sled huskies bounded about barked and chased rabbits wind whined in the cold stunted trees along the creek bank listening to it johhny thought of the distant violins again the sound struck him as funeral music snow sifted in on him it was covering him like a shroud a funeral shroud he shivered what are you doing with me he yelled a little uneasily unsteadily a man leered down at him the guy is forgettin his big words kettler came and looked down the man had a face like a devil johnny thought a canine sort of a devil it was altogether the most unlovely face the lank geologist and archaeologist could recall johnny glared up at the devillike face the glaring was a measure to preserve his own control a man does not get scared so badly if he can keep his mind on doing something else gonna spill it asked kettler johnny said no men appeared they carried folding canvas buckets no doubt also gotten from their plane water was in the buckets they must have dipped it up from a hole they had chopped through the ice pour it in directed kettler the water splashed down the sides of the ice pit it seemed warm at first but that was some misinterpretation by johnnys nerves it became cold it bit through his garments soaked him it mixed with the snow and became a slush that began to freeze instantly johnny floundered about the rock on his chest did not allow much of that and what motion he did manage did not help much his legs began to feel pleasantly warm that seared him horror frosted his brain that warmth he was freezing what do you want to know he gasped hastily kettler leered down in the pit not a damn thing he rasped ive decided well just put you in the ice here hell with what you know maybe theyll find you next spring maybe not johnny writhed knowing it would not help blood rammed at his eardrums he could hear a singing it was his own horror of course but it made him think of the radio transmitter that he had left switched on the transmitter was strong enough to reach doc savages new york headquarters if there had just been time to use it more water kettler called harshly lets get this guy out of the way and get at the job of finding that goldenhaired dame johnnys head throbbed the radio the radio chapter the knife that threw itself the radio is undoubtedly a remarkable invention with many possibilities and probably no one individual knew more about radio or employed it more assiduously than did doc savage man of miracles mystery and adventure doc savage stood beside the complex radio equipment in his new york headquarters and listened to a steady hissing note which came from a loudspeaker this is strange he said his voice was a remarkable one controlled a voice that had undergone much training unusual as it was the voice was hardly as remarkable as the man doc savage was a giant one did not realize that until comparison with ordinary objects for his muscles were evenly developed he did not have the knotted shoulders of a wrestler or the overdeveloped legs of a runner rather his whole great frame was swathed in sinews that were remindful of bundled wires more striking was the bronze of his skin a hue which might have come from many tropical suns and the slightly darker bronze of his straight tightlying hair his eyes were a little weird being like pools of fine gold flakes being always stirred by tiny invisible gales the loudspeaker hissed steadily renny doc called there were windows on three sides of the laboratory which held the radio equipment windows which looked down from a height of eightysix stories up in central new york city at one end was a door which opened revealing a library a room with floor space taken up by bookcases the door was high but the man who came through ducked a little so that its top would clear his head he was broad too with arms that were beams yet somehow he looked lean gaunt hungry maybe it was his hands that made him look that way they were fantastic hinds huge he could hardly have put either of them in a gallon pail yes he said and his voice somehow brought thoughts of a lion which had jumped out of its cave and roared listen to that renny doc savage said and indicated the hissing radio renny came forward he was colonel john renwick m s c e d s c c m h and a lot of other things he was a civil engineer noted over most of the world for his abilityand those fists he cocked an ear to the hissing from the radio he walked over and eyed the dials noting their setting it was obvious that he was quite familiar with the apparatus a transmitter sending on our wave length the wave length we use for intercommunication he said sounds weak must be some amateur with a little transmitter this station is hundreds of mites distant doc savage said sure fairly you can tell after you have played with radio for a long time this is one of our sets the one johnny had you can tell that too renny rumbled the particular quality of the carrier wave doc imparted there is hardly another transmitter that would emit the specific type of wave associated with our newly developed shortwave v u x type tube renny used an enormous forefinger to scratch his head but what would johnny be keeping that transmitter turned on for running down his battery isnt it look here doc savage said he pressed a button which lighted a groundglass compass rose over which was mounted a pointer actuated by a loop aerial through remote control the loop was situated on the skyscraper roof for better functioning doc savage moved the loop in the regulation radio compass manner not getting the signals to their loudest but to their weakest point which was more easily detected renny read the compass indicator north by east a quarter east he said holy cow hes somewhere on a line drawn approximately between here and greenland or maybe on the same line if extended south through new york city exactly doc said it is very strange this continuous operation of johnnys transmitter renny extracted a newspaper from a coat pocket which looked as if it had been especially tailored with sufficient capacity to hold his enormous fists he tapped the headlines that business of the viking pirates who took over that yacht is getting a big play he said there is a story in here to the effect that johnny examined the viking dragon ship and declared it to be genuine and some hundreds of years old funny eh unusual to say the least doc savage agreed and johnny is supposed to have chased off somewhere investigating the mystery renny boomed doc savage was still in front of the radio there now came into being a sound so soft and eerie that its presence was at first unnoticeable it was a trilling low indescribably mellow a sound so fantastic that it defied description the fantastic note seemed to filter from everywhere it was as if the very air were saturated with it the trilling was the sound of doc savage a small unconscious thing which he did in moments of mental stress he did not do it willfully he had made it always since he could remember and now he seemed to realize what he was doing and the unearthly note ebbed away renny eyed the bronze man sharply that sound always meant something was up strange that business of the radio transmitter going steady he said echoing docs earlier statement its got some queer angles queer angles it did have they found out just how queer an instant later something that glinted whipped through the air renny had a flash realization of what it was a knife it flashed directly for doc savages back the knife struck doc in the back pointfirst and with ugly force an alarm clock began ringing deliriously renny reacted with the abruptness of a man who had been in danger before he slammed down and to one side getting behind a case which held storage batteries the steadily ringing alarm clock seemed very loud doc savage had taken a headlong dive and was lying behind the battery case also the bronze mans back was to renny docs coat was ripped displaying the fine chain mail undergarment which doc habitually wore the knife still stuck in the cloth of the bronze mans coat renny pulled the knife out and looked at it briefly short as his inspection was he noted that the knife was extremely unusual doc savage had dug a thin tube as long as a pencil and not much larger than a match from his clothing somewhere and he elongated this somewhat then projected the tip over the battery case it was a tiny periscope the alarm clock jangled steadily watch it doc renny croaked in sudden apprehension doc savage had stood erect he was staring steadily there was for the bronze man an unusual tenseness about his posture it was rarely that he showed excitement look out renny boomed whoever threw that knife may have a gun there is no one doc savage said their voices sounded eerie over the frantic clangor of the clock renny heaved erect his eyes roved as did the machine gun pistol which looked small in his enormous fist he had dropped the strange knife on the floor he walked forward searching holy cow he rumbled there was no one but themselves the windows were all closed because it was windy a trifle chilly this far up the windows were hardly ever opened anyway for air conditioning kept the laboratory at an even temperature that was necessary in some chemical experiments there was one door this was almost at their elbow no one could have passed through it without being seen the thrown knife had come from the other end of the room there were no doors down there it was a culdesac doc savage was moving about searching flake gold eyes roving intently renny trailed him they opened a few cabinets which were large enough to hold a man these were few in number since most of the cabinets had transparent glass doors there was no man in them the alarm clock stopped ringing doc savage picked it up with the end of a long pole that had a grabber hook on the end of it and which was ordinarily used for taking bottles off the high chemical shelves the bronze man put the clock under an xray and examined the fluroscopic screen it was not an infernal machine ever see that clock before renny asked no doc told him any finger prints doc used a vapor method of his own in searching the cheap tin alarm clock for prints he held it in a chemical vapor which would mingle with the microscopic oily deposit left by the human hand and cause a color change together with a thickening of the oily deposit due to precipitation the method would bring out the most infinitesimal print no finger prints he said renny knotted his big fists and knocked them together their hard bone and gristle made sounds reminiscent of bricks colliding it was a small habit he had holy cow he growled if you ask me it couldnt have happened doc savage said there was apparently no one in the room yet the knife was thrown you got secret trapdoors and things in this place renny reminded maybe the guy got in and got away through them doc savage moved about the room he touched innocentlooking bits of wall floor and cases and in the most unexpected places tiny lids flew up to expose dials it became evident that his skyscraper aerie was one incredible maze of mechanical devices he came back and stood by the radio the hissing note still came from the radio receiver all of the concealed doors have indicators on them which show when they have been used and the indicators cannot be put out of commission without evidence of it showing doc said they show that none of the secret entrances or exits have been used but why the alarm clock renny scratched his head say that knife maybe doc savage picked the knife up turned it in his hands he abruptly put it under a magnifying glass unusual thing eh renny commented doc savage lifted a glance have you guessed just how unusual renny i can build a bridge or a skyscraper renny said i dont know a heck of a lot about knives the one youve got in your hand looks as if some amateur had hammered it out of a piece of iron as a knife it dont look so hot the knife is probably more than a thousand years old renny renny showed interest he knew this was one of the things on which doc was an authority yeah he said it is a genuine old viking knife doc said a collector of such things might be willing to pay five hundred dollars for it a viking knife renny said holy cow the telephone buzzer whined doc savage went over and picked up one of several telephones each of which was connected instead of a bell to a buzzer which had a distinctive note yes he said the voice which began talking to him was monks what goes on if anything monk asked an alarm clock just rang in my laboratory doc told him about the same time a knife struck my back with force enough to make the discomfort of wearing a bulletproof jacket all the time seem a good investment monk was silent a moment he must have been digesting that and trying to make something out of it then he asked who threw the knife no one so far as we can find then what kind of a gadget done it no gadget that we have seen doc told him the alarm clock did not obviously alarm clock monk made a mumbling noise say what is this a mystery doc replied it seems to have to do with ancient vikings and owww monk bawled monks roar out of the receiver was earsplitting it made renny standing across the laboratory jump silence followed utter silence either monks receiver had been hung up or the telephone had been torn from its cord socket somethings happened big renny barked charging across the laboratory monk dont squall like that without reasons chapter mysterious campaign monk like most extremely homely men was ordinarily a peaceful quiet smallvoiced soul the only time he was noisy was in a fight then he was a bedlam all by himself monk was putting on one of his best bedlams now he howled and roared and floundered about although there was daylight outside the room wherein monk was having his troubles was in the blackest darkness this was because special shutters on the windows were closed monk had been engaged in an experiment with chemicals sensitive to light there had been a red light burning that had gone out very mysteriously something had fastened itself around monks feet unexpectedly in his excitement he had tried to jump howling at the same time and had gone down absentmindedly keeping a clutch on the telephone he had torn it loose from its wires yeoow monk roared leggo me he struck savagely with the telephone hit nothing and suddenly discovered the thing around his ankles was a cord it was hard stiff slick a thong of some kind of hide monk suddenly stopped making a noise and tried to change his position the thing around his ankles hampered him he got around that by the for him simple expedient of rearing up and walking on his hands he settled down behind a steel desk and listened intently an alarm clock started ringing the thing sounded louder than any alarm clock monk had ever heard probably surprise had something to do with that he tried to listen harder his ears could not penetrate the din he did not move he was thinking of what he had just been told over the telephone the alarm clock which had accompanied the attempt on doc savages life trying to make no noise monk worked at the thong securing his ankles the knot was the kind that supped only one way it would not loosen monk got out his pocketknife fists were beating rapidly on the dark room door monk cried the one who was doing the belaboring mr mayfair what has happened it was monks secretary obviously she had found the door locked that surprised monk no end he had not locked it the thong defied his pocketknife blade zunnng the sound came from the spot monk had left he knew something had hit the wall near the telephone stand hit it very hard the sound was loud over the alarm clock bell monk felt under his left arm then grimaced the holster was there but the machinegun pistol was not monk was a careless soul and he had lain the gun aside while he worked moments dragged the alarm clock rang on monk began to wonder if it would ever run down the secretary was still attacking the door it sounded as if she had gotten the fire axe out of the penthouse vestibule monk got up on his hands again walked himself toward where he had lain his gun he got it one of the machine pistols which doc savage had perfected he held it by the trigger guard with his teeth and hindwalked to a light switch he set himself then he turned the switch on bringing a blaze of white light which hopelessly ruined the chemical project under way at the moment monks hair all but stood on end it was not what he saw it was what he did not see there was apparently no one but himself in the dark room at least half a dozen times monk ran an intent scrutiny over the dark room there were many stands of apparatus cases metal boxes jugs and a few packing boxes none of these were of sufficient size to harbor a man devoting one eye to the job monk discovered he had been using the dull blade in his pocketknife to saw at the thong he opened a sharp blade and finally sawed through it he laid the thong aside for future examination it was the toughest piece of leather he had ever seen monk made a complete circle of the room he saw no attacker he went over and gaped at the thing sticking in the wall beside the telephone stand it was a bobtailed spear a thing with a heavy razorsharp head and a shaft less than three feet long very heavy a tassel of flexible thongs on the end of the shaft evidently served the same purpose as feathers on the extremity of an indians arrow monk left it sticking and went to the alarm clock it ran down just as he reached it the thing was cheap the type sold by most drug stores for less than a dollar a volley of loud blows on the door reminded monk that his secretary was still trying to get in he went over the key had been turned in the lock he was positive of that he turned the key back and opened the door the secretary who came in was as near being the prettiest secretary in new york as monk had been able to achieve after interviewing some hundreds of applicants she was excited but that only made her prettier it was obvious that she had not the least idea of what had happened so monk told her now what do you make of it he finished no one came in or left im positive said the young woman who had brains as well as beauty monk took another tour of inspection around the dark room which was a part of the penthouse chemical laboratory which he maintained down here a stones throw from wall street monk was by way of being one of the nations leading chemists he came back and eyed his secretary foolishly do i look all right he demanded no worse than usual the young woman replied why i thought maybe i had an attack of the jimjams and imagined what happened monk said dont be silly monk suddenly handed the young woman his machinegun pistol guard the door with that he commanded im gonna go get habeas corpus that hog sure said monk hes part bloodhound that hog is monk walked rapidly along a corridor which had cost a great deal to decorate after a single look at monk one knew where he got his nickname he would not have to be met in a very dark alley to be mistaken for an overgrown ape his face was composed mostly of mouth his nose had been pounded almost entirely back into his face in the past and he had small eyes practically no forehead strangely enough people who met him for the first time usually smiled at him monk opened a mahogany door and entered a room which was no doubt the most expensive pigpen in the world the floor was marble covered with mats and there was a trough of chromium and various chromium selffeeders holding viands dear to the porker family there was a stack of clean straw at one end in the middle was a wallowing box perhaps ten feet square the mud in this wallow was perfumed out of the mud stuck two ears of enormous size habeas monk called the ears twitched get outta there or ill kick your ribs in monk yelled the big ears arose judging from their size the hog in the mud should have been only slightly smaller than a hippopotamus he proved to be about the size of a good jack rabbit he was composed other than ears of snout and long legs with very little left over for other necessary portions habeas followed monk back into the dark room theres a mystery in here habeas monk said find im sic habeas seemed to get the idea he advanced then a very peculiar thing happened the big ears shot up straight habeas stiffened then very slowly he retreated to the door good night monk breathed only other time i ever seen habeas act that scared was when he happened on a lion unexpected like down in feet clattered furiously outside doors banged monk spun whipped the machinegun out of his secretarys hands faced the door doc savage and renny came in renny was blowing docs bronze was a little darker as if he had been moving fast all of this excitement over me monk grinned what happened doc asked quietly monk told them ending something in here gave habeas the big jitters must be something he smells you can see there aint no place big enough for a man to hide renny picked up the alarm clock different brand than the one in docs office he said thats easy to understand anybody who bought two alarm clocks might be suspected he dang thing sure raised the roof monk stated doc savage was examining the stubby spear he pulled it out of the wall after giving it a yank to demonstrate how forcibly it had been driven in he turned it over and examined it for finger prints but found none viking he said what renny boomed a type of short club spear carried by ancient vikings doc elaborated there is a historical reference to them you will notice it is heavy enough for a club and at the same time the leather tassel on the end makes it go straight if thrown monk got the thong which had been about his ankles the thong had a length of some fifteen feet beyond the loop doc looked at it walrus hide he said he scrutinized the knot a rare knot he continued whoever tied it knew a great deal about them sailors sometimes use this knot the vikings were mostly sailors renny said slowly monk scratched his nubbin of a head but why should a viking and if you find a viking in here ill eat him try to croak me doc savage wheeled and started for the door renny banged his two great fists together boomed doc the bronze man seemed not to hear and went through the door doc was attacked then monk renny rumbled only one thing can explain that doc was out of sight now what monk barked at renny somebody is tryin to wipe our crowd out renny explained his sudden suspicion holy cow next they may try to get ham hes the only other one of our gang in town yeah monk mumbled long tom the other one of our outfit is down in south america superintending some kind of an electrical project but ham is here in town working on a brief wed better get hold of ham thumped renny they charged into the outer room which monk had decorated especially as a background for his pretty secretary doc savage was speaking over the second of monks telephones i am calling the apartment of ham of brigadier general theodore marley brooks the bronze man was saying yes i know this is the office of the building manager i have called hams quarters and he does not answer what is that you have called the police you havent do not then i shall be up immediately doc clicked up the receiver he addressed the others something terrible has happened to ham he said come on park avenue the swanky part of it is noted for the manner in which its buildings succeed in being imposing without being flashy park avenue has class the club where brigadier general theodore marley brooks ham had his bachelor quarters was a building with one of the plainest fronts on park avenue it was so exclusive that a great many park avenue residents did not themselves know that it existed an imposing gentleman in afternoon attire met them he was although he would have thrown up his hands in horror at the suggestion the head janitor he was quite rattled most regrettable he murmured tell us about it doc requested there was a most terrible uproar in brigadier general brookss quarters he said one of the other tenants complained and i went up with the fourth assistant building superintendent from what we found i fear there has been ah violence just what had given the man that idea was apparent when doc savage and his two companions entered the sumptuous quarters which ham maintained the first thing they saw was an expensive vase lying in fragments over the floor chairs were upset small scatterrugs were wadded together as if by struggling feet almost exactly in the center of the study which was lined with eases holding law hooks a knife was sticking upright in the floor monk ambled over to it trailed by the shote habeas he eyed the knife another one he grunted and looked at doc savage questioningly viking doc savage agreed very similar to the one which struck my back except that it is lighter they made a quick search of the apartment and it was painfully evident that the place did not harbor ham what became of him doc asked the superintendent or thus the head janitor permitted himself to be designated you say you came up and heard sounds of an uproar did you enter immediately not immediately replied the other you see it was necessary to send for the master key i i had forgotten it i regret to say did any one remain behind and watch the door oh yes affirmed the flunky the fourthassistant building superintendent did that renny boomed then how in blazes did ham disappear from his quarters renny frowned darkly when no one seemed to have a suitable answer to his demand he stamped around the apartment and yanked open closet doors which they had opened before he even examined the interior of cabinets in the tiny kitchenette which was almost entirely electrical in equipment he stopped for a moment in front of a tall case which held nearly two dozen richlooking black canes each almost identical in appearance with the others a casual inspection failed entirely to identify the canes for what they weresword canes at the bottom of the case was a niche holding a bottle and a tiny bejeweled pocket flask with a large opening the bottle and the flask were for the peculiar chemical concoction with which ham was wont to daub the tips of his sword cane blades the chemical was one which produced quick harmless unconsciousness in a victim renny noted that there were twentyfour niches for canes and twentyfour canes in the niches ham sure left here unwillingly renny boomed thoughtfully he never goes out if only downstairs to the barber shop without one of those sword canes this has got me worried monk said gloomily monks gloom was somewhat out of line with his unusual manner with ham the two were probably as quarrelsome a pair as ever got together no one who knew monk and ham could recall either having addressed a civil word to the other but monks present worried look indicated plainly that he had a genuine affection for the missing lawyer doc savage was examining the windows he tried each then inspected the locks closely every window was locked there are no secret passages or doors in this apartment i happen to know the bronze man said monk waved an arm no place in here ham could be hidden no place big enough for a man holy cow boomed renny whered he go doc savage was unlocking the windows he raised them one after another inspected the ledges outside then leaned out and looked down at the third window he apparently made a discovery because his weird trilling sound was audible for the briefest of moments a nebulous tremolo so faint that it certainly would have escaped any ear less than normal come on he said abruptly the bronze mans flake gold eyes whipped about as if searching for some one and not finding whoever they sought where is the building superintendent doc asked he went downstairs to ask if any one had seen suspiciouslooking persons about a flunky reported he was very worried about this mess doc savage studied the flunky who was standing watch at the door between the time the door was unlocked and the time i arrived was the door left unwatched doc asked i think so said the other but there was no one in the apartment we looked i ooked thoroughly since there was no one in the apartment there was no sense in guarding the door come on doc repeated to his men the club building had an ample concretefloored court to the rear with a narrow passage leading between two other structures to a back street this was to pick up package deliveries without lowering the dignity of the place by having tradespeople scampering in and out of the front door this court was directly below tile window of hams quarters doc savage led renny and monk into the cement enclosure and pointed at a spot under hams window there were wet red spots on the concrete it looked as if some one had shaken out a brush which had been dipped in scarlet paint monk tried to speak and his first effort was a wordless croak but on his second try he asked in an agonized voice is that hams blood very likely doc savage said but his windows were locked monk exploded how did he get out doc savage studied them both thoughtfully it was rarely that he did this and it was even more rarely that he showed any emotion but now he looked as if his remarkably trained brain had just seized upon an idea too preposterous for belief monk squinted at the bronze man doc he exploded youve solved the mystery you bet renny boomed i can tell the way you look just what happened up there doc savage walked off without appearing to have heard either of them monk and renny exchanged disappointed but knowing looks hes got it monk said with certainty yeah renny agreed but what hes got is only a theory as yet he is not ready to prove it right monk finished he always acts like that when hes got a good idea but not enough proof he pretends he cant hear anybody who asks what his suspicions are then both of them jumped they had caught the vague trilling sound which was characteristic of doc savage the sound was coming from the narrow alleyway that led from the court to the hack street the bronze man had walked down this the trilling died away as monk and renny ran down the alley doc savage was standing beside a dead man doc savage said this poor fellow must have come down to search and happened upon something and he was killed the dead man was the dapper building superintendent the very much dressedup gentleman who had admitted them to the club they had seen him alive only a few moments ago and it was quite horrible now seeing him again with his mouth open and a little wormlet of his lifes blood crawling out of it monk bent over and peered at the unusual shape of the knife hilt which protruded from the dead mans chest the homely chemist looked at doc questioningly viking doc said simply renny knocked his big fists together with quick jerky swings and seemed to want to say something without knowing what say renny mumbled dont forget that mysterious business about johnnys radio transmitter being on johnny may be in trouble we will get the police on this murder doc savage said the bronze man walked on out of the alley he reached the sidewalk looked up and down the street and saw a uniformed policeman two blocks distant he walked toward the cop renny monk and the pig habeas corpus came out of the alley and followed him they were a remarkable procession every one on the street stopped to stare doc reached the policeman the other was very absorbed in examining a dark cutaway coat which he turned curiously in his hands the tailoring of the garment was exquisite monk goggled at the coat thats hams he barked chapter the secret in the river the policeman started when be heard monks strangled croak at his elbow he looked at them blankly then he gave another start and saluted smartly he had recognized doc savage doc savage had often served as a consulting expert for the police department the present radio system was his design as was the teletype hookup between the various stations as a gesture of appreciation for that and other services he had been given a high honorary commission on the police force and every policeman was given a look at the bronze mans picture and received orders to render doc every cooperation where did you get the coat doc asked the patrolman twas thrown out of a car replied the officer some one told me about it and i just went out and picked it up description of the car doc queried sedan said the cop black thats all i know about it doc took the coat gave it a closer glance and said it is certainly hams he brought letters out of the inside pocket these are addressed to ham pockets have not been disturbed renny grumbled i dont get this without saying anything doc savage walked on down the street on the third block they found hams natty gray waistcoat some one had evidently found it in the street and laid it on top of a parked car where they found it they went on down the street they found a shoe two socks a shirt a stray dog was playing with the shirt some blocks farther on a street sweeper was wheeling his can down a side street it was doc savage who thought of looking into the can they found hams pants there a billfold containing two hundred and sixtythree dollars was in the pants the street cleaner nearly fell over when he saw that he had not searched them because the pants were soiled having been run over by several cars they found no more garments doc savage carried the clothing back to the spot where he had left his car near hams club there was a crowd and much excitement over on the side street the body of the murdered building superintendent had been found newspaper reporters were already trying vainly to get into the exclusive club if one did manage to get in he would probably be the first of his kind ever to enter the place on the corner a newsboy unfazed by the excitement was crying a headline stating that no trace had been found of the mysterious freebooting vikings who had stolen a yacht the words of the noisy newsboy seemed to remind renny of something that radio of johnnys he rumbled i hope it turns out johnny aint in trouble doc savage was in his car he pulled special blinds there was even one over the windshield it became surprisingly dark in the ear doc savage got a boxshaped apparatus out of a door pocket and turned a switch on the side of the mechanism it was a portable ultraviolet lantern he began going over hams clothing he was using the same method employed by police in examining for secret inks ultraviolet light through a fluorescing phenomenon causes many substances ordinarily invisible to the human eye to glow coat waistcoat shirt shoes socks offered nothing of value nor did the first examination of the pants then doc turned the pockets inside out doc had been hunting one very definite thing all of his men carried tiny particles of a chemical compound a chalk for writing which left a mark entirely invisible to the unaided eye but which the ultraviolet light brought out ham had used his piece of chalk to write on the inside of a pants pocket the inside of a pocket is a poor writing surface they had great difficulty distinguishing the fines at all it certainly was not a written message monk scowled at it looks like be drawed a square kinda catawampus and put a letter v on its side after that he said ld think he had started to write something beginning with oc only the v is laying on the wrong side with the point away from the kinda squashedout square doc savage suddenly started the car he raised the curtains monk climbing in hastily gulped where we going after ham doc said you mean them funny marks gave you an idea of where be is monk countered hauling habeas corpus into the car by an ear an idea doc agreed the car gathered speed the newsboy at the corner yelling about the viking freebooters and the yacht craned his neck recognized doc savage probably from some newspaper picture he had seen and waved at them their car skidded a little on the corner and the conductor of a street car dropped a handful of nickels when they shaved his conveyance monk settled back holding his pig by an ear and even managed a faint grin he liked these hairraising rides with doc savage he remembered some of the past ones quite distinctly i dont see where a lopsided square and a letter v lying on its side tells you anything doc he said doc savage touched a button a regulation police siren began wailing under the hood and for blocks ahead policemen started halting traffic the lopsided square as you call it was meant to depict a diamond unless i am mistaken doc said yeah monk blinked it did at that what about the v on its side meant to indicate the word point doc suggested pointpoint monk muttered i dont get it diamond point doc savage told him it is north of the city a short distance the car hit a raised street railway crossing was thrown up and seemed to travel half a block before it was on the ground again monk recovered his hat and his pig you think ham got a chance to get a finger into his pockets or maybe a hand and drew that design right quick the homely chemist said yep ham is smart enough to think of something like that first time i heard you admit ham had anything on the ball renny boomed that overdressed little shyster monk began belligerently then colored and sighed i hope hes all right if hes gotta die i want the pleasure of killin him youd be lost without him renny said they swept under an elevated the motors roar was like the sound of a train for doc had opened the muffler cutouts steel elevated pillars went past like pickets they slid a hundred feet with all four wheels locked and got their speed down enough to take a corner monk grinned it was uncanny the way doc handled the machine renny noting the grin spoke with a sober face saying want me to drive doc monk blanched you drive he promised and i walk a motorcycle policeman out of courtesy tried to fall in ahead of them to clear the way but his speed was inadequate and he fell behind diamond point was really not a point but a ridge of rocky rough land along the hudson river just why it had ever been called diamond point no one probably knew because it did not bear the remotest resemblance to the shape of a diamond and there was certainly nothing valuable about its appearance being too rocky for agricultural value the region had been permitted to grow up in scrub brush and stunted trees no doubt due to the extreme number and steepness of the hills the state had never found it profitable to build a paved road into the region and this lack of thoroughfare although there was a rutted dirt road of sorts added to the remote nature and inaccessibility of the spot the single road which did penetrate the vicinity was rough to an extreme it was also very muddy this despite the fact that in new york city the streets had been dry and the skies rather pleasantly clear it had rained the night before and the roads had not yet dried out despite the strong wind blowing pools of dirty water stood in the ruts renny rode the running board and used a big handkerchief steadily keeping mud wiped off the wind shield the mud had proved too much for the mechanical wiper monk hung to the edge of the window tightly to combat the bouncing of the car over a somewhat more than ordinary number of rocks the wind made whinings around the open window road aint used much monk gasped but theres been cars along since the rain within the last hour doc told him huh the water in the ruts is very muddy doc pointed out that means recent passage of a car has stirred it up monk nodded drew out his machinegun pistol and scrutinized the drum to make sure it was ready to feed cartridges properly the bullets in the drum looked vicious but they were actually mercy slugs shells filled with a chemical which produced senselessness without hardly breaking the skin of a victim doc savage cut the mufflers in and the big motor became surprisingly silent after which doc savage turned on a radio receiver which was almost unnoticeable under the dash it was an shortwave outfit he adjusted the dials johnnys faraway transmitter was still sending its hissing carrier wave steadily im gettin more and more worried about johnny monk grumbled i got sort of a feeling in my bones their car topped a ridge abruptly and before them through scrubby trees they could see the blue and cream of water which the wind was lashing into a foam the hudson river renny said the road angled over to the river descending the while until it was very near the water unexpectedly car tracks turned off doc stopped his machine got out followed the tracks they led directly to the water which was a lather of waves holy cow renny rumbled the car was a black sedan and it stood running board deep in the river all the doors were open doc savage advanced and looked inside the waves whipped his ankles the interior of the sedan was splattered with red moist droplets doc savage stood back his gaze absently swept the river and he suddenly began stripping off his outer clothing hey monk exploded whats the idea doc savage waved a hand at the surface of the river see anything monk squinted no nothing but a heck of a lot of waves renny got binoculars and swept the river with them i see it looks like an oil patch doc savage clad only in shorts entered the water he did not seem to exert himself unduly hut his speed through the water was amazing out where the oil was a multicolored film on the river he dived he was down an incredible length of time then he came up and swam back at times the river waves hid him that yacht seized by the vikings he said is lying out there it has been scuttled monk and renny exchanged startled glances then both eyed doc savage sure theres no mistake it is the sea scream doc said the masts had been chopped off before she was scuttled and she is not far beneath the surface i felt out the raised lettering of the name on the wheelhouse monk indicated the abandoned car but what does this mean wheres ham whatd they drive it in the water for doc savage scrutinized the bottom about the car closely the water was clear enough for that he found enough marks to tell him what had happened they loaded into a boat he said no doubt they drove the car into the river so there would be no tracks the bronze man now shifted his attention to the car itself especially the rear where the spots of blood were he used the small ultraviolet lantern which he had employed on hams clothing renny and monk spread their coats to darken the car interior it was not necessary to have absolute gloom for efficient working of the ultraviolet lantern due to the power of the little instrument but murkiness helped on the floorboards the black light brought out words written with the strange secret chalk carleth a l blast it monk complained another darn puzzle hey doc what the dickens the bronze man was running back toward their car monk and renny followed him doc had the motor running when they got to the machine he began turning around a l carleth said monk whos he it is not a l carleth doc corrected it is carleth air lines youve heard of them heck yes monk said the car picked up speed renny leaned out and began wiping fresh splatters of mud off the wind shield during the period when aviation took an unprecedented boom almost every american town of more than village proportions found itself with from one to half a dozen airports most of these unfortunately proved to be mushroom projects started by gentlemen who had more than one rattletrap plane and sometimes not that collapse of the aviation boom in its wilder aspects saw a high mortality rate among such aviation projects until in most cases it was only the sturdy organized air lines with mail contracts that survived carleth air lines was an exception it had no air mail contracts it did not even fly passengers over a regular route yet it survived the carleth air lines flying field was situated well out of new york city and it was marked by a rotating beacon just as were the commercial airports we do an awful lot of flying monk said when they came in sight of the beacon plainly visible some miles away because it was now past sundown and becoming rather dark yet weve no more than barely heard of this carleth air lines or at least i havent thats funny doc savage switched off the headlights they were on pavement and renny had long since gotten most of the mud off the wind shield that may be because the concern is owned by thorpe carleth doc said how do you figure that monk asked the car engine did not make much noise now and off to the side they distinctly heard the moan of a steamboat whistle the craft was on the hudson which ran parallel to the road not far distant the carleth air lines seems to be a rich mans plaything doc savage explained thorpe carleth is a wealthy man or has the name of being one his air line is not really an air line at all but consists merely of a flying field some hangars and several planes he formerly made a specialty of giving flying instruction to young society bloods uhhuh said monk i remember now he sponsored one of them attempts to fly nonstop from california to rome italy last summer it flivvered out and they lost their plane a ship that must have cost a quarter of a million the car headlights seemed to be becoming brighter but that was only because the night was growing darker there were sudsy clouds overhead racing with the wind the wind was blowing with the ear so that it was not particularly noticeable except that shrubbery along the road was bobbing and writhing and jumping they reached a gravel drive which must lead to the airport doc went on a short distance and stopped the car he had to lock the brake to keep the wind from carrying the machine along it was blowing a great deal harder since sunset doc savage switched off the car headlights then punched various switches on the instrument dial a procedure which as far as the naked eye could tell caused nothing to happen out of a locker beneath the seats doc produced devices which fitted the face in the fashion of goggles but had lenses more nearly the size and shape of condensed milk cans the lenses were connected by wires and conductors ran to a tiny battery box which could be carried in a pocket viewed through the goggles the nightwrapped world underwent a peculiar change ahead of the car there was light a peculiar hard light which showed things in a colorless black and white like a photographic print the distance values were somewhat unnatural too it was as if one were looking at the world through two long black tubes to the end of which developed camera negatives were affixed there was a projector of infrared light on the front of the car it might have been mistaken for a black siren of large size these goggles were far more intricate than they seemed being electromechanical devices which rendered light that was ordinarily invisible effective upon the optical nerves doc savage delved into the baggage compartment at the rear of the car and brought out a portable projector of the infrared light monk shouldered the thing it was larger than a suitcase and by no means featherweight take it easy doc savage directed the apparatus is delicate he closed the car carefully after working under the dash they swung wide to approach the airport from the side this swing carried them down near the edge of the river monk roving the infrared beam said a boat tied to a wharf down there doc savage and the other two clambered down to the boat it was a fast expensive little craft about eighteen feet long of the type sometimes used as tenders on more expensive yachts it was black and shiny doc savage scratched the paint it rolled and scooped off under his nails paint is green he said it has been put on within the last two days the bronze man used a pocketknife at the bow and the stern scraping off the new paint he uncovered an original name which had been painted over it read sea scream tender off the yacht the vikings grabbed the boat that is lying scuttled back up the river there monk muttered doc savage lifted the hood over the powerful motor and put a bronze hand on the cylinders they were warm very warm come on he said and moved toward the airport it was a grotesque world through which they moved this one lighted by the infrared beam it was as if they were part of a pale motion picture a picture filtered through off focus lenses or through a heavy cheesecloth for the infrared light did not by any means furnish an illumination that could compete with the sun strangely enough the beacon a bright light when viewed with the naked eye was hardly discernible through the filtering goggles but there were two hangars rather sturdylooking structures of stucco it abruptly became apparent that the flying field might be considered only a back yard to a house that was rather a surprising structure the mansion might have been lifted out of the north africa desert country there was a wall of stucco fitted with little imitation embrasures and turrets and inside that a rambling flatroofed house of the same material that where carleth lives monk breathed it would seem likely doc replied lowvoiced this is my first time here you know they listened the wind whooped moaned slapped their clothing against their limbs the shrubbery and there was a good deal of it about threshed and fluttered an army could have been marching near and they might not have heard monk muttered if this wind gets any stronger its gonna blow the clothes right off our backs doc savage said wait here you two the bronze man reached over and switched off the infrared light projector which monk carried darkness which followed was abysmal he took off the filter goggles it was almost as dark but above occasional stars peeped from between madly racing clouds doc savage advanced toward the house silence was not difficult a man would have had to run for his footsteps to be heard there was a lighted window in the house it had not been visible before the filter goggles cut out ordinary light somewhere near a branch broke out of a tree and the wind ran it like a flailing monster through the treetops then monks voice bawled out in one of his earsplitting combat howls doc he squalled hells broke loose chapter wind and terror doc savage spun put out both hands before him and lunged back toward the spot where he had left his two aides monk was still howling renny was roaring something which rage and frantic movements made inarticulate one of them cut loose with a machinegun pistol its bullfiddle moan was terrific even above the howl of the wind but there was no muzzle flame carefully designed flame digesters fitted to the ends of the barrels took care of that doc hit a tree even his scientifically trained eyes could not penetrate the darkness strength in his mighty arms cushioned the collision and he veered to the left he was close to monk and renny now then his feet hit something it felt like something alive it jerked he went down something struck at him twice three times he could bear the ugly thuds the jarring of the earth he rolled to one side there was a hiss up from the earth came a stream of something that resembled pale liquid fire it splattered over him it felt wet and it continued glowing the bronze man charged the spot from which the weird luminance had come his kicking his threshing of arms encountered nothing there seemed to be sounds all about but it might have been the wind he did not stop to listen for the glowing stuff that had drenched him marked his giant figure with a pale luminance he ran toward his two aides hauling out a flashlight he came upon them they were grotesque dancing satans of pale flame like doc they had been drenched by the glowing stuff whatever it was doc got his flashlight on he fanned the beam everywhere shrubbery danced shook but that was the wind other than his two men there was no living being in sight doc shifted the light back to monk and renny when the electric beam was upon them they ceased to glow the fluid which had splattered them was a bluishgray substance something like pale but thick skim milk both wore expressions of men who had just met ghosts monk had a gash over one ear coat sleeve shirt and some flesh was torn from rennys right arm monk tried to talk made only gargling noises in his excitement swallowed and tried again there was somethin here he gulped whered it go renny was holding his machine pistol in his left hand he waved it holy cow he boomed i threw bullets around here like water out of a hose sure thought id hit it it doc said wasnt it a man or men monk scratched his nubbin of a head looked foolish and said i wouldnt bet too much on that what do you mean doc demanded we began hearing noises like things hitting the ground bard monk said then this flaming stuff phosphorescent juice of some kind i think it is got spouted on us it seemed to come right up out of the ground renny turned loose his machinegun pistol then you came turn your flashlights on doc directed they complied doc savage turned his flash beam on the ground he held it there some moments then he lifted the beam to the faces of monk and renny their hair was not exactly standing on end but that was only because nature did not equip the human scalp to perform that phenomenon successfully there were indentations in the ground perhaps sixteen inches long wider than a human foot at one end and tapering they were deepest at the wide end the hairraising part though was the gashes edging the marks gashes which might have been made by enormous razorsharp claws monk said hoarsely im doggonned if i get this at all doc savage went ahead and studied the spot where he had been attacked there where he had heard the ugly blows hit the ground he found more of the weird horrible indentations he was bending over them when monk and renny looking as if they wanted company joined him renny began in the same voice a man might use to talk to himself when going through a graveyard monk and me dont know exactly what to make of this he choked off holy cow he howled look at that that was a ghostly thing of phosphorescence that danced like a willothewisp through the trees ahead it was small rather shapeless it poised as if it knew it had been discovered im gonna get that thing whatever it is monk yelled and was off like a shot doc and renny followed him monk had the awkward appearance of a bull ape but he could run doc gained renny who could do a hundred in close to ten seconds fell behind the glowing willothewisp spot was in flight now it traveled with giddy speed often lost in the shrubbery it seemed to be making toward the hangars it was it rounded the hangars monk and doc savage rounded the first hangar structure side by side they stopped the glowing spot was gone im gonna find that thing monk gritted bet itll explain that mystery attack back there the homely chemist yanked at the sliding hangar door it was unlocked and caved open monk dashed his flashlight aside he stared for some seconds held almost breathless by what he saw it was a plane an ultramodern job of chromium and stainless steel and masterly streamlining there were two enormous motors and streamlined bulks virtually a part of the cabin the ship was almost a perfect flying wing boy monk breathed a guy could go places in that bet its almost as fast as that new speed job of yours doc notice the shape of the hull for landing on water or snow and how the landing gear cranks down we were hunting something doc put in obviously it did not go rennys great roaring voice reached their ears ive got it i got it they whipped out of the hangar and around to the other side they saw renny before their lights bore upon him renny with the phosphorescence smearing him was a gargoyle of greenish flame struggling with a smaller gargoyle they got their lights on the object which renny had captured it was the pig habeas corpus who had been smeared with the phosphorescent juice renny made disgusted noises and released his captive which he must have surprised by rounding the other side of the hangar im beginning to string with hams ideas renny grumbled that hog aint good for nothing but breakfast bacon monk squinted at habeas the pig had a gashed flank so you run into the big mystery too habeas monk grunted habeas the pig looked as if he did not care greatly for the whole procedure doc savage said we have made enough noise to arouse this end of the county in spite of the wind we might as well walk right up to the house the moorish castle of a house was some hundreds of feet distant its presence marked by the one lighted window and the fleeting ghostly luminance cast on its walls by the distant rotating airport beacon the three men kept close together from time to time they used the infrared light projector which had not been smashed in the excitement but neither with that nor their unaided eyes did they see anything out of the way when using the infrared light they turned their flashlights off and the pig habeas seeing their glowing forms in the darkness emitted a series of disapproving grunts and drew away thats why he ran from us monk decided saw this shining stuff on us and decided we were spooks or somethin well renny began i cant for my life figure it sounded like overdry sticks breaking many of them breaking in measure staccato procession the sounds had an uneven loudness but that was due to the wind gun renny boomed sounded like an automatic pistol from the house doc savage said and they ran forward the wind was screaming now leaves carried by the gale smacked their faces occasionally there were small branches they reached the wall and a gate of metal openwork the wind made low awful whinings around the gate doc savage tried it it was latched but not locked doc unlatched it and the wind tore it open with a rush and a bang they went through holy cow renny muttered look the wall inside the gate was pocked where bullets had hit there were a few smashed bullets on the walk they kept the flashlights on and walked toward the house the wind did not blow straight inside the wall but in little spiral tornadoes the air was full of dust leaves twigs the house door was under a little balcony doc savage went to it while the other two stood back their machinegun pistols alert doc banged on the door it opened before you come in gentlemen said a voice from inside the house i must warn you that at present it does not seem likely you will ever leave the place alive doc savage turned his flashlight on the speaker the man was five feet five rotund and pink he wore plush knee breeches long stockings shoes with buckles of silver or an imitation that looked like silver one sleeve of his brocaded tail coat was split from shoulder to wrist his tie and stock were askew his hair was down over his blue eyes i suppose you heard us shooting sir he said i dare say the master will be delighted sir we have been trying to get attention for two days doc savage asked who are you peabody sir said the man mister carleths manservant if you think its safe you might come inside gentlemen without moving doc queried and why should it be dangerous peabody the manservant bowed in the slightly stiff manner common to fat men it might be more fitting for the master to say sir he murmured shall i take you to him doc nodded peabody turned led the way to a stairs and upward doc savage was close on his heels monk and renny dragged a little farther back keep your glims open monk breathed to renny i dont like this screwy setup at the top of the stairs there was a trapdoor framing darkness and the banshee moan of wind peabody put his head out and asked the darkness have you see anything more sir no said a shrill nervous voice i admitted the gentlemen sir said peabody who are they asked the voice they have not told me sir damn it you should not have let them in until you knew who they were snapped the voice wait a minute a man appeared on the roof his hair was long white and flying like a rag from his head his face was younger than his hair and his lean brown body looked sturdy enough he wore pajamas a dressing gown carpet slippers and he carried a gauge pumpgun peabody introduced him the master thorpe carleth he said thorpe carleth looked intently at doc savage a pair of rimless spectacles dangled from carleths dressing gown by a ribbon he absently put the glasses on his nose they fell off the nose clip seemed to be broken it seems i should know you he murmured monk said this is doc savage ohhh carleth said without particular excitement the gentleman who is reputedly the worlds eighth wonder monk scowled at that thinking it a flippancy carleth saw when he had balanced the glasses on his nose and apologized hastily dont mind me he said im rattled im liable to say anything you see i am not accustomed to being held a prisoner in my own house by an infernal hoodoo hoodoo monk frowned carleth murmured how else can you describe a blasted thing you havent seen and which throws the queerest sort of knives and spears at you old viking knives and spears monk exploded im sure i dont know about that said carleth carleth descended the steps walked into another room and waved at an array of crude heavy knives and short vicious spears which reposed on a table doc savage glanced at them viking weapons all right he said carleth asked may i inquire what brought you here search for a friend of general theodore marley brooks doc replied he was carried off rather mysteriously carleths glasses fell off and he replaced them i say did the captors of this fellow ham throw bally knives and spears and things without ever being seen he asked monk looked at him closely growled so youve been up against em too oh rather carleth looked at peabody havent we peabody it has been very unpleasant sir peabody said correctly carleths glasses fell and he let them hang first they took one of my two new planes at least somebody took it he said we heard the motor as it left the hangar and we naturally ran out that was at night we were set upon in the darkness we had quite a tussle and got some kind of glowing stuff on us somehow we ah funked it and ran back into the house never did know exactly what we were fighting dare say you dont believe me that aint hard to believe monk muttered we went through about the same thing carleth fingered his glasses the deuced telephone wire was cut he said we could not call for help i heard my plane leave and after that i went out but the moment my nose was past the door a blasted knife hit right beside me here ill show you the mark he led them to the front door stuck his head out gingerly as if he considered himself to be running something of a risk and pointed at a deep gash in the door jamb well weve been here two days afraid to leave carleth said a few times ive shot at things i guess they were shadows or my imagination last time was a while ago i know what the last one was the infernal wind had blown a paper onto a bush carleth was facing the door watch it doc savage ripped suddenly and shoved him the two of them landed heavily on the floor to one side monk renny had their flashlights on they doused the beams instinctively not wanting to be targets forgetting they were covered with the phosphorescent substance plunk it was something hitting the rear of the hallway monk turned his flash on the sound one of the heavy viking knives was sticking in the wall still humming from the force with which it had struck that was thrown from outside monk bawled he lunged to one side yanked down a thick velvet drapery and enveloped himself in it he resembled an arab in a dark burnoose as he charged out through the door flashlight in one hand machinegun pistol in the other renny followed after monk roaring irately peabody the manservant bounced up and down as if he did not know what to do then followed the others better watch yourself doc savage told carleth the bronze man then followed monks example in enveloping himself in a drapery and eased out into the darkness strangely enough doc savage did not head for where monk renny and peabody were threshing about searching the shrubbery inside the wall the bronze man eased along the wall until he was at the rear of the house he tried windows as he went all were locked doc drew a hank of silken cord from his clothing to the end of this was affixed a folding grapple he tossed it up snared the roof edge there was a wall around the roof after the moorish fashion and he climbed he made no sound that could have been heard above the wind he was banking on there being more than one trapdoor to the roof there was he got it open it was not locked and descended from the odors he was in the kitchen regions he used his flashlight it showed only the conventional things he found stairs descended them into a basement it was large divided into rooms he explored these the second chamber he entered had something that interested him greatly he walked around and around the thing several times using his flashlight it was a radio outfit transmitter and received for both short and long wave length it was not a portable set and it was very powerful extinguishing his flashlight abruptly doc listened he had heard something not the wind or the searchers it was inside near the door he moved over there put a hand against the door very lightly the panel was opening doc set himself the door opened wider and he let it swing and when it was far ajar and he could hear the vague efforts of some one who was excited but trying to breathe without noise the bronze man stepped forward his movements were uncannily quiet he got a throat between his fingers squeezing it he shut off all outcry and when he was sure he had the captive secure he ran fingers over a face exploring the features in the intense darkness there might be others and he did not want to use his light doc continued to examine the face with his sensitive finger tips he was good at that a relic of the weeks he had once spent m a school for the blind eyes bandaged except for daily exercise periods ah he said finally and his voice was filled with surprise the victim seemed to be trying to speak doc slackened his grip a little a small shrill whisper came from the captives lips let me the whisper said tell you something it was strange that whisper it might have been a man or a woman chapter phantom enemy carleth peabody renny and monk were in the hallway when doc savage joined them the bronze man came in from the outdoors having gone out by the roof trapdoor and dropped to the earth find anything he asked and his manner was entirely casual not a blamed thing said monk this is givin me the willies i even had habeas snoop and hes as good as a bloodhound he didnt find anything the pig never even acted queer like he did in monks penthouse renny added booming carleth perched his glasses on his nose and held his head back so that they would stay there now you begin to understand what i am up against he said nervously we seem to be hounded by a phantom enemy we might search the house doc savage said of course carleth agreed readily they found nothing and eventually they came to the radio room doc savage glanced at the apparatus and seemed surprised why did you not use this to summon help he asked i know nothing of radio carleth said but peabody here is an operator picked it up in the war you know the apparatus has been out of order peabody said without changing a face muscle something burned out i do not know how it happened i installed the deuced radio a long time ago when i had visions of starting a regular air line you know said carleth they continued their search of the house poking into closets coal bins chests they tried window after window and found them all locked on the inside we were very careful about that said carleth indeed we were peabody agreed in the manner of a perfect servant they completed their search and there was nothing amiss they wound up in the hallway again where monk walked over to the knife that was sticking in the wall monk pulled the knife out he looked at it and amazement rushed over his homely features doc he gulped this knife doc savage made a small gesture admonishing silence monk swallowed the rest of his bewildered exclamation and made sure neither carleth or peabody had noticed then at the first opportunity he cornered doc alone that knife he muttered what about it doc asked its the same one that was thrown at you in your office monk grunted im dead sure because its got some of that finger print vapor coloring on it you know the same stuff you said you used on it it is the same knife doc told him i was carrying it around with me monk choked then you threw it myself doc admitted but why to start some excitement and give me an opportunity to look around without any one knowing doc replied blazes monk breathed whatd you find doc savage seemed not to hear that peabody the manservant came up to them and murmured politely the master has a suggestion cant he talk himself growled monk who was disappointed because he had not gotten the information he hoped for out of doc carleth smiling wryly approached and said i should like to visit my hangars and see if they damaged my other new plane you see i have only two ships of any value and i must confess they represent the investment of my last cent in the world if you gentlemen had the idea i am wealthy you were mistaken you are looking at a gentleman who should like very much to make a few dollars they left the house carleth produced strong electric hand lanterns and they carried these when they reached the hangars he turned on the field floodlights and thereafter there was light aplenty with more than average anxiety apparent in his manner carleth went over the big speed plane which doc and the others had seen earlier monk stood back and admired the remarkable plane again some job he breathed some job carleth stood back i bought the two of them for a roundtheworld record attempt he said yes they are unusual ships they cost almost two hundred thousand apiece he tried to make his spectacles stick failed and held them on his nose with one hand i do wish i knew whether the other ship went he said grimly it was not insured upon finding it depends my immediate financial future in fact if i do not get it back i am ruined carleth paced about nervously eventually wandering into the office which adjoined one end of the hangar the instant he was in there he stared at the large map cases arrayed along one wall one of the cases was open dratted queer he said and went to the open case he riffled through the charts within for some moments i say he exploded in a surprised voice doc came over what is it ordinarily i do a business of renting out ships for long dangerous flights which the regular air lines and barnstorming pilots will not attempt carleth explained for that reason i have complete charts for most of north america the men who took the plane seem to have made off with some of my charts as well what charts doc queried those covering a line drawn generally from here to greenland carleth elaborated renny blinked rumbled that radio of johnnys carleth looking very interested demanded would you mind telling me why you seem so surprised renny eyed doc any objection none doc told him renny told about the radio transmitter of johnnys which was in such mysterious continual operation without any actual transmitting being done he told what the direction finder had revealed about the whereabouts of the transmitter very puzzling carleth murmured but it hooks up the stolen charts cover the same direction from which the transmitter wave is coming theres a connection renny agreed and knocked his big hard fists together peabody advanced and said something to carleth in a voice so low that none of the others caught it peabody used a tiny whisper anyway the wind outside was making cyclone noises the hangar squeaked moaned steadily doc savage was watching peabody intently as he spoke doc had first learned to read lips when he was very young peabody has an excellent suggestion carleth murmured it is his thought that we might join forces you are interested in finding your colleague johnny i am interested very interested in recovering my stolen plane so may i offer you use of my other ship here in pursuing your enemies more correctly i should say our joint enemies it was earnestly put convincing monk and renny glanced at doc savage plainly wondering what his reaction would be doc had a speed plane of his own but it was only a little faster than this amazing supership doc said you forget carleth that we have to find our man ham who is missing here in the vicinity of new york carleth nodded true may i offer you every assistance doc savage seemed to consider briefly will get in touch with you he advised carleth if he felt disappointment did not show it he was still holding his spectacles on his nose with one hand what do you suggest i do he asked call the police are you willing to stay in your house for a while doc asked carleth smiled wryly we managed for two days nothing seemed to menace us as long as we remained inside yes i will try it five minutes later doc savage monk renny and the pig habeas were headed for the spot where they had left the bronze mans car they had left carleth and his servant the perfectly mannered peabody in carleths stucco home monk grumbled if i didnt know enough about your ideas to be sure theyre better than any id have doc id make a suggestion what doc asked hang over that place back there like a cloud monk said got a hunch we might turn up something ham doc savage replied is not around there huh monk exploded youre sure positive renny emitted an astounded rumble then pointed a huge hand ill say hes not there look they had come close enough so that their flashlight beams had picked up their car ham was lying motionless beside it ham brigadier general theodore marley brooks was a noted lawyer but he was probably better known for something else his clothes he was the beau brummell of new york if not of the twentieth century he was a tailors dream tailors had been known to follow him down the street just to see clothes being worn as they should be hams garb just now would have been a disappointment however it consisted entirely of a gunnysack none too clean two holes had been torn in the bottom for hams legs and he filled the rest of the sack it was not a very large on snugly indeed there was a cut on his shoulder it was not serious and had long since stopped bleeding they stood over him he snored it was a very loud peaceful snore it had to be to arise above the gale monk frowned blackly and drew back a foot preparatory to kicking the snoring gunnysackclad ham in the ribs renny pushed the homely chemist off balance whats the idea ill teach im to lay down and go to sleep when were sweatin blood tryin to find im monk gurgled ill kick his innards all over that car wait doc savage said he was caught in a trap of mine huh said monk doc demonstrated an ingenious mechanical device which had completely escaped discovery by monk and renny in their previous use of the car when the switch hidden under the dash is thrown it completes a connection so that when the car doors are disturbed an odorless colorless gas is released from a container under the chassis doc explained the gas produces unconsciousness thinking that some one might visit the car while we were gone i turned it on monk looked ham over grinned widely and said i oughta kick his sides in anyway dont he look pretty ill that oat sack doc savage got a medical case from the car and went to work on the recumbent snoring ham ham should have an interesting story to tell said the bronze man bet he dont know a thing monk grunted hes the kind that wouldnt monk came near being right ham came out under the urging of a combined stimulant and nullifier for the affects of the anaesthetic gas which was harmless and a type doc savage frequently used dazed ham murmured what where dont tell him monk said sourly let him guess where he is ham said nothing more until he had full control of his faculties then he addressed monk clearly and with a great deal of feeling you bugfaced ape he said monk glowered in a manner which was in marked contrast to his earlier expressions of concern over hams welfare what happened to you doc savage asked ham start explanations with your apartment i heard a vase break ham said i turned toward the sound i did not see anything then something whacked me on the head i went down i was stunned but not out before i could see what had hit me a black cloth of some kind was thrown over my head and held there i fought it was funny ha ha said monk id like to have seen it ham said ill poison you some day and went on with his story by funny i mean it was strange ham continued during the fight i did not have the impression of battling human beings there were real things there all right but i dont know i was dazed i did get my hand on what felt like a knife and struck but the knife point stuck in the floor and i lost it then i was knocked out completely slammed entirely cuckoo cuckoo is right monk said unkindly but i think you got it earlier than that ham ignored him i came to being lowered from the window by a rope ham said at least i suppose it was the window anyway i was dragged across a cement pavement an alley it smelled like and dumped into a car men dragged you doc asked i dont know ham said earnestly it was a very bad dream but of course it must have been men of course leered monk or maybe it was little birds ham pretending not to hear continued in the car i heard a sound as if some one had come up and discovered what was going on i think i recognized the voice as belonging to the superintendent of my club building there was a horrible sound later as if did they kill him they did doc said soberly he was a decent fellow ham said gently they were all silent monk was first to speak and he left the quarrelsomeness out of his voice now the chalk message we found in your trousers oh yes ham said i got a hand in my pocket after they began yanking my clothing off there was a man driving the car i am sure of that i heard him say something about diamond point so there must have been another man too i managed to leave the message in my pocket then they knocked me out again they must have thought i was fishing in the pocket for a weapon and what else doc asked oh they kept knocking me over the head when i woke up ham said it was very tough to keep them from knowing when i was reviving in fact i did not do it did you ever see a man regain his senses without some subconscious stirring about you got a chance to write on the floorboards doc pointed out yes ham admitted i caught something about the carleth air lines i got that on the floorboards had the chalk for that invisible writing in my hair stuff is a little sticky you know you can put it in your hair and itll stay there continue monk suggested the next thing i knew i was fifty feet or so from this car ham said i had regained my senses i was in this this gunnysack it becomes you monk told him ham glared said thats all i know and before i do anything about it im going to get some clothes monk seemed to think of something that made him chuckle ham glowered now what i just thought monk said of what a picture youll make going into your club in that gunnysack doc got the car headed toward new york doc did not drive as rapidly as he had coming out by a good deal especially was he careful on the hills which were exposed to the full force of the wind at one point there was a tree down across the road but their machine crashed around it although afterward renny got out and disengaged a branch from the underside of the chassis now that weve got ham were heading north to see whats wrong with johnny monk asked we are doc savage agreed but what about all of this mysterious business the viking freebooters and the viking weapons and the mysterious attackers and the rest of it monk queried johnnys safety comes above all of it doc replied after a time when they headed into metropolitan new york monk knew by the route that doc savage was driving that the bronze man was heading for the airplane hangar which he maintained disguised as a huge warehouse on the hudson river water front the wind seemed to be getting worse women walked bent over holding skirts below their knees men held their hats or carried them under their arms paper leaves trash was all over the streets they passed a big sign which had blown down farther on workmen were boarding up a glass window which had collapsed merry old springtime renny rumbled gloomily its things like this that makes sailors quit the sea monk grinned ham started pointed ahead look isnt that a fire four blocks more and they saw it was a fire they were on the elevated speedway along the hudson doc savage drove more rapidly it was a big fire the wind snapped off pieces of flame and carried it hundreds of feet the blaze flickered red against the clouds there was a fire apparatus a crowd policemen excitement renny reared up abruptly to get a closer look holy cow he boomed the burning structure was doc savages warehouse hangar they found a policeman who told them in two sentences all that they learned even by questioning all others who had seen the thing start a guy backed a truck loaded with oil drums and probably a few cases of dynamite up against the place then got out and ran said the cop pretty soon the truck went flooey doc savage and his aides were very busy during the next hour there was much to be done there was valuable equipment other than planes stored in the great building a submarine of a new and amazing type upon which doc savage was experimenting and adjacent to that a small dirigible which the bronze man had developed to a point where it could make stratosphere flights they saved the dirigible the submarine and some other stuff the fire did not even get through the partitions to them police lines and the wind kept the crowd back not one of doc savages planes survived the fire the hangar wall had been blown in on them accompanied by a flood of flaming gasoline it had been gasoline in the barrels on the truck dont nobody need to tell me what was behind this monk growled when they finally got a breathing spell somebody dont want us to go hunting johnny simple reasoning renny agreed what other kind of reasoning could you expect from monk ham asked ham was feeling more chipper he had borrowed a long rubber coat from a fireman but not before he had provoked much astonishment and mirth by tearing about clad only in a gunnysack im going to get some clothes from the club ham said in a determined voice i cant understand why they threw my other garments away after they seized me whoever or whatever your captors were they must have heard of the gadgets doc and ourselves use renny reminded him they were afraid you would have some of the things in your clothing getting rid of the garments was easier than searching you ham said well im off to get some decent clothes on you have a cold country outfit have you not doc asked brand new ham admitted made by the best fur house in the city no crude eskimo work on them better bring them doc said monk renny better get your own too you have them havent you sure monk grunted i got some left from that last dizzy trip we took up there that time we found that fantastic place underground renny queried abruptly just how are we going up there doc the fastest way the bronze man told him by plane well install a radio compass and run down johnnys transmitter weve got to get to it before the batteries give out too and where will we get a suitable plane renny demanded a trip like that will take more than an ordinary ship we are going to accept thorpe carleths kind offer of cooperation doc savage said chapter terror in the north it was cold over that part of canada lying to the south and west of greenland most of the inhabited world called this season spring but there it was bitter the thermometer on the strut outside the window of the plane read fortyeight below zero no doubt it was a little warmer down below darned cold snap even for up here monk grumbled the homely chemist was mixing chemicals he was concocting a bitter mixture to put on the small overall jacket of fur which he had fashioned for the pig habeas his purpose being to discourage habeass inclination to chew the legs off the garment thorpe carleth had been studying the rugged terrain below with binoculars he shuddered put the binoculars down he fished out his spectacles and sat them on his nose he had not gotten the nose clip repaired and had to keep his head tilted back to balance the spectacles in place i hate to think of what would happen to my ship if they had a forced landing down there he murmured you know im rather out of luck if i find theyve crashed the bus somewhere renny rumbled what were interested in is what happened to johnny peabody the perfect manservant sat in the rear taking no part in the conversation ham watched peabody from time to time with something bordering on admiration it had long been hams ambition to acquire for himself a manservant who left nothing to be desired in peabody ham believed be saw the fulfillment of all his dreams earlier in the long flight from new york ham had spoken with peabody and discovered that the efficient peabody knew his business peabody was the sort of a valet who would be horrified at wearing a black bow tie with full dress the black bow being reserved for tux ham was half inclined to entice peabody from his master by offering a larger salary doc savage had spoken little for a long time the bronze man was at the rear working over a sensitive radio direction finder he had arranged the loop so that it was outside the plane they were heading straight for johnnys radio transmitter they had been heading straight for it for a long time the hissing still emanated from the loudspeaker monk came back and listened to the hissing blazes he muttered you got the volume control cut down it is on more than it was doc said then the signal is getting weaker monk muttered the batteries on the transmitter are running down doc savage nodded change the course to northwest a half west doc savage directed renny was piloting surprise came over his long puritanicallookmg face but he made the course shift after which they were flying almost at right angles to their previous route doc savage offered no explanation they held that course for something near fortyfive minutes doc savage worked over the radio compass the while the most effective method was to get the signal to the weakest point on the rotation loop dial and read the bearing at right angles to that but this was no longer possible only when the loop was directly upon the signal could it be picked up at all doc savage read the bearing carefully then turned to the sextant leaned out of a window and hurriedly took a sight for position he worked the sight spotted it on the chart and drew a line with protractor in the direction indicated by the bearing monk saw then what the bronze man had done in changing course he had gotten two bearing lines on johnnys transmitter where they crossed would be the approximate of the transmitter doc put the plane back toward the weak radio signal twenty minutes later the signal was not audible at all the transmitter batteries had given out entirely boy its lucky you got that cross bearing monk grunted in three hours and twenty minutes we should pick up the transmitter doc savage said after calculations the three hours and twenty minutes passed without incident the chart was of little use to them now this was a british admiralty chart and it bore only surveys actually made these were surprisingly few they gave an idea of the character of the coastline not much more this country is pretty much unknown renny offered he frowned at the terrain below i wouldnt give thirty cents for all of it doc savage took over the controls the sky above was mottled ahead was a gray haze snow they reached the snow area soon it screamed against the propeller blades and driven against the fuselage sounded like sand from a blasting blower the bronze man sank the ship lower and lower there was unpleasantly little visibility long minutes passed weve gone over the spot he decided he turned back but instead of wasting time hunting climbed until he found the top of the clouds at fourteen thousand feet took an astronomical sight when he had worked out the position he put the plane down again less than two hundred feet above the snow he flattened out and began flying back and forth searching the other men used binoculars yet it was the bronze mans trained flakegold eyes which picked up first evidence of what they sought wrecked plane he said grimly and bent off in a sharp bank to the right the others saw the ship practically buried in the drifts adjacent to a forest of huge boulders it was only scattered bits johnnys ship doc announced from the looks of the thing it was blown up a moment later doc executed a landing in the snow carleth became pale during the landing peabody moistened his lips several times monk ham and renny showed no concern they knew from the past what doc could do with a plane the bronze man clambered out there was a foot or two of loose snow on the level a crust beneath and it was blowing but not hard they searched the wreckage of johnnys plane combed the immediate vicinity time after time they kicked through the drifts searching they found no trace of johnny the snow was cold and it squealed under their moosehide footgear as they moved about doc savage moved back into the clearing scrutinizing this level place in the wilderness of stone and snow he was drawn by what at first appeared to be a snowdrift of unusual formation he approached it the certainty grew that it was snow drifted over a human body johnny monk exploded in horror but it was not the gaunt geologist whom they were bunting it was the man johnny had found dying and who had been killed by kettler although doc and the others now had no way of knowing that doc brushed snow away from the stonily frozen cadaver the fact that the man had worn a heavy beard until a short time before his death stood out even more distinctly in his present condition thorpe carleth fished his glasses out of his parka held them on his nose and peered at the dead man i say he exploded i remember this chap doc savage watched carleth intently yes carleth glanced at the correct peabody am i right peabody isnt this a mechanic whom i employed about two years ago yes sir said peabody you discharged him for undue intoxication sir know anything more about him doc asked no said carleth i never did like the gentleman said peabody no reason for that sir doc savage announced we will look for some trace of johnny they spread out in a line each separated from the other by a few yards and began combing the vicinity they found enough traces to show them two planes had landed in the clearing johnnys and another they found where the other ship had taken off carleth measured the marks of the latter ship carefully then nodded vehemently this was my stolen ship he declared barring of course the presence of another ship with similar measurements which is not likely they came upon the stream frozen over but the gurgle of running water when an ear was placed close to the ice was audible doc savage located the frozen litter where a pit had been chopped in the thickcrusted ice snow had drifted over it he kicked the white flakes away a bit of cloth projected from the ice it was part of a garment the rest of which was frozen deep doc savage studied the cloth closely renny came up and stared with him holy cow renny yelled out thats johnnys woolen blouse that he always wore under his parka monk and renny raced back to the plane and returned with light axes they hacked furiously at the ice it was brittle came up in showers sharp fragments punished their faces the ice was clearer near the bottom renny broke out a chunk which broke clear so that be could see down into the ice he made out a shapeless blob of fur an elongated blob johnnys body he moaned a splitsecond later doc savage straightened he listened intently dropped his axe and raced toward their plane then the others heard what he had heard a plane motor it was in the distance but becoming louder in a way which showed it was headed toward them then its fainter sound was lost in the blasting whoop as doc got the engine of their own plane going hes leaving without us thorpe carleth screamed and raced madly for their plane he did not make it the engine was still warm and doc savage got the tail of the ship up snow climbed up in a great funnel around the plane the ship climbed a drift bounced climbed another did not settle knocked the top off a third mound of snow and was in the air carleth stood watching it wringing his hands apparently he found much in the prospect of being left behind on the snow to horrify him doc banked away the other ship appeared it was almost identical with the one doc was piloting my other ship carleth bowled a man leaned from the plane he had a rifle it began to lip flame theyre trying to kill us carleth shrieked and ran arms threshing the air as he fought the snow dive into a drift renny boomed cover yourself up with snow they cant pick you out from up there suiting action to his words renny shot into a drift headfirst such was his momentum that he buried himself completely in the soft flakes he stamped through the crust and got down deeper renny could hear noises in the snow which told him the others were doing the same thing the noise of the attacking plane went away the ship arched off obviously intending to conic back then the pilot discovered doc savages ship he twisted thin lips in a snarling grimace of confidence this is gonna be easy he gritted i cut my teeth on combat stuff back in the war doc savage if he felt apprehensions did not show them the other ship was loaded with men and guns the two planes were no doubt alike in speed maneuverability with the other possibly a shade slower because of its load doc slammed headon at the other craft its prop was big and they had no gun synchronized to shoot through it the propeller blades prevented them firing at him the bronze man dug into a metal duffel box which he had dragged forward before taking off it held extra machinegun pistols and some of the marked ammunition drums there was a sliding window over the pilots seat doc intended to fly under the other ship and try to get its propeller in passing but the other pilot was no tyro he nosed down almost against the snowsheathed earth because there was nothing else to do doc went over him the bronze mans plane trembled as a lead storm swept it a cockpit window acquired a round bullet hole back in the cabin equipment jumped about one box upset began to give out smoke and fumes that was monks tiny portable chemical laboratory which he always took with him lead must have broken some of the bottles doc arched around he began to cough violently his eyes ran he swayed all but fell out of the cockpit seat it was the chemical fumes overcoming him asphyxiation has a queer way with a man it upsets his mental balance causes him to do the unexpected and it enwraps him in a grisly lethargy of uncare for what happens such was the affect of the fumes from the broken chemical bottles doc fought it with a great mental effort probably the bullet hole in the window helped more than anything it let in screaming fresh air that pushed the fumes back doc struck the window with a fist knocking out the glass cutting his metallic knuckles a little he pumped air into his lungs and that cleared his head he was flying level the other plane pursued occasional bullets hit docs ship the bronze man held his breath heaved out of the cockpit ran back and wrenched open a window in the rear of the cabin the draft cleared out the fumes he tugged at the metal case from which the fumes came it was lashed down before doc could free it to throw it overboard the plane disturbed by his shifting weight was moaning toward a crash and be had to get to the controls not much vapor was coming from the box now anyway the bronze man was still groggy he put the plane into a climbing spiral sparring for time for a clearer head the other ship followed him up striving to rake him with lead always just failing and unable to climb quite as fast as docs bus the altimeter needle marched to eighteen thousand where the thermometer said it was fifty below and there they fought above the clouds jockeying diving zooming time was interminable they paid no attention to where they were carried for all of their thoughts were on saving their lives it was doc savage who triumphed and he did it by strategy getting in front of the other plane and fleeing then he clipped a certain special ammo drum in his machinegun pistol leaned out and fired steadily and long at the other ship doc was aiming at the motor and he was using bullets charged with the chemical which formed a vapor that drawn into a carburetor made the mixture noninflammable it had effect just as his drum ran empty and there were no more of the special bullets aboard the motor of the other ship stopped surprise caused the pilot to fall into a spin after he had stalled but he centered his controls and pulled out then went into a vertical dive and vanished with the speed of a dropping stone into the clouds doc followed them down he kept track of them in the clouds for a time but the clouds thickened he lost track of his quarry he hunted for a long time he floated down close to earth and arched back and forth seeking the other ship or the wreck of it if it had crashed in landing he saw numerous spots at which a good pilot could have landed he did not see the other ship renny and monk were excited when doc savage came back to them it was a glad excitement not caused entirely by his safe return johnny renny bawled his great roaring voice on full power what about him doc asked we dug out the hole in the ice renny whooped that thing we thought was his body wasnt it was his parka then johnny must be alive doc savage said grimly chapter the goldenhaired girl johnny was alive he did however hold more than a sneaking suspicion that he was going to freeze to death he shivered more violently than he would have believed possible and his teeth rattled like several dice receiving a hard shaking in a glass a stocky bulbnosed man looked at johnny and said my gosh you rattle all over dont you facetious asssertations are an infelicitous necessitarianism johnny remarked gloomily my gosh gasped the bulbnosed man does cold always bring words like that out of you johnny said nothing and devoted himself to a shiver of extraordinary violence after which he made a mental decision that the person who had advanced the theory that shivering helps keep one warm had either been perpetrating a joke or had been badly mistaken johnnys present garb consisted of redflannel underwear which he had prudently donned in new york and two blankets neither comfortably heavy this was no equipment with which to sit in a cave hollowed out of snow with the thermometer well below zero his wrists were tied with rope some moments ago johnny had heard a plane overhead previous to that the plane of his captors which had gone away for a time had returned in what seemed to be a great hurry and there had ensued some noise and excitement johnny had not been able to figure out what this last had meant what chicanery is eventuating he demanded the bulbnosed man had a rifle which he kept tucked in his armpit the breech mechanism portion where the cold would not affect it there were two other riflemen outside translate that the guard requested what is going on johnny asked shut up said the guard the other two guards came crawling in from a snow tunnel which led out of the hastily improvised prison cell they demanded to know what was the meaning of the conversation which they had just heard just this bag of bones and his words said the bulbnosed one we oughta let him freeze in that ice pit full of water growled another wonder what made kettler decide to keep him alive all of a sudden search me said the first some big idea i guess to their ears came sounds of a man expressing himself roundly and violently in profanity that must be kettler a man chuckled hes kinda peeved that doc savage almost plucked his tail feathers a while ago johnny who had found the most comfortable position to be one of reclining sat up after the fashion of a jumping jack doc savage up here he barked sure grinned the bulbnosed man howd he happen to come johnny demanded forgetting his usual large words came lookin for qui reckon said the other shut up you blasted fool gritted another guard this mug dont know what the qui business is all about doc savage has never heard of it want to tip em off at that point kettler came stamping in rage all over his doglike face he yanked the flaps of his muskrat cap loose as if to hear himself better we cant find out what that bronze guy done to the damn motor he growled not a thing wrong with it but it sure conked out on us and we cant get it started johnny kept an expression of gloom on his gaunt features he could guess what had happened to the motor the stuff which mixed with the gasoline vapor would congeal on the walls of the carburetors cylinders and intake manifolds and it would be several hours before the engine would start unless the affected parts were taken out and wiped carefully that was doc savage flyin over after you landed wasnt it asked a man sounded like he was lookin for you kettler swore he kicked cold snow on johnny who hastily brushed the damp flakes off his bare skin and wrapped himself protectingly in the blanket we spread that white canvas tent over part of the plane and kicked snow over the rest kettler gritted that and the fact it was snowin kept him from seem us an execrable circumstantiality murmured johnny another gob of them words and ill cut your throat kettler screamed johnny looked at the speaker and was surprised to feel his spine grow colder than the rest of his body an occurrence which surprised him infinitely kettler had meant it satisfied with johnnys sudden silence if one did not consider sporadic involuntary teeth chatterings kettler took several turns stamping around the snow room breath came out of his nostrils in angry snorts of steam suddenly he stopped in front of johnny youre an archyarchy an archaeologist johnny supplied yeah kettler glared that means you know all about oldtime things dont i and if you spring a big word answering me ill stomp your brains into the snow yes johnny said you know a lot of oldtime languages dont you yes said johnny could you understand an oldtime viking if you heard him kettler demanded yes could you talk to him kettler growled yes by gosh exclaimed the bulbnosed guard he spoke four little words one right after the other johnny said nothing he sat and shivered thought about the viking business and wondered how long it would actually be before he froze stiff kettler continued to stomp anxious circles in the snow some one came in with a gasoline lantern pumped it up and got it going after some difficulty the lantern gave off a little warmth johnny tried to edge over to it but kettler kicked him away as long as youre half frozen you cant run out on us he growled kettler consulted an oldfashioned silver turnip of a watch scowled and took up his pacing again the party we sent out oughta be back by now he snapped angrily and damn it theyd better have found that goldenhaired dame johnny had been thinking now he voiced a conclusion he had reached you men he said were the bearded vikings who were on the dragon ship and captured that yacht in long island sound kettler stopped and assumed the expression of a man who had just stepped in something nasty so you knew that all the time he barked no johnny corrected but i drew some conclusions from the fact that the faces of all of you show you have recently shaven off heavy beards the vikings had beards they werent really vikings at all they were your crowd kettler put his doglike face forward and what else has that great brain of yours told you he demanded the goldenhaired girl you are hunting now is the one who was on the dragon ship johnny guessed aloud you captured that yacht because it was faster and you were in a hurry to get somewhere probably to get a plane you got the plane and came up here bringing the girl then what happened did the man you killed let her escape kettler swore hes a regular mind reader kettler said the bulbnosed man what was the mysterious cargo you had on the dragon ship johnny asked the objects the people on the yacht heard you transferring after you made them go below kettler roared for a plugged nickel id fix you a man put his head in from the tunnel they got her kettler he yelled kettler underwent an amazing change a smile wreathed his doglike face and he seemed to grow two inches in height he rubbed his veined hands delightedly bring her nibs in here he directed very shortly afterward the goldenhaired girl was shoved inside johnny looked at her widened his eyes and made a silent whistle of amazed appreciation this came despite the fact that johnny was about as impervious to feminine charms as they came the exaggerated newspaper stories growing out of the glimpse those on the yacht had had of her aboard the viking dragon ship did not even do her justice she was not the tall slim type she was rather husky in fact but her curves were entirely pleasing to the eye and she had features that were a pleasant relief from the dollfaced types popular in the motion pictures at the moment kettler executed a deep bow and said welcome my dear ingra so ingra was her name johnny reflected that it was fitting she was the kind of a viking girl who must have mothered fellows like eric the red the girl spoke she spoke rapidly her tone indicated plainly she was saying what she thought of kettler and it must be a low opinion that she held the words johnnys mouth sagged open she was speaking ancient viking johnny had never heard it before except the few halting efforts of students but he had studied such records of it as existed he caught some of her words even as rapidly as she spoke kettler whirled on johnny get on the job he gritted you are going to translate for us thats what we kept you alive for johnny swallowed he had already realized that she is talking too rapidly he said i cannot get all she says tell her to slow up kettler rapped then ask her questions ask her what johnny countered ask her where qui is kettler directed under pretense of rising from a sitting position johnny thought rapidly as he moved his bound wrists hampered him but for the moment he did not notice kettler of course had no way of knowing johnny would translate the girls remarks correctly but kettler was taking that chance this meant he was getting desperate then johnnys bound wrists suggested something it will be more convenient if my wrists are untied he said making gestures will help he neglected to mention what kind of gestures or how he hoped they would help scowling blackly kettler untied the rope now ask her he directed johnny racked his brains for old norse words up until now he had considered himself an expert on the subject but he suddenly realized he was going to have trouble making himself understood at all he addressed ingra these men want me to question you after which they will probably kill me was the substance of johnnys labors with the viking tongue if you have any ideas about how we may escape please tell them to me the girl spoke too rapidly and vehemently for johnny to get it all the gist was that if she had had any ideas she would have used them herself before now they are hunting qui johnny labored making some gestures at the word qui kettler and his men showed great interest i know that is what they seek the girl said her voice was pleasant even if it was angry what is qui johnny asked and where is it i never heard of the place or is it a place the girl answered with a tirade the substance of which was that she saw no reason for telling johnny anything because kettler would get it out of him willing or no and be hanged if she would tell anything whats the girl jabberin kettler yelled shut up johnny said im trying to pump her telling kettler to shut up was an unthinking slip on johnnys part but the bony archaeologist was angry excited kettler swung a fist and knocked johnny down he jumped over to add a kick for good measure johnny had wangled the freeing of his wrists in hopes of getting a break he took his break now even if it was a long chance he whipped doubled grabbed at kettlers ankles got them outwardly johnny looked only little less helpless than the wired skeletons they keep in medical schools but that was deceptive gripping kettlers ankles johnny stood erect kettler waved his arms wildly trying to keep upright this was just what johnny had hoped for johnny jammed kettlers head and shoulders into the snow ceiling kettlers waving arms helped the entire ceiling of the snow room suddenly came down johnny racked his brain for the old viking word for run but could not think of it vamoose he shrieked for ingras benefit clear out beat it then he did his best to follow his own advice first however he dived accurately for the spot where his two blankets lay this was no country for a garb of redflannel underwear alone he got the blankets a gun went off in the snow there was much cursing johnny waded flailed with his arms seeking the open air this he knew must be a drift probably behind a boulder johnny choked on the snow it was almost impossible to breathe his underwear was full of snow remarkably enough though he was warmer than he had been for hours with shocking suddenness johnny encountered a man the fellow hit him johnny hit back the man did not seem to have a gun the man tried to butt johnny and the gaunt geologist grabbed the fellows parka and partly by accident peeled the garment off the wearer he kept a grip on it johnny slugged furiously and got the man down johnny dived came out of the drift almost unexpectedly no foes were in sight they must have tried to crawl into the tunnel when they had heard the uproar johnny could see their plane camouflaged with the white canvas tent and the snow no use trying to get away in it he realized it would take minutes to clear it to warm the motors to turn it around ingra came out of the drift almost simultaneously kettler appeared back to johnny not a yard distant johnny hit him behind the ear before kettler got snow out of his eyes kettler went down johnny began wrenching madly at kettlers moosehide moccasins fool shouted ingra flee johnny understood her viking it was a good suggestion she was already fleeing he loped after her chapter ii death fall boulders and huge masses of stones were all about along with some scrubby bushes many of which were buried in the soft snow they were very thorny bushes johnnys bare feet soon told him and that reminded him that his feet were already becoming numb he should he reflected have tarried for kettlers moccasins he was even tempted to go back a wild shouting from behind encouraged him to go on johnnys foes were now out of the snow he ran ingra was an agile young woman he had difficulty in overhauling her where will we head for johnny demanded she seemed to be too busy running to answer johnny attempted drawing on the captured parka as he sprinted fell headlong once but managed the blankets would do for leggings and a foot covering if he ever got time to apply them to his extremities there was some shooting behind probably that was for effect then there arose a human baying the men were following their footprints in the snow johnny cast about desperately the snow was everywhere except for a few bare rocks ingra called something over her shoulder johnny did not get it and demanded a repeat we will separate the young woman said more slowly in the viking tongue in that manner maybe they will not catch us both johnny resented the idea of a woman telling him what they should do anyway he did not want to lose track of ingra he wanted to ask her many things among which was how on earth she happened to speak ancient viking so fluently and just what the mysterious qui was he had enough of other questions too to fill up hours of interrogation no he said to her suggestion she promptly demonstrated that she was a young woman who would not brook argument to their right was a patch of the thorny bushes speckled with jagged rocks she plunged into these her north country garments they were new and looked as if they had been purchased in new york protected her from the thorns johnny tried to follow he negotiated fifty feet and practically no skin remained on his bony shanks rags of red underwear dotted the bushes behind he would never make it johnny backed out and of necessity took up his flight in the opposite direction when he looked back ingra had vanished he ran furiously for only violent motion would keep him from freezing he heard shouting behind the pursuers apparently delayed briefly arguing then split in two bands one following each fugitive a rocky stretch bare of snow shortly answered johnnys prayers and he altered his course on this after which he believed he had gained a few minutes he paused tore up one blanket and bound his feet then he ran on the improvised footgear barring the necessity of retying at intervals was not bad kettlers men were still following him he could hear their angry shouts once they shot at him when he topped a ridge granting that the wind had not changed direction johnny decided he was headed north his plane had been wrecked far to the south no need of going back there later perhaps he could do so and employ the wreckage to make skils or snowshoes the thing now was to outstrip his pursuers he settled to a longlegged distanceeating run johnnys youth had been scholastic but he had found time for athletics and his specialty had been distance running he had never set any world records but that was possibly because he had never taken the time out for the intensive training necessary on an occasion or two however he had delivered some surprising upsets in track meets unlike most college athletes johnny was now in better condition than during his scholastic days some freak in his makeup doc savage had diagnosed it as an unusual glandular condition had endowed him with muscles that were more like violin strings than those an ordinary man would have the bony archaelogists endurance was fabulous he was going to need all he had the men behind were fresh but what was worse from the way they held their own they must be wearing snowshoes johnnys extremely long legs were a help in the snow but they did not overcome the snowshoe advantage the nearness of his pursuers drove him to more and more frantic efforts his position was almost hopeless doc savage was somewhere about from what kettlers men had said but the chance of attracting the bronze mans attention was not even worth trying it was still snowing a signal could not be seen at any distance a faint roaring reached johnnys ears he stopped listening straining he thought hoped it was a plane docs ship but no it was the sea waves breaking on an icy shore three or four miles distant he concluded johnny ran on the fact that he could hear waves did not surprise him tidal currents were reputedly terrific off these shores and portions of the sea never froze a bullet climbed whining off a stone near by a moment later the crash of the rifle firing it arrived johnny observed a defile a rounded gully to the left the wind seemed to sweep straight up it and it was as free of snow as the rest of the country johnny loped into it the going he thanked his stars was easier he put on more speed he slithered time and again almost fell for the terrific exertion was making him a little blind the cold was helping too snow had melted in his redflannel underwear and he knew the garment would eventually freeze once clear and he began to hold a horrible doubt that he would get clear he would have to get the underwear off he still carried the other blanket that would help another bullet searched for him johnny doubled low the gully seemed to turn ahead if he could but reach that angle he looked back to see how close pursuit was he was running in shallow snow suddenly horribly johnny was running in midair there is in the human category of experiences nothing quite so shocking as to have solidness drop abruptly from underfoot johnny fanned his arms tried to turn in the air like a cat and grab solid rock he knew he had run into some kind of a crevasse which had been bridged over by snow he knew too that he was lost and it was numbing but no great surprise when his fingers failed to reach a hold and he plummeted down into a grisly infinity that was made gray and hideous by the snow that fell with him and awful to the ear because there came faintly the shouts of men who wanted to kill him kettlers men had been close they had seen him fall they had taken off their snowshoes were carrying them as they ran the bulbnosed man was in charge of the pursuit detail careful he warned the bag of bones fell into a crack of some kind the men slowed their pace the respite was welcome all were drinking in air with frenzied gulps and the cold stuff burned their lungs like fire nearer the crevasse they went even more gingerly two of them exhausted completely lay down where they were and rolled in agony hands clamped over mouths and nostrils to shut out the air which they must have yet which was so cold it was almost impossible to breathe they linked hands together the bulbnosed man foremost and edged to the crevasse it was a canyon into which the gully emptied they could see nor was it so very narrow the bulbnosed man looked down below snow eddied like smoke his eyes could not penetrate it one of you guys got a flashlight he demanded none of them had they argued swore and rested the snow haze settled then it was too gloomy to see the bottom they solved that problem when one of them produced a fistful of letters complained loudly that they were from his best girl friend and therefore more valuable than gems and surrendered them the bulbnosed man struck matches the wind gave him trouble but finally he got a wad of the letters burning and dropped it into the chasm there was a considerable draft coming up from the stone rent and this tossed the makeshift torch about but finally it sank low enough to disclose what they had expressed themselves profanely as hoping to see johnnys purloined parka projected out of the fallen snow hunched grotesquely as if the body within were twisted and broken suddenly before the letters burned themselves out the bulbnosed man whipped up his rifle it was a biggame automatic he emptied it into the still form below and the roar of the shots thundered weirdly in the recesses of the crevasse the bulbnosed man drew back moistening his lips not looking particularly glad over what he had done that he said hoarsely fixes that guy he led the others back up the gully as if he wanted to quit the vicinity in a hurry i hope that doc savage dont make us any more trouble than this guy he muttered chapter a find and a loss doc savage was at that moment planning trouble the bronze man was at the controls of thorpe carleths plane and in the cabin were carleth the perfect peabody renny monk and ham and habeas corpus savage had picked out a spot suitable for a landing it was some two miles from the level space where johnnys wrecked plane lay doc landed carleth and peabody did not look so worried over this landing although it was as difficult as the one back at the other clearing the big motors lipped flame and noise as doc gunned the ship in close to a drift then up the sloping side of the drift until it collapsed and the ship was all but half buried with superb judgment doc cut the motors just as the snow crust gave saving the propellers how shall we get out of here carleth wailed trying to keep his glasses on his nose dig out doc told him it will not be difficult the bronze man stepped out gave orders and they got snowshoes out of the cabin these served as snow shovels and they began banking and covering the plane i have a hunch this is what that other crowd did doc said that would explain why their plane could not be located carleth got his glasses to stick what are you going to do the bronze man did not answer that directly you fellows will remain here he suggested we do not want to take chances of losing this ship it would not carleth agreed fervently be pleasant to be marooned up here doc savage made up a small pack consisting of a silken airtight sleeping bag which rolled into a pack no larger than rennys fist and which could be kept warm by a tiny fireless chemical heater which was situated in a bag in the foot and which was put in operation by filling the bag with water snow would do then pouring in a spoonful of a chemical which was contained in a flask doc also took a box containing a number of small cakes of stuff resembling candy cakes which were really concentrated food that could be prepared by mixing with water or in an emergency taken without preparation the bronze man added to the pack such chemicals and gadgets as he believed might be convenient monks chemical laboratory he had discovered was not greatly damaged one piece of equipment which another would certainly not have neglected doc savage did not carry he took no gun this was in keeping with a policy which he had long ago formulated that of having nothing to do with firearms for this he had a reason the thorough conviction that one who comes to depend upon a gun is the more helpless then without the weapon without saying where he was bound or what he intended to do doc savage struck out over the snow he handled the snowshoes with the precise ease that comes of careful practice devoted solely to learning how to do a thing coupled with the advice of experts docs skill in almost all lines which seemed amazing was in the last analysis simply explained when he wanted to master a thing he went to those who were already masters of the subject and learned from them unexpectedly it stopped snowing the clouds were still matted above but they no longer leaked flakes the wind too dropped until it was scarcely perceptible and in the calm that followed the myriad noises of the northland previously unnoticeable became apparent rocks which occasionally cracked from the awful cold twigs complaining the sandy crunch of dry snow under the snowshoe webs the boom of the sea was audible now as well doc savage was alert using eyes ears not much missed him he was crossing a particularly rocky region when he halted abruptly his eyes were fixed on a drift a score of yards distant plumes of steam so faint as to be virtually nonexistent arose at intervals from the drift breath steam undoubtedly doc savage advanced warily something was under the snow breathing through a small hole in the flakes the hole might be for listening purposes as well it might be an animal in the drift doc savage freed a small rock from an icy anchorage hefted it at the drift it sank into the snow not six inches from the hole the breath steam stopped coming you might as well show yourself doc savage said quietly no response the bronze man listened sounds were faint but he could hear them whatever was in the drift was working deeper into the snow doc lunged forward he was cautious he had no ambition to kick a bear in the ribs come out of that he snapped a form human popped out of the drift ran madly at first it appeared to be a man doc pursued the instant be caught the fugitive he discovered it was a young woman with remarkable golden hair she was no clinging vine she sent a fist at him he parried it caught her wrists she jumped up and slammed both moccasined feet to his chest but even a professional wrestler could hardly have downed him that way doc laughed he released her the laugh was not because there was anything funny it was to reassure the young woman once loose she ran a few feet turned her head saw he was not following and stopped she said something doc savage recognized the words as old viking but her rapid breathing made the syllables unintelligible doc savage put his right hand against his chest doc savage he said that did not seem to mean the slightest thing to her doc savage watched her and there were vague eddies in his flakegold eyes no small part of his remarkable training had been devoted to languages ancient and modern and he probably knew more about tongues long since lost in history than did gaunt johnny who made that sort of thing his profession he assembled words of viking and was foresighted enough to repeat them under his breath to accustom his tongue to the strange syllables you can see that i have no designs upon you doc said in viking will you talk to me the girl started you look much as my forefathers must have looked she said you are from across the sea doc presumed she must mean the home of the ancient vikings in northern europe he could understand her fairly well no doc said she looked puzzled but you cannot be one of those slaves of the qui who escaped i have seen them all who the bronze man queried quietly are you i am ingra she said i am one of the slaves of the qui she did not call it slave but a combination of viking terminology meaning one who is forced to row at the sweeps of dragon ships and do menial tasks which meant the same thing the escaping slaves took me from qui on the dragon ship which they stole from the sacred shrine of the qui the girl ingra went on abruptly i did not want to go they took me against my will i did not know why then but i have since learned i have the knowledge of my ancestors the knowledge of how to tell the whereabouts of a place by the position of the stars i knew where qui was in relation to the position of the stars and i could guide them back she was talking about astronomical navigation doc knew some knowledge of the science which had been handed down from the past ancient navigators had been able to read their position from the stars at an earlier age than most persons convinced all scientific learning was of a recent date would have guessed some ancient vikings might have known it doc was not sure the old freebooters had made some remarkable voyages in their dragon ships ingra was still talking the men the slaves of qui who escaped in the dragon ship from the shrine wanted to get their modern weapons from your strange world and come back she said they desired to take things from qui doc became slightly tense not because he was learning things that tended to solve the mystery he had heard a sound a plane the motor noise was coming up out of the south he groped for viking words found them quick he rasped we had better get out of sight they moved swiftly running for the drift and possibly that was their mistake moving objects are easily seen the other plane was closer than it had seemed it popped up over a nearby ridge those aboard must have been keeping an alert watch the plane veered toward doc and the girl just as they dived into the drift it moaned overhead very low it turned came back time and again it passed there was no spot near by suitable for a landing doc poked a hole in the snow a hole small enough that it could not be seen from above and studied the plane he had never seen the ship before it was a big trimotored biplane capable of carrying almost a score of passengers and it looked like an old job gotten secondhand from some air line it bore the united states markings there was no way of telling whether those aboard were friends doc decided to test he stepped out of the snow and shucked back the hood of the parka so that his features showed plainly results amply demonstrated what he wanted to know men in the plane above all but fell overboard in their haste to get guns out of the windows when he saw the first rifle barrel appear doc savage whipped for shelter bullets thumped around him he got into the snow burrowed changed this course and snuggled under a boulder there he could only be hit from one direction and the men in the plane not knowing where he was were not likely to get the correct angle the plane moaned above its exhaust syncopation punctuated with gun sound the lead accomplished nothing the plane went away doc savage shoved out of the drift hastily he glanced tip he had guessed correctly two parachutes were lowering men who had leaped from the other plane stay here the bronze man shouted in viking very well the girl agreed from under the snow doc ran toward the spots where the parachutes would drop they were big slow lobes of silk but it was impossible to travel swiftly through the snow he saw he would not be able to reach a position near the parachutes before the men harnessed in them were down the big shabby biplane came storming back but doc was among high boulders and paid it little attention beyond dodging and favoring shelter one parachute came down on a spot where stones were huge and rugged the man in the harness took a nasty fall lost the rifle which he was carrying and doc made for him the other parachute was higher the occupant began shooting from the air his marksmanship was hairraising doc heard that peculiar popping noise which a highvelocity bullet makes close to an ear he slapped behind a rock ledge the plane came back men in it shooting doc was forced to change position the man in the parachute shot at him again the fellow who had fallen recovered and began firing doc began to need all the eyes with which a fly is equipped he settled himself in the most convenient shelter half buried in the snow that filled a crack in the rock and explored his clothing over his light strong chain mail undershirt doc wore a vest which consisted almost entirely of pockets that held containers designed for flatness so that they fitted into the pockets without special bulk he extracted one of these twisted off the lid and it instantly began pouring out a dense thick black smoke he tossed the smoke bomb behind him the black cloud it poured out was prodigious monk had spent months perfecting that particular chemical concoction the pall covered doc hid him and went on to envelop the other two who had come down in their parachutes doc reared up and started through the black smudge three paces and he stopped he could hear shouting it was off to the left quite a distance doc savage had no way of knowing he was listening to the party of kettlers men who had been hunting the strange girl ingra and who had been drawn by the uproar but he did guess that they were new foes the bronze man continued with the job at hand he located one of the parachuters crept upon the fellow and had the man by the neck before the fellow dreamed that he was in imminent danger the man tried to use his rifle instead of twisting it out of his hand doc simply exerted sudden terrific pressure on certain vulnerable spinal nerve centers the victim let his gun go went limp doc dropped him the pressure had the same effect generally as a knockout blow and it would be some time before the fellow aroused the distant new arrivals were still shouting and now they began shooting doc caught some of their words theres the girl one of them was bawling ingra the remarkable young woman who spoke old viking must have ventured from concealment and been discovered a moment later doc heard the young woman shrieking the plane whooped moaned above some one in it was using a machine gun which jammed frequently doc violated a principle of never using firearms the plane above was the big handicap he scooped up the rifle of the man he had just overcome and ran out of the smoke pall the other fellow who had come down by parachute had been canny enough to get out of the smoke also he saw doc lifted his rifle the bronze man snapped a shot an onlooker would have sworn he could not possibly have aimed but the man with the rifle let out a squawk and tried to stand on one leg the bullet had shattered the bone in the other he soon fell down doc got behind a rock and waited for the plane to come back he aimed with great care twice he seemed on the point of firing only to be dissatisfied with his aim he fired one shot the starboard motor of the plane stopped there must have been consternation on the ship a landing here would be suicide the craft limped away two motors keeping it up but not much more doc savage ran toward the spot where ingra had been left coming in sight of her he saw that she had been taken by the other raiding party three of them were holding her the others saw doc and began shooting doc drifted back that being the only sane thing to do they pursued him but warily obviously afraid of him but intent on killing off to the east the crippled plane was coming down level snow evidently having been discovered doc listened for the results of their descent bloopings of the motors undoubtedly as the craft taxied in the snow told him they were down safely unexpectedly those pursuing doc veered over toward where the ship had landed they went swiftly and were well on their way before the bronze man comprehended their intention to join those in the plane doc made a barren effort to cut them off but the distance was too great they reached the other ship well ahead of him the craft had been idling with its two motors but now the third broke out noisily they must have found the wiring which the bronze mans bullet had cut he had done some careful calculating on that shot and had repaired it the plane took the air before he was near enough to do anything toward preventing it doc promptly took shelter in a snowdrift with a peephole at hand and the rifle ready but the plane all the men and the girl must have loaded aboard did not take chances they made two or three halfhearted circles of the vicinity saw no one did not get close enough for doc to use the rifle then angled off to the north they evidently had a healthy respect for the rifle and they seemed to have something else on their collective minds doc savage got out of the snow and hurried toward the spot where he had left his aides monk and the others chapter hed make a swell valet monk was excited he had his bullet of a head out of the snowdrift beside the plane where they were hidden a cupped hand back of a scarred ear endeavored to catch the sounds of the distant plane which had departed they had heard far away the fighting monk floundered out of the drift danged if i stick here any longer he growled somethings happened to doc im goin over there and pick up the pieces or something ham said try not to be the numskull nature made you sarcasm did not conceal the anxiety in hams voice monk scowled and routed carleth and peabody out of the snow what do you birds think about going over there peabody looked at carleth and said my wishes are yours sir carleth shivered he seemed to have acquired a dislike for the whole thing my wishes are that we were back in new york he muttered but since that is out of the question i believe we should see what has happened to doc savage monk told ham youre outnumbered shyster ham shrugged we were told to stay here but lets go they buckled on snowshoes monk ham and renny could use them having learned in the past but carleth and peabody proved to be aggravating dubs they dug the toes of their webs in and fell down on an average of once every fifty feet carleth was profane peevish about it but peabody was composed accepting things as they were ham walking ahead with monk voiced an opinion that peabody would make me a superb valet he said when this is all over im going to offer him more money than carleth is paying that trick is about your caliber monk said sourly they began to quarrel perhaps in part to take their minds off thoughts of what might have happened to doc the squabbling went on until it was interrupted by a startled outcry from behind they whirled peabody stood a few yards back panting working with a snowshoe strap renny and carleth were not in sight whats wrong monk demanded peabody gasped i think renny is helping carleth the master fell or something monk and ham walked past peabody going back monk came in sight of renny and carleth he exploded a gasp renny was lying prone carleth stood over him in carleths hands was a rock with which he had obviously just struck renny down probably as the latter endeavored to assist him a cry a thump sounded behind monk he spun ham was down patently senseless peabody stood over the prone lawyer a big heavy automatic was in each of peabodys hands you will stand damn still peabody stated the two guns looked big and ugly enough to hold monk still wordless peabody came up to him he jabbed one gun into monks stomach he swung the other to monks head the homely chemist had an impression of diving into snow that was a thousand miles deep monk came out of it with a roaring in his ears the roaring of their plane motor he was lying in the cabin and he was bound tighter than he believed he had ever been bound before it was a lot of trouble to roll over ham was conscious he glared at monk so peabody would make a good valet monk sneered oh shut up ham said i wonder if doc suspected them dont talk to me monk growled my head aches why didnt they kill us i dont know renny snapped from behind monk chickenhearted i guess peabody came back scowling and kicked monk several times as if he enjoyed it chickenhearted eh he snarled why you damn fools were going to kill you carleth and myself dont do work like that we have hired men for it and youre taking us to the hired men renny boomed exactly peabody said and added sarcastically sir where did you learn to be a valet ham asked abruptly peabody spat i was once a very rich man he said i had two valets three chauffeurs and thirtysix other servants at my town and country places i have been valeted enough to know how to valet i think youre lying said ham i am not said peabody as if it were a point of honor with him to convince the dapper ham he was not valet caliber why at one time i had that man is pumping you shouted carleth who was flying the plane dry up peabody snapped then added for hams benefit carleth has worked for me for years people think hes a millionaire playboy with an air line but hell hes just one of my flunkies aint you carleth you dont need to rub it in carleth clipped carleths air line dont belong to carleth peabody said gloatingly it belongs to me i own a lot of other guys too im a big shot still even if i been having my troubles like everybody else just what is your profession ham demanded curiously smuggler and rum runner said peabody now tell me what this is all about ham requested nerts to you said peabody peabody leaned very close to hams face glaring with exaggerated yet very real ferocity he seemed to have a particular hate for ham gonna gimme a job as your valet huh he snarled and slapped ham as hard as he could then he went back and sat down monk squinted and saw ham had not been knocked entirely senseless by the blow but only dizzy after which monk rolled his small eyes and added insult to injury i wish you did have a valet with manners like that he said carleth spent some time looking down out of the cockpit window then angled the plane over and it tilted steeply and centrifugal pull told them the craft was spiraling down sharply once they even got a glimpse of a misplaced earth through one of the cabin windows the ship landed it was a very bumpy landing which scared monk renny and ham badly and caused peabody to curse carleth peabody got out and yelled kettler you old bucket of sin how do things stack up there was much conversation which the three prisoners in the plane could not quite overhear and numerous men came up to the ship looked inside and made insulting remarks to the captives monk listening carefully overheard enough casual remarks to tell him several things namely kettler was the leader of the party they had joined but he was working under peabodys orders kettler had it seemed once been a captain of a smuggling ship operated by peabody kettlers plane was here where it had been hidden after escaping from its unsuccessful attack on docs ship a second plane the old biplane which had attacked doc had just arrived from new york bearing more members of the gang the biplane also had carried something else which had an important connection with qui monk did not catch what it was the girl ingra was here they were trying to make her direct them to qui monk was still straining his ears for information when several men came seized him along with ham and renny and hauled them out of the plane cabin monk looked at the biplane hoping to see what its mysterious unidentified cargo was numerous men were standing around the ship looking in the cabin windows they reminded monk of spectators at a sideshow before he got any information monk and those with him were hauled over to kettlers big plane the ship which carleth had insisted had been stolen from him kettler peabody and carleth were there alternately shouting qui at a very attractive young goldenhaired woman they also made fierce faces pinched her cruelly and twisted her arms in the course of this the three men had collected a few bruises which ingra had managed to inflict peabody scowled at ham valet material am i he gritted well lets see what you think in a minute what are you going to do ham demanded anxiously this damn girl wont do what we want said peabody so were gonna cut your throat and let you bleed on her feet or something to kinda remind her we mean business ham blinked swallowed peabody was utterly serious about it peabody called one of his men and demanded the loan of a knife ham noted that the blade was one of the viking weapons which had cropped up so mysteriously in new york that reminded ham that the mystery attacks in new york never had been explained satisfactorily but he did not devote that angle much thought peabody had come up to him and had made a preparatory flourish with the knife to get ingras eye the young woman realized what he was about to do she to hams everlasting thankfulness did not hesitate she shrieked a conglomeration of words in viking no one present understood her but her meaning was plain shes gonna take us to qui peabody barked peabody glowered fingered his knife seeming happy and at the same time disappointed reckon i gotta keep you and your two pals around until this dame does her stuff he said but buddy after that ill do you up like no valet you never saw the three prisoners were hauled back to the plane along with the girl and loaded inside there was much turmoil plane motors howled stirring up choking clouds of snow all three ships were going to take the air there was some parceling out of rifles and ammunition particularly ammunition watching the preparations monk gathered that these men contemplated a fight from their numbers and the quantity of arms they must expect the fray to amount to a battle try as he would monk could not see what was in the old biplane which had moved men to gather around and stare the ships took the air amid terrific straining of motors and shouted profane advice between the pilot and his passengers peabody ingra and some others were with monk and his two companions carleth was flying peabody shouted we might as well look for that doc savage a little before we go to qui the plane headed south taking swings of two or three miles to each side i think i saw him over there a man shouted and pointed the plane angled over sharply it came down close to earth everyone but the prisoners used field glasses results were nil musta been mistaken said the man who had shouted discovery well give it up peabody growled head north while i start this dame doin her stuff the three ships trailed each other noisily through a sky that was leaden in the direction of qui chapter qui doc savage came out of the snow after the planes had gone for it was the bronze man whom they had seen and he had taken shelter and standing in the snow doc stared into the north listening to the final diminishing of sound which the bevy of motors had made and left it was getting dark and the borealis was prominent making somewhat weird patterns as seen through the fine snow which was coming not from the sky but from a small breeze which had arisen and was kicking it up doc shifted position the squall of his snowshoes in the colddry snow was almost frightening the fantastic vastness of the snow country seemed to press in like a gobbling monster the bronze man snowshoed north he had been back already to where he had left monk and the others and had found them and the plane gone he had found one other thing too habeas doc called the grotesque pig came out of a drift where he had taken shelter after the fashion of sled dogs the little porkers appearance was made more incredible if that was really possible by the fur jacket affair with which monk had equipped him and a part of which habeas had already eaten habeas had some of the manners of a goat in the matter of diet doc had seen the three planes take the air he made for the spot of their takeoff apprehensive of what he might find it took him three hours to reach the camp he searched for bodies and there were none mushing a hundred yards from the deserted camp doc began a circle of the spot he found tracks for the snow had no more than half filled them he located where johnny and the girl had fled he came to the spot where the girl had separated her trail from johnnys doc knew what had happened to the girl so he set out on johnnys trail the chasm into which johnny had fallen was dark ominous when he came to it he used a pocket flashlight which was small but gave a strong thin white beam he rested the light for a long time on the bulletperforated parka visible in the fallen snow doc studied the icy surface around the crack edge it was treacherous the cracks filled with ice which had doubtless come from some sunshiny day he used a knife to gouge ice out of a crack then wedged his grapple the one with the silken cord attached therein habeas the pig stood well back and grunted uneasily as the bronze man went down the thin cord his bronze hands were ungloved but they seemed stiffened not at all by the intense cold reaching the bottom doc went at once to the parka picked it up and shook out the snow which had been stuffed inside the fur garment johnny was not there soft snow that padded the bottom of the canyon to a considerable depth had cushioned his fall no doubt and he had used this snowintheparka ruse to fool his pursuers johnny doc called there was no answer a scratching and frantic squealing above wrenched docs gaze upward but it was only habeas the pig who had come investigating and had slipped over the edge he came sailing down and doc did not even bother to catch him because the snow was very soft the pig climbed out grunting doc savage used his flashlight and worked up the canyon he saw enough to tell him that johnny had not gone in that direction doc turned back and went down the canyon very narrow extremely deep was by no means entirely bridged over by snow it was just in the narrow places that the drifts had built out until they had formed a complete arch where the crack was arched over however the darkness was intense once doc savage disturbed a mass of snow and the whole arch came down hundreds of pounds of it but light flaky stuff which did no more damage than to bury them doc got himself out and excavated for habeas johnny had gone this way the gaunt archaeologists tracks showed at times the canyon widened the sides remained steep seldom less than straight up and down there had been no point at which johnny could have left it doc savage came to a spot where the canyon bed dropped suddenly for at least thirty feet no doubt during the season when the snow melted the spot was a waterfall of some consequence johnny his marks indicated had dropped a rock or two to see how deep the snow was below then had jumped doc tossed habeas down then followed himself the canyon abruptly ended and the bronze man found himself in level country where there was quite a bit of stunted shrubbery and some trees he glanced backward then to the right and left and observed a rather remarkable fact in descending the canyon he had penetrated down through a line of cliffs ages ago the sea must have beaten here and worn a line of cliffs after which some convulsion of earth forces had lifted the coast line leaving the cliffs a sheer unscalable wall almost high and dry the throb and roll of the sea was stronger now too there was the faint tang of salt air doc judged the ocean to be no more than a mile ahead johnnys tracks almost lost in the snow indicated he had started running again probably that meant he was trying to keep off the bitter cold he was heading west and in that direction doc could see larger trees and a number of rocky peaks which seemed to be surrounded by masses of boulders no doubt johnny was visioning shelter from the elements when he headed for that point doc savage gathered up the pig habeas and quickened his pace he worked through brush came out on the south slope of a hill and was suddenly face to face with the last thing he had expected to see a cultivated field nothing of course was growing now but the marks of agricultural efforts were evident it was a crude kind of farming however the earth must have been spaded instead of plowed farther on there were trees of a variety not often seen this far north doc inspected them new england maples of the type from which is drawn the sap for maple syrup in new england they would not have been considered much as maple trees being stunted and gnarled but they were maples more surprisingly the trunks bore marks indicating they had been tapped there were a few other trees of a hardy fruiting variety grown in canada and the northern united states and some berry bushes obviously cultivated doc savage made his small trilling sound as he considered all of this the canadian indians did not go in for this sort of thing eskimos certainly did not moreover there was no record of civilization on this coast it was also true that this part of the coast had never been explored thoroughly for the simple but adequate reason that there was nothing to indicate the region held anything to make it worth exploring british admiralty expeditions had of course charted the coast generally but the shore could have held a great deal that they missed apparently it did doc advanced through the cultivated section topped the hill and was no little surprised to discover himself standing on the shore of a small bay the entrance to this was narrow and had the shape of a letter s doc frowned at the ocean which was plentifully sprinkled with ice cakes from out there it would be almost impossible to discover the bay entrance not of course if a ship came in close but there were ugly rocks here and there no sane skipper even an explorer would venture close to a shore like that the west side of the bay was against a high cliff doc savage at first had no intention of going near the cliff but on closer inspection he saw something which drew him toward the spot wave action in some distant age when the water was higher had hollowed out the base of the cliff a wall had been thrown up in front of the hollow a wall that reached up to the cliff it was a manmade wall neatly mortared no telling how big the cavity behind was intrigued doc searched for a hole through the wall toward the opposite end the wall arose sheer from the water and there judging from appearances a sizeable portion of the wall had been torn down and rebuilt the mortar there was new and looked as if it were frozen rather than dry doc decided the hole had been filled in within the last month doc savage worked toward the other end of the wall the cliff towered above overhanging the sky was murky an unusual play of borealis furnished much of what light there was doc came upon a path it was about three feet wide cut neatly through the drifts the excavated snow piled on either side there was soft snow in the path but it had not been disturbed by tracks the path terminated against the artificial wall doc savage bent low and inspected there seemed to be a loose block of stone perhaps eighteen inches in each dimension which was designed to come out he worked at it the rock came out it was only a plate standing on edge he threw his flash beam inside he saw nothing but a bleak stone cavern the opposite wall formed by the side of the waveworn cliff the wall was too thick for him to see in either direction doc worked at the mortared rocks his strength was enormous the construction of the wall none too stable that combination enabled him to free some of the rocks he made an opening which would permit him with difficulty to squeeze through he wormed in he was not quite through when something grabbed his wrist chapter men of qui it felt like a wire at first a cable it hauled with terrific force doc was snapped completely out of the hole hauled into the air he heard a rattle and squeak back in the cavern as this happened he knew then that it was a snare some crude affair of pulleys and a weight he did not thresh about needlessly but merely kicked out with his feet found the wall was not in reach then pulled himself up the agony was tremendous he got hold of the wire it was a wire above the loop which imprisoned his wrist his next feat taxed even his remarkable muscles he gripped the wire high did not try the entirely hopeless task of trying to climb it but brought his imprisoned wrist up and got a loop around the other hand then he worked at the slip knot with his teeth it was tight but it slid he dropped to the sandy floor free instantly he whipped to one side there was good reason for that he did not believe he had been careless enough to fall into any ordinary snare he was convinced that some one had dropped the loop over his wrist he was right a squeaking ejaculation came from almost underfoot a hard blow struck his right leg above the knee sharp agony accompanied the blow the bronze man whipped to one side he could feel wet warmth on his leg a wound it did not seem to be bad a small guttural voice squawked at his side then there was a drumming sound in the darkness a sound which might have been made by scores of dogs running something fastened to the bronze mans legs another he reached down grasping slapping a small body fastened to his neck more descended upon his back he got hold of one of his assailants and gripping the fellow heaved toward the hole he fell but he was near enough to get his captive in the light that came from outside at first glance the being which doc held looked like a small boy but the fellow was broader heavier and his face was seamed that of an old man dozens of them were in the fight one got around in front of doc in the light the little fellow had a club a hideous thing studded with sharp iron spikes he did his best to brain the bronze man with it doc grasped at the club got it and threw it out of the hole the bronze man was under a selfimposed handicap he had no desire to damage the little fellows he had forced himself into some private sanctuary of theirs and he was getting literally not much worse than his just deserts he decided to crawl out through the hole that was a decision easier reached than accomplished they grabbed his legs held on despite his violent kicking and hauled him back the small men shouted from time to time their words were an admixture of viking dialect coupled with an indian lingo spoken by some canadian redmen the combination was almost unintelligible to doc but they might understand old viking he tried it i am a stranger who means no harm he said sharply in the norse tongue they understood the striking and clubbing ceased but they retained a tight grip only fools fight doc told them wise men talk let us talk there was some muttering in their vernacular after which three went back into the cavern and could be heard hitting flints with steel they finally got torches ignited the torches consisted of pans made of slabs of rock laboriously hollowed out and filled with oil in which a tall wick was floated through a bit of wood light from the torches disclosed an amazing scene the cavern was of some size and it was literally gorged with the wrecks of ships some dismantled and others almost intact none of the vessels were large close at hand was the bowsprit and stem of what had probably been a fishing schooner farther on was a whaleboat some of the planking stove in there were numerous portions of keels frames and even part of a deck house with the portholes intact looming huge in the darkness was a modernlooking craft which looked enormously stout its hull was steel and it was motor driven the superstructure apparently had been swiped off by a sea and the hulk was otherwise battered it had been floated into the cavern there was water at the other end superhuman labor must have gone into hauling out the hull there were hatches wooden belaying pins blocks lines spars masts oars and sails which had fallen to pieces the place seemed to be well ventilated for most of the stuff was in an excellent state of preservation there is little rot in the northland anyway occupying a place of honor and doc stared at it a long time was a viking dragon ship which might have been a double for the one which had put in such an amazing appearance in long island sound except that the bow of the craft was pretty much of a wreck as if it had gone on a rock before being hauled into this queer place docs attention returned to his captors they were amazing little fellows possibly not as small as it had seemed at first doc had once visited pygmies in africa these fellows were about the same size although a bit broader and with round butterball faces the young ones the old ones were walking masses of wrinkles doc decided they were ordinary north american aboriginal stock who had been stunted by some freak of heredity or environment who doc asked in viking are you the medicine men of qui replied the most wrinkled of the lot why were you breaking into our sacred place where only the medicine men are permitted to come it did not seem exactly suitable to explain that he had just been curious so doc countered with a question is this he demanded the way that wellmeaning visitors should be treated we will show you how we treat visitors the medicine man chief said calmly they closed in on him doc let them seize him and the leading thongs to his wrists he was curious to see what they intended doing the small men of qui led the bronze giant out of their queer sacred place as they called it and marched him down the trail scooped in the snowdrifts doc savage did some thinking the viking dragon ship of long island sound had undoubtedly come from here that meant the bearded crew who had captured the yacht had sailed the dragon ship down from here this was something of a feat considering the season of the year but not impossible had the vikings not crossed the atlantic the northern dangerous part too according to wellfounded historical opinion using exactly such ships perhaps these identical ships becalmed on long island sound the bearded crew of the viking dragon ship had taken the yacht to complete their voyage they had shaved off their beards enlisted the aid of peabody and carleth taken a plane and come north for what that still remained a mystery further recapitulation was interrupted by appearance of one of the most primitive striking settlements doc had ever seen it looked as if some one with only a hazy idea of how to go about it had attempted to construct a village patterned after those of northern europe in the tenth century there was a wall quite substantial but not overly high inside there were several large buildings which resembled big stone blocks adding an almost laughable touch were several common eskimo igloos and a few indian wikiups of poles and animal skins there were some sod huts plump little pygmy people were everywhere swathed in fur garments which did not differ greatly from the ordinary eskimo type they swarmed out and surrounded doc and the capturing party of medicine men doc expected his size to excite some astonishment it did but not as much as he had anticipated the little fellows seemed fully aware that the world held bigger mortals than themselves a few minutes later doc saw the reason a group of four normalsized men appeared they were clad warmly in furs but each man carried a long length of what must be ordinary ships anchor chain the ends of these chains were fastened about the mens ankles it was an improvised and no doubt effective variation of the ballandchain the wrinkled little chief medicine man prodded doc and indicated the four men with the chains at least one of whom was white the other three apparently being ordinary eskimos they said the medicine man in bad viking were visitors like yourself that did not sound so good doc was led to a square block of a house there was no door no windows a pole was leaned against the wall and doc was persuaded to climb to the roof the roof had two holes out of one smoke came the other was larger doc was shoved down it into a black rather chilly and smelly interior ill be superamalgamated a scholastic voice greeted him there was an extremely large blubber lamp possibly the local version of a heating stove burning under the small hole and it gave off some light and heat in addition to much smoke by that fitful gleam doc discerned the bony johnny the gaunt geologist and archaeologist was hugging the blubber heater he still wore nothing but his red underwear it is a wonder you dont freeze to death doc told him i am convinced i have said johnny who made it a point not to use his big words when talking to doc savage i have been running all over the north pole dressed like this why i am not dead i dont know it is really remarkable not when you considered johns whalebone constitution doc reflected what happened to you doc asked johnny told him the recital missed no details consequently required some time i eventually wandered to a spot where these little fellows saw me johnny finished we had a bit of a battle but i was almost frozen they threw me in here i gather that they are going to tie a piece of anchor chain to me and use me to perform useful tasks they seem to have the same ideas about me doc admitted quietly it appears they keep slaves johnny said every one who drifts in here winds up doing that i believe they have some sailors quite a few eskimos who got inquisitive and poked their kayaks in here there are also some indians and a hunter and prospector or so who ventured down over the cliffs you seem to have gotten quite a bit of information doc said oh theyre willing enough to talk theyre not bad fellows in spite of that slave business theyre even rather proud of their small size seem to think it makes them superior doc savage looked up a ring of faces was around the roof hole watching their small size is due to diet probably doc said theyre thinboned johnny admitted i found out that they get their water from a spring there is only the one spring they brought me some of the water he nodded at a bucket made of sealskin stretched over a wooden framework doc went over and tasted some of the water this probably explains it he said the stuff seems to have a mineral content which might easily stunt growth its their private sacred spring thank goodness johnny grunted they gave me that water as a special favor their slaves get melted snow to drink during the summer theres a rivulet or two over the cliffs that explains why the vikings werent stunted vikings this is amazing johnny murmured hard to believe it seems that centuries ago a colonizing expedition of vikings in two dragon ships came in here and were captured theyre here yet their descendants i gather there is not over half a dozen of them now however they must have been sturdy lads the little fellows even speak their language and they cant speak any other tongue except that gibberish of their own doc savage said suddenly kettlers crowd captured monk ham and renny that stunned johnny he groped for words and found none they were in three planes doc said any sign of them i heard planes johnny said hoarsely that was while it was snowing they went on north must have missed this place we must get out of here doc said he stood up eyed the hole in the roof the little men there seemed to fathom his thoughts for they made angry admonishing noises and shook knives short spears and clubs all viking weapons they still have a lot of the weapons brought here by those shipwrecked norsemen johnny said quietly doc paced the dank smoky chamber what about kettler he demanded kettler and his gang were shipwrecked here johnny said the little fellows told me that kettler was a bad actor and a talker he got some of the little fellows a few bad ones to help him they stole a viking ship and got away they took one of the viking girls she knew astronomical navigation those norsemen were clever the girl was to be used to guide them back to this place there is something here that kettler wants and can only get with an armed force so kettler had some little men with him doc said grimly that explains some queer things that happened in new york you mean the attacks you mentioned and the alarm clocks johnny queried yes doc said the little men got into my quarters and into monks laboratory they used the alarm clocks to make a noise that covered their movements while they hid after throwing the knives and short spears probably peabody put them up to that johnny squinted at doc savage through the smoke from the big blubber lamp just when did you suspect peabody and carleth he asked doc savage did not answer immediately in new york doc savage said at carleths house we had gone there hunting ham i used a trick to get a chance to search the house in the basement was a radio set and while i was examining it a man came in and i caught him i have not told this to any one for the simple reason that an excited outcry from the small men on the roof interrupted him listen johnny exploded the moan of airplane engines sounded in the distance chapter death in qui doc savage whipped quickly to a position under the roof hole none of the little men were looking down now but were staring upward into the gaudy display of the borealis the aerial pyrotechnics made an amazing background for the three dark noisy planes to the midget men who had patently never seen a plane before the scene was highly dramatic the three planes swooped low heading for the little village of conglomerate norse indian and eskimo architecture the small men on the roof broke and fled shouting doc savage glanced at johnny as if to point out the inadequateness of the redflannel underwear sadly torn as an arctic garb i know what youre thinking johnny stood up i didnt freeze before so why should i now doc savage stripped off his parka tossed it to johnny the strips of blanket which johnny had tied about his feet and legs were still in place furnishing some protection for those members thanks said johnny doc savage sank under the roof hole then shot upward and his hands clamped the edge he was outside with flashing speed the three planes were off in the north again apparently trying to select a spot for a landing and none of the small men were on the roof johnny having pulled the parka on clambered up to docs side what is the program he asked monk ham and renny are aboard those planes doc said weve got to do something about that if it is not too late the bronze man surveyed the village as he had expected the populace even the slaves had gathered outside the wall where a better view could be had of the planes doc and johnny dropped off the roof and ran in the opposite direction a few dogs barked at them but that did not draw attention they clambered over the wall and dived into brush and stones they are rather careless with their prisoners doc said johnny running easily replied they do not have to worry those cliffs are a rather effective barrier to prevent escape and no one is going to tackle the sea in a small boat at this time of year the cliffs supposed to be unscalable doc queried they angled to the left circling back around the village not exactly said johnny i understand that the midgets have climbed them and a few slaves have escaped but i imagine it did not do them much good civilization is hundreds of miles away over frightfully barren country they were past the village now undiscovered and heading for the cultivated area it was probably there that the planes would attempt to land johnny who had the peculiar ability to carry on a conversation in an almost perfectly normal voice while running at top speed continued imparting what he had learned the little fellows used to send out hunting parties beyond the cliffs he said but they were no match for the indians who seem to be rather fierce the small chaps concluded they would be better off if they kept to themselves and did not let the outer world know they were here that you know is not an uncommon attitude among primitive people doc said you learned a great deal oh theyre little windbags said johnny those vikings they captured centuries ago proved to be their alltime prize capture of slaves they have legends about it they thought i was another viking because i could speak a little of the tongue they were glad to get me i suspect look doc said the planes were coming down the three crafts had selected as doc had anticipated the comparatively level cultivated area which was under a smooth blanket of snow it was the only available spot the little bay being full of floating ice and partially frozen over and the beach entirely too rocky doc and johnny were well to one side they could hear sounds which indicated the little men were working through the snow toward the ships a shot cracked a ragged fusillade followed there were small screams angry shrieks devils johnny gritted kettler and his crowd have started killing doc savage kept on for some hundreds of yards then veered to approach the planes from behind fight noises had increased gunfire was almost continuous the small men after the fashion of primitives were doing much shouting as they fought there are the planes doc breathed finally the ships had been landed into the wind but had then been taxied back to the other side of the field on the chance that a hurried takeoff might be necessary doc had foreseen this he and johnny were not fifty yards from the craft kettler peabody and carleth along with most of their crowd were on the opposite side of the field fighting the small men had prudently taken to the brush and boulders where their primitive weapons had a slight chance they did not seem to be doing as badly for themselves as might be expected because they are small does not mean they are weaklings johnny muttered but they havent got a chance peabody had left guards at the planes obviously these were both watching the ships and guarding the prisoners there arose much shouting from across the field where the fight was in progress kettler and peabody were squawling at those left behind with the planes doc distinguished their words the fighters wanted ammunition it seemed they had charged with only what they had in their pockets and that was running low the men at the planes became very busy hauling out ammunition boxes well try it now doc said and his voice was almost a chill nothingness they crawled through the shrubbery the bushes the men about the plane were entirely preoccupied with what they were doing frenzied squawks from peabody and kettler across the clearing hurried them peabody and kettler were fighting in the open taking their chances carleth was in the rear crouching behind a rock looking at the planes frequently as if he would like to come back some small men were fighting other small men they were the little fellows who had thrown in with kettler doc savage had one of the men at the planes down before he was seen he laid the victim up with that peculiar pressure on the spinal nerve centers at which he was so adept there were three others doc rushed caught one then got another who had fallen over an ammunition case neither was a weakling they went over and over in a cloud of snow johnny wrapped his bony length about the survivor in one of the planes monk began to flounder about and howl delighted at what was happening angry because he was missing a fight doc had trouble getting his foes by the neck he changed tactics and banged their heads together they went limp when be stood up johnny had strangled his man into insensibility turn monk and the others loose doc rapped without a word johnny dived into the ship which held the prisoners doc savage lunged to the nearest motor ripped up the hood and began tearing at the ignition system he loosened certain very essential parts carried them with him took the second motor a third removing parts from each it would have been better if there had been more time but kettlers men were already shooting yelling and running back across the clearing monk fell out of the plane limbs stiffened by being long bound renny followed him then ham gather up the ammunition doc shouted without asking questions they started shouldering the heavy ammo boxes it was easy to pick them out they were plainly marked doc savage finished with the last of the motors and had a tangle of ignition parts in his hands it was hardly likely they could be replaced he seized the last of the ammo cases they ran kettler and his crowd kept up a rattling fire but were having their troubles with the deep snow a bullet lodged in the ammo box monk carried and several cartridges exploded blowing the lid off the box monk startled dropped the box and ran but when all the cartridges did not go ran back and got the case slapping his side where a bullet had grooved that was the only difficulty they suffered before reaching shelter the girl ingra had one of the heavy cases and she began to fall behind doc relieved her of the case which somehow seemed to pique her they ran with deadly earnestness the cold air was agony in their lungs sounds indicated the small men were pursuing kettlers crowd hampering them shooting was steady there were more than a few mortal screams kettlers gang reached the plane monk grinned all over his homely face at the burst of profanity that arose as if it were a beautiful sound kettler tried to follow them to get his ammunition back but the small men had surged down the side of the clearing and cut him off they fought among the trees and rocks then kettler growing suddenly cautious ordered his men to form a compact group and tried to return to the planes they found a swarm of little men about the ships fired a few shots then angled off to the right and took up a position atop a hillock which had been swept bare of snow they stopped there ringed in by small foes who after some of them had been shot were not idiotic enough to try a charge doc and his party got to another high spot where they could see what was going on and stopped to breathe to watch they were rather pleased with themselves that feeling evaporated when they saw what was happening to the planes the little men were tearing the ships to pieces they were using clubs rocks to beat in the wings and fuselage coverings they were like small ants dismembering a trio of captured hornets many times their size doc shouted the girl ingra yelled it had no effect a horde of the little men climbed on the plane wings and jumped up and down until the wings buckled holy cow renny rumbled we gotta stop that he started forward doc stopped him the little men are maddened the bronze man said you cannot blame them keep away from them they might kill you renny scowled at the distant planes not one of which was intact maybe we can put em together later he muttered if we cant were in a pickle what i mean how we gonna get out of this place rennys worst apprehensions were exceeded the small men having dismembered the planes by sheer force of numbers now began hauling the parts toward the sea they even took the motors tying lines to the heavy things and a score or more of them seizing each line they dumped the parts over a small cliff into swiftmoving tidal current the motors of course sank but the wing assemblies floated away before they filled and disappeared renny groaned now we are up against it chapter ultimatum the demolition and disposition of the planes which the primitive little dwarf men seemed to consider devil birds in part responsible for their woes had the effect of dispelling some of the mad rage the small fellows stopped their insensate screeching and in grim silence gathered up their dead this quiet fooled kettler and his men into trying to make a break from their knoll which was a bad move indeed for they were set upon fiercely lost two men and were glad to get back in the open where their guns could be used most effectively shooting during this fray was not nearly as free as during the previous scrap complete silence fell when kettlers crowd were back on their prominence no bullets were being wasted doc savage and his group fully rested now worked cautiously in the direction of the village they still carried the ammunition boxes when they were within half a mile of the settlement still undiscovered doc called a halt and directed all to conceal themselves in the drifted snow but however to keep a sharp lookout you doc told ingra in halting viking will accompany me what are you going to do she demanded attempt to enlist ourselves on the side of the small men doc explained you will probably not have any luck the young woman surmised the little men are very proud they will resent the idea that they need help but doc savage had a system for getting around that he advanced with no show of hostility until he and ingra were surrounded and taken into the village they were led past a group of the normalsized slaves who wore chains and one of these shouted gladly at doc the individual was a frenchcanadian trapper and he did not seem as gloomy as one might expect they keep me by thees places maybe ten year oui he shouted she not so bad as maybe yo tink they tak off the chains when we ave not the work to do she not worth get killed for to try to get away lak some do thanks doc told him doc and ingra were brought before the medicine men who seemed to be the chiefs as well they wore sour expressions when he started talking ingra stood back and listened her features radiated skepticism as doc began but that faded to admiration the bronze man had wisely taken a meek attitude his manner indicating that the small men were his masters as they indeed were at the moment doc pointed out quietly that he had stolen the ammunition of kettlers gang he had to explain what ammunition was and did it in a subtle fashion which gave the impression that the small men not knowing that it was not ignorance but really a matter hardly worth the notice of such remarkable fellows his oration was long and probably as psychologically clever as any talk he had ever made and he wound up by stating that he could plainly see the small men did not need his help but that he would consider it a great favor on their part if he would be permitted to help fight their enemies who were also his foes it was blarney pure and simple but it worked doc was informed he had permission to bring his friends to the village and that if they behaved themselves they would be allowed to fight after hostilities were over and these enemies of qui settled with doc was further advised that he would be given the great privilege of becoming a slave of the qul he thanked thera with a straight face ingra went back with doc to get his friends the young woman was impressed your tongue is the mightiest of your weapons she informed him doc reached his group and explained the situation particularly did he explain it to monk who was a bluff soul and liable to fly off the handle at the idea of being treated as an inferior by ignorant and somewhat smelly little men whose average weight was probably a fifth of his own k monk grumbled but its against my principles you havent got any principles ham told him and you havent got a valet monk sneered ham shut up the small men took the boxes of ammunition away and doc after some roundabout inquiring learned they intended to store it in a house where it would be safe to the disgust of doc and the others disgust which they did not voice lest they offend their hosts the bronze man and his aides were bundled into the establishment where the slaves were kept this was a walled enclosure constructed of stones and mortar with needlepointed hardwood thorns inserted in the mortar points downward the thorns being stout enough to afford a grip but sharp enough and plentiful enough to make climbing the wall a horrible job inside the pen the enforced laborers had been permitted to build huts to suit their fancy the eskimos tended to ice igloos for the winter and sod huts for the summer the indians had wikiups tepee affairs and the frenchcanadian had built himself a little stone house that might have been transplanted from his fatherland the other slaves were sociable souls anxious to talk they were surprisingly resigned to their lot and did not seem unhappy the descendants of the vikings in particular were full of boyish good humor doc was introduced if that was what it could be termed to ingras father a strapping brother and another stalwart young norseman who bent many a fond gaze on the young woman this last came to the attention of monk competition he said gloomily well ill give him a run for his money that young lady would make a swell partner if we had the bad luck of being stuck here for good ham overheard that looked wise and a bit later was discovered presenting ingra with his wrist watch a very fine jeweled gaudy which ham had preserved from kettlers men by dropping it inside his tall moccasins monk was not the only aggravated observer the young norseman suitor looked daggers that gave monk an idea and he singled out johnny teach me the viking words for he has a wife and thirteen children monk requested johnny innocently complied monk repeated them several times got the words down pat then went over to the strapping norseman lad pointed at ham and laboriously recited the words the norseman lost no time he strode toward ham collared him and shoved him away from ingra ham resented this took a poke at the norseman and was knocked head over heels monk went off into a corner with his mirth ingra with feminine contrariness made a bigger fuss than ever over ham shots banked frequently in the distance there was not enough of them to indicate an engagement of consequence every one seemed to be marking time doc savage talked to the frenchcanadian kettler ver bad msieu said the trapper me i ave only hope he ees get wheep doc savage held the same views he was becoming somewhat impatient having hoped that the small men would deign to accept his aid before this but it seemed that the little fellows were blissfully confident of taking care of matters themselves they might too if there was not an upset there was an upset it came hours later when the occupants of the slave compound had settled down to get some very necessary sleep it started with an uproar shots ripped out screams a machine gun gobbled and gobbled and gobbled doc savage scrambled out of the frenchcanadians rock house hospitality of which he had accepted and sprinted for the wall he began breaking off the thorns the uproar in the village was bloodcurdling the crash of rifle fire was earsplitting and the shrieks not pleasant listening bullets whined spanged rocks ricocheted everywhere doc got the thorns broken off nearly to the wall top then leaped and managed to grab an outthrust of stone from which he broke off more thorns then grasped the top of the wall a small man came rushing up clubbed his hands before he could hoist himself to the top and forced him to drop back the fighting continued those in the compound were helpless to take part ablebodied guards on the wall were soon replaced with others who had been wounded and were unfit for the more fierce fighting that looks bad monk muttered ingra shouted questions at the new guards and the answers she received explained what had happened some of the little men fighting with kettlers gang had friends in the village she said they tipped the others off to where the ammunition was hidden peabody and kettler and carleth got it now theyre slaughtering the little men there was only one point where the compound wall could be scaled the spot where doc had broken off the thorns they tried again and again to get out there the little men from the secure footing of the wall top beat them back the captives tried making living pyramids at other parts of the wall that did not work either they decided to try several points at once then unexpectedly the fighting ended a grisly sort of quiet followed lasting some thirty minutes during which every one in the compound felt that something ominous was gathering even the natural surroundings seemed to partake of the evil air for the sound of the sea was not as loud as usual except to the south where it pounded hollowly against the cliffs then small men came marching to the compound they shouted commands that made the viking girl ingra gasp out in horror what is it monk exploded peabodys crowd has come out on top doc savage said grimly they have made the little men of qui agree to let them take what they came here for repair the dragon ship in the shrine cavern and sail it away monk moistened his lips thats not so terrible that is not all of it doc told him monk swallowed and looked a question kettler and peabody have been given the privilege of killing us doc said chapter the doublecrosser if doc savage seized upon any momentary hopes of escaping before peabodys gang arrived to gather the fruits of their victory the bronze man was thwarted because normalsized men carrying rifles and machine guns appeared outside the compound peabody rotund pink and happy led them and coarsevoiced kettler at his heels because there was no other sane course doc and his aides stepped out when they were ordered to do so let em have it here kettler suggested peabody hesitated then shook his head might stir these little runts up again lets get em away from the village kettler was suddenly smitten with an idea he snapped his fingers have the runts show us where they keep those special offerings to their great spirit he said well get the stuff and leave this bronze guy and his pals there sort of a trade its damn foolishness said the practical peabody but all right doc savage and the others were formed in a line they were not bound although they were searched very thoroughly run if you wanta said kettler thatd make it easier on our consciences doc did not run neither did his men they were marched out of the village thence southward guided by sullen medicine men who did not come above any ones belt they walked for so long that peabody and kettler began to hear complaints from their followers who loudly declared they were tired what with the fighting and all and anyway they had a hunch the medicine men were misleading them kettler largely by signs let the medicine men understand they would not live long once trickery was evident monk shuffling along with doc remarked i dont see that guy carleth wonder if he got killed in the fighting they trod through brush thickets shuffled among boulders wallowed in snow not once did a chance for escape present although they watched assiduously for one however small monk grumbled wonder what theyre going after the way turned wilder they were entering a wedge bounded on one side by the sea turbulent and ice caked and on the other side by the cliffs sheer unclimbable peabody became more ugly in his signaling to the medicine men they in turn put more vehemence into their attempts to indicate everything was all right they smiled forced horrible smiles for all of them had seen these fiends shoot down friends and relatives and ran on ahead pointing the spot they indicated was a small round clearing among naked trees and evergreen brush in the center of this was erected a circular stone platform on which stood a carved totem of wood the medicine men pointed at the totem jabbered hell peabody gritted they dont know what we want wait growled kettler lets look around try moving the totem there was a stir in the brush near by causing several guns to shift in that direction thorpe carleth stumbled out and confronted them he sat his glasses on his nose and looked at them foolishly i got lost said carleth during the fighting peabody cursed him youve got lost in all of our fights he said im gonna have things to say about that kettler let out a yell he had shoved the totem and it had moved lifting also the rock in which it was set the men ran forward with excited cries but not all of them enough kept their guns alert to hold doc and his aides in their tracks kettler and the others were levering up the stones this uncovered dry leaves and they dug in furiously tearing the leaves aside scattering them over the snow kettler emitted a new bawl of joy and struggled with something that was heavy it was an old ships safe complete with the straps with which it had once been fastened to a bulllhead they worked at the door got it open and dug out some fistfuls of coins packets of ancient paper money a copperbound chest followed next it fell to pieces while they were trying to get it out and some of the contents spilled there were jewels some unmounted the majority in knife and sword hilts and inset in various pieces of armor the stuff those old viking freebooters had on their dragon ships when they were wrecked here peabody chortled boy is this something as antiques the junk is worth no telling how much its value as metal and jewels they continued to dig in the leaves they excavated a shower of small skeletons and heaved them away into the snow the medicine men shifted and muttered at the desecration and doc caught enough of their mumbling to understand that this was the burying place of the medicine men of the past kettlers crowd was not satisfied with all they brought up there was for instance much copper which of course was hardly worth packing back to civilization and which was the more aggravating because kettlers men had difficulty telling it from the gold in some cases there were old ships kettles binnacles railings mostly of copper but some of brass it was obvious that the small men of qui having learned yellow metal was prized by men of the outer world had failed to distinguish between gold and brass and copper also between silver and lead it developed for they found a number of tons of ballast lead taken from some ship kettler finally stood back this is it he said now lets get this doc savage out of the way for good he waved at men he must have selected previously as executioners they lifted their weapons a grim wildly determined voice shrieked dont do that kettler kettler spun so did every one else carleth stood at the clearing edge whence he had retreated to produce from where he had hidden it no doubt before he showed himself a few minutes ago a machine gun carleth had the machine gun trained on kettler and the others stand still all of you carleth screamed vehemence of his yell shook carleth and his glasses fell off doc savage moved like he never had before carleths glasses falling off decided him carleth was so nearsighted he could not tell friend from foe at twenty feet doc whipped at peabody hit the man and knocked him into the loose leaves that filled the pit under the shrine monk and the others exploded making for the gang who had been on the point of executing them a gun went off that was rennys victim who fired in the air convulsively the machine gun let out a stuttering uproar men shrieked and cursed and some fell the others recoiled wildly and dived for the spot where they had put their arms aside while they unearthed the wealth under the shrine it was an unfortunate move for them putting their guns aside for it enabled doc savage and his men in the final analysis to make their escape the only ones with guns were the executioners and docs first wild charge with his men put these out of commission the bronze man went on and reached carleths side about the same moment the machine gun stopped ammunition out carleth shrieked i only had part of a drum run for it doc directed and pitched out of the clearing the bronze mans aides followed him there was only a fractional moment in which to act for kettlers crowd were falling upon their weapons doc and his aides did however succeed in getting into the boulders before shooting really started lets go the bronze man commanded grimly if they overhaul us now were in a pickle they had started south toward the narrowing v of the cliffs and they kept going in that direction knowing that to veer to either side would mean they would be cut off but aware also of a horrible certainty of being trapped ahead surprise fortunately had given them a little advantage the cliffs were close now their shadow made almost darkness about them and this handicapped them a bit but handicapped also their pursuers who were now following by vision their footprints rather than sound they came shortly to the spot where the cliff breasted the sea and waves smashed with appalling force against stone the tide was out but coming in with the amazing speed characteristic of this region the tides here were not as great as in the bay of fundy to the south where the rise and fall is often twoscore feet but it was considerable there was they saw a strip of sand along the foot of the cliff as yet uncovered by water waves however crawled up fearsomely to the stone wall come on doc directed he ran into the water it was very cold when it was up around his knees he turned to the left as if heading back along the beach in the direction they had come we wont make it monk exploded theyll see us trick doc said and waded out deeper then he turned sharply back and headed for the line of cliffs we may be able to locate a ledge above the level of high tide he explained thats our only chance theyve got guns the sand was hard it had frozen while the tide was out and it was slick going time after time they fell the strip of sand welcomingly wide at first rapidly narrowed but that was because the tide was coming in fast were liable to be cut off monk groaned fact is i dont believe we could make it back this water is too darn cold for anybody to swim in they had gone fully half a mile without a sign of a break in the cliffs waves were breaking over them now smashing them about soaking them there doc rapped and pointed it was a ledge amply wide but some fifty feet up the surface of the cliff sloped was rugged and could be climbed doc mounted assisting the others to go up as he did they dropped on the ledge soaked breathless and looked back peabody kettler and their men must have been taken in by the fake tracks which they had no doubt seen in the kneedeep water they could be heard shouting in another ten minutes the tide will have that strip of land covered monk grunted that means well be safe for at least several hours carleth was by far the most exhausted man in the group the cold air had burned his lung tissue and he hacked and strangled several times breathe inside your parka monk suggested carleth did that and caught his breath guy you sure done us a turn back there monk told carleth just what made you do it carleth seemed vastly surprised he looked at doc savage i did not tell them carleth the bronze man said huh monk exploded tell us what remember when we were at carleths house and i faked the thrown knife gag to give me a chance to search the premises doc queried sure i caught carleth in the basement putting the radio out of commission doc said that proved absolutely that he was one of the gang holy cow boomed renny who had overheard you got wise that early in the game carleth was sick of the whole thing doc said the killing of hams apartment house superintendent had decided carleth to quit the game he told me this there in the basement of the house and i believed him he told me the whole story he offered to string along and help me i took him up and i must confess i was not a great deal of use carleth muttered monk looked somewhat injured but why didnt you tell us doc he demanded carleths life was at stake and more the bronze man said quietly the slightest hint of what he was doing and he would have been killed monk grumbled but we could have kept it quiet doc smiled it was rarely that he did that it was much more convincing as it was he said monk finally grinned yeah doc youre right at that the homely chemist eyed carleth say that long yarn about you and peabody bein held prisoners in your house was a lie eh of course said carleth monk waved his arms so that circulation would not slacken too much it was not so cold but that they could stand it with precautions monk also did some thinking it was rarely that doc savage did as he had done with this man carleth it was a risk the bronze man staking so much on character judgment or had it been a risk carleth would hardly have dared tell his fellows what he had done but studying carleth monk abruptly decided carleth was sincere right now the man looked happy as if he were helping do the world a good turn a roaming bullet distracted monks attention the bit of lead glanced off the cliff above them went singing nastily out to sea kettlers crowd had discovered them kettler bellowed great oaths which reached entirely to where doc and his aides crouched peabody came running and waved his arms beckoning urging every one forward they charged onto the narrow ribbon of beach under the cliffs traversing approximately a hundred yards peabody kettler and their crowd had to cross a low spot where the tide had already covered the sand and was smashing against the beach they splashed through the water was nearly to their waists holy cow renny boomed that was dry when we went through johnny said tides usually do not come in steadily but in three surges during which the water rises much more doc savage was shouting he had made a funnel of his metallic hands and he lifted his remarkable voice to its greatest volume he was directing a warning at peabody and kettler go back he called you cant make it hell we cant peabody bellowed he thought doc was threatening him whereas the bronze man in accordance with his policy of seeing no lives taken that might be saved was conveying a warning peabody himself fired a shot the others with him did likewise and the storm of lead thus unleashed drove doc and those with him flat on the ledge there they lay not even lifting their heads until a man shrieked on the tiny beach not far away then they chanced a glance there was no beach now waves were piling in offshore there was a tide rip and this tossed up waves that came lunging in furiously the man who had shrieked was in the water being lifted battered against the stone carried back flung against the cliff again a moment later another man was off his feet then peabody and kettler went almost together as they turned and tried to fight their way back the water was cold enough to chill the strongest swim men into a near paralysis and even had any of them been able to keep afloat the waves would have driven them against the rocks it became certain that they were to drown to the last man if we could save them doc savage said slowly we would monk looked at carleth doc would monk said hes funny that way chapter war clouds four months new york city was treated to a little mystery which for a few days got a good deal of newspaper attention a viking dragon ship was discovered tied to a brooklyn dock one morning the craft undoubtedly had been rebuilt in part within recent months and bore evidences of a long rough sea voyage searchers found no one aboard nor did any one ever appear to state where the unique craft had come from nor was there a claim of ownership made the services of that learned and bigworded archaeologist william harper littlejohn were solicited and he after due examination declared the dragon ship a genuine viking product most of it hundreds of years old but some of it modern repair work as on another occasion the more playful tabloids translated johnnys big words for their readers the dragon ship was taken to a museum and placed beside that other dragon ship which had appeared so mysteriously in long island sound johnny had a very good reason for not telling all he knew the little men of qui had of course elected to stay in their retreat most of the slaves had elected to remain also among them this to monks chagrin ingra doc savage had been the guiding medium in a mutual understanding between the men of qui and their slaves before he left he had in fact succeeded in carrying out a lincolnesque role in that the servitors had been emancipated for the future this arrangement had seemed eminently satisfactory to every one some of the impressed servitors among them the frenchcanadian trapper had returned with doc some eskimos and indians had been returned to their tribes to tell tales which no one believed the men of qui would benefit little if civilization did know of them and certainly unknown they would not be exploited by smooth talking gogetters they were happiest where they were as they were there was some talk in antique circles during the next few months about certain very valuable and undoubtedly genuine viking items which had come on the market the money from the antiques doc savage employed to purchase a shipload of commoner conveniences of civilization and this was delivered to qui by men who knew how to keep their mouths shut the first shipped did not take all of the money there was more for the years following the end
