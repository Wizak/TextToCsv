 chapter one at kirrin cottage i feel as if weve been at kirrin for about a month already said anne stretching herself out on the warm sand and digging her toes in and weve only just come yes its funny how we settle down at kirrin so quickly said dick we only came yesterday and i agree with you anne it seems as if weve been here ages i love kirrin i hope this weather lasts out the three weeks weve got left of the holiday said julian rolling away from timmy who was pawing at him trying to make him play go away timmy youre too energetic weve bathed had a run played ball and thats quite enough for a little while go and play with the crabs woof said timmy disgusted then he pricked up his ears as he heard a tinkling noise from the promenade he barked again trust old timmy to hear the icecream man said dick anyone want an icecream everyone did so anne collected the money and went off to get the icecreams timmy close at her heels she came back with five cartons of icecream timmy jumping up at her all the way i cant think of anything nicer than lying down on hot sand with the sun on every part of my body eating an icecream and knowing there are still three weeks holiday in front of us at kirrin too said dick yes its heaven said anne its a pity your father has visitors today george who are they have we got to dress up for them i dont think so said george timmy youve eaten your icecream in one gulp what a frightful waste when are these people coming asked dick about half past twelve said george theyre coming to lunch but thank goodness father told mother he didnt want a pack of children gobbling all round him and his friends at lunch so mother said we could go in at half past twelve say howdoyoudo and then clear off again with a picnic basket i must say i think your father has some good ideas at times said dick i suppose they are some scientist friends of his yes fathers working on some great scheme with these two men said george one of thems a genius apparently and has hit on an idea thats too wonderful for words what kind of modern idea is it said julian lazily holding out his fingertips for timmy to lick off smears of icecream some spaceship to take us on daytrips to the moon or some new bomb to set off or no i think its something that will give us heat light and power for almost nothing said george i heard father say that its the simplest and best idea anyone had ever worked out and hes awfully excited about it he called it a gift to mankind and said he was proud to have anything to do with it uncle quentin is very clever isnt he said anne georges father was the uncle of julian dick and anne and they were cousins to george short for georgina once more they had all come down to kirrin for part of their holiday the last three weeks georges father was certainly clever all the same george sometimes wished that he was a more ordinary parent one who would play cricket or tennis with children and not be so horrified at shouting and laughter and silly jokes he always made a fuss when georges mother insisted that george should have her cousins to stay noisy rowdy yelling kids he said i shall lock myself in my study and stay there all right dear said his wife you do that but you know perfectly well that they will be out practically all day long george must have other children to stay sometimes and her three cousins are the nicest ones i know george loves having them here the four cousins were very careful not to upset georges father he had a very hot temper and shouted at the top of his voice when he was angry still as julian said he really couldnt help being a genius and geniuses werent ordinary people especially scientific geniuses who might easily blow up the whole world in a fit of temper said julian solemnly well i wish he wouldnt keep blowing me up if i let a door bang or set timmy barking said george thats only to keep his hand in said dick just a bit of practice at blowing up dont be an ass said george does anyone feel like another bathe no but i dont mind going and lying in the very edge of the sea and letting the waves there just curl over me said dick im absolutely baked lying here it sounds lovely said anne but the hotter you are the colder the water feels come on said dick getting up i shall hang my tongue out and pant like timmy soon they all went down to the edge of the water and lay down flat in the tiny curling waves there anne gave a little shriek it feels icy i knew it would i cant lie down in it yet i can only sit up however they were soon all lying fulllength in the shallow waves at the edge of the sea sliding down the sand a little every now and again as the tide ebbed farther from them it was lovely to feel the cool fingers of the sea on every part of them suddenly timmy barked he was not in the water with them but was just at the edge he thought that lying down in the sea was quite unnecessary george raised her head whats the matter she said theres nobody coming but dick had heard something too he sat up hurriedly gosh i believe thats someone ringing a bell for us it sounds like the bell from kirrin cottage but it cant be dinnertime yet said anne in dismay it must be said julian leaping up blow this is what comes of leaving my watch in my blazer pocket i ought to have remembered that time at kirrin goes more quickly than anywhere else he ran up the beach to his blazer and took his wristwatch from the pocket its one oclock he yelled in fact its a minute past buck up well be awfully late blow said george mother wont be at all pleased with us because those two scientist people will be there they collected their blazers and tore up the beach it was not very far to kirrin cottage fortunately and they were soon running in at the front gate there was a very large car outside one of the latest american models but there was no time to examine it they trailed in quietly at the garden door georges mother met them looking rather cross sorry aunt fanny said julian please forgive us it was my fault entirely im the only one with a watch are we awfully late asked anne have you begun lunch yet would you like us just to take our picnic basket and slip off without interrupting no said her aunt fortunately your uncle is still shut up in his study with his friends ive sounded the gong once but i dont expect theyve even heard it i rang the bell for you because i thought that any moment they might come out and your uncle would be cross if you werent there just to say howdoyoudo but fathers friends dont usually want to see us said george surprised well one of them has a girl a bit younger than you george younger than anne too i think said her mother and he specially asked to see you all because his daughter is going to your school next term wed better buck up and have a bit of a wash then said julian but at that very moment the study door opened and his uncle quentin came out with two men hallo are these your kids said one of the men stopping theyve just come in from the beach said aunt fanny hurriedly im afraid they are not really fit to be seen i great snakes said the man dont you dare to apologise for kids like these i never saw such a fine lot in my life theyre wunnerful he spoke with an american accent and beamed all over his face the children warmed to him at once he turned to georges father these all yours he asked i bet youre proud of them how did they get that tan they look like red indians my my wish my berta looked like that theyre not all mine said uncle quentin looking quite horrified at the thought only this one is mine and he put his hand on georges shoulder the others are nephews and a niece well i must say youve got a fine boy said the american ruffling georges short curls as a rule she hated people who did that but because he mistook her for a boy she grinned happily my girls going to your school he said to anne give her a bit of help will you shell be scared stiff at first of course i will said anne taking a liking to the huge loudvoiced american he didnt look a bit like a scientist the other man did though he was roundshouldered and wore owllike glasses and as uncle quentin often did he stared into the distance as if he was not hearing a single word that anyone said uncle quentin thought this gossiping had lasted long enough he waved the children away come and have lunch he said to the other men the second man followed him at once but the big american stayed behind he thrust his hands into his pocket and brought out a pound note he gave it to anne spend that on yourselves he said and be kind to my berta wont you he disappeared into the diningroom and shut the door with a loud bang goodness what will father say to a bang like that said george with a sudden giggle i like him dont you that must be his car outside i cant imagine the other man even riding a bicycle let alone driving a car children take your picnic basket and go said aunt fanny urgently i must run and see that everything is all right she thrust a big basket into julians hands and disappeared into the diningroom julian grinned as he felt the weight of the basket come along he said this feels good back to the beach everyone chapter two a visitor in the night the five were on the beach in two minutes and julian undid the basket it was full of neatly packed sandwiches and packets of biscuits and chocolate a bag contained ripe plums and there were two bottles of lemonade homemade said dick taking it out and icycold and whats this a fruit cake a whole fruit cake were in luck woof said timmy approvingly and sniffled inside the basket wrapped in brown paper were some biscuits and a bone together with a small pot of paste george undid the packet i packed these for you timmy she said say thank you timmy licked her so lavishly that she cried out for mercy pass me the towel ju she said timmys made my face all wet get away now timmy youve thanked me quite enough get away i said how can i spread paste on your biscuits if you stick your nose into the pot all the time you spoil timmy dreadfully said anne all right all right you neednt scowl at me george i agree that hes worth spoiling take your bone a bit farther away from me tim its smelly they were soon eating sardine sandwiches with tomatoes and eggandlettuce sandwiches after that then they started on the fruit cake and the lemonade i cant think why people ever have tablemeals when they can have picnics said dick think of uncle and aunt and those two men tucking into a hot meal indoors on a day like this phew i liked that big american said george aha we all know why said dick annoyingly he thought you were a boy will you ever grow out of that george timmys trying to get at the cake said anne quick george stop him they all lay back on the sand after their picnic and julian began a long story of some trick that he and dick had played on their formmaster at school he was most annoyed because nobody laughed at the funny part and sat up to see why all asleep he said in disgust then he cocked his head just as timmy pricked up his ears a loud roaring noise came to him just the american revving up his car do you think tim said julian the boy stood up and saw the great car tearing down the sea road the day was too hot to do anything but laze the five were quite content to do that on their first day together again soon they would want to plan all kinds of things but the first day at kirrin was a day for picking up old threads teasing timmy getting into the feel of things again as dick said dick and julian had been abroad for four weeks and anne had been away to camp and had had a school friend to stay with her at home afterwards george had been alone at kirrin so it was wonderful to all the five to meet together once more for three whole summer weeks at kirrin too kirrin by the sea with its lovely beach its fine boating and its exciting little island across kirrin bay as usual the first day or two passed in a kind of dream and then the children began to plan exciting things to do well go to kirrin island again said dick weve not been there for ages well go fishing in lobster cove said julian well go and explore some of the caves in the cliffs said george i meant to do that these hols but somehow its no fun going alone on the third day just as they were finishing making their beds the telephone bell rang ill go yelled julian to his aunt and went to answer it an urgent voice spoke at the other end whos that oh you julian youre quentins nephew arent you listen tell your uncle im coming over tonight yes tonight latish say tell him to wait up for me its important but wont you speak to him yourself said julian surprised ill fetch him if youll but the line had gone dead julian was puzzled the man hadnt even given his name but julian had recognised the voice it was the big cheery american who had come to see his uncle two days before what had happened what was all the excitement about he went to find his uncle but he was not in his study so he found his aunt instead aunt fanny he said i think that was the big american on the phone the one who came to lunch the other day he said i was to tell uncle quentin that he was coming here tonight late he said and that uncle was to wait up for him because it was important dear me said his aunt startled is he going to stay the night then weve no bedroom free now you and the others are here he didnt say aunt fanny said julian im awfully sorry not to be able to tell you any details but just as i was saying id fetch uncle quentin he rang off in the very middle of what i was saying how mysterious said his aunt and how annoying how can i put him up if he wants to stay i suppose hell come roaring down at midnight in that enormous car of his i only hope nothings gone wrong with this latest work your uncle is doing i know its tremendously important perhaps uncle will know the americans telephone number and he can ring him up to find out a bit more said julian helpfully where is uncle hes gone down to the postoffice i think said his aunt ill tell him when he gets back julian told the others about the mysterious phone call dick was pleased i didnt have a chance of getting a good look at that enormous car the other day he said i think ill keep awake tonight till the american comes and then nip down and have a look at it i bet its got more gadgets on the dashboard than any car ive ever seen uncle quentin appeared to be as surprised as anyone else at the phone call and was inclined to blame julian for not finding out more details whats he want now he demanded almost as if julian ought to know i fixed everything up with him the other day everything each of us three has his own part to do mines the least important as it happens and his is the most important he took all the papers away with him he cant have left any behind coming down in the middle of the night like this quite extraordinary none of the children except dick meant to stay awake and listen for the americans coming dick put on his bedlight and took up a book to read he knew he would fall asleep and not wake up for any noise if he didnt somehow keep himself wide awake he listened as he read his ear alert to hear the coming of any car eleven oclock came then midnight struck he listened to the twelve dongs from the big grandfather clock in the hall goodness uncle quentin wouldnt be at all pleased that his visitor was so late he yawned and turned over his page he read on and on half past twelve one oclock then he thought he heard a sound downstairs and opened his door yes it was uncle quentin in his study dick could hear his voice poor old aunt fanny must be up too he thought i can hear their voices gosh i shall soon fall asleep over my book ill slip down and out into the garden for a breath of fresh air i shall keep awake then he put on his dressinggown and went quietly down the stairs he undid the bolt of the garden door and slipped out he stood listening for a moment wondering if he would hear the roar of the americans car in the stillness of the night but all he heard was the sound of the tyres of a bicycle on the road outside a bicycle who was riding about at this time of night perhaps it was the village policeman dick stood in the shadows and watched a man was on the bicycle dick could just make him out dimly a big black shadow in the starlit night to the boys enormous surprise he heard the sound of the man dismounting then the swish of the leaves in the hedge as the bicycle was slung there then someone came quietly up the path and went round to the window of the study it was the only room in the house that was lighted dick heard a tapping on the window and then it was opened cautiously his uncles head appeared who is it he said in a low tone is it you elbur it apparently was dick saw that it was the big american who had visited his uncle two days before ill open the door said his aunt but elbur was already putting his leg across the windowsill dick went back to bed puzzled how strange why should the american come so secretly in the night why should he ride a bicycle instead of driving his car he fell asleep still wondering he did not know whether the american rode away again or whether his aunt made a bed for him on a couch downstairs in fact when he awoke the next morning he really wondered if it had all been a dream he asked his aunt when he went down to breakfast did that man who telephoned come last night he said his aunt nodded her head yes but please say nothing about it i dont want anyone to know hes gone now was it important asked dick julian seemed to think it was when he answered the phone yes it was important said aunt fanny but not in the way you think dont ask me anything now dick and keep out of your uncles way hes rather cross this morning then something must have gone wrong with this new work hes doing thought dick and went to warn the others it sounds rather exciting said julian i wonder whats up they kept out of uncle quentins way they heard him grumbling loudly to his wife about something they heard him slam down his desklid as he always did when he was badtempered and then he settled down to his mornings work anne came running to the others after a time looking surprised george ive just been into our room and what do you think aunt fannys put a campbed over in the corner a campbed made up with blankets and everything it looks an awful squash with two other beds as well in the room mine and yours gosh someone else is coming to stay then a girl said dick or a woman aha i expect its a governess engaged to look after you and anne george to see that you behave like little ladies dont be an idiot said george surprised and cross at the news im going to ask mother what its all about i wont have anyone else in our room i just will not but just as she was marching off to tell her mother this the study door downstairs opened and her father bellowed into the hall calling his wife fanny tell the children i want them tell them to come to my study at once gracious he does sound cross whatever can we have done said anne scared chapter three annoying news the four children and timmy trooped down the stairs together georges mother was in the hall just going to call them oh there you are she said well i suppose you heard that youre wanted in the study im coming too and listen please dont make any more fuss than you can help ive had quite enough fuss made by quentin this was very mysterious what had aunt fanny to do with whatever trouble there was into the study went the five timmy too and saw uncle quentin standing on the hearthrug looking as black as thunder quentin i could have told the children began his wife but he silenced her with a scowl exactly like the one george sometimes put on ive got something to say to you he began you remember those two friends of mine scientists working on a scheme with me you remember the big american yes said everyone he gave us a whole pound said anne uncle quentin took no notice of that remark well he said hes got a daughter lets see now shes got some silly name berta said his wife dont interrupt me said uncle quentin yes berta well elbur her father has been warned that shes going to be kidnapped whatever for said julian amazed because it so happens that her father knows more secrets about a new scheme were planning than anyone else in the world said his uncle and he says quite frankly that if this girl whats her name now berta said everyone obligingly that if this berta is kidnapped he will give away every single secret he knows to get her back said uncle quentin pah whats he made of traitor to us all how can he even think of giving away secrets for the sake of a silly girl quentin shes his only child and he adores her said aunt fanny i should feel the same about george women are always soft and silly said her husband in a tone of great disgust its a good thing you dont know any secrets youd give them away to the milkman this was so ridiculous that the children laughed uncle quentin glared at them this is no laughing matter it has been a great shock to me to be told by one of the leading scientists of the world that he feels certain he might give all our secrets to the enemy if this this berta said everyone again at once if this berta was kidnapped went on uncle quentin so he came to ask if wed take this this berta into our own home for three weeks by that time the scheme will be finished and launched and our secrets will be safe there was a silence nobody looked very pleased in fact george looked furious she burst out at last so thats who the bed is for in our room mother have we got to be squashed up with nowhere to move about the room for three whole weeks its too bad for once you and i agree george said her father but im afraid youll have to put up with it elbur is in such a state about this kidnapping warning that he couldnt be reasoned with in fact he threatend to tear up all his figures and diagrams and burn them if i didnt agree to this that would mean we couldnt get on with the scheme but why has she got to come here said george fiercely why put her on to us hasnt she any relations or friends she can go to george dont be so fierce said her mother apparently berta has no mother and has been everywhere with her father they have no relations in this country and no friends they can trust he wont send her back to america because he has been warned by the police that she might be followed there and at the moment he cant leave this country himself to go with her but why choose us said george again he doesnt know a thing about us well said her mother with a small smile he met you all the other day you know and he was apparently very struck with you and especially with you george though i cant imagine why he said hed rather his berta was with you four than with any other family in the world she paused and looked at the four a harassed expression on her face julian went over to her dont you worry he said well look after berta i wont pretend im pleased at having a strange girl to join us these last three precious weeks but i can see her fathers point of view hes scared for berta and hes scared he might find himself spilling the beans if anything happened to her it might be the only way he could get her back to think of such a thing burst out uncle quentin all the work of the last two years the man must be mad now quentin dont think any more about it said his wife im glad to have the child here i would hate george to be kidnapped and i know exactly how he feels you wont even notice shes here one more will make no difference so you say grumbled her husband anyway its settled when is she coming asked dick tonight by boat said his uncle well have to let joan the cook into the secret but nobody else thats understood isnt it of course said the four at once then uncle quentin sat down firmly at his desk and the children went hurriedly out of the room aunt fanny behind them and timmy pushing between their ankles its such a pity and im so sorry said aunt fanny but i do feel we cant do anything else i bet timmy will hate her said george now dont you go and make things difficult george old thing said julian were all agreed it cant be helped so we might as well make the best of it i hate making the best of things said george obstinately well said dick amiably julian and anne and i could go back home and take berta with us if you hate everything so much i dont particularly want to stay here for three weeks if youre going to put on a hate all the time all right i wont said george im only letting off steam you know that im never sure with you said dick with a grin well look lets not spoil this one day when we will be by ourselves they all tried valiantly to have as good a time as possible and went out in georges boat for a long row to lobster cove they didnt do any fishing there but bathed from the boat instead in water as green and clear as in an openair bath timmy didnt approve of bathing from boats it was quite easy to jump out of the boat into the water but he found it extremely difficult to jump in again aunt fanny had again packed them a wonderful lunch an extra good one to make up for a disappointment she said smiling anne had given her a hug for that here they had all been making such a fuss about having someone extra and aunt fanny had been the only one to feel a real kindness for a child in danger they had enough food for tea too and did not get home until the evening the sea was calm and blue and the children could see almost to the bottom of the water when they leaned over the side of the boat the sky was the colour of harebells as they rowed into the bay and up to the beach will berta be there yet do you suppose said george mentioning the girl for the first time since they had set out that morning i shouldnt think so said julian your father said she would be coming tonight and i imagine that as shes coming by boat it will be dark so that she wont be seen i expect shell be feeling very scared said anne it must be horrid to be sent away to a strange place to strange people i should hate it they beached the boat and left it high and dry then they made their way to kirrin cottage aunt fanny was pleased to see them you are in nice time for supper she said though if you ate all i gave you today for your picnics youll surely find it difficult to eat very much supper oh im terribly hungry said dick he sniffed holding his nose up in the air just as timmy often did i believe youve been making your special tomato soup with real tomatoes aunt fanny youre too good at guessing said his aunt with a laugh it was meant to be a surprise now go and wash and make yourselves tidy berta hasnt come yet i suppose has she asked julian no said his aunt and well have to think of another name for her julian it would never do to call her berta now uncle quentin didnt appear for supper he is having his in the study by himself said aunt fanny there was a sigh of relief nobody had looked forward to seeing uncle quentin that night it took him quite a long time to get over any annoyance how sunburnt you all are said aunt fanny looking round the table george your nose is beginning to peel i know said george i wish it didnt annes never does gosh im sleepy well go to bed as soon as youve finished your supper said her mother id like to but what about this berta said george what time is she coming it would be rather mean to be in bed when she arrives ive no idea what time she will come said her mother but i shall wait up of course theres no need for anyone else to i expect shell be tired and scared so i shall give her something to eat some of the tomato soup if youve left any and then pop her into bed i expect she would be quite glad not to have to meet any of you tonight well i shall go to bed said dick i heard mr elbur arriving last night aunt fanny and it was pretty late wasnt it i can hardly keep my eyes open tonight come on then lets all go up said julian we can read if we cant sleep good night aunt fanny thank you for that lovely picnic food again all the four went upstairs anne and dick yawning loudly and setting the others off too timmy padded behind them quite glad that george was going to bed so early they were all asleep in ten minutes the boys slept like logs and didnt stir at all the girls fell fast asleep for about four hours and then george was awakened by hearing timmy growl she sat up at once what is it she said oh is it berta arriving tim lets keep quiet and see what shes like after a minute timmy growled again george heard the sound of quiet footsteps on the stairs then the bedroom door was slid softly open and two people stood in the light of the landing lamp one was aunt fanny the other of course was berta chapter four berta george sat up in bed and stared at berta she looked very peculiar indeed for one thing she was so bundled up in coats and wraps that it was difficult to see if she was fat or thin tall or short and for another thing she was crying so bitterly that her face was all screwed up anne didnt wake up timmy was so astonished that like george he simply sat and stared tell timmy not to make a sound whispered georges mother afraid that the dog might bark the house down once he began george laid a warning hand on timmy her mother gave berta a little push farther into the room shes been terribly seasick poor child she told george and shes scared and upset i want her to get into bed as soon as possible berta was still sobbing but the sobs grew quieter as she began to feel less sick georges mother was so kind and sensible that she felt comforted lets take these things off she said to berta my word you are bundled up but if you came in an open motorboat i expect you needed them what am i to call you asked berta with one last sniff youd better call me aunt fanny as the others do i think said georges mother i expect you know why youve come to stay with us for a while dont you yes said berta i didnt want to come i wanted to stay with my father im not afraid of being kidnapped ive got sally to look after me whos sally dear asked aunt fanny taking a coat or two off berta my dog said berta shes downstairs in the basket i was carrying george pricked up her ears at that bit of news a dog she said we cant have a dog here mine would never allow that would you timmy timmy gave a small wuff he was watching this night arrival with great interest who was she he was longing to get down from georges bed and go to sniff at her but george had her hand on his collar well ive brought my dog and i just reckon shell have to stay now said berta the boats gone back anyway i wouldnt go anywhere without sally i told my father that and he said all right then take her with you so i did mother tell her how fierce timmy is and that he would fight any other dog who came here said george urgently i wont have anybody elses dog at kirrin cottage to georges annoyance her mother took not the slightest notice she went on helping berta take off scarves and leggings and goodness knows what george wondered how anyone could possibly exist in all those clothes on a warm summers night at last berta stood in a simple jersey and skirt a slim pretty little girl with large blue eyes and wavy golden hair she shook back her hair and rubbed her face with a hanky thank you she said can i get sally my dog now not tonight said aunt fanny you see you are to sleep in that little campbed over in the corner and i cant let you have your dog here too because she and timmy might fight unless we introduce them to one another properly and there is no time to bother about that tonight do you feel hungry now would you like some tomato soup and biscuits yes please i do feel a bit hungry said berta ive been so sick on that awful bumpy boat that i dont expect theres anything left inside me at all well look you unpack your little nightcase and have a wash in the bathroom if you want to and then get into your pyjamas said aunt fanny then hop into bed and ill bring you up some soup but one look at the scowling george made her change her mind better not leave poor berta with an angry george on her very first night i think perhaps i wont get the soup myself she said george you go and get it will you its warming up in the saucepan on the stove downstairs youll see the little soupcup on the table and some biscuits too george got out of bed still looking very mutinous she watched berta shake out a nightdress from her nightcase and pursed up her lips she doesnt even wear pyjamas she thought what a ninny and shes had the sauce to bring her own dog too spoilt little thing i wonder where it is ive a good mind to have a look at it when im downstairs but her mother had an idea that george might do that and she went to the door after her george she said warningly i dont want you to open the dogs basket downstairs im not having any dogfights tonight i shall put him in timmys kennel outside before i go to bed george said nothing but went on downstairs the soup was just about to boil and she whipped it off the stove at once she poured it into the little soupcup placed it on the saucer and put some biscuits on the side she heard a small whimpering sound and turned round it came from a fairly large basket over in the corner george was terribly tempted to go and undo it but she knew perfectly well that if the new dog ran upstairs to find its mistress timmy would bark and wake everybody up it wasnt worth risking she took up the soup berta was now in the campbed and looked very cosy anne was still sleeping peacefully quite undisturbed by all that was going on timmy had taken the opportunity of jumping off georges bed and had gone to examine this newcomer he sniffed her delicately and berta put out her hand and stroked his head what lovely eyes hes got she said but hes a mongrel isnt he a sort of mixturedog dont you say anything like that to george said aunt fanny she adores timmy now do you feel better i hope youll be happy with us berta dear i am sure you didnt want to come but your father was so worried and it will be nice for you to get to know anne and georgina before you go to their school next term oh was that georgina the one you called george said berta in surprise i wasnt really sure if she was a boy or not my father told me there were three boys here and one girl and thats the girl isnt it in bed there she pointed to anne aunt fanny nodded yes thats anne your father thought george was a boy thats why he told you there were three boys and only one girl here i suppose the two boys are in the next room i dont like george very much said berta she doesnt want me here does she or my dog oh youll find george great fun when you get to know her said aunt fanny here she comes now with your soup george came in with the soup and was not at all pleased to see timmy standing by the campbed being petted by berta she set the soup down sharply and pushed timmy away thank you said berta and took the soupcup eagerly into her hands what lovely soup she said george got into bed and turned over on her side she knew she was behaving badly but the thought of someone daring to bring another dog to live at kirrin cottage was more than she could bear timmy leapt up to lie at her feet as usual berta looked at this with much approval ill have sally on my feet tomorrow she said thats an awfully good idea pops thats my father always let me have sally in my room but she had to be in her basket not on my bed tomorrow night she can sleep on my feet like timmy does on georges she will not said george in a fierce voice no dog sleeps in my bedroom except timmy now dont talk any more said aunt fanny hurriedly we can settle everything tomorrow when youre not so tired ill look after sally tonight for you i promise lie down now and go to sleep you look as if youre half asleep already berta was suddenly overcome with sleep and flopped down into bed her eyes closed but she managed to force them open and look up at georges mother good night aunt fanny she said sleepily thats what i was to call you wasnt it thank you for being so kind to me she was asleep almost before she had finished speaking aunt fanny took up the soupcup and went to the door are you awake george she said george lay absolutely still she knew that her mother was not pleased with her it would be better to pretend to be fast asleep i am sure you are awake said her mother and i hope you are ashamed of yourself i shall expect you to make up for this silly behaviour in the morning it is a pity to behave in such a childish manner she went out of the room closing the door softly george put out her hand to timmy she was ashamed of herself but she wasnt at all certain that she would behave better in the morning that silly soppy girl her dog would be as silly as herself she was sure and timmy would simply hate having another dog in the house he would probably growl and snarl to such a degree that berta would be forced to send her dog away and a good thing too murmured george as timmy licked her fingers lovingly you dont want another girl in the house or another dog either do you timmy especially a girl like that aunt fanny saw to bertas dog and put her safely into timmys kennel outside it had a little door to it which could be shut so the dog was safe there and would not be able to run out she went back into the house cleared up bertas belongings a little for they had been thrown higgledypiggledy into the room and then turned out the light she went upstairs to bed her husband had slept soundly all through bertas late arrival he had been very sure that he would wake up and welcome the girl as well as his wife but he hadnt even stirred aunt fanny was glad it was much easier for her to deal with a seasick frightened girl by herself she climbed thankfully into bed and lay down with a sigh oh dear i dont look forward to the morning what will happen then with george in this mood and two dogs to sort out berta seems a nice little thing well perhaps they will all get on better than i think yes things wouldnt be too easy in the morning that was quite certain chapter five in the morning george was the first to wake up in the morning she at once remembered the events of the night before and looked across at berta in the campbed the girl was asleep her wavy golden hair spread over the pillow george leaned across annes bed and gave her a sharp nudge anne woke up at once and gazed sleepily at george whats the matter george is it time to get up look over there whispered george nodding her head towards berta anne turned over and looked unlike george she liked the look of berta her sleeping face was pleasant and open and her mouth turned up not down anne couldnt bear people whose mouths turned down she looks all right whispered back anne george frowned she howled like anything when she came she told anne shes a real baby and shes brought a dog goodness timmy wont like that said anne startled where is it down in timmys kennel said george still whispering i havent seen it it was in a closed basket last night and i didnt dare open it in case it tore upstairs and had a row with tim but it cant be very big i expect its a horrible peke or some silly little lapdog pekes arent horrible said anne they may be small and have funny little pugnoses but theyre awfully brave fancy having another dog i cant think what timmy will say its a pity berta isnt our kind said george look at her pale face not a scrap of suntan and she looks weedy doesnt she im sure she couldnt climb a tree or row a boat or sh shes waking up said anne warningly berta yawned and stretched herself then she opened her eyes and looked round at first she had no idea where she was and then she suddenly remembered she sat up hallo said anne and smiled at her you werent here when i came to bed last night i was surprised to see you this morning berta took an immediate liking to anne shes got kind eyes she thought shes not like the other girl i like this one she smiled back at anne yes i came in the middle of the night she said i came by motorboat and the sea was so bumpy that i was frightfully sick my father didnt come with me but a friend of his did and he carried me from the boat to kirrin cottage even my legs felt seasick bad luck said anne you didnt really enjoy the adventure then no i can do without adventures said berta im not keen on them especially when pops gets all excited and worried about me he fusses round me like a hen dear old pops i shall hate being away from him george was listening to all this not keen on adventures well a girl like that wouldnt be of course im not very keen on adventures either said anne weve had plenty goodness knows i prefer adventures when theyre all over george exploded anne how can you talk like that weve had some smashing adventures and weve enjoyed every one of them if you feel like that well leave you out of the next one anne laughed you wont an adventure comes up all of a sudden like a wind blowing up in the sky and were all in it whether we like it or not and you know that i like sharing things with you i say isnt it time we got up yes said george looking at the clock on the mantelpiece unless berta wants to have her breakfast in bed i bet she always does at home no i dont i hate meals in bed said berta im going to get up she leapt out of bed and went to the window immediately she saw the wide sweep of the bay sparkling in the morning sun as blue as cornflowers the seasparkle was reflected into the bedroom and made it very bright indeed oh i wondered why our room was so full of brilliant light said berta now i know what a view oh how lovely the sea looks this morning and whats that little island out there what a lovely place it looks thats kirrin island said george proudly it belongs to me berta laughed thinking that george was joking belongs to you i bet you wish it did its really wunnerful wunnerful said george imitating her cant you say wonderful its got a d in the middle you know yes im always being told things like that said berta still staring out of the window i had an english governess and she tried to make me speak like you do i do try because ive got to go to an english school my my i wish that island belonged to me i wonder if my pops could buy it george exploded again buy it you donkey i told you it was mine didnt i berta turned round in surprise but you didnt mean it did you she said yours but how could it be it is georges said anne it has always belonged to the kirrin family thats kirrin island georges father gave it to her after an adventure we once had berta stared at george in awe great snakes so it is yours arent you the lucky one will you take me to visit it ill see said george gruffly glad to have impressed this american girl so much getting her pops to buy the island indeed george snorted to herself what next a shout came from the next room it was julian hey you girls are you getting up were all too late for a bathe before breakfast this morning dick and i have only just woken up bertas here shouted back anne well get dressed all of us and then well introduce berta to you are they your brothers asked berta i havent got any or sisters either i shall be pretty scared of them you wont be scared of julian and dick said anne proudly youll wish you had brothers like them wont she george yes said george shortly she was feeling rather annoyed just then because timmy was standing by berta wagging his plumy tail come here timmy dont make a nuisance of yourself oh hes not said berta and patted his big head i like him he seems simply enormous after my sally but youll love sally george you really will everyone says how sweet she is and ive trained her beautifully george took no interest in these remarks at all she flounced off to wash in the bathroom but julian and dick were there and there was a lot of yelling and shouting as george tried to make them hurry up and get out berta laughed that sounds nice and familylike she said you dont get that sort of thing if youre an only child what do i wear here oh something very simple said anne looking at the suitcase open on the floor showing a collection of bertas clothes that shirt and those jeans will do they were ready just as the gong rang for breakfast a delicious smell of frying bacon and tomatoes came up the stairs and berta sniffed in delight i do like english breakfast she said we havent gotten around to a proper breakfast in america yet thats bacon and tomatoes i smell isnt it my english governess always said that bacon and eggs made the best breakfast in the world but i guess the one were going to have will taste pretty good uncle quentin was at the table when the children came down he looked most surprised to see berta having quite forgotten that she was coming whos this he said now quentin dont pretend you dont know said his wife its elburs girl your friend elbur she came in the middle of the night but i didnt wake you you were so sound asleep ah yes said uncle quentin and he shook hands with the rather scared berta glad to have you here er let me see now whats your name berta said everyone in a chorus yes yes berta sit down my dear i know your father well hes doing some wonderful work berta beamed hes always at work she said he works all through the night sometimes does he well what a thing to do said uncle quentin its a thing you often do yourself quentin said his wife pouring out coffee though i dont suppose you even realize it uncle quentin looked surprised do i really bless us all dont i go to bed some nights then berta laughed youre like my pops sometimes he doesnt know what day of the week it is even and yet hes supposed to be one of the cleverest guys in the world guy said uncle quentin surprised immediately thinking of firework night everyone laughed anne patted her uncles knee its all right uncle she said hes not going to sit on the top of a bonfire but uncle quentin was not listening he had suddenly seen a letter marked important on the top of his pile of correspondence and he picked it up well unless im much mistaken heres a letter from your father he said to berta ill see what he says he opened the letter and read it to himself then he looked up its all about you er er her names berta said aunt fanny patiently about you berta said uncle quentin but i must say your father has some very strange ideas yes very strange what are they asked his wife well he says she must be disguised in case anyone comes to find her here said uncle quentin and he wants her name changed and bless us all he wants us to buy her boys clothes and cut her hair short and dress her up as a boy everyone listened in surprise berta gave a little squeal i wont i wont be dressed up as a boy i wont have my hair cut off dont you dare to make me i wont chapter six a few upsets berta looked so upset that aunt fanny acted quickly and firmly dont bother about that letter now quentin she said well go through it afterwards and decide what to do lets have our breakfast in peace i wont have my hair cut off said berta again uncle quentin was not used to being defied openly like this and he scowled he looked at his wife surely you are not going to let this er whats her name now bertha berta said everyone automatically i said that we would not discuss this till after breakfast said aunt fanny in the kind of voice that made everyone including uncle quentin quite certain that she meant what she said her husband folded up the letter and opened the next one frowning the children looked at one another berta to be a boy goodness if ever anyone looked less like a boy it was berta george was most annoyed she loved to dress like a boy but she didnt feel inclined to urge anyone else to she looked at berta who was eating her breakfast with tears in her eyes what a baby she wouldnt even look like a boy if she was dressed in boys clothes she would just look absolutely silly julian began a conversation with his aunt about the garden she was grateful to him for breaking up the sudden awkwardness caused by the letter she was very fond of julian i can always depend on him she thought and talked gladly of the garden fruit and who would pick the raspberries for lunch and whether the wasps would eat all the plums or not dick joined in and anne and soon berta did too only george and her father remained gloomy they both looked so exactly alike in solemn rather frowning expressions that julian nudged dick and nodded towards them dick grinned like father like daughter he said cheer up george dont you like your breakfast george was just about to answer crossly when anne gave an exclamation oh look at uncle quentin hes putting mustard on his toast aunt fanny stop him hes just going to eat it everyone roared with laughter aunt fanny managed to smack her husbands hand down from his mouth just as he was putting his toast and mustard up to it reading a letter at the same time hey whats the matter he said startled quentin thats the second time this month youve spread your toast with mustard instead of with marmalade said his wife do have a little sense after that everyone became very cheerful uncle quentin laughed at himself and george saw the funny side and laughed loudly too which made timmy bark and berta giggled aunt fanny was quite relieved that her husband had done such a silly thing do you remember when father poured custard all over his fried fish once george said entering into the talk for the first time and he said it was the best eggsauce he had ever tasted the conversation was very animated after that and aunt fanny felt happier you girls can clear away and wash up the breakfast things for joan she said or two of you can and the other can make the beds with me what about my little dog said berta suddenly remembering her again i havent seen her yet because i was only just in time for breakfast where is she you can go and get her now said aunt fanny weve all finished are you going to start your work quentin yes i am said her husband so i dont want any yelling or shouting or barking outside my study door he got up and went out of the room berta stood up too wheres the kennel she said ill show you said anne well go and get your dog and introduce it to timmy coming george you can bring the dog in here and well see what timmy says said george going all gloomy again if he doesnt like the dog and he wont it will have to live out in the kennel oh no said berta at once well you dont want timmy to eat it do you said george hes very jealous of other dogs in the house he might go for yours and savage it oh no said berta again looking upset timmys nice hes not a fierce dog thats all you know said george well ive warned you come on said anne pulling at bertas sleeve lets go and fetch sally she must be wondering why nobody bothers about her i bet timmy wont mind terribly as soon as the two had gone out george spoke in timmys ear you dont like strange dogs who want to come and live here do you tim youll growl and snarl like anything wont you growl your very fiercest i know you wont bite but if you could just growl your loudest that will be enough berta will make that sallydog live out of doors then soon she heard footsteps returning and annes voice exclaiming in delight oh shes sweet oh what a darling sally youre a pet julian dick aunt fanny do come and see bertas dog everyone came into the room led by berta and anne berta held the dog in her arms it was a tiny black poodle whose woolly fur was cut away here and there to give it a very fashionable look sally was certainly an attractive little thing her sharp little nose sniffed all the time she was carried into the room and her quick little eyes looked everywhere berta put her down and the little poodle stood there poised on her dainty feet like a ballet dancer about to perform everyone but george exclaimed in delight shes a poppet sally sally youre a pet oh a poodle i do love poodles they look so knowing timmy stood by george sniffing hard to get the smell of this new dog george had her hand on his collar in case he sprang his tail was as stiff as a ramrod the poodle suddenly saw him she stared at him out of bright little eyes quite unafraid then she pulled away from bertas hand and trotted right over to timmy her funny little tail wagging merrily timmy backed a little in surprise the poodle danced all round him on her toes and a little whimpering bark which said as plainly as possible i want to play with you timmy sprang he leapt in the air and came down with a thud on his big paws and the little poodle dodged timmys tail began to wag wildly he sprang again in play and almost knocked the little poodle over he barked as if to say sorry i didnt mean that then he and the poodle played a most ridiculous game of dodge and run and although one or two chairs went flying nobody minded they were all laughing so much at the sight of the quick little poodle leading timmy such a dance at last sally was tired and sat down in a corner timmy pranced about in front of her showing off then he went up to her and sniffed her nose he licked it gently and then lay down in front of her gazing at her adoringly anne gave a little squeal of laughter hes gazing at sally exactly as he gazes at you george she cried but george was not at all pleased in fact she was quite astounded to think that timmy should welcome another dog to think that he should behave like this when she had told him to do the opposite arent they sweet together said berta pleased i thought timmy would like sally of course sally is a pedigree dog and cost a lot of money and timmys only a mongrel i expect he thinks shes wunnerful oh tim may be a mongrel but hes absolutely wunnerful too said dick hastily pronouncing the word like berta to try and get a laugh he saw georges scowl and knew how cross she felt at hearing her beloved timmy compared with a pedigree dog hes a magnificent fellow arent you timmy went on dick sally may be a darling but youre worth more than a hundred darlings arent you i think hes beautiful said berta looking down at timmy hes got the loveliest eyes i ever did see george began to feel a little better she called timmy youre making rather a fool of yourself she said to him now that timmy and sally are going to be friends can i have sally to sleep on my bed at night like george has timmy said berta please say yes aunt fanny no said george at once mother i wont have that i wont well well see what we can do about it said her mother sally was quite happy in the kennel last night i must say im going to have her sleep with me said berth scowling at george my father will pay you a lot of money to make me happy he told me he would dont be silly berta said aunt fanny firmly this isnt a question of money now leave this for a little while please and go and do your jobs all of you and then we must consider your fathers letter berta and see exactly what he wants done we must certainly try to follow his advice about you but i dont want to began berta and then felt a firm hand on her arm it was julian come on kid he said be your age remember youre a guest here and put on a few of your best manners we like american children but not spoilt ones berta had quite a shock to hear julian speaking like this she looked up at him and he grinned down at her she felt near tears but she smiled back you havent any brothers to keep you in your place said julian linking his arm in hers well from now on while youre here dick and i are your brothers and youve got to toe the line just like anne see what about it berta felt that there was nothing in the world she would like better than having julian for a brother he was big and tall and had twinkling kindly eyes that made berta feel he was as responsible and trustable as her father aunt fanny smiled to herself julian always knew the best thing to say and do now he would take berta in hand and see that she didnt upset the household too much she was glad it wasnt easy to run a big family like this with a scientist husband to cope with unless everyone pulled together you go and help aunt fanny with the beds said julian to berta and take your sallydog with you shes great but so is timmy and dont you forget it chapter seven a little conference peace reigned in the house for a little while george and anne went to help the cook with the washingup joan was pleased because with eight people in the house including herself there was a lot to do she had been very astonished that morning to find a fifth child added to the household but had been told that after breakfast she could go into the sittingroom and hear an explanation joan must certainly be in the secret too upstairs berta was helping with the beds not very successfully because she was not used to doing things for herself but she was very willing to learn and aunt fanny was quite pleased with her timmy and sally darted about together and made things rather more dificult than they need have been popping under beds and out again at top speed im glad timmy likes sally said berta i knew he would i cant think why george thought he wouldnt george is funny i think not really said aunt fanny she hasnt any brothers or sisters to rub off her corners and she didnt even know her three cousins till a few years ago or go to school lonely people arent so easy to get on with as others but she is great fun now as you will soon find out im an only child too said berta but ive always had plenty of other children to play with my pops saw to that hes wunnerful i mean wonderful ill say that word wonderful twenny times then maybe ill get it right well say the word twenty as well said aunt fanny it has a letter t at the end as well as at the beginning you know its twenty not twenny but dont make yourself too english its nice to have a change wonderful wonderful wonderful twenty twenty chanted berta as she made the beds dick looked into the room and chuckled great snakes he said with a grin and an american accent you shore are wunnerful baby dont be so silly dick said his aunt laughing now i think weve finished all we have to do berta well go downstairs and have a conference tell the others will you berta followed closely by sally who was also followed closely by an adoring timmy went to tell dick and julian and then george and anne george was not too pleased with timmy where have you been she said cant you stop running about after sally shell get very very tired of you wuff said sally in a high little bark not at all like timmys deep woof soon all five children and the two dogs and also joan were in the sittingroom with aunt fanny berta began to look a little nervous aunt fanny had the letter that bertas father had sent she did not read it out to the children but told them what was in it she also explained to joan about berta joan you have always known what important work the master does she said well miss bertas father does the same kind of work in america and he and the master are working on a great new scheme together oh yes mam said joan very much interested bertas father has been warned by the police that it is possible berta may be kidnapped and held to ransom not for money but for the scientific secrets that he knows went on aunt fanny so she has been sent to us to be kept safe for three weeks by that time the scheme will be finished and made public berta is going to the same school as miss anne and miss george and it is a good idea to let them know one another first joan nodded i understand that mam she said i think we can keep miss berta safe dont you yes said aunt fanny but her father has now put up some further ideas that he wants us to follow he says it would be best to disguise her as a boy jolly good idea interrupted dick and to give her another name a boys name said aunt fanny he wants her to have her hair cut short and oh please not that begged berta shaking back her fair wavy hair id hate it girls with short hair like boys look so silly they anne nudged her and frowned berta stopped hurriedly remembering that george had curly hair cut as short as any boy i think well have to do what your father says said aunt fanny this is very important berta you see if anyone should come here looking for you thinking of kidnapping they would never recognize you if you were looking exactly like a boy but my hair said berta almost in tears how could pops say im to have my hair off he always said it was wunnerful nobody liked to point out that there was a d in wonderful just then berta was really so very upset about her hair your hair will grow quickly enough said aunt fanny her heads a good shape said julian looking at it consideringly she should look nice with short hair berta cheered up if julian thought that then it wouldnt be so bad but what about clothes she said remembering this point with a look of horror girls look frightful in boys clothes pops always said so till now you wont look any worse than george does said dick shes got on a boys jersey boys jeans and boys shoes this very minute i think she looks awful said berta obstinately and george scowled well i think youd look horrible she said you wouldnt even look like a boy youd look littlegirlish silly little sissyboy i think its a fatheaded idea to put you into boys clothes aha our george wants to be the only one said dick slyly and quickly got out of the way of a punch from the furious george well said julian ill go out and buy some things for berta this morning so thats settled what about her hair shall i cut it short aunt fanny was amused at julians highhanded way of dealing with berta and her troubles and even more amused to see that berta did not even argue with julian you can certainly go shopping for berta if you like she said but id rather you didnt cut her hair youd make her look a scarecrow i dont mind if julian cuts it said berta surprisingly meek all at once i shall cut it for you myself said aunt fanny now what about a boys name we cant call you berta any more thats certain id rather not have a boys name said berta its silly for a girl to be called by a boys name like george if you mean to be rude to me ill began george but got no farther julian and dick had burst into laughter oh george you and berta will be the death of us said julian here are you doing all you can to pretend to be a boy and here is berta doing all she can to get out of it for goodness sake lets settle the matter without any more bickering well call berta robert no thats too like berta said dick it ought to be a completely different name well call her a good plain boys name like jim or tom or john no said berta i dont like any of them let me have my second name please whats that another girls name asked julian yes but its used for a boy too only then its spelt differently said berta its lesley its a nice name i think lesley yes it rather suits you said julian it suits you better than berta well call you lesley and people will think its leslie spelt lie at the end and not ley all right everythings settled not quite said his aunt i just want to say that you mustnt let berta i mean lesley out of your sight at all and you must report at once any mysterious happening or any stranger you see the local police here know that we have lesley with us and why and anything can be reported to them at once they also are keeping a good lookout of course this almost sounds as if were in the middle of an adventure said dick looking pleased i hope not said his aunt i dont imagine that anyone will ever guess berta i mean lesley is anything more than she will appear to be a boy friend of yours and julians come to stay for a while dear me its going to be dificult to refer to her and him all the time it certainly is said julian standing up if youll give me some money aunt fanny ill go and do a little shopping for lesley what size do you think he needs everyone laughed he wears size three shoes said joan smiling i noticed that this morning and he will have to get used to doing his coat buttons up on the righthand side instead of on the left said anne joining in the fun she will soon get used to that said george wont she timmy dont spoil it all now george said julian a slip of the tongue saying she instead of he might lead to danger for her i mean lesley yes i know said george its just that shell never look like a boy and i dont want to look like a boy said berta i think you look here we go again said julian stop it lesley stop it george george youd better come out and help me to get the things for lesley come on and take that scowl off your face you look like a sulky girl that made george alter her face at once she couldnt help grinning at the artful julian im coming she said goodbye berta when we come back youll be leslie haircut and all she and julian went off anne fetched her aunts sharpest scissors and draped a big towel round bertas shoulders berta looked as if she was going to cry cheer up said dick youre going to look angelic with short hair begin aunt fanny lets see what shes like with shorn locks sit quite still said aunt fanny and began clipclipclip the wavy golden hair fell to the floor in big strands and berta began to weep in earnest my hair i cant bear this oh my hair soon most of it was on the floor and aunt fanny began to clip what was left as best she could to make it look as boyish as possible she made a very good job of it indeed dick and anne watched with the greatest interest there its done said aunt fanny at last stop crying lesley and lets have a look at you chapter eight a transformation berta stood in the middle of the floor blinking her tears away anne gave a gasp you know its very odd but she does look rather like a boy a very very goodlooking boy an angelic boy said dick a choirboy or something she looks smashing who would have thought it aunt fanny was very struck with bertas appearance too its certainly very odd she said but theres no doubt about it when shes i mean hes dressed in boys clothes hell make a fine boy better than george actually because her hairs really too curly for a boy berta went to the lookingglass on the wall she gave a wail i look awful i dont know myself nobody would ever recognize me splendid said dick at once youve hit the nail right on the head nobody would recognize you now your father was quite right to say cut your hair off and dress up as a boy any prowling kidnapper would never think you were berta the pretty little girl id rather be kidnapped than look like this wept berta what will the girls at your school say anne when they see me they dont say anything to george about her short hair and they wont say anything to you said anne stop crying bert er lesley said aunt fanny you make me feel quite miserable youve been very good to stand so still all that time now i really must think of a little reward for you berta stopped crying at once please she said theres only one thing i want now i want sallydog to sleep with me oh dear ber er lesley i really cant have another dog in that little bedroom said poor aunt fanny and george would make things most unpleasant if i did aunt fanny sally is a very very good guard for me said berta she barks at the very slightest sound id feel safe with her in the bedroom id like you to have her said aunt fanny but joan had come into the room to put away some things and had heard the conversation she stared in admiration at bertas neat golden head and then made a suggestion if youll excuse me mam she said miss berta could have her campbed in my room i dont mind the dog a bit she can have her and welcome hes a pet that little poodle its very crowded in the girls room now with three beds in it and my rooms a nice big one so if miss berta doesnt mind sharing it shes welcome oh joan thats good of you said aunt fanny relieved at such a simple solution also your room is up in the attic it would be very difficult for kidnappers to find their way there and nobody would think of looking into your room for one of the children thank you joan youre just wunnerful said berta in delight sally do you hear that youll be sleeping on my feet tonight like timmy does on georges i dont really approve of that you know berta said aunt fanny oh dear i called you berta again lesley i mean what a muddle im going to get into anne get the dustpan and sweep up the hair on the floor when julian and george came back there was no sign of the golden hair on the floor they put their parcels down on the table and shouted for aunt fanny mother called george aunt fanny shouted julian she came running downstairs with berta and anne and dick julian and george looked at berta thunderstruck gosh is it really you berta said julian i simply dont recognize you why you do look like a boy said george i never thought you would a jolly goodlooking boy said julian well your father was right its the best disguise you could have where are the clothes asked berta rather pleased at all the interest in her looks they opened the parcels and pulled out the things they were not really very exciting a boys blazer in navy blue two pairs of boys jeans two grey jerseys a few shirts a tie and a pullover without sleeves and shoes and socks said george but we decided youd got plenty of socks that would do so we only bought one pair of those oh and heres a boys grey felt hat in case the suns too hot and a cap berta put on the cap at once there were squeals of laughter from everyone it suits her shes got it on at just the right angle she looks a real boy you put it on george said berta and george took it eager to share in the admiration but it looked ridiculous on her curls and wouldnt sit down flat as it should everyone hooted it makes you look a girl take it off george took it off in disappointment how very aggravating that this girl berta should make a better boy than she did she threw the cap on the table halfcross that they had bought it go upstairs and put some of the things on said aunt fanny amused at all these goingson up went berta obediently and soon came down again neatly arrayed in jeans grey shirt and blue tie everyone roared with laughter berta was now quite enjoying herself and paraded round the room her cap tilted on one side of her head she looks like a very tidy neat little boy a good and most angelic child said julian dear lesley you must get yourself just a little dirty you look too good to be true i dont like getting dirty said berta i think but what she thought nobody knew because at that moment the door opened and uncle quentin came into the room id like to know how you think i can do my work with all this hooting and cackling going on he began and then he suddenly saw berta and stopped whos this he said looking berta up and down dont you know father said george of course not never seen him in my life before said her father dont tell me its somebody else come to stay its berta said anne with a giggle berta now whos berta said uncle quentin frowning i seem to have heard that name before the girl you thought might be kidnapped explained dick oh berta elburs girl said uncle quentin i remember her all right but whos this this boy ive never seen him before whats your name boy lesley said berta but i was berta when you saw me at breakfast good heavens said uncle quentin amazed what a what a transformation why your own father wouldnt know you i hope i remember who you are keep reminding me if i dont off he went back to his study the children laughed and aunt fanny had to laugh too by the way she said i want you all to have lunch at home today because its really too late now to start making sandwiches for a picnic its only cold ham and salad so dont get too hungry will you is there time for a bathe asked julian looking at his watch yes if youll come in about twelve oclock and pick the fruit for a pudding for lunch said his aunt it takes ages to pick enough for eight people and joan and i have a lot to do today right well go for a bathe now and then well all pick fruit said julian bags i pick the plums the raspberries are such fiddley little things have you a swimsuit berta i mean lesley asked george yes its an absolutely plain one like a boys so ill be all right in it said berta hurray i shant need to wear a cap boys never do bertas cases were now all in joans big room and she ran to get into her swimsuit bring your blazer and a towel yelled george and went into her own room with anne i bet berta cant swim she said that will be a pity because most boys swim well well have to teach her well dont duck her too often said anne seeing a look in georges eye that was not too kindly blow my swimsuit isnt here im sure i brought it in from the clothesline it took quite a while to find it and the boys and berta had already gone down to the beach with sally by the time anne and george were ready to follow with the impatient timmy they were down on the beach at last and there was sallydog guarding the blazers belonging to julian dick and berta she was lying on them and she even dared to growl at timmy when he came near george laughed growl back timmy dont let a little snippet like that cheek you growl back but timmy wouldnt he just sat down out of reach of sally and looked at her sadly wasnt she friends with him any more where are the others said anne shading her eyes from the glare of the sun and looking out to sea goodness how far out theyve swum that cant be berta with them surely george looked out over the stretch of blue sea at once she saw three heads bobbing yes berta was out there she must be a jolly good swimmer said anne admiringly i couldnt swim out as far as that we were wrong about berta she swims like a fish george said nothing she ran to the waves plunged through a big one just as it was curling over and swam out strongly she couldnt believe that it was berta out there and if it was the boys must be helping her but it was berta her golden head glistened wet in the water and she shouted in glee as she swam this is great this is wunnerful gee im enjoying this hi there george isnt the water warm julian and dick grinned round at the panting george lesleys a fine swimmer said dick gosh i thought she was going to race me at one time shed beat you george she wouldnt said george but all the same she didnt challenge berta to race it was fun to be five fun to chase one another in the sea to swim under the water and grab somebodys leg and anne laughed till she choked when she saw somebody heave themselves out of the water right on to georges back and duck her well and truly it was berta and what was more the angry george couldnt catch her afterwards berta could swim much too fast chapter nine a sudden telephone call berta soon settled down happily with the five george couldnt bear to think that the girl had to be dressed like a boy but her jealousy wore off a little as the days went by though she couldnt help feeling annoyed that berta proved to be such a good swimmer she could dive well too and swim under water even longer than the boys could much to their surprise oh well you see back home weve got a pool in our garden she said a wonderful pool gee you should see it and i learnt to swim in it when i was two pops always called me a waterbaby berta ate just as much as the others although she was not so sturdy and well built she was loud in her praise of the meals and this pleased aunt fanny and joan very much youre getting fatter lesley said aunt fanny a week later looking at her as she sat eating her lunch with the others and what is better still youre getting a really good suntan youre almost as brown as the others yes i thought so too said berta pleased its a good thing you caught the sun so easily said aunt fanny now if any kidnappers come round looking for a longhaired palefaced american girl they would take one look at the lot of you and off they would go nobody would guess you were berta all the same id much rather be berta said berta i still dont like pretending to be a boy its silly and it makes me feel silly anyway thank goodness my hairs growing a bit longer i dont look quite so much like a boy now dear me youre right said aunt fanny and everyone looked at berta i shall have to cut it short again gosh said berta why did i say that you wouldnt have noticed if i hadnt mentioned it let it grow again please aunt fanny ive been here a week and there isnt even a smell of a kidnapper and i reckon there wont be either but aunt fanny was firm about the hair and after the meal she made berta stand still while she clipped it a little shorter it was not a bit curly like georges and now that it was short the wave had almost gone from it she really did look like a good clean little boy rather a wishywashy one said george unkindly but everyone knew what she meant sally the poodle was a great success even george couldnt go on disliking the happy dancing little dog she trotted and capered about on her slim little legs and timmy was her adoring slave she always looks as if shes running about on tiptoe said anne and so she did she made friends with everyone even the paperboy who was really scared of dogs uncle quentin was the only one who didnt get used to berta and sally when he met them together berta so like a small boy sally at her heels he stopped and stared now let me see who are you he said yes youre berta no hes lesley everyone would say you must not call her berta dear said his wife you really must not its a funny thing that you never could remember she was berta and now that weve made her into lesley you immediately remember shes berta well i must say youve made her look exactly like a boy said uncle quentin much to georges annoyance george was beginning to be afraid that berta looked more boyish than she did well i hope youre having a good time with the others er er lesley is the name said aunt fanny with a little laugh quentin do try and remember another day passed peacefully by and the five children and two dogs were out of doors all day long swimming boating exploring really enjoying themselves berta wanted to go over to kirrin island but george kept making excuses not to go dont be mean said dick we all want to go its ages since we went its just that you dont want to let lesley do something shed like to do it isnt said george perhaps well go tomorrow but when tomorrow came something happened that upset their plans for going to kirrin island a telephone call came for uncle quentin and immediately he was in a panic fanny fanny where are you he called pack my bag at once at once do you hear his wife came running down the stairs at top speed quentin why whats happened elburs found a mistake in our calculations said uncle quentin what nonsense theres no mistake none at all but why cant he come here and work it out with you asked his wife why have you got to rush off like this tell him to come here quentin ill find him a bed somehow he says he doesnt want to while his daughter his daughter whats her name now lesley said his wife all right dont bother to explain i see now that it would be foolish for him to come while lesleys here shed be calling him pops and pops said her husband startled what do you mean pops its what she calls her father dear said aunt fanny patiently anyway hes quite right it would be foolish to hide lesley here so well and then have everyone hear her calling him pops and him calling her berta if any kidnappers followed him they would soon find out where his daughter was here with our four yes thats what i was trying to tell you said her husband impatiently anyway i must go to elbur straightaway so pack my bag please ill be back in two days time in that case ill go with you quentin said his wife i could do with a quiet two days and youre not much good when youre alone are you losing your socks and forgetting to have your shoes cleaned and her husband gave a sudden smile that lighted up his face and made him seem quite young will you really come with me i thought youd hate to leave the children its only for two days said his wife and joan is very good with them ill arrange that they shall go out on allday picnics in the boat theyll be quite safe then if any kidnappers were around theyd find it difficult to snatch lesley out of a boat but im beginning not to believe that tale of elburs he just got into a panic when he heard the rumour i expect the children were told of the sudden decision when they got back to lunch that day joan had to tell them because aunt fanny and her husband had already departed complete with two suitcases one containing precious papers and the other clothes for two days gosh said julian surprised i hope nothing horrids happened oh no it was just a sudden telephone call from master lesleys father said joan smiling at berta he had to see your uncle in a hurry about some figures why didnt pops come down here then he could have seen me demanded berta at once because everyone would have known who you are then said dick were hiding you dont forget oh yes well i do believe i had forgotten said berta rather surprised at herself its so lovely down here in kirrin with you all the days seem to swim by your mother said you had better go off on allday picnics in the boat said joan to george that was to make things easy for me of course but i dont mind what you do you can come back to lunch each day if you like i do so like you joan said berta giving the surprised cook a sudden hug youre a real honey in fact shes quite wunnerful said dick its all right joan well go out for the midday meal and for tea till my aunt comes back and well make the sandwiches and pack up everything ourselves well thats nice of you said joan why dont you go across to kirrin island for the day master lesley keeps wanting to go berta grinned at joan it always struck her as extremely funny to be called master lesley and joan never once forgot well go if the boat is ready said george rather reluctantly you know james is mending one of the rowlocks well go and see if its finished they all went to see but james was not there his father was working on another boat over by the jetty and he called to them do you want my james hes gone off in his uncles boat for a days fishing he said to tell you the rowlocks not mended yet but hell do it for certain tonight when he comes back right thank you called back julian berta looked very disappointed cheer up he said well be able to go tomorrow we shant said berta mournfully something else will happen to prevent us or george will think of another excuse not to go gee if i had a wunnerful wonderful island like that id go and live on it they went back to kirrin cottage and packed up a very good lunch for themselves bertas father had sent down a parcel of american goodies three days before and they meant to try them snicksnacks said dick reading the name on a tin shrimp lobster crab and a dozen other things all in one tin sounds good well make sandwiches with this gorgies said anne reading the name on another tin what a peculiar name oh i suppose its something you gorge yourself with lets open it they opened half a dozen tins with most exciting names and made themselves so many sandwiches that joan exclaimed in amazement however many have you made for each of you twenny each i mean twenty said berta but we wont be back to lunch or tea joan i guess well be plenny hungry plenty chorused everyone and berta obediently repeated the word a grin on her suntanned face what a day they had they walked for miles and picnicked in a shady wood near a little stream that bubbled along near by sounding very cool and enticing they decided to sit with their feet in it as they ate and anne gave continual little squeals because she said the water tickled the soles of her feet they were so tired when they got home that night that it was all they could do to eat their supper and stagger upstairs to bed i shant wake till half past twelve tomorrow morning yawned dick oh my poor feet gosh im so tired i shall probably fall asleep cleaning my teeth what a peaceful night said anne looking out of her window well sleep tight everyone i dont expect any of us will open an eye till late tomorrow morning i know i shant but she did she opened both eyes very wide indeed in the middle of the night chapter ten a puzzling thing all was quiet in kirrin cottage the two boys slept soundly in their room and george and anne slept without stirring in theirs berta was up in joans attic room and hadnt moved since she had flopped into bed timmy was on georges feet as usual and sally the poodle was curled up in the crook of bertas knees looking like a ball of black wool nobody stirred a black cloud crept up the sky and blotted out the stars one by one then a low roll of thunder came it was far off and only a rumble but it woke both the dogs and it woke anne too she opened her eyes wondering what the noise was then she knew it was thunder oh i hope a storm wont come and break up this wonderful weather she thought as she lay and listened she turned towards the open window and looked for the stars but there were none to see well if a storms coming ill go and watch it at the window thought anne it should be a magnificent sight over kirrin bay im so hot too id like a breath of fresh air at the window she got quietly out of bed and padded over to the open window she leaned out sniffing the cool air outside the night was very dark indeed because of the great black cloud the thunder came again but not very near just a low growl timmy jumped off georges bed and went to join anne he put his great paws up on the windowsill and looked out solemnly over the bay and then both he and anne heard another sound a faraway chugchugchugchugchug its a motorboat said anne listening isnt it timmy someones having a very late trip can you see any shiplights tim i cant the engine of the motorboat cut out just then and there was complete silence except for the swishswashswish of the waves on the beach anne strained her eyes to see if she could spot any light anywhere to show where the motorboat was it sounded quite far out on the bay why had it stopped on the water why hadnt it gone to the jetty then she did see a light but a very faint one right out at the entrance of the bay about the middle it shone for a while moved here and there and then disappeared anne was puzzled surely thats just about where kirrin island is she whispered to timmy is anyone there has the motorboat gone there do you suppose well well listen to see if it leaves again and goes away but no further sound came from across the bay and no light shone either perhaps the motorboat is behind kirrin island thought anne suddenly and then i wouldnt be able to see any lights on it the island would hide the boat and its lights but what was that moving light i saw was it someone on the island oh dear my eyes are getting so sleepy again that i can hardly keep them open perhaps i didnt hear or see anything after all there was no more thunder and no lightning at all the big black cloud began to thin out and one or two stars appeared in the gaps anne yawned and crawled into bed timmy jumped back on georges bed and curled himself up with a little sigh in the morning anne had almost forgotten her watch at the open window the night before it was only when joan mentioned that a big storm had burst over a town fifty miles away that anne remembered the thunder she had heard oh she said suddenly yes i heard thunder too and i got out of bed hoping to watch a storm but it didnt come and i heard a motorboat far out on the bay but i couldnt see any lights except for a faint moving one i thought was on kirrin island george sat up in her chair as if she had had an electric shock on kirrin island whatever do you mean nobodys there nobodys allowed there well i may have been mistaken said anne i was so very sleepy i didnt hear the motorboat go away i just went back to bed you might have waked me if you thought you saw a light on my island said george you really might oh miss anne it wouldnt be kidnappers would it said joan at once julian laughed no joan what would be the use of them going to kirrin island they couldnt do any kidnapping there in full view of all the houses round the bay i guess it was only a dream anne said berta i guess you heard the thunder in your sleep and it turned into the sound of a motorboat chugging dreams do that sort of thing i know once i left the tap running in my basin when i went to sleep and i dreamed all night long i was riding over the niagara falls everyone laughed berta could be very droll at times if the boats ready well certainly go over to kirrin island today said george if any trippers are there ill send timmy after them there will only be the rabbits said dick i wonder if there are still hundreds there my word last time we went they were so tame that we nearly fell over them yes but we didnt have timmy with us said anne george it will be nice to go to kirrin island again well have to tell lesley about the adventures weve had there they washed up after breakfast made the beds and did their rooms joan put her head round julians bedroom door will you want a packed lunch for a picnic again master julian she said if you dont i can get you a nice bit of cold ham for lunch the grocers just rung up if the boats mended were going over to the island joan said julian and then wed like a packed lunch but if we dont go well stay for lunch it will be easier for you in a way wont it we all got up so late this morning that theres not much time to make sandwiches and pick fruit and so on well you tell me as soon as you know about the boat said joan and disappeared george came in im going to see if the boat is mended she said ill only be gone a minute joan wants to know she was back almost at once its not ready she said disappointed but it will be ready at two oclock this afternoon so well have lunch here shall we and then go over to the island afterwards well pack up a picnic tea right said julian i vote we bathe from the beach this morning then the tide will be nice and high and we can have some fun with the big breakers and also keep an eye on james to see that he keeps his word about the boat said dick so when all their jobs were finished and they were very conscientious about them the five children and the two dogs went off down to the beach it was a little cooler after the thunder but not much and they were quite warm enough in their swimsuits with a blazer to wear after a bathe theres nothing nicer than to feel hot and go into the sea and get cool and then come out and get hot in the sun again and then go back into the sea began berta you say that every single day said george its like a gramophone record still i must say that i agree with you come on lets have a jolly good swim they all plunged through the big curling breakers squealing as the water dashed over their bodies cold and stinging they chased one another swam under water and grabbed at the legs swimming there floated on their backs and wished they hadnt forgotten to bring the big red rubber ball with them but nobody wanted to go and fetch it so they had to do without it timmy and sally raced about in the shallow waves at the edge of the sea timmy was a fine swimmer but sally didnt much like the water so they always played together at the edge they really were most amusing to watch the dogs were glad when the children came panting out of the water they lay down on the warm beach and timmy flopped down beside george she pushed him away you smell of seaweed she said pooh after a while dick sat up to pull on his blazer he gazed over the bay to where kirrin island lay basking in the sun and gave a sudden exclamation i say look all of you everyone sat up theres someone on kirrin island though we cant see them said dick someone lying down looking through binoculars at our beach can you see the sun glittering on the glasses yes said julian youre right someone must be using binoculars to examine this beach we cant see them as you say but its easy enough to see the sunlight glinting on the glasses gosh what cheek cheek said george her face crimson with rage its a lot more than cheek how dare people go on my island and use it to spy on people on the beach lets spy on them lets get our own fieldglasses and look through them well see who it is then ill get them said dick and ran off to kirrin cottage he felt worried it seemed a strange thing to do to spy on people sitting on the beach round the bay using binoculars on kirrin island what was the reason he came back with the binoculars and handed them to julian i think theyve gone now whoever it was said julian i dont mean gone off the island but gone somewhere else on it we cant see the glint of the sun on their glasses any more well buck up and see if you can spy anyone through our glasses said george impatiently julian adjusted them and gazed through them earnestly the island seemed very near indeed when seen through the powerful glasses everyone watched him anxiously see anyone asked dick not a soul said julian disappointed he handed the glasses to the impatient george who put them to her eyes at once blow she said theres not a thing to be seen not a thing whoever it was has gone into hiding somewhere if its trippers having a picnic there ill be absolutely furious if we see smoke rising well know it is trippers but no smoke arose dick had a turn at looking through the glasses and he looked puzzled he took them down from his eyes and turned to the others we ought to be able to see the rabbits running about he said but i cant see a single one did either of you julian and george well now i come to think of it no i didnt said julian and george said the same they were frightened by whoever was there of course said dick i suppose it will he all right to take lesley with us when we go to the island this afternoon i mean its just a bit queer that anyone should be using the island to spy from yes i see what you mean said julian if it occurred to the kidnappers whoever they are that berta might be down here with us it would be quite a good idea on their part to land on the island and use it as a place from which to spy on the beach they would guess we would come down to bathe every day yes and they would see five children instead of four and would begin to make inquiries about the fifth said dick they would hope actually to see berta on the beach theyve probably got a photograph of her and they would be looking for a girl with long wavy hair and there isnt one said anne mines not wavy and its not right down to my shoulders as lesleys was how muddled they would be theres one thing that would tell them that berta was here though said julian suddenly he pointed to sally good gracious yes said dick sally would give the game away all right whew well have to think about all this chapter eleven on kirrin island again george wanted to get her boat and go across to the island immediately she was so furious at the thought of anyone else being there without permission that all she wanted to do was to chase them away but julian said no for one thing the boat wont be ready till two he said for another thing weve got to consider whether its a sensible thing to do to go to the island if possible kidnappers are here on the lookout for berta lesley i mean we could go without her said george we could leave her safely with joan that would be a foolish thing to do said dick anyone watching us coming across in the boat would see that one of the five was missing and would guess at once it was berta if we go all of us must go actually i think it might be a good thing to go said julian carry the war right into the enemys camp so to speak if there are enemies it would be a most useful thing if we could see what they are like and give a description to the police i rather vote we go oh yes said dick anyway well have tim with us he can deal with any bad behaviour on the part of the intruders i dont really think its anybody but trippers said julian i think were making too much of the whole thing just because someone gazed at the beach through glasses remember that i think i saw a light on the island last night anne reminded him yes id forgotten that said julian looking at his watch its almost lunchtime lets go and have something to eat and then fetch the boat james is working on it now well give him a shout to see if it will be ready at two james was hailed and he shouted back yes sir be ready sharp at two oclock if you want her ive done one or two little jobs on her besides the rowlock thats good said dick and they walked back to kirrin cottage well well soon find out whos on your island george and if they are obstinate about leaving well have a little fun with timmy he can round them up all right cant you tim so could sally said berta sallys teeth arent very big but theyre sharp she once went for a man who accidentally pushed into me and you should have seen the nips she gave him all down his leg yes sally would come in useful said dick george looked rather scornful that silly little poodle she thought a fat lot of good she would be timmys worth a hundred of her joan had a fine lunch ready for them ham and salad and new potatoes piled high in a big dish there were firm red tomatoes from the greenhouse and lettuces with enormous yellowgreen hearts crisp radishes and a whole cucumber ready for anyone to cut as they liked slices of hardboiled egg were mixed in with the salad and joan had put in tiny boiled carrots and peas as well what a salad said dick fit for a king and big enough for several kings said anne how many potatoes ju small or large ones julian looked at the piledup dish ha i can really go for these potatoes he said ill have three large and four small whats for pudding asked berta i like this kind of salad so much that i might not have room for a stodgy sort of pudding its fresh raspberries from the garden sugar and homemade icecream said joan i didnt think youd want a hot pudding my sister came to see me this morning so i got her to pick the raspberries for me i cant think of a nicer meal than this said berta helping herself to the salad i really cant i like your meals better than the ones we have at home in america well turn you into a proper little english boy before you know where you are said dick they told joan about what they had seen that morning on the island she took a grave view of it at once now you know what your aunt said master julian she said the police have got to have a report of anything suspicious youd better ring them up i will when weve been over to the island and back said julian i dont want to look an ass joan if its only harmless trippers who dont know any better theres no need to bother the police i promise to ring the police if we find anything suspicious i think you ought to ring them now said joan and whats more i dont think you ought to go over to the island if youre suspicious of the people there well have timmy with us said dick dont worry and sally too added berta at once joan said no more but went out to get the raspberries and icecream looking worried she brought in an enormous glass dish of fresh red raspberries and another dish of creamylooking icecream blocks from the refrigerator a sigh of admiration went up from everyone who could want anything better said dick and that icecream how do you get it like that joan not too frozen and not too melty just how i like it i do hope some american doesnt get hold of you and whisk you away across the ocean youre worth your weight in gold joan laughed you say such extravagant things master dick and all because of an ordinary dish like raspberries and icecream get along with you master lesley will tell you theres nothing clever about raspberries and cream i agree with every word the others say said berta fervently youre wunnerful youre a honey youre but joan had run out of the room laughing very pleased she didnt mind what she did for children like these after they had finished lunch they went down to the beach james was still with the boat shes finished he called you going out in her now ill give you a hand down with her then soon all five children and the dogs as well were in georges boat the boys took the oars and began to pull hard towards the island timmy stood at the prow as he loved to do forepaws on the edge of the boat looking out across the water he fancies himself as a figurehead said dick ah here comes sally she wants to be one too mind you dont fall overboard sally and get your pretty feet wet youll have to learn to swim if you do sally stood close beside timmy and both dogs looked eagerly towards the island timmy because he knew there were hundreds of rabbits there and sally because for her it was still quite an adventure to go out in a boat like this berta too gazed eagerly at the little island as they drew near she had heard so many tales about it now she looked especially at the old castle rising up from it it was in ruins and berta thought it must be very old indeed like all americans she loved old buildings and old customs how lucky george was to own an island like this rocks guarded the island and the sea ran strongly over them sending up spray and foam however are we going to get safely to the shore of the island said berta rather alarmed at the array of fiercelooking rocks that guarded it theres a little cove we always use said george she was at the tiller and she steered the boat cleverly in and out of the rocks they rounded a low wall of very sharp rocks and berta suddenly saw the little cove oh is that the cove you mean she said why its like a little harbour going right up to that stretch of sand there was a smooth inlet of water running between rocks making a natural little harbour as berta said the boat slid smoothly into the inlet and up to the beach of sand dick leapt out and pulled it up the shore shes safe here he told berta welcome to kirrin island berta laughed she felt very happy what a truly wonderful place to come to george led the way up the sandy beach to the rocks behind and they climbed over them they stopped at the top and berta exclaimed in amazement rabbits thousands of them simply thousands my my i never saw such tame ones in my life will they let me pick them up no said george theyre not as tame as that theyll run away when we go near but they will probably not go into their holes they know us weve so often been here sally the poodle was amazed at the rabbits she couldnt believe her eyes she stood close beside berta staring at the scuttling rabbits her nose twitching as she tried to get their smell she simply couldnt understand why timmy didnt run at them timmy stood quite still beside george his tail down looking very mournful a visit to kirrin island was not such a pleasure to him as to the children because he wasnt allowed to hunt the rabbits what a waste of rabbits poor old tim look at him said julian he looks the picture of misery look at sally too shes longing to go after the rabbits but she doesnt think its good manners to chase them till timmy does good manners or not little sally could bear it no longer she suddenly made a dart at a rabbit who had come temptingly near and it leapt into the air in fright sally called george in a most peremptory manner no youre not to chase my rabbits tim go and fetch her here timmy went off to sally and gave a tiny little growl sally looked at him in amazement could her friend timmy really be growling at her timmy began to push himself against her and she found herself shepherded over to george good dog timmy said george pleased to have shown everyone how obedient he was sally you mustnt chase these rabbits because they are too tame they havent learnt to run away properly yet because not many people come here and frighten them whoever was here this morning scared them all right said julian remembering gosh dont lets forget there may be people here well i cant see anyone so far they went cautiously forward towards the old castle timmy running ahead then julian stopped and pointed to the ground cigarette ends look fresh ones too there are people here thats certain walk ahead of us tim but at that moment there came the sound that anne had heard the night before the sound of a motorboats engine rrrrrrrr theyre escaping cried dick quick run to the other side of the island we may see them then chapter twelve very suspicious the children with the two dogs barking excitedly ran to the other seaward side of the island great rocks lay out there and the sea splashed over them there it is a motorboat cried dick they all stood and watched the boat riding over the sea at a very fast speed where are the glasses did we bring them with us said julian id like to focus them on the boat and see if i can read the name or even see the men in it but the glasses had been left behind at kirrin cottage what a pity they must have anchored their motorboat out there and somehow clambered inshore over the rocks said george its a dangerous thing to do if you dont know the best way yes and if they came last night as i think they must have done because im sure now it was the engine of the motorboat that i heard said anne if they came last night they must have clambered to the shore in the dark i wonder they managed it it must have been the light of a lantern or a torch you saw on the island in the night said julian they probably didnt want to be seen arriving on the island and thats why they went to the other side the seaward side i wonder if they were men spying to find out if berta is with us or not lets snoop around a bit more and see if we can find anything else said anne the motorboat is almost out of sight now they went back to the other side of the island berta looked with awe at the old ruined castle in the middle jackdaws circled round a tower calling loudly chackchackchack once upon a time my castle had strong walls all round it said george and there were two great towers ones almost in ruins as you can see but the other is fairly good come right into the castle berta followed the others in struck dumb with awe to think that this island and this wonderful old ruined castle belonged to george how very very lucky she was she went through a great doorway and found herself in a dark room with stone walls enclosing it two narrow slitlike windows brought in all the light there was its strange and old and mysterious said berta half to herself its asleep and dreaming of the old days when people lived here it doesnt like us being here wake up said dick you look quite dopey berta shook herself and looked round again then she went on through the castle and looked at other rooms some without roofs some without one or two of their walls its a honey of a castle she said to george a real honey wunnerful wonderful they wandered all round showing the awestruck berta everything well show you the dungeons too said george very pleased to be impressing berta so much dungeons youve got dungeons too oh of course you told me about them said berta dungeons you dont say my my ill never forget this afternoon as they walked over the old courtyard timmy suddenly growled and stood still his tail down the hackles on his neck rising everyone automatically stood still too what is it tim asked george in a whisper timmys nose was pointing towards the little harbour where they had left their boat there must be someone there said dick dont say theyre going off with our boat george gave a scream her boat her precious boat she set off at top speed with timmy bounding in front come back george there may be danger shouted julian but george didnt listen she ran over the rocks that led down to the little harbourbeach and then stopped still in surprise two policemen were walking up the sandy beach their boat was drawn up beside georges they saluted her and grinned afternoon miss george what are you doing on my island demanded george recognising them why have you come here someone reported suspicious people on the island said the first policeman who did said george nobody knew about it but us i bet i know who reported it said dick suddenly joan did she didnt like us going off by ourselves she said we ought to telephone the police thats right said the policeman so we came to see for ourselves found anyone julian took command then and related how they had first seen the cigarette ends and then heard the motorboat starting up and had gone to see it roaring away from the island ah said both policemen profoundly ah what do you mean ah asked dick fred here heard a motorboat somewhere in the bay in the night said the first man what was it doing there id like to know so would we said julian we saw someone on the island looking through binoculars at the beach this morning this brought forth two more ahs and the policemen exchanged glances good thing youve got a couple of dogs with you said the one called fred well well just have a bit of a look round and then well go back on our beats again and mind you ring us up next time anything turns up miss george see off they went together looking closely at the ground they found the cigarette ends and picked them up then on they went again lets go back said george in a low voice it spoils things if other people are on the island i dont want to have a picnic here now well go off in the boat somewhere and have a picnic tea in a cove so they dragged the boat down to the water and jumped in sally was very pleased to be back in the boat and ran from end to end wagging her stiff little tail in delight timmy followed her up and down and got in everyones way how can i row if you keep on jumping over me timmy complained dick sally youre just as bad berta are you all right you look a bit green its only excitement and the bumpy bit past the rocks said berta anxious not to appear seasick in front of the others ill be all right as soon as we get on to calm waters but she wasnt so it was regretfully decided that they must row to the shore they had a lazy tea on the beach and berta recovered enough to join in heartily anyone got room for an icecream asked anne because if so ill stroll down to the shops and get some i want to buy a new pair of shoelaces too one of mine broke this morning everyone appeared to have room for an icecream so anne set off with sally who wanted to come with her she went to the drapers and got the laces and then went to the teashop that sold ices seven please she said the girl in the shop smiled seven you used to ask for five yes i know but weve got someone staying with us and another dog explained anne and both dogs like icecreams that reminds me someone was in my shop yesterday asking about your uncle said the girl he said he knew him he wanted to know how many children were staying at kirrin cottage and i thought only the four of you were there and timmy of course he seemed surprised and said surely there was another girl good gracious said anne startled did he really how inquisitive what did you say then i just said there were two boys and a girl and a girl who liked to dress as a boy said the girl anne was glad to think the shopgirl hadnt known about berta what was the man like she asked quite ordinary said the girl trying to remember he wore dark glasses like so many visitors do in the bright sun i noticed he had a large gold ring on his finger when he paid my bill thats all i can remember well if anyone else asks you about us just say weve got a friend staying with us called lesley said anne goodbye she went off at top speed anxious to tell the others the man in the teashop must have been one of those who had gone to the island to watch the beach he might have been staring at the five of them as they had played together he must be one of the men now in the motorboat anne didnt like it and it made her feel very uneasy she told the others what the shop girl had said as they sat in the sand and ate their icecreams timmy gobbled his almost at once and sat patiently watching for sally to deal with hers hoping that she would leave some all the four listened intently to annes little story that settles it said dick those men are certainly snooping round trying to find out if lesley is here they are getting uncomfortably close said julian still your uncle and aunt come back tomorrow said berta well tell them and maybe theyll have some good plan i hope those men dont know that they are away said dick uneasily i think well have to keep a pretty close watch from now on i wonder if berta ought to stay on here with us see what father says tomorrow said george so it was decided that nothing should be done except to keep a sharp lookout until georges parents came back they all went back rather soberly to kirrin cottage and told joan what had happened on the island you telephoned to the police joan said dick shaking his finger at her i did and i was right to said joan and whats more master lesleys bed is going to be moved away from the window tonight and the windows going to be fastened even if we melt and the door will be locked ill lend you timmy too if you like said george he can sleep in the room with sally you ought to be safe then she really only meant it as a joke but to her surprise joan accepted at once thank you miss she said id be glad of timmy i feel all of a dither left on my own like this and kidnappers closing in on us julian laughed oh its not so bad as that joan only one more night and uncle quentin and aunt fanny will be back oh i quite forgot to tell you said joan look theres a telegram come theyre staying away a whole week thats why i feel so scared a week well a lot can happen in a week chapter thirteen a horrid shock julian was not very happy to hear that his aunt and uncle were staying away for a week he picked up the telegram it was addressed to george but joan had opened it not returning for a week it said complications have arisen hope all goes well love from mother there was no address how annoying now julian couldnt even let them know that he was feeling uneasy he made up his mind to guard berta every minute thank goodness they had timmy nobody would dare to do any kidnapping under timmys eye he thought it was a good idea to put timmy in joans room that night with berta in fact if george would agree it would be best to do that each night he thought it would not be wise to ask george now though because he could see that she was half sorry she had made the offer to joan julian was quite fussy that evening he insisted on the blinds being drawn when they sat down to play cards after their supper he would not let berta take sally out for a run but took her himself watching for any strange person as he went down the lane youre making me feel quite scared said anne with a laugh oh ju its so hot in this room do do lets have the blind up for a few minutes and let some air in i shall begin to sizzle if we dont timmy would soon growl if there was anyone outside all right said julian and drew up the blind it was dark outside now and the light streamed out thats better said anne mopping her wet forehead now whose turn is it yours george they sat round the table playing julian and berta sat side by side as julian was helping her in a new game of cards she looked exactly like a very earnest little boy with her straight closecut fair hair george sat opposite the window with dick on one side of her and anne on the other your turn dick said george do buck up youre slow tonight she sat and waited looking out of the window into the darkness then suddenly she slammed down her cards and leapt up shouting everyone jumped almost out of their skins what is it what is it george cried julian out there look a face i saw a face peeping in at us the light of the window just caught it timmy timmy quick go after him but timmy wasnt there nor was sally george called frantically again timmy come here quickly oh blow him that fellow will get away tim timmy came bounding up the hall and into the sittingroom barking sally followed behind where were you fathead cried george furiously jump out of the window go on chase him find him timmy leapt out of the window and sally tried to do the same but couldnt she barked and yelped trying again and again to jump out joan came running in panicstricken wondering what was happening listen said julian suddenly shut up sally listen they were all suddenly quiet sally too there was the sound of a car being revved up down the lane and then the sound died down as the car sped away hes got away whoever he was said dick and sat down suddenly gosh i feel as if id been running a mile you nearly scared the life out of me when you slammed down your cards like that george and yelled in my ear timmy leapt in at the window at that moment and dick almost jumped out of his skin again so did everyone else including sally who fled behind the sofa in panic whats all this about said joan quite fiercely really george was in a tearing rage with timmy of all things she shouted at the surprised dog and he put his tail down at once where were you why did you slink out of the room into the kitchen how dare you leave me and go off like that just when we needed you im ashamed of you timmy you could have caught that fellow easily oh dont said berta almost in tears poor timmy dont george then george turned on berta you just let me scold my own dog if he needs it and you go and scold yours too i bet timmy followed your horrid little woolly pet out into the kitchen it was her fault not his shut up george said julian your temper gets us nowhere calm down and lets hear what you saw calm down i say george stared at him about to retort with something defiant then timmy gave a small whimper his heart was almost broken to hear george george his beloved mistress rave at him in such anger he had no idea what he had done to displease her the whimper brought george to her senses oh timmy she said and knelt down and flung her arms round his neck i didnt mean to shout at you i was so angry because we missed our chance of getting that man who was peeping in at us oh timmy its all right it really is timmy was extremely glad to hear it he licked george lavishly and then lay down by her very soberly he wished he knew what all the excitement was about so did joan she thumped on the table to get everyones attention and at last got julian to explain everything to her she stared out of the window halfthinking that she could see faces in the darkness outside she drew the blind down sharply well go to bed she said all of us i dont like this i shall ring up the police and warn them master lesley you come with me straightaway now i think perhaps youre right joan said julian ill lock up everywhere come on girls timmy was astonished and upset to find himself handed over to joan and berta was george still cross with him then it was a very very long time since he had slept away from her at night he cheered up a little when he saw that sally was going to be with him and trotted rather mournfully up the attic stairs to joans room joan soon got berta into bed and then undressed herself she fastened the window and locked the door she gave timmy a rug in a corner and sally jumped up on bertas bed as usual now we ought to be quite safe said joan and settled creakingly into her bed on the floor below the two boys followed the same procedure and so did anne and george doors were locked and windows fastened though it was a hot night and they were all sure they would be melted by the morning george couldnt bear to think of timmy with berta and joan especially as she had been so very cross with him she lay in bed full of remorse dear kind faithful timmy how could she have shouted at him like that do you suppose timmy is feeling very upset she said when she and anne were in bed a bit perhaps said anne but dogs are very forgiving i know that somehow makes it worse said george well you really shouldnt get into such tempers said anne seizing the opportunity to tell george a few home truths i thought you were getting over the tantrums you used to have but these hols youve been pretty bad because of berta i suppose i wish i could go up and say good night to timmy george began again after a few minutes silence oh for goodness sake george said anne sleepily do be sensible you cant go and bang on joans door and ask for timmy youd scare them to death anne fell asleep but george didnt then suddenly she heard the sound of a door being unlocked and sat up it sounded as if it came from the attic was it joan unlocking her door what did she want a cautious little knock came at georges door who is it said george me joan said joans voice ive brought sally down miss george timmy keeps trying to get up on miss bertas bed to be with sally and she simply cant go to sleep her campbed is too small to hold all three of them so will you have sally please oh blow said george and went to open her door hows timmy she said in a low voice all right said joan hell be annoyed ive taken sally away im glad to have him up here tonight with all these goings on is he is he happy joan asked george but joan had turned away and didnt hear george sighed why had she offered to let joan and berta have timmy tonight of all nights when she had scolded him so unfairly now she had got to have this silly little sally instead sally whimpered she didnt like being away from berta and she was not fond of george she wriggled out of georges arms and ran round the room still whimpering anne woke up with a jump whatevers going on she said why its sally in the room how did she get here george told her sounding very cross well i hope shell settle down said anne i dont want her to whimper and run round the bedroom all night long but sally wouldnt settle down her whimpering became louder and when she took a flying jump on to georges bed and landed right on georges middle the girl had had enough of it she sat up and spoke in a fierce whisper you little idiot im jolly well going to take you downstairs and put you into timmys kennel good idea said anne sleepily george picked up the lively little poodle and went out of the room shutting the door softly anne promptly went to sleep again george crept down the stairs and went to the garden door she undid it and walked out in dressinggown and pyjamas her curly hair all tousled carrying the whimpering little dog suddenly she felt sally stiffen in her arms and growl grrrrrrr george stood quite still what had sally heard then things happened very suddenly indeed a torch was flashed in her face and before she could cry out a cloth was thrown over her head so that she could not make a sound this is the one said a low voice the one with curly hair and this is her dog the poodle put him in that kennel quick before he barks the place down sally too scared even to growl was pushed into the kennel and the door shut on her george struggling and trying vainly to call out was lifted off her feet and carried swiftly down to the front gate the garden door swung creaking to and fro in the night wind sally whimpered in her kennel but no one heard either door or dog everyone in kirrin cottage was sound asleep chapter fourteen where is george next morning about half past seven joan went downstairs as usual berta was awake and decided to fetch sally from georges bedroom she put on her dressinggown and padded downstairs with timmy behind her to georges room on the floor below the door was shut and she knocked gently come in said annes sleepy voice oh its you berta yes ive come for sally said berta hallo wheres george anne looked at the empty bed beside hers i dont know the last thing i heard of her was in the middle of the night when we got cross because sally wouldnt settle down and george said she would take her down to the kennel oh well probably george has gone down to fetch her back said berta ill go up and dress its a heavenly morning again are you going to bathe before breakfast because if so ill just put on my swimsuit yes i think we might today were nice and early said anne scrambling out of bed go and wake the boys timmy go down and find george dick and julian were awake and quite ready for a beforebreakfast bathe anne joined them as they went downstairs berta had already gone down and had discovered sally in the kennel most excited to see her she pranced round barking happily timmy came up to the children looking puzzled he had hunted everywhere for george and hadnt found her woof he said to anne woof woof it was just as if he were saying please where is george havent you found george yet said anne in surprise she called to joan joan wheres george has she gone down to bathe already i havent seen her said joan but i expect she has because the gardendoor was open when i came down and i guessed one of you had gone for an early bathe well george must be down on the beach then said anne feeling rather puzzled why hadnt george wakened her and told her to come too soon all four were on the beach with the two dogs sally very happy to be with berta again and timmy very downcast and puzzled he stood staring up the beach and down looking quite lost i cant see george anywhere said dick suddenly feeling scared shes not in the sea they all gazed over the water but no one was bathing that morning anne turned to julian in sudden panic ju where is she i wish i knew said julian anxiously shes not here and she hasnt gone out in her boat its over there lets go back to the house i dont think george would have gone for an early bathe without telling me said anne and i also think i would surely have woken up just for a moment when she came back after taking sally down oh julian i think something happened when she went downstairs with sally late last night ive been thinking that too said julian soberly we know that there was someone about last night because george saw a face outside the window lets go back to the house and see if we can spot anything to help us near the garden door or the kennel they went back looking very anxious as soon as they began to look about near the kennel anne gave an exclamation and bent down she picked up something and held it out to the others without a word what is it gosh its the girdle off georges dressinggown said dick startled that proves it george was caught when she came down to put sally into her kennel they must have thought she was me said berta in tears you see she was carrying sally and they know sally belongs to me and she has short hair too and dresses like a boy in the daytime thats it said julian actually you look like a boy in your boys things but george doesnt and the kidnappers are looking for a girl dressed as a boy and george fitted the bill nicely especially as she had the poodle with her shes been kidnapped and will my father get the usual note to say his daughter will not be harmed if he does what the kidnappers want and hands over this new secret said berta sure to said julian what will they say when they know theyve got george not me asked berta well said julian considering i really dont know they might try the same thing with uncle quentin but of course he hasnt got the figures they want what about berta now asked dick once those men find theyve got the wrong girl theyll be after berta in a trice george wont tell them said anne at once shell know that berta would be in immediate danger if she did tell them so shell say nothing as long as she can would she really said berta wonderingly shes brave isnt she she could get herself set free at once if she said she wasnt me and proved it gee shes wunnerful if she could do a thing like that george is brave all right said dick as brave as any boy could be when shes in a fix julian lets go and tell joan weve got to make up our minds what we are going to do about this and also we must safeguard berta somehow she cant possibly wander round with us any more berta all at once began to feel scared georges sudden disappearance had brought home to her the very real danger she was in she had not really believed in it before she looked over her shoulder and all round and about as if she expected someone to pounce on her its all right berta theres no one here at present said dick comfortingly but youd better get indoors all the same i dont think george would give away the fact that she wasnt you but the men might find out some other way and back they would come hotfoot berta raced indoors as if someone was chasing her julian shut and locked the garden door and called joan they had a very serious conference indeed joan was horrified she wept when she heard that george must have been kidnapped in the middle of the night she wiped her eyes with her apron i said we must lock the doors and the windows i said we must tell the police and then miss george has to go down all by herself into the garden she said if only she hadnt had the poodle with her no wonder they thought she was berta with sally in her arms listen joan said julian there are a lot of things to do first we must tell the police then somehow we must contact aunt fanny and uncle quentin its so like them not to give us an address then we must most certainly decide about berta she must be well hidden away somewhere yes thats certain said joan wiping her eyes again she sat and thought for a minute and then her face lightened i know where we could hide her she said you remember jo the little gypsy girl youve had one or two adventures with yes said julian she lives with your cousin now doesnt she she does said joan and my cousin would have berta straightaway if she knew about this she lives in a quiet little village where nothing ever happens and nobody would think anything of my cousin having a child to stay with jo she often does it really seems an idea said dick doesnt it julian weve simply got to get berta away at once we could trust jo to look after her too jos as sharp as a packet of needles the police would know too said julian and would keep an eye on her as well joan can you ring up and get a taxi and take berta now this very minute itll be a surprise for my cousin my arriving this time of the morning said joan standing up and taking off her apron but shes quick on the uptake and shell do it i know master lesley get a few things together nothing posh mind like your silver hairbrush berta looked extremely scared by now and was inclined to refuse to go julian put his arm round her look he said i bet george is holding her tongue so that we can get you away in safety before the men tumble to the fact that theyve got the wrong boy so you can play up too cant you and be brave yes said berta looking up at julians kind serious face ill do what you say but whats this jo like joan said she was a little gypsy girl i dont like gypsies youll like this one all right said julian shes a pickle and a scamp and a scallywag but her hearts in the right place isnt it joan joan nodded she had always been fond of the reckless cheeky little jo and it was she who had found a home for her when jos father had had to go to prison come on master lesley she said we must hurry master julian is she to go as a girl or a boy now weve got to decide that too a girl please please please a girl said berta at once julian considered yes i think youre right he said youd better be a girl now but for goodness sake dont call yourself berta yet she can be jane said joan firmly thats a nice name but quite ordinary enough for nobody to notice berta is too noticeable a name come along now well have to pick out your simplest clothes now ill ring up the police said julian and also ring for a taxi no dont get a taxi for us said joan i dont want to arrive at my cousins little cottage in a taxi and make everyone stare jane and i will catch the market bus and people will think im going off to market we can get another bus there that will take us almost all the way to my cousins weve only to walk down the lane then good idea said julian and went to the telephone he got hold of the police sergeant and told his tale the man showed not the least excitement but took down quickly all that julian told him ill be up in ten minutes he said wait in till i come julian put down the receiver dick and anne were watching him with troubled eyes what was happening to george was she frightened or furious or perhaps hurt timmy was absolutely miserable he knew by now that something had happened to george he had gone a dozen times to the place where her dressinggown girdle had been found and had sniffed round disconsolately sally knew he was unhappy and trotted after him soberly when he lay down she lay down beside him when he got up she got up too it would have been amusing to watch if anyone had felt like being amused but nobody felt that way footsteps came up the path the police said julian theyve not been long chapter fifteen discoveries in the wood the sergeant had come and also a constable anne felt comforted when she saw the big solid responsiblelooking men julian took them into the sittingroom and began to tell all that had happened in the middle of it there came the sound of footsteps racing down the stairs and up the hall were just off shouted joans voice cant stop to say goodbye or we shall miss the bus down the garden path rushed joan carrying a small suitcase of her own which she had lent berta because bertas was too grand in it she had packed the very simplest of bertas clothes but secretly she had thought that she would tell her cousin to dress berta in some of jos things berta ran behind her a different berta now dressed in a frock instead of jeans and jersey she waved to the others as she went trying to smile good old berta said dick shes got quite a lot in her that kid in fact shes quite a honey said julian trying to make anne smile whats all that said the sergeant in surprise nodding his head towards the front path down which joan and berta had just rushed julian explained the sergeant frowned you shouldnt have arranged about that till youd consulted us he said julian was quite taken aback well you see he said it seemed to me that i must get berta out of the house and hidden away at once in case the kidnappers realised quickly that theyd got the wrong girl thats so said the sergeant still you should have consulted us it seems quite a good idea to put her in that quiet village with jo to see to her shes sharp that jo i wouldnt put it past her to hoodwink the kidnappers any day but this is a very serious business you realise master julian it cant be dealt with by children can you get george back asked anne breaking in with the question she had been longing to ask ever since the police came maybe said the sergeant now ill get in touch with your aunt and uncle master julian and with mr elbur wright and the telephone rang just then and anne answered it its for you sergeant she said and he took the receiver from her ha hm just so yes yes right ha hm the sergeant replaced the receiver and went back to julian and the others news has just come in that the kidnappers have contacted mr elbur wright and told him theyve got his daughter berta he said oh and have they demanded that he shall tell them the secret figures he knows asked julian the sergeant nodded yes hes almost off his head with shock hes promised to give them all they want very foolish gosh youd better tell him its not berta theyve got but george said dick then hell sit tight the sergeant frowned now you leave this to us he said ponderously youll only hinder us if you interfere or try meddling on your own you just sit back and take things easy what with george kidnapped and in danger exploded dick what are you going to do to get her back now now said the sergeant annoyed she is in no danger shes not the person they want they will free her as soon as they realise that they wont said dick theyll get on to her father and make him give up a few secrets well that will give us a little more time to find these men said the irritating sergeant and he stood up big and burly in his navy blue uniform let me know at once if you have any other news and please do not try to meddle i assure you that we know the right things to do he went out with the constable julian groaned he doesnt see that this is urgent its so complicated too the wrong girl kidnapped the wrong father informed the right one not at all inclined to give up powerful secrets and poor old george not knowing what is happening well thank goodness we got berta out of the way said dick anne you look queer are you all right yes i think im just shocked and oh dear i feel awfully empty said anne pressing her tummy gosh we forgot all about breakfast said dick staring at the clock and its almost ten oclock now what have we been doing all this time come on anne get us some food theres a dear we shall all feel better then im so sorry for poor old timmy and little sally said anne going into the kitchen timmy darling dont look at me like that i dont know where your beloved george is or id take you to her straight away and sally you will have to put up with me for a little while because although i do know where berta is i cant possibly take you there they were soon sitting down to a plain breakfast of boiled eggs toast and butter it seemed queer only to be three dick tried to make conversation but the other two were very quiet timmy sat under the table with his head on annes foot and sally stood beside her paws on her knee anne comforted both the mournful dogs as best she could after breakfast anne went to wash up and make the beds and the boys went outside to have another look at the place where georges dressinggown girdle had been found sally and timmy came with them timmy sniffed around a good bit and then nose to ground went down the garden path to the front gate and then pushed it open and went through it nose to ground he went down the lane and turned off into a little path dick hes following some kind of trail said julian im certain its georges even if somebody carried her away timmy is clever enough to know george might be with him he might just get a whiff of her come on then lets follow timmy said dick and the boys and sally went along the little path hot on timmys track timmy began to run and dick called to him not so fast old boy were coming too but timmy did not slow down whatever it was he smelt the scent was quite strong the boys ran after him beginning to feel excited but soon timmy came to a full stop in a little clearing in the wood dick and julian panted up to where he was nosing round he looked up at them forlornly evidently the scent came to an end there cartracks said dick pointing down to where the dampish grass under a great oak tree had been rutted with big tyremarks see the men brought a car here and hid it then crept through the woods to kirrin cottage and waited for a chance to get berta they got george instead but they wouldnt have got anyone if only george hadnt been ass enough to take sally to the kennel the house was well and truly locked and bolted julian was looking at the wheeltracks these tracks were made by very big tyres he said it was a car and i rather think these are american tyremarks i can check that when i get back ill go and ask jim at the local garage hell know ill just sketch one quickly he took out a notebook and pencil and began to sketch dick bent down and looked more carefully at the tracks there is quite a lot of crisscrossing of tracks he said i think the men came here and waited then when they got george they must have pushed her into the car and turned it to go back the way they came see the tracks lead down that wide path over there they made a mess of the turning though bumped into this tree look theres a mark right across it where said julian at once yes a bright blue mark the car was that colour or the wings were at any rate well thats something weve learnt a big blue car probably american surely the police could trace that timmys still nosing round the picture of misery said dick poor old tim i expect he knows george was pushed into a car just there hallo hes scraping at something they ran to see what it was timmy was trying to get at some small object embedded in a carrut evidently in turning the car had run over whatever it was dick saw something broken in half something green he picked up the halves a comb did george have a little green comb like this yes she did said julian she must have thrown it down when she got near to the car to show us she was taken here hoping we would find it and look whats that it was a handkerchief hanging on a gorse bush julian ran to it it had the initial g on it in blue yes its georges he said shes got six of these all with differentcoloured initials she must have thrown this out too quick dick look for anything else she might have thrown out of the car while they were trying to turn it they would probably put her in the back and she would just have had a chance to throw out anything she had in her dressinggown pocket to let us know she was here if we came along this way they searched for a long time timmy found one more thing again embedded in a carrut a boiled sweet wrapped in cellophane paper look said dick picking it up one of the sweets we all had the other night george must have had one in her dressinggown pocket if only she had had a pencil and bit of paper she might have had time to write a note too thats an idea said julian well hunt even more carefully but although they searched every bit of ground and every bush there was no note to be found it was too much to hope for lets just follow the cartracks and make sure they reached the road said julian so they followed them down the wide woodland path at the side a little way along a piece of paper blew in the wind hopping an inch or two each time the breeze flapped it dick picked it up and then looked at julian excitedly she did have time to write a note this is her writing but theres only one word look whatever does it mean julian and dick frowned over the piece of paper yes it was georges writing the g was exactly like the way she always wrote the big g at the beginning of her signature gringo read julian just that one word gringo what does it mean its something she heard them say i suppose and she just had time to write it and throw out the paper gringo timmy what does gringo mean chapter sixteen jo dick and julian went back to kirrin cottage with the two disconsolate dogs they showed anne the things they had found and she too puzzled over the word gringo well have to tell the police what you have discovered she said they might trace the car and they might know who or what gringo is ill telephone them now said julian dick you go down to the garage with this sketch of the tyremark and see if its an american design the police were interested but not helpful the sergeant said he would send his constable up to examine the place where the car had stood in the clearing and gave it as his opinion that the bit of paper wasnt much use as the boys had found it some way from the turningplace of the car your cousin wouldnt be able to throw it out of the window once the car was going he said there would be sure to be someone in the back with her the only reason she could throw things out at the clearing would be because the second fellow and there would certainly be two would be guiding the other man in the turning of the car the wind might have blown the note along the path said julian anyway ive given you the information it was a very miserable day although the sun shone down warmly and the sea was blue and most inviting but nobody wanted to bathe nobody really wanted to do anything but talk and talk about george and what had happened and where she could be at that moment joan came back in time to get their lunch and was pleased to find that anne had done the potatoes and prepared a salad and that dick had managed to pick some raspberries they were very glad to see joan she was someone sensible and comforting and matteroffact well miss jane is now safely in my cousins cottage she said she was very miserable but i told her she must smile and play about else the neighbours would wonder about her i put her into some of jos clothes they fitted her all right hers are too expensivelooking and would make people talk they told joan what they had discovered in the clearing that morning she took the note and looked at it gringo she said thats a queer word sounds like a gypsy word to me its a pity jo isnt here she might tell us what it means did you see jo asked dick no she was out shopping said joan lifting the lid to look at the potatoes i only hope she gets on with miss jane all right really its getting very difficult to remember that childs change of names the only fresh news that day was a worried telephonecall from aunt fanny she was shocked and amazed at the news she had heard your uncle has collapsed she said he has been working very hard you know and now this news of george has been quite the last straw hes very ill i cant leave him at the moment but anyway we couldnt do anything only the police can help now to think those horrible men took george by mistake dont worry too much aunt fanny said julian weve hidden berta away safely and i expect the men will free george as soon as she tells them shes the wrong girl if she does tell them said dick under his breath she might not for bertas sake for a few days at any rate everyone went miserable to bed that night anne took timmy and sally with her for both were so forlorn that she couldnt bear to do anything else timmy wouldnt eat anything at all and anne was worried about him julian could not go to sleep he tossed and turned thinking about george hottempered courageous impatient independent george he worried and worried about her wishing he could do something a small stone suddenly rattled against his window he sat up alert at once then something fell right into the room and rolled over the floor julian was at the window in a trice who was throwing pebbles at his window he leaned out a voice came up to him at once is it you dick jo what are you doing here said julian startled its julian speaking dicks asleep ill wake him and let you in but he did not need to go down and let jo in she was up a tree outside the window and across some ivy and on his windowsill before he had even shaken dick awake she slid into the room julian switched on his light there was jo sitting at the end of dicks bed the familiar cheeky grin on her face she was very brown but still showed her freckles and her hair was as short and curly as ever i had to come she said when i got home from shopping there was this girl jane she told me all about how george had been captured in mistake for her and when i said to her you go straightaway and say youre safe and sound and its all a mistake and george has got to be set free she wouldnt she just wouldnt all she did was to sit and cry little coward no no jo said dick and tried to explain everything to the indignant girl but he could not convince her if i was that girl jane i wouldnt let someone stay kidnapped because of me she said i dont like her shes silly and im supposed to keep an eye on her phoo not me id like her to be kidnapped the way shes behaving about george julian looked at jo she was very very loyal to the five and proud of being their friend she had been in two adventures with them now an artful little gypsy girl but a very loyal friend her father was in prison and she was living with a cousin of joans and for the first time in her life going to school to learn lessons listen jo weve found out a few more things since berta i mean lesley no i dont i mean jane what do you mean said jo puzzled i mean jane said julian weve found out something else since joan parked jane with her cousin this morning go on tell me said jo have you found out where george is ill go and break in and get her out if you do oh jo its no use just being fierce said dick things are not so easy as all that george threw out a bit of paper with this written on it said julian and he put it before jo see just that one word gringo does it mean anything to you gringo said jo that rings a bell lets see now gringo she frowned as she thought hard then she nodded oh yes i remember now a fair came to the town a few weeks back the big town not far from our village it was called gringos great fair where did it go asked dick eagerly it was going to fallenwick then to granton said jo i made friends with the boy whose father owned the roundabout and gosh i had about a hundred free rides you would said both boys together and jo grinned do you suppose this gringo who runs the fair could be anything to do with the name gringo that george wrote on this paper said julian i dunno said jo but if you like i can go and find the fair and get hold of spiky thats the roundabout boy and see if i can find out anything i know spiky said gringo was a real horror to work for and thought himself as good as a lord had he a car a big car asked dick suddenly i dunno that either said jo i can find out here ill go now you lend me a bike and ill bike to granton certainly not said julian startled at the idea of jo biking the twelve miles to granton in the middle of the night all right said jo rather sulkily i just thought youd like me to help it might be that this gringo has got george somewhere he was the kind of fellow who was a gobetween if you know what i mean how asked dick well spiky said that if anyone wanted something dirty done this gringo just held out his hand and if a wad of notes was put into it hed do it and nothing said said jo i see said julian hm it sounds as if kidnapping would be right up his street then jo laughed scornfully that would be nothing to him chickenfeed come on julian let me have a lend of your bike no said julian thanks very very much but im not letting anyone ride to a fair in the middle of the night to find out if a fellow called gringo has anything to do with george i cant believe he has either its too farfetched all right but you asked me if the name meant anything to me said jo sounding offended anyway its a common enough nickname in the circus world and the fair world too theres probably a thousand gringos about its time you went back home said julian looking at his watch and be decent to berta i mean jane please jo you can come over tomorrow to see if theres any more news how did you get here tonight by the way walked said jo well ran i mean not by the roads though they take too long i go like the birds do as straight as i can and its much shorter dick had a sudden picture of the valiant little jo speeding through woods and fields over hills and through valleys as straight as a crow flying homewards how did she find her way like that he knew he would never be able to jo slipped out over the windowsill and down the tree as easily as a cat bye she said see you soon give our love to jane whispered dick shant said jo much too loudly and disappeared julian switched out the light whew he said i always feel as if ive been blown about by a strong fresh wind when i see jo what a girl fancy wanting to ride all the way to granton tonight after running all the way here from bertas yes im jolly glad you wouldnt let her take your bike said dick its a good thing she wouldnt dare to disobey you he got into bed and just at that very moment the two boys heard a loud ringing noise dick sat up straightaway well im blowed he said the little wretch whats up said julian and then he too realised what the ringing was a bicycle bell yes a bell rung loudly and defiantly by someone cycling swiftly along the searoad towards granton its jo said dick and shes taken my bike i know its bell gosh wont i rub her face in the mud when i get hold of her julian gave a loud guffaw shes a monkey a gallant plucky loyal aggravating monkey what a cheek shes got she didnt dare to take my bike when id said no so she took yours well we cant do a thing about it now what that roundabout boy is going to think when hes awakened in the middle of the night by jo i cannot imagine hes probably used to her said dick well lets go to sleep i wonder if george is asleep or awake i hate to think of her a prisoner somewhere i bet timmy hates it more than we do said dick hearing a longdrawn whimper from the next room poor old tim he cant go to sleep either dick and julian managed to go to sleep at last both thinking of a speedy little figure on a bicycle racing through the night to ask questions of a roundabout boy called spiky chapter seventeen to gringos fair at half past seven next morning joan came running upstairs to julians bedroom a piece of paper in her hand she knocked on the door master julian a dirty little note was on the front door mat when i got down this morning its folded over with your name on the outside julian was out of bed in a trice a note from the kidnappers perhaps no it couldnt be they wouldnt write to him it was from jo she had scribbled it so badly that julian could hardly read it julian i saw spiky hes coming to the beech at levven i took dicks bike to go home on i will bring it back at levven dont be too cross jo i suppose beech doesnt mean a tree it means the beach the sands said dick and levven means eleven oclock little scallywag i hope she hasnt damaged my bike in any way jo hadnt she had actually managed to find time to clean it before she left home and arrived with it so bright and gleaming that dick hadnt the heart to scold her she was early so she came to the house instead of the beach she rode through the gate and up the front path and timmy ran to greet her with a volley of delighted barks he liked jo in fact he really loved the little gypsy girl she certainly had a way with animals sally followed dancing on her tiptoes as usual ready to welcome as a friend anyone that timmy liked dick hailed jo from the front door as she came up hallo bicyclestealer my word whats happened to my bike have you springcleaned it jo grinned looking at dick warily yes im sorry i took it dick youre not a bit sorry but ill forgive you said dick grinning too so you got to the fair safely after all oh yes and i woke up spiky he wasnt half surprised said jo but his pa was sleeping in the same caravan as he was so i couldnt say much i just told him to be on kirrin beach at eleven then i rode back home i ought to have left your bike on the way back but i was a bit tired so i rode home instead of walking you cant have had much sleep last night said julian looking at the sunburnt girl with her untidy curly hair hallo whos that a short plump boy was hurrying past the gate he had a mop of black hair which stuck up into curious spikes of hair at the crown oh thats spiky said jo hes on time isnt he hes called spiky because of his hair you wont believe it but he spends a fortune on hairoil trying to make those spiky bits go flat but they wont she called loudly spiky hey spiky spiky turned at once he had a pleasant rather lopsided face and eyes as black as currants he stood staring at jo and the boys im just off to the beach he said right were coming too said jo and she and the boys went to join they met the icecream man on the way and julian bought an icecream for each of them coo thanks said spiky pleased he was rather shy of dick and julian and wondered very much why he had been asked to come they sat down on the beach i wasnt half scared when you came tapping at the window last night he said to jo licking his icecream with a very pink tongue whats it all about well said julian cautiously were interested in somebody called gringo old gringo said spiky a lot of peoples interested in gringo do you know what we say at the fair we say gringo ought to put up a notice all dirty work done here hes a bad lot gringo is but he pays us well even if he makes us work like slaves he owns the fair doesnt he said julian and spiky nodded i expect he uses it as a cover for all his other bigger jobs julian said to dick he looked at the plump blackeyed boy wondering how far he could trust him jo saw the look and knew what it meant hes all right she said nodding towards spiky you can say what you like hes an oyster he is aint you spiky spiky grinned his lopsided grin julian decided to trust him and speaking in a low voice that really thrilled spiky he told him about the kidnapping of george spikys eyes nearly fell out of his head coo he said i bet old gringos at the bottom of that last week he went off up to london he told my pa he was on to a big job an american job he said it was yes it sounds as if it all fits said julian spiky this kidnapping happened the night before last did anything unusual occur in the fair camp do you know it must have happened in the middle of the night spiky considered he shook his head no i dont think so gringos big doublecaravan is still there so he cant have gone he had it moved right away from the camp yesterday morning said there was too much noise for his old ma who lives in his posh caravan and looks after him we was all glad it was moved now he cant spy on us so easily i suppose you began julian and then stopped as dick gave an exclamation ive got an idea he said suppose that caravan was moved for another reason suppose someone was making a row inside the van someone shouting for help say gringo would have to move it away from the rest of the camp in case that someone was heard there was a pause and then spiky nodded yes it could be he said ive never known gringo move his caravan away from the camp before shall i do a bit of snooping for you yes said julian excited my word it would be a bit of luck if we could find george so quickly and so near us too a fair camp would be a fine place to hide her of course thank goodness we found that bit of paper with gringo written on it lets all go to the fair this afternoon said dick timmy too hed smell out george at once hadnt we better tell the police first said julian at once spiky and jo got up in alarm spiky looked as if he were going to run away immediately dont you get the police julian said jo urgently you wont get anything more out of spiky if you do not a thing im going said spiky still looking terrified no youre not said dick and caught hold of him we shant go to the police they might frighten off gringo and make him smuggle george away at once ive no doubt he has plans to do so at any minute we shant say a word so sit down and be sensible you can believe him jo told spiky hes straight see spiky sat down still looking wary if youre coming to the fair come at four he said its halfday closing today for the towns around and the place will be packed if you want to do any snooping you wont be noticed in that crowd right said julian well be there look out for us spiky in case youve got any news spiky then left and the boys couldnt help smiling at his back view the spikes of hair at the top of his head were so very noticeable youd better stay to lunch with us jo said dick and the delighted girl beamed all over her face will joans cousin mind you not being back to dinner asked julian no i said i wouldnt be back all day said jo its still school holidays you see anyway i cant stand that jane she moons about all the time and shes got some of my clothes on too jo sounded so indignant about berta that the boys had to laugh they all went back to kirrin cottage and found joan and anne hard at work in the house well you monkey said joan to jo up to tricks as usual i hear throwing stones at peoples windows in the middle of the night you just try that on my window and see what happens to you now put on that apron and help round a bit hows miss jane joan was most excited to hear about the boys latest ideas as to where george might be julian gave her a warning but no ringing up the police behind our backs this time joan he said this is something best done by dick and me cant i come with sally asked anne we cant possibly take sally said dick in case gringos about and recognises her so youd better stay and look after her and well take timmy he would be sure to smell where george is if shes hidden anywhere in the camp but i think shes probably in gringos own caravan timmy pricked up his ears every time he heard georges name mentioned he was a very miserable dog indeed and kept running to the front gate hoping to see george coming along whenever they missed him they knew where to find him lying mournfully on georges empty bed probably with an equally mournful sally beside him the boys and jo set off to the fair about half past three on their bicycles jo rode annes this time and timmy ran valiantly beside them jo glanced at dicks bicycle from time to time proud of its brilliant look how well she had cleaned it that morning they came to the fair you can put your bikes up against spikys caravan said jo theyll be safe there will you pay and then well get in straightaway you neednt pay for me im going through the gap in the hedge im spikys friend so its all right she gave dick her bicycle and disappeared julian paid and went in at the gate they saw jo waving wildly to them from the side of the big field and wheeled the three bicycles over to her timmy following closely at their heels hallo said spiky appearing suddenly see you soon ive got to go and tend to the roundabout ive got a bit of news but not much thats gringos caravan over there the doubleone big van in front little van behind he nodded his head to where a most magnificent caravan stood right away from the rest of the camp there were people milling about all round the other vans but there was nobody at all by gringos evidently no one dared to go too near i vote we buy a ball at one of the stands and then go and play near gringos caravan said dick in a low voice then one of us will throw the ball too hard and it will go near the van and well somehow manage to get a peep inside timmy can go sniffing round while we play if george is there hell bark the place down jolly good idea said julian come on jo and keep your eyes open all the time in case youve got to warn us of danger chapter eighteen spiky is very helpful the two boys and jo with timmy at their heels wandered round the fair to find somewhere to buy a ball there seemed to be none for sale so they had a go at a hoopla stall and julian managed to get a ring round a small red ball just the thing it was a big and noisy fair and hundreds of people from the nearby towns had come on this shops closing day to enjoy the fun the roundabout played its loud raucous music all the time swings went to and fro the dodgem cars banged and bumped one another as usual and men went round shouting their wares balloons giant balloons three pence each icecream all flavours tell your fortune lady ill tell it true as can be jo was very much at home in the fair she had been brought up in one and knew all the tricks of the trade timmy was rather amazed at the noise and kept close to the boys his tail still down because he could not forget that george was missing now lets play our little game of ball said julian come on tim and if we get into any trouble just growl and show your teeth see the three of them with timmy went to the clear space of field that separated the magnificent caravan from the rest of the camp a man at a nearby stall called to them hey youll get into trouble if you play there but they took no notice and he shrugged his shoulders and began to shout his wares they threw the ball to one another and then julian flung it so wildly that it ran right up to the wheels of the front caravan of the pair in a trice dick and jo were after it jo leapt up on a wheel and looked in at the big window while dick ran to the small van that was attached behind the big one a quick glance assured jo that the big caravan was empty the interior was furnished in a most luxurious way and looked like a very fine bedsittingroom she leapt down dick peered into the window of the smaller van at first he thought there was no one there and then he saw a pair of very fierce angry eyes looking at him the eyes of a small bent old woman with untidy hair she looked rather like a witch dick thought she was sitting sewing in a bunk and as he looked in she shook her fist at him and called out something he couldnt hear he jumped down and joined the others no one at all in the big van said jo only a witchlike old woman in the other reported dick in deep disappointment unless george is pushed under a bunk or squashed into a cupboard shes certainly not there timmy doesnt seem interested in the caravans at all does he said julian im sure if george really was in one of those caravans hed bark and try to get inside yes i think he would said dick hallo theres somebody coming out of the second van its the old lady shes in a fine old temper so she was she came down the steps to the van shouting and shaking her fist at them tim go and find go and find in that van said julian suddenly as the old woman came towards them the three of them stood their ground as the old woman came right up they couldnt understand a word she said partly because she had no teeth and partly because she spoke a mixture of many languages anyway it was quite obvious that she was ticking them off for daring to play near the two vans timmy had understood what julian had said and had slipped inside the second van he was there for half a minute and then he barked the boys jumped and dick made a move towards the van then timmy appeared dragging something behind him with his teeth he tried to bark at the same time but he couldnt he dragged the coatlike thing right down to the ground before the old woman was on him screaming in a high voice and hitting him she pulled the garment away and went up the steps kicking out at the surprised timmy as he tried to pull it away the door slammed if that old woman hadnt been old timmy would have soon shown her he was top dog said dick whatever was he pulling out of the van come over here out of sight of the van said julian urgently didnt you recognise it dick it was georges dressinggown my word said dick stopping in surprise yes youre right it was whew what does that mean exactly george certainly isnt in those vans or timmy would have found her i sent him in to see if he could smell that george had been hidden there said julian i thought he would bark excitedly if he smelt her scent anywhere on the bunk perhaps i never guessed hed find her dressinggown and drag it out to show us good old timmy clever old timmy said dick patting the dog whose tail was now at halfmast instead of right down he had at least found georges dressinggown but how surprising to find it in that caravan why on earth didnt they take the dressinggown with them when they took george off wondered julian theres no doubt that she has been in that caravan she was taken straight there the night before last i expect where is she now she must have been dressed differently said dick they must have had to dress her properly when they took her somewhere else after all she was only in pyjamas and dressinggown jo was listening to all this puzzled and worried she nudged dick spikys beckoning to us she said they went over to the roundabout boy whose father was now in charge of the noisy machine spiky took them into his caravan a small and rather dirty one in which he lived with his father i saw gringos old ma chasing you he said with his lopsided grin what was your dog dragging out of the van they told him he nodded ive been asking round a bit cautiouslike he said just to see if anyone had heard anything from gringos caravan and the fellow whose caravan is nearest told me he heard shouts and yells two nights ago he reckoned it was someone in gringos van but hes too scared of gringo to go and interfere of course that would be george yelling said dick well then gringos vans were moved the next day right away from the other vans said spiky and this afternoon before the fair opened gringo got his car and towed the little van the second one out of the field and set off with it we all wondered why but he told somebody it needed repairing whew and george was inside said dick what a cunning way of moving her off to another hidingplace when did the van come back asked julian just before you came said spiky i dont know where it went it was gone an hour i should think an hour said dick well suppose it goes at an average of miles an hour you cant go very fast if you are towing something that would mean he had gone somewhere about miles or so away and come back the same distance making about an hours drive allowing for a stop when they arrived at the place they had to leave her at yes said julian but there are lots of places within the radius of miles wheres gringos car said dick suddenly over there under that big tarpaulin said spiky its a silvergrey one american and very striking he thinks the world of it gringo does im going to have a peep at it said julian and strode off he came to the tarpaulin which covered the car right to the ground he lifted it and was just about to look under it when a man ran up shouting here you leave that alone youll be turned out of the fair if you mess about with things that dont concern you but timmy was with julian and he turned and growled so fiercely that the man stopped in a hurry julian had plenty of time to take a good look under the tarpaulin yes the car was silvergrey a big american one and the wings were bright blue julian took a quick look at the two lefthand ones and saw a deep scratch on one of them before he dropped the tarpaulin he had time to glance at the tyres he was sure they had the same pattern as those shown in the wheeltracks he had sketched he had checked the sketch with jim at kirrin garage who had told him they were an american design yes this was the car that had hidden in the clearing the night before last the car that had turned with difficulty and made those deep ruts the car that had taken george away and this afternoon had towed away the caravan with her inside to hide her somewhere else he dropped the tarpaulin and walked back to the others excited taking no notice of the rude things that the nearby man called out to him its the car all right said julian now where did it go this afternoon if only we could find out its such a very striking car that anyone would notice it especially as it was towing a rather nice little caravan said dick yes but we cant go round the countryside asking everyone we meet if theyve noticed a silvergrey car with blue wings said julian lets go back home and get a map and see the lie of the country round about said dick spiky which way did the car turn when it went out of the fieldgate towards the east said spiky on the road to big twillingham well thats something to know said dick come on lets get our bikes thanks most awfully spiky youve been a terrific help well let you know what happens call on me if ever you want more help said spiky proudly and gave them a smart little salute bobbing his head so that his spikes of hair shook comically the three of them rode off with timmy running beside them again as soon as they got home they told anne and joan all they had found out joan was for ringing up the police at once again but julian stopped her i think perhaps we can do this next bit of work better than they can he said were going to try and find out where the car went joan now where are the maps of the district they found them and began to pore over them jo was quite lost when it came to mapreading she could find her way anywhere day or night but not with a map now heres the road to big twillingham and little twillingham he said lets list carefully all the roads the car could take from there my word its a job chapter nineteen an exciting plan after fifteen minutes they had six towns on their list all of which could have been reached in about halfanhour from big twillingham which was two miles away from the fair and now what do you propose to do ju asked dick bike over to all the towns and ask if anyone has seen the car no we cant possibly do that said julian im going down to the garage to see our friend jim and get his help im going to ask him to ring up any friends he has in the garages in those towns and ask if theyve seen the car passing through wont he think its a bit funny asked anne yes but he wont mind how funny it is if we pay the telephonecalls and give him fifty pence for his trouble said julian folding up the map and whats more he wont ask any questions either hell probably think its some silly bet weve got on with one another jim was quite willing to ring up the garages for them he knew boys working in main garages in four of the towns and he knew the hallporter of a hotel in the fifth town but he knew no one in the sixth that dont matter he said well ring up the garage in the high street there and just ask whoever comes to the phone jim rang up the garage in hillingford and had a rather cheeky conversation with his friend there he put the receiver down no go he said he says no car like that came through hillingford or hed have noticed it that time of day ill ring up jake at greens garage in lowington now thats no go either he said after a minutes telephone conversation ill try my hallporter now hes a cousin of mine the hallporter had some news yes jim kept saying yes thats the one yes yes you heard him say that did you thanks most awfully what is it asked dick eagerly when jim at last put down the receiver pat thats the hall porter says he was off duty this afternoon and went to buy some cigarettes at a little shop in the main street of graysfield where his hotel is and as he stood talking to the fellow in the shop an enormous car drew up at the kerb silvergrey with blue wings an american car lefthand drive and all yes what next said julian eagerly well the driver got out to get some cigarettes at the shop he had dark glasses on and a big gold ring on his finger pat noticed that that must be the man who asked about us at the teashop in kirrin said julian remembering go on jim this is wonderful well pats interested in big cars so he went out and had a good look at it said jim he said the car had its blinds drawn down at the back so he couldnt see inside the fellow with the dark glasses came out and got into the drivers seat again he called out to whoever was behind and said which way now yes yes did he hear the answer said julian somebody called back and said not far now into twining turn to the left and its the house on the hill well of all the luck said dick would that be where g he stopped at a sharp nudge from julian and remembered that he mustnt give too much away to the helpful jim julian passed over fifty pence to the pleased garage boy who pocketed it at once grinning now you just come along to me if you want to know about any more cars he said ill phone all over the place for you thanks a lot they sped back to kirrin cottage too excited even to talk they flung their bicycles against the wall and ran in to tell anne and joan timmy and sally sensed their excitement and danced round barking loudly we know where george is cried dick we know we know joan and anne listened eagerly well master julian said joan in admiration it was really smart of you to make jim phone up like that the police couldnt have done better what are you going to do now ring up that sergeant no said julian im so afraid that if the police get moving on this now theyll alarm gringo and hell spirit george away somewhere else dick and i will go to this place tonight and see if we cant get hold of george and bring her back after all its only an ordinary house i imagine and as gringo doesnt suspect that anyone knows where george is he wont be on the look out good said dick good good good im coming too said jo you are not said julian at once thats flat you are not coming jo but i shall take timmy of course jo said no more but looked so sulky that anne laughed cheer up jo you can keep me and sally company oh julian wouldnt it be wonderful to find george and rescue her there was more mapreading as the boys decided which was the best way to bicycle over to graysfield look out the best torches weve got anne will you said dick and let me see how can we bring george back once weve got her on my bikestep i think though i know its not allowed but this is very urgent we cant very well take a third bike with us gosh isnt this exciting we really ought to ring up the police said joan who kept saying this at intervals joan you sound like a parrot said julian if were not back by morning you can ring up all the police in the country if you want to theres been another phonecall from your aunt today master julian i nearly forgot to tell you said joan your uncle is better and they are coming home as soon as possible not this evening i hope said julian in alarm did they tell you anything about mr elbur wright bertas father oh hes hanging on to his secrets quite happily now that he knows it isnt berta who is kidnapped said joan i dont know if the kidnappers even know theyve got the wrong girl yet its all very hushhush even your uncle and aunt are having to obey the police your poor aunt is so terribly upset about george yes she must be frightfully worried said julian soberly weve had so much excitement today that ive almost forgotten to worry and anyway when youre able to do something things dont seem so bad you be careful you dont go and do too much and land yourself in trouble said joan darkly ill be careful said julian winking at dick i say isnt it nearly suppertime i feel awfully hungry well we havent had any tea said dick how extraordinary to have forgotten about tea no wonder were hungry would you like bacon and eggs for a treat said joan and there was a chorus of approval at once timmy and sally wagged their tails as if joans question applied to them too well set off as soon as its dark said julian jo youd better go home after supper theyll be worrying about you all right said jo pleased to have been asked to supper but still sulky at being forbidden to go with julian and dick that night jo disappeared after supper with many messages to berta from dick julian anne and sally and i bet she doesnt give a single one of them said dick now lets have a game before we set off julian just to take our minds off the excitement im getting all workedup joan went up to bed at ten because she was tired anne stayed up to see the boys off you will be careful she kept saying you will be careful wont you oh dear i think its almost worse to stay behind and wonder whats happening to you than to go with you and find out at last the time came for the boys to go it was a quarter to twelve and except for a small moon was a dark night with great clouds looming up often hiding the moon come on timmy said dick were going to find george woof said timmy delighted sally wuffed too and was most disappointed at being left behind the boys wheeled their bicycles to the front gate so long anne said dick go to bed and hope to see george when you wake up they set off on their bicycles with timmy loping along beside them they soon arrived at the field where the fair was and went swinging away to the east following the road the silvergrey car had gone that afternoon they knew the way by heart for they had studied the map so well as they passed the signposts they felt their excitement beginning to mount graysfield next said dick at last soon be there timmy youre not getting tired are you they came into graysfield silently the town was asleep and not a single light showed in any window a policeman suddenly loomed up out of the shadows but when he saw two boys cycling he did not stop them now into twining village turn to the left and look for the house on the hill said dick they rode through the tiny silent village of twining and took the lane to the left it led up a steep narrow lane the boys had to get off and walk because the hill was too much for them theres the house said julian suddenly whispering look through those trees my word it looks a dark and lonely one they came to some enormous iron gates but when they tried to open them they found them locked a great wall ran completely round the grounds they followed it a little way leaving their bicycles against a tree by the gate but it was soon certain that nobody could climb a wall like that blow said julian blow what about the gates whispered dick then he glanced round him nervously hearing a twig crack did you hear that theres nobody following us is there no dont get the jitters for goodness sake said julian what was it you were saying i said what about the gates said dick i dont see why we cant climb over them do you nobody would do that in the daytime theyd be seen but i cant see why we cant do it now they didnt look too dificult just ordinary wroughtiron ones yes of course said julian thats a brainwave come on chapter twenty a thrilling time the two boys went back to the gates dick turned round and looked behind him two or three times i do hope nobody is shadowing us he said i keep on feeling somebodys watching us all the time oh stuff said julian impatiently look here are the gates give me a legup and ill be over in a jiffy dick gave him a shove and julian climbed over the gates without much difficulty they were bolted not locked he slid the great bolts carefully and opened one gate a little for dick and timmy timmy cant be left behind he said and he certainly couldnt climb this gate they kept to the shadowed side of the drive as they walked up towards the house the small moon came out from behind a cloud as they came near it was an old house with high chimneys an ugly house with narrow windows that seemed like watching eyes dick glanced behind him suddenly and julian saw him got the jitters again he said impatiently dick dont be an ass you know perfectly well that if anyone was shadowing us timmy would hear them and go for them at once yes i know said dick im an idiot but ive just got that feeling tonight the feeling that someone else is there they came right up to the house how shall we get in whispered julian the doors are all sure to be locked well have to try the windows they tiptoed silently round the big house as julian had said the doors were all locked the windows were all fastened too well and truly fastened not one was open or could be opened if this is a house belonging to gringo he must be able to hide plenty of things in absolute safety bolted gates high walls locked doors fastened windows said dick no burglar could possibly get in and neither can we said julian desperately weve been all round the house three times now theres no door no window we can get in no balcony to climb up to no ivy to hang on to nothing lets go round once more said dick we might have missed something so once more they went round and discovered something curious when they got to the kitchen quarters the moon came out and showed them a round black hole in the ground whatever could it be they tiptoed to it just as the moon went in again they shone their torches on it briefly its a coalhole said dick astonished why didnt we see it before look theres the lid just beside it its been left open i suppose the moon was in last time we came by this part of the house i cant think how we didnt notice it julian was uneasy i didnt see it before certainly its queer could it be a trap do you think i dont see how it could be said dick come on lets get down at least its a way in he shone his torch into the hole yes look theres a whole lot of coke down there we can easily jump on to it tim you go first and spy out the land timmy jumped down at once the coke slithering away from beneath his four paws hes down all right said julian ill go next down he jumped and the coke slithered away again making what seemed to be a very loud noise in the silent night julian shone his torch around they were standing on a very large heap of coke in the middle of a big cellar at the end was a door hope its not locked said dick in a whisper now tim keep to heel for goodness sake and dont make a sound they went to the door treading on gritty bits of coke julian turned the dirty handle and the door opened inwards its not locked said julian thankfully they crept through it timmy treading on their heels and found themselves in another cellar set with stone shelves on which were piled tins and boxes and crates enough food here to stand a siege whispered dick where are the cellarsteps weve got to get out over there said julian then he stopped and put out his torch he had heard something did you hear that he whispered it sounded like somebody treading on the coke in the coalcellar gosh i hope nobody is shadowing us well soon be prisoners if so they listened but heard nothing further up the stone steps they went and undid the door at the top a big kitchen lay beyond lighted by the dim moon a shadow rose suddenly in front of them and timmy growled dicks heart almost stopped beating what in the world was that crawling silently over the floor and disappearing in the shadows he clutched at julian and made him jump dont do that ass that was only the kitchen cat you saw whispered julian gosh you made me jump wasnt it a good thing that timmy didnt go for the cat there would have been an awful yowling where do you suppose george will be asked dick somewhere at the top of the house ive no idea well just have to look into every room said julian so they looked into every room on the ground floor but they were empty they were huge rooms ugly and overfurnished come on up the stairs said dick and up they went they came to an enormous landing hung with tapestry curtains at the windows timmy suddenly gave a small growl and in a trice both boys had hidden themselves in the folds of the long windowcurtains timmy went with them feeling surprised dick peeped out after a minute i think it was that cat again he whispered look there it is up on that chest its following us wondering what on earth were doing i expect blow it said julian im getting the jitters now being watched by a shadowy cat i suppose it is real timmy thinks so said dick come on there are any amount of bedroom doors on this landing they tiptoed into the ones whose doors were open but no one was sleeping in the beds there they came to a closed door and listened someone was snoring inside thats not george said dick anyway shed be locked in and the key is in this door they went to the next door which was also shut they listened and could hear someone breathing heavily not george said dick and they went on up to the next flight of stairs there were four more rooms there two of them not even furnished the doors of the other two were ajar and it was clear that people were sleeping in them because once more there was loud breathing to be heard there dont seem to be any more rooms said dick in dismay as they flashed their torches carefully round the top landing blow wheres george then look theres a little wooden door there said julian in dicks ear a door leading into the cistern room i should think she wouldnt be there said dick but wait look theres a strong bolt on the door and cistern rooms dont have bolts on their doors or even locks this one hasnt a lock but it has a bolt sh not so loud said julian yes thats funny i must say how can we get the door open without waking the people in those other two rooms well shut their doors very quietly and well lock them said dick excited ill go and do it he drew the doors gently to and then locked first one and then the other having taken the keys from the other side of the doors to do so except that one made a slight click as he locked it there was no noise nobody stirred in the two rooms and the boys breathed freely again they went to the little wooden door opposite they pulled gently at the bolt afraid that it might squeak but it didnt it was obviously quite new and ran easily the door opened outwards with a small creak there was pitch darkness inside and the sound of trickling water from the cistern dick flashed his torch on and off quickly in that second he saw something that made his heart jump there was a small mattress on the floor of the little cistern room and someone was lying on it rolled so completely in blankets that even the head was covered julian had seen it too and he put his arm on dicks afraid that it might not be george afraid that it might be someone who would give the alarm perhaps another prisoner but timmy knew who it was timmy ran straight in with a small loving whimper and flung himself on the sleeping figure dick shut the cistern room door at once afraid of the noise being heard timmy might bark with joy in a moment or george might shout the figure gave a grunt and sat up the blanket fell away from the head and there was georges curly nob and her startled face sh said dick raising his finger warningly sh timmy was licking george from head to foot wild with delight but extraordinarily silent clever old timmy knew that this was one of the times when joy must be dumb oh said george hugging timmy anywhere she could oh timmy i missed you so darling darling tim oh timmy dick stood by the closed door listening to find out if anyone was stirring in the other rooms he heard nothing at all julian went to george are you all right george he asked have you been treated well not very said george but then i didnt behave very well i did quite a lot of kicking and biting so they locked me in here poor old george said julian well well hear everything when weve got out of here so far weve been jolly lucky can you come now yes said george and got off the mattress she was dressed in an odd selection of clothes and looked rather peculiar that awful old woman gringos mother found these for me when i was taken to the caravan she said gosh ive got a lot to tell you sh said dick at the door not a sound now im going to open the door he opened it slowly all was quiet now well go down the stairs he said not a sound they went down the first flight of stairs and on to the enormous landing then just as dick put his foot on to the next stair down he trod on something soft that yowled spat and scratched it was that cat dick fell halfway down the stairs and timmy could not stop himself from chasing the cat up the landing and up the top stairs to the cistern room nor could he stop himself from barking shouts came from two of the nearby bedrooms and two men appeared in pyjamas one switched on the landing light and then both of them tore down the stairs after the three children dick picked himself up but he had ricked his ankle and could not even walk run george ill see to dick yelled julian rut george stopped too and in a trice the two men were on to them catching hold of dick and julian and jerking them into a nearby room tim tim shouted george help timmy but before timmy could come pelting down the stairs from the attic george was shoved into the room too and the door locked look out for the dog shouted one of the men hes dangerous timmy certainly was he came tearing towards the men snarling his eyes blazing showing all his teeth the men darted into the room next to the one into which they had locked the children and banged the door timmy flung himself against it in rage snarling and growling in a most terrifying manner if only he could get at those men if only he could chapter twentyone most unexpected soon there was real pandemonium in the old house the sleepers in the rooms on the top landing awoke suddenly and found their doors locked and began to bang on them and shout the three children in the locked room on the ground floor shouted and banged too and timmy nearly went mad only the men in the room next to the children were silent they were terrified at timmys growling and snarling they would have liked to lock themselves in but the key was on the other side of the door and they certainly didnt dare to open it to get the key soon the children quietened down dick sat on a chair exhausted that cat that wretched prowling sly old cat gosh i stepped on it and it scratched me to the bone to say nothing of pitching me headlong down the stairs and making me wrench my ankle we so nearly managed to escape groaned julian i cant think what will happen now said george timmys out there and cant get in to us and we cant possibly get out to him because the doors locked and those men wont dare to set a foot outside their door while tims there and weve locked the people into their rooms upstairs said julian well its certain that nobody can get out of their rooms to help anyone else so it looks as if well all be here till doomsday it certainly did seem a very poor lookout the only people who were not behind locked doors were the two men whoever they were and they simply dared not put a foot outside their room timmy roamed about occasionally whimpering and scratching outside the childrens door but more often growling outside the next door sometimes flinging his heavy body against it as if he would break it down i bet the men are shaking with fright said dick they wont even dare to try and get out of a window in case they meet timmy outside somewhere serve them right said george gosh im glad you came wasnt i an absolute ass to take sally down to the kennel that night you were said julian i agree wholeheartedly the men were waiting for a chance to get berta of course and they saw you complete with bertas dog and thought you were the girl they wanted yes they flung something all over my head so that i couldnt make a sound said george i fought like anything and my dressinggown girdle must have slipped off did you find it yes said dick we were jolly glad to find a few other things too the comb the hanky the sweet and of course the note they carried me quite a way to somewhere in the wood said george then they plonked me down at the back of the car but they had to turn it and it was difficult and i had the bright thought of throwing out all the things in my dressinggown pocket just in case you came along and saw them what about that note with the word gringo on asked julian that was a terrific help we wouldnt be here tonight if it hadnt been for that well i heard one of the men call the other gringo said george and it was such an unusual name i thought id scribble it on a bit of paper and throw that out too it was just on chance i did it a jolly good chance said dick good thing you had a notebook and pencil with you i hadnt said george but one of the men had left his coat in the back of the car and there was a notebook with a pencil in the breastpocket i just used that jolly good said julian well they whizzed me off in the car to some fairground or other said george i heard the roundabout music next day there was a horrid old witchlike woman in the caravan she didnt seem at all pleased to see me i had to sleep in a chair that night and i got so wild that i yelled and shouted and threw things about and smashed quite a lot of cups and saucers i enjoyed that the boys couldnt help laughing yes i bet you did said dick they had to move the caravan away from the fair itself because they were afraid people would hear you in fact i expect thats why gringo decided to hide you here yes i suddenly felt a jolt and found the caravan we were in was being towed away said george i was awfully surprised i waved at the windows and shouted as we drove through the streets but nobody seemed to notice anything wrong in fact some people waved back to me then we swung in through some gates and came here and as i told you they put me up here because i made such a nuisance of myself did you tell them you werent berta asked dick no said george of course not for two reasons i knew there would be no fear of bertas father giving those secrets away because hed be told by you that i had been kidnapped not his precious berta so hed hang on to them and also i thought berta would be safe so long as i didnt tell the men theyd got the wrong person youre a good kid george said julian and slapped her gently on the back a very good kid im jolly proud of you theres nobody like our george dont be a fathead said george but she was very pleased all the same well theres no more to tell she said except that the cistern room was most frightfully draughty and i had to wrap my head up as well as my body when i lay down and the cistern made awful noises sort of rude noises that made me want to say i beg your pardon all the time of course i knew youd rescue me so i wasnt awfully worried and we havent rescued you said julian all weve done is to get ourselves locked up as well as you tell me how you found out i was here said george so the boys told her everything and she listened thrilled so berta went to stay with jo she said i bet jo didnt like that she didnt said julian but shes been quite a help i only wish she was here now and could do one of her ivyclimbing stunts or something i say timmys very quiet all of a sudden said george listening whats happened they listened timmy was not barking or whimpering there was no sound of him at all what was happening georges heart sank perhaps those men had managed to do something to him but suddenly they heard him again whimpering but whimpering gladly and excitedly and then a familiar voice came to their ears dick julian where are you gosh its jo said dick astounded he limped to the door were in here jo unlock the door jo unlocked it and looked in grinning timmy tore in like a whirlwind and flung himself on george almost knocking her over dick limped out of the room immediately jo rushed in much to everyones astonishment then he returned looking rather pleased with himself lets go while the goings good he said yes but be careful those men will be out now that timmy isnt there to guard them cried julian suddenly realising that the two angry fellows could easily escape while timmy was in with them and might lock the door on the lot of them timmy too its all right theres no desperate hurry said dick i thought of that i slipped out and locked their door on them as soon as jo rushed in to us and there they can stay till the police arrive in the morning they can then collect the whole lot the men upstairs too and im sure the police will be quite pleased to search the house and the cellars said julian there will be plenty of stuff here that they will be interested in well lets go at once they called a cheery goodbye to the two men were off shouted dick youd better look out for the dog in case he gets you they all went down the hall dick hobbling for his ankle was still painful we might as well leave in style said julian and unbolted and unlocked the front door also it would be as well to leave this door open for the police to come in by i dont expect they will want to come in through the coalhole it was a good idea of yours to let the men think we were leaving tim behind to guard them dick they wont dare even to climb out of the windows in case hes waiting for them weve left a good many lights on said george looking back never mind were not paying the bill come on timmy out into the dark dark night they went down the front steps and into the dark drive everyone felt safe with timmy running ahead jo exactly how did you get here said dick suddenly you were forbidden to come i know said jo well i just took annes bike and followed you thats all and i walked in through the front gates when youd left them open of course that was easy gosh i kept feeling there was someone behind me said dick and there was it was you you little horror no wonder timmy didnt bother to bark or growl yes it was me said jo and i followed you round and round the house while you were trying to get in and i thought you never would see that coalhole so i took the lid off and put it on the ground hoping youd see it then and you did so you did that said dick i must say i was astonished to see it i knew we must have passed it before so that was you too you want spanking you disobedient cheeky little wretch jo laughed i couldnt bear you to go off without me she said its a good thing i did come i waited and waited inside that coalhole for you to come back with george and when you didnt i left the coalhole and got into the house and timmy heard me and came running down the stairs he nearly knocked me over he was that pleased here are the gates at last said george what are we going to do about bikes there isnt one for me jo can stand behind on my step and hold on to my shoulder said julian you take annes bike george well leave these gates open the police ought to be pleased with us for saving them so much trouble off they went down the steep hill timmy running behind his tail wagging happily he had got george back again all was well again in his doggy world chapter twentytwo these kids sure are wunnerful what shrieks and shouts there were from joan and anne when the four arrived at kirrin cottage at last at half past three in the morning joan was awake but anne had just gone to sleep she was sleeping in joans room for company and sally was there too the stories had to be told again and again first dick then julian then george then jo they all talked without stopping excited and happy sally ran from one to the other and followed timmy about but sometimes her little stiff tail drooped when she remembered that berta was not there i say said dick suddenly drawing back the sittingroom curtains its daylight the suns up and all the time ive been thinking it was still night no use going to bed then said jo at once she was so much enjoying this that she felt as if she never wanted it to stop well i suppose it isnt said joan i know what well do well have a big breakfast now a very big one to celebrate and then well all go back to bed and sleep till lunchtime were tired out really just look at our blackrimmed eyes and pale cheeks joan were all as sunburnt as can be youre just making that up said george come on lets get this celebration breakfast going bacon eggs tomatoes fried bread oh and mushrooms too have you any mushrooms joan and lots and lots of hot coffee and toast and marmalade im ravenous they discovered that they all were and twenty minutes later they sat at the table tucking in as if they had eaten nothing for a month i cant eat a thing more said dick and i dont know whats happening to my eyes they keep closing so do mine said george with an enormous yawn joan dont say weve got to do the washingup will you of course not said joan go on up to your beds now dont even bother to undress i feel as if theres something i ought to do but i cant remember it said julian sleepily staggering upstairs i just cant remember he flopped on his bed and was asleep as soon as his head fell on the pillow in two minutes everyone but joan was asleep too joan stopped to give timmy a drink and then he bounded up to george and curled up in the crook of her knees as usual joan went to lie down too thinking she would just have a rest but not go to sleep but in half a second she slept too the sun rose higher in the sky the milkman came whistling up the path and left four bottles of milk on the step the gulls in the bay circled and soared and called loudly but nobody stirred in kirrin cottage a car came up to the front gate and another one followed out of the first stepped uncle quentin aunt fanny mr elbur wright and berta out of the second car stepped the sergeant and his constable berta flew to the front door but it was shut she raced round to the garden door that was locked too and so was the kitchen door pops well have to ring all the doors are locked she called and then from up above came a sound of excited barking and sallys head appeared at a bedroom window when she saw it really was berta down below she tore down the stairs and scraped at the front door whats happened where is everyone said aunt fanny in amazement all the doors locked but its ten oclock in the morning where are the children ive got my key said uncle quentin and he put it into the front door lock he opened the door and sally leapt straight into bertas arms licking her face from forehead to chin aunt fanny went into the hall and called anyone at home no answer timmy heard her call but as george did not stir he didnt either he was not going to leave george for a minute not even to go downstairs aunt fanny walked into all the rooms on the ground floor nobody there she marvelled at the remains of the meal spread all over the diningroom table and even more at the dirty pans and dishes in the kitchen what was joan thinking of where was everybody she did not expect george to be there because she knew george had been kidnapped but where in the world were all the others she went upstairs and her husband followed with berta and her father they were all feeling most astonished now they went into julians room good gracious he was there then and dick too lying choppily on their beds absolutely sound asleep aunt fanny couldnt understand it and then she went into the girls room and there was anne fast asleep too and good gracious could that be george but surely george was kidnapped then how why where her mother suddenly put her arms round the sleeping george and kissed her and hugged her she had worried so much about her and now here she was safe and sound after all george awoke at once she sat up and gazed at her mother and father in astonishment oh youre back oh how lovely when did you come just now said her mother but george why is everyone asleep and how did you get here we thought you were oh mother yes of course you dont know half the story do you said george gosh theres berta here too and your pops berta hallo everyone she was still so sleepy that she was not quite sure whether this was a dream or not but then anne woke up and squealed and that woke julian and dick they came into the very crowded bedroom and soon there was such a noise that joan and jo in the room above awoke too down they came looking very dishevelled joan full of apologies she rushed downstairs to put some coffee on and bumped into the two policemen in the hall she screamed excuse me miss said the sergeant to joan isnt anyone ever coming down again were supposed to be guarding miss berta oh my you dont need to do that now said joan didnt master julian telephone you last night this morning i mean i thought he was going to what about said the sergeant about the kidnappers everythings all right explained joan to the two astonished policemen weve got miss george back and oh bless us all theres those kidnappers you havent been told theyre all locked up and waiting for you have you look here miss what are you talking about said the sergeant bewildered this is too bad what do you mean kidnappers locked up and waiting master julian called joan the police are here and you forgot to telephone and tell them what happened last night theyd better go to that house and get the men hadnt they i knew there was something id forgotten said julian running down the stairs i did mean to telephone but i was so tired that i forgot everyone then came downstairs and went into the sittingroom jo was shy with so many people there and wouldnt sit anywhere near the two policemen ive just been told mr wright sir that theres no need to guard your daughter now said the sergeant rather stiffly seems as if the police are the last to hear about anything well the fact of the matter is that we found out that gringo who owns the fair called gringos fair was paid to kidnap berta said julian he kidnapped george instead by mistake we found out where gringo had taken her and went to rescue her last night you go on dick and we left gringo and somebody else locked up in a room on the ground floor and two other people locked up in a topfloor room and weve left the front door open for you and the drive gates open too said dick so dont be too annoyed about it sergeant because we really have tried to make things easy for you weve rescued george as you see and now you can get the men the sergeant looked as if he found it difficult to believe a single word uncle quentin tapped him sharply on the shoulder well look alive man theyll escape before you can get them if you dont hurry whats the address said the sergeant stolidly i dont know the name of the house or the lane its in said julian but you go through the village of twining turn to the left and its the house up on the hill how did you find out all this said the sergeant its too long to tell you now said dick well write it all down in a book and send you a copy well call it er well call it what shall we call it you others its a peculiar adventure really it ended with everyone fast asleep in bed i want some coffee announced uncle quentin i think weve talked enough do go and catch your kidnappers my good men the policemen disappeared mr elbur wright beamed round happily berta on his knee well this is a very happy ending he said and i can take my little berta back with me after all oh no wailed berta much to her fathers surprise what do you mean he asked gee pops be a honey and let me stay on here begged berta these kids sure are wunnerful wonderful wonderful wonderful chanted the others of course let her stay on if shed like to said aunt fanny but as a girl this time not a boy george heaved a sigh of relief that was all right then she wouldnt mind berta as a girl even though she was a silly girl woof said timmy suddenly and made everyone jump he says hes jolly pleased youre staying berta because now sallydog will have to stay too said dick so hell have someone to play with as well shall we really send the sergeant a book about this adventure said anne did you really mean it dick rather said dick our fourteenth adventure and may we have many more what shall we call the book i know said george at once i know lets call it five have plenty of fun well they did and they hope you like it
