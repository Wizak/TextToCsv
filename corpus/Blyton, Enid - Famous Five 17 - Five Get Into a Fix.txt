 chapter one a miserable christmas i do think these christmas holidays have been the worst weve ever had said dick jolly bad luck on old george coming to stay with us for christmas and then us all going down with those awful colds and coughs said julian yes and being in bed on christmas day was horrible said george the worst of it was i coulclnt eat anything fancy not being hungry on christmas day i never thought that would happen to me timmy was the only one of us who didnt get ill said anne patting him you were a pet tim when we were in bed you divided your time between us nicely woof said timmy rather solemnly he hadnt been at all happy this christmas to have four of the five in bed coughing and sneezing was quite unheard of well anyhow were all up again said dick though my legs dont really feel as if they belong to me yet oh do yours feel like that too asked george i was quite worried about mine we all feel the same said julian but we shall be quite diferent in a day or two now were up anyway we go back to school next week so wed better feel all right everyone groaned and then coughed thats the worst of this germ weve had whatever it is said george if we laugh or speak loudly or groan we start coughing i shall go completely mad if i dont get rid of my cough it keeps me awake for hours at night anne went to the window its been snowing again she said not much but it looks lovely to think we might have been out in it all last week i do think its too bad to have holidays like this george joined her at the window a car drew up outside and a burly merrylooking man got out and hurried up the steps to the front door heres the doctor said anne i bet hell say were all quite all right to go back to school next week in a minute or two the door opened and the doctor came into the room with the mother of julian dick and anne she looked tired and no wonder looking after four ill children and a most miserable dog over christmas had not been an easy job well here they are all up and about now said mrs barnard they look pretty down in the mouth dont they oh theyll soon perk up said dr drew sitting down and looking at each of the four in turn george looks the worst not so strong as the others i suppose george went red with annoyance and dick chuckled poor george is the weakling of the family he said she had the highest temperature the worst cough and the loudest groans and she but whatever else he was going to say was lost beneath the biggest cushion in the room which an angry george had flung at him with all her might dick flung it back and everyone began to laugh george too that set all the four coughing of course and the doctor put his hands to his ears will they be well enough to go to school doctor asked mrs barnard anxiously well yes they would but they ought to get rid of those coughs first said the doctor he looked out of the window at the snow i wonder now no i dont suppose its possible but but what said dick pricking up his ears at once going to send us to switzerland for a skiing holiday doc fine absolutely smashing the doctor laughed youre going too fast he said no i wasnt actually thinking of switzerland but perhaps somewhere hilly not far from the sea somewhere really bracing but not too cold where the snow will lie so that you can toboggan and ski but without travelling as far as switzerland switzerland is expensive you know yes i suppose it is said julian no we cant expect a holiday in switzerland just because weve had beastly colds but i must say a week somewhere would be jolly nice oh yes said george her eyes shining it would really make up for these miserable holidays do you mean all by ourselves doctor wed love that well no someone ought to be there surely said dr drew but thats up to your parents i think its a jolly good idea said julian mother dont you think so im sure youre longing to be rid of us all for a while you look worn out his mother smiled well if its what you need a short holiday somewhere to get rid of your coughs you must have it and i wont say that i shant enjoy a little rest while youre enjoying yourselves having a good time ill talk it over with your father woof said timmy looking enquiringly at the doctor both ears pricked high he says he needs a rest somewhere too explained george he wants to know if he can come with us lets have a look at your tongue timmy and give me your paw to feel if its hot or not said dr drew gravely he held out his hand and timmy obediently put his paw into it the four children laughed and immediately began to cough again how they coughed the doctor shook his head at them what a din i shouldnt have made you laugh now i shant be coming to see you again until just before you go back to school i expect your mother will let me know when that day comes goodbye till then and have a good time wherever you go we will said julian and thanks for bothering about us so much well send you a card when our coughs are gone as soon as dr drew had driven off in his car there was a conference we can go off somewhere cant we mother said dick eagerly the sooner the better you must be tired to death of our coughs night and day yes i think you must go somewhere for a week or ten days said his mother but the question is where you could go off to georges home i suppose kirrin cottage but its not high up and besides georges father would certainly not welcome four coughs like yours no hed go mad at once said george hed fling open his study door and stride into our room and shout whos mak but as george began to shout she coughed and that was the end of her little piece of acting thats enough george said her aunt for goodness sake go and get a drink of water there was much debating about where they could go for a little while and all the time they were talking the snow fell steadily dick went to the window pleased if only we could find a place high up on a hill just as the doctor said a place where we could use our toboggans and our skis he said gosh it makes me feel better already to think of it i do hope this snow goes on and on i think id better ring up a holiday agency and see if they can offer us something sensible said his mother maybe a summer camp set up on a hill would do it would be empty now and you could have the choice of a hut or a chalet or something but all her telephoning came to nothing no said the agencies sorry we havent anything to suggest our camps are all closed down now no we know of no winter ones in this country at all and then as so often happens the problem was suddenly solved by somebody no one had thought of asking old jenkins the gardener there was nothing for him to do that day except sweep a path through the snow he saw the children watching him from the window grinned and came up to them how are you he shouted would you like some apples theyve ripened nicely now those late ones your mother said you werent feeling like apples or pears either but maybe youre ready for some now yes we are shouted julian not daring to open the window in case his mother came in and was angry to see him standing with his head out in the cold bring them in jenkins come and talk to us so old jenkins came in carrying a basket of ripe yellow apples and some plump brownyellow pears and how are you now he said in his soft welsh voice for he came from the welsh mountains its pale you are and thin too ah its the mountain air of wales you want he smiled all over his wrinkled brown face handing round his basket the children helped themselves to the fruit mountain air thats what the doctor ordered said julian biting into a juicy pear i suppose you dont know somewhere like that we could go to do you jenkins well my aunt now she lets rooms in the summertime said jenkins and a good cook she is my aunt glenys but the wintertime now im not knowing if shed do it then what with the snow and all her farms on the hillside man and the slope runs right down to the sea a fine place it is in the summer but therell be nothing but snow there now sure as im telling you but it sounds exactly right said anne delighted doesnt it ju lets call mother mother mother where are you her mother came running in afraid that one of the children was feeling ill again she was most astonished to see old jenkins there and even more astonished to hear the four children pouring out what he had just told them timmy added a few excited barks and jenkins stood twirling his old hat quite overcome the excitement made julian and dick cough distressingly now listen to me said their mother firmly go straight upstairs and take another dose of your cough medicine ill talk to jenkins and find out what all this is about no dont interrupt dick go they went at once and left their mother talking to the bewildered gardener blow this cough said dick pouring out his usual dose gosh i hope mother fixes up something with jenkins aunt if i dont go off somewhere and lose this cough i shall go mad stark staring mad i bet well go to his old aunt said julian thats if shell take us its the kind of sudden idea that clicks dont you think so julian was right the idea did click his mother had actually met jenkins old aunt that spring when she had come to visit her relations and jenkins had brought her proudly up to the house to introduce her to the cook so when dick and julian went downstairs again they were met with good news im telephoning to jenkins aunt old mrs jones said their mother and if shell take you well off you can go in a day or two coughs and all chapter two off to magga glen everything was soon settled old mrs jones whose voice came remarkably clearly over the longdistance call seemed delighted to take the four children yes mam i understand oh their coughs wont last a day here dont you be fretting mam and hows my nephew ifor jenkins mam its hoping i am that hes still pleasing you a wild boy he was and mother tell her were bringing a dog too said julian in his mothers ear george had been making wild gestures to him pointing first to timmy then to the telephone where her aunt stood patiently listening to old mrs jones gossipy talk oh er mrs jones therell be a dog too said her aunt what youve seven dogs already good gracious oh for the sheep of course seven dogs timmy said george in a low voice to tim who wagged his tail at once what do you think of that seven youll have the time of your life sh said julian seeing his mother glance crossly at george he felt thankful that this unexpected holiday had been so quickly fixed up like the others he was beginning to feel very down and dull it would he wonderful to go away he wondered where their skis were everyone looked brighter when things had been settled no school for some time no lounging about the house wishing something would happen tirnmy would be able to go for long walks at last they would be on their own again too a thing the five loved jenkins was very helpful in looking out toboggans and skis he brought them all into the house to be examined and cleaned something exciting to do at last their exertions made them all cough badly but they didnt mind so much now only two days to wait then were off said dick ought we to take our skates do you think no jenkins says theres no skating round about the farm said george i asked him i say look at that mound of woollen clothes your mothers just brought in ju we might be going to the north pole whew mother if we wear all those well never be able to ski said julian gosh look six scarves even if timmy wears one thats one too many one or two may get wet said his mother it wont matter how many clothes you take youre going by car and we can easily get everything in ill take my fieldglasses too said dick you never know when they might be useful george old thing i do hope timmy will be friends with the farm dogs it would be awful if he quarrelled with them and he does sometimes get fierce with other dogs you know especially if we make a fuss of them hell behave perfectly said george and theres no need to make a fuss of other dogs if weve got timmy all right teacher said dick and george stopped her polishing and threw her duster at him yes certainly things were getting normal again when the time came for the children to set out on their journey they were feeling a good deal better though their coughs were still almost as bad i do hope youll lose those awful coughs julian before you come back said his mother it worries me to hear you all cough cough cough day and night poor old mother you have had a time said julian giving her a hug youve been a brick what a sigh of relief youll give when were all safely away in the car at last the car came driving up the snowy path to the house it was a hired car a very big one and that was fortunate as the childrens luggage was truly colossal the driver was a cheerful little man and he and jenkins soon had the suitcases toboggans skis and all the rest either in the boot of the car or strapped on top there we are mam said the driver at last everything made fast were making a nice early start and we should be safe in magga glen before its dark were all ready to start said julian and the little man nodded and smiled climbing into the drivingseat dick sat beside him and the other three sat at the back with timmy on their feet not that he would stay there long he liked to look out of the window just as much as the children did everyone heaved a sigh of relief as the car slid down the drive they were off at last jenkins was at the gate and waved as they went past remember me to my old aunt now he shouted as he shut the gate the driver was very chatty he soon heard all about their miserable holidays and how much they were looking forward to their unexpected break before going back to school in return he told them all about himself and his family and as he had eleven brothers and sisters his tale lasted for a good part of the journey they stopped for a meal in the car after some time and found that they were hungry for the first time since they had been ill good gracious i can really taste these sandwiches said george in a surprised voice can you anne yes they dont taste of cardboard like all our meals have lately said anne timmy youre not going to fare so well now that were getting our appetites back he was a very good dustbin while we were ill wasnt he said dick he simply gobbled up all the bits and pieces we couldnt eat ugh that boiled fish it tasted like stewed knitting they laughed and that set them off coughing again the driver listened and shook his head nasty coughs youve got he said reminds me of the time when me and my family got whoopingcough twelve of us together my when we all whooped it sounded like a lot of firesirens going off that made the children laugh again and cough but somehow nobody minded the irritating coughs now they would surely soon be gone once they could get out into the country and try their legs at running and racing and skiing once again it was a long drive all the children fell asleep in the car after their meal and the driver smiled to see them lolling back against one another looking very peaceful only timmy was awake and he climbed cautiously up between george and the window wishing the window was open so that he could put his big nose out into the wind as he loved to do they stopped for a very early tea at a teashop in a village better stretch your legs a bit said the driver getting out i know i want to stretch mine look im going into that place over there for my tea theres plenty of my pals there and id enjoy a chat you go and tuck in at this teashop here and ask for their buttered crumpets best in the kingdom they are be back for you in a quarter of an hour not longer or we shant be at the farmhouse before dark its still about an hours run but therell be a moon later on they were all glad to stretch their legs timmy bounded out as if he were on springs barking madly he was disappointed to find that they were only making a short stop he had hoped they were at the end of their journey but he was pleased to be given a buttery crumpet all to himself in the teashop he licked every scrap of butter off first much to the childrens amusement id rather like to do that myself timmy said anne but its not really good manners you know oh dont make my shoe buttery take your crumpet a bit farther away they had time for two crumpets each and a cup of hot tea julian bought some chocolate biscuits as he felt unexpectedly hungry even after two crumpets marvellous to feel even a bit hungry after not being able to look even bread and butter in the face he said i knew we must be jolly ill that day we couldnt eat even icecream though mother tried to tempt us with some my legs are still a bit funny said anne walking back to the car but theyre beginning to feel as if they belong to me thank goodness they set off again they were in wales now and mountains were beginning to loom up in the distance it was a very clear evening and although the mountains were white with snow the countryside they passed was not nearly as snowy as their own home had been when they left i hope to goodness the snow doesnt begin to melt just as weve arrived said dick it seems all right up on the mountains at present but down here in the valleys theres hardly any they passed a signpost and julian looked to see what it said he made out a word that looked like cymryhlli and called to the driver did you see that signpost should we look out for magga glen now yes we must be getting on that way said the driver ive been looking out for it myself i wonder i havent seen it yet goodness i hope we havent lost our way said anne it will soon be dark the car went on and on better look out for a village said julian but they didnt come to one nor did they see any other signposts the night was now coming on but there was already a small moon which gave a little light are you sure were right dick asked the driver the road seems to be getting a bit rough and we havent passed even a farmhouse for ages well maybe we are on the wrong road admitted the driver slowing down though where we took the wrong turning i simply dont know i reckon were near the sea now look theres a turning up to the right shouted george as they went slowly on its got a signpost too they stopped by the signpost which was only a small one it doesnt say magga glen said dick disappointed it says old towers just that would it be the name of a place do you think or a building wheres a map the driver hadnt one i dont usually need a map he said but this here countryside isnt signposted as it should be and i wish id brought my route with me i guess wed better turn right and go up to see this old towers maybe they can put us on our road so they swung up to the right and the car went slowly crawling up a long steep winding road its quite a mountain said anne peering out of the window oh i can see something a building on the side of the hill look with towers this must be it they came to stout wooden gates on them was a large notice with just two words on it in large black letters keep out well thats nice and polite said the driver angrily keep out why should we wait a bit theres a little lodge here ill go and ask our way but the lodge was no more helpful than the big gate it was in complete darkness and when the driver banged on the door there was no answer at all now what could they do chapter three the end of the journey well wed better turn round and go back down the hill said dick as the driver came back to the car no wait ill just hop out and see if there are any lights anywhere said julian and jumped out of the car i could go up the drive a little way and see if i can spot the house itself it cant be very far after all we spotted it just now as we came up the winding road he went to the gates and looked at them in the light from the cars headlamps theyre padlocked he called but i think i can climb over theres certainly a light somewhere beyond though how far i dont know but before he could climb over the gate there came the sound of running footsteps behind it and then a loud and savage howl came on the night air and some animal hurled itself against the other side of the gate the driver got back hurriedly into the car and slammed the door julian also ran to the car finding his legs could go quickly if he wanted them to for all their feebleness timmy began to bark fiercely and tried to leap through the closed carwindow the howling and barking behind the gates went on and on and the dog there which must have been a very big one continually hurled itself against the gates shaking them from top to bottom better turn round and go said the driver scared whew im glad im this side of those gates what a din that dog of yours is almost as bad too timmy was certainly furious why wasnt he allowed to get out and tell the other dog what he thought of him george tried to pacify him but he wouldnt stop barking the driver began to turn the car round cautiously backing a little and then going forward and backing again the road was fairly wide but there was a very steep slope to the right of the car old towers was certainly built on a mountainside the people there must be jolly scared of burglars to have a dog like that said dick yet its such a lonely place you wouldnt think many people would come near it whats up driver theres something wrong said the driver who now had the car facing back down the road again the car seems very heavy to drive all of a sudden as if id got my brakes on perhaps you have said julian well i havent said the driver shortly that is only just a little to make sure the car doesnt shoot off down the hill you can see its pretty steep here and theres almost a cliff your side dont want to drive down there in the dark what can be the matter with the car it will only crawl i thought it came up the hill terribly slowly too said dick i know the road was steep and winding but didnt it seem to you as if the car was making heavy work of it well yes it did admitted the driver but i just thought the hill must be steeper than i imagined what is the matter with the car ive got no brake on at all and im pushing the accelerator down hard and still she crawls as if shed got a ton weight to pull it really was a puzzle julian felt worried he didnt want them to have to spend the night in the car lost in a cold countryside especially as now it was beginning to snow lightly the moon had disappeared behind heavy clouds and everything looked very dark indeed they reached the bottom of the hill at last and came on to the level road again the driver heaved a sigh of relief and then gave a sudden exclamation whats happened the cars all right again shes going like a bird whew thats a load off my mind i thought she was going to pack up and leave us to spend the night here the car sped along well now and everyone was most relieved must have been something wrong with her works somewhere said the driver but im blessed if i know what it was now look out for a house or a signpost they actually came to a signpost not long after that and george yelled out at once stop heres a signpost stop the car slid to a stop beside it and everyone looked at it and gave a shout of delight magga glen hurrah up to the left said the driver and swung his car into the lane it was rather rough and obviously only a farmroad but there right up the hill they were now climbing was a house with lights shining in the windows that must be old mrs jones farmhouse thank goodness said julian this must be it im glad we got here before the snow set in properly its quite difficult to see through the windscreen now yes it was the farmhouse dogs set up a terrific barking as the car drew near and timmy at once answered almost deafening everyone in the car the driver drew up at the farmhouse door and looked out cautiously to make sure that none of the barking dogs was leaping about round the car the front door opened and framed in the light stood a little old woman as upright as any of the children come you in come you in she called out of this cold and snow our morgan will help with the luggage come you in now the four children suddenly feeling very tired got out of the car anne almost stumbled because once again her legs felt as if they didnt belong to her ancl julian caught her arm they went in wearily only timmy seeming to have any energy a tall man hurried out to help the driver with the luggage saluting them as he passed the old lady took them into a big warm livingroom and made them sit down what a journey for you she said you look worn out and poorly its late you are too and id a good tea laid for you but now its supper youll be wanting poor children julian caught sight of a loaded table not far from the fire set to one side although he was tired the sight of the good food there made him suddenly feel hungry he smiled at the kind old woman her hair gleamed like silver and her fine old face was wrinkled all over but her eyes were as sharp and bright as a blackbirds im sorry were so late he said we lost our way this is my sister anne this is our cousin george and this is my brother dick and this is timmy said george and timmy at once offered his paw to the old woman well now its a wonder to see a dog with such good manners she said weve seven but not one of them would shake hands no not if the queen herself came here god bless her the barking of the dogs had now died down not one of them was to be seen in the house and the children thought they must be outside in kennels somewhere timmy trotted about round the room sniffing into every corner with much interest finally he went to the table put his paws up and had a good look at the food there then he went to george and whined he says he likes the look of the food there george said to the old woman i must say i agree with him it looks good you go and wash and get yourselves a bit tidy while i make some hot tea said mrs jones you look cold and hungry go through that door look and up the little flight of stairs the rooms up there are all yours no one will disturb you the five went out of the door and found themselves in a little stone passage lighted by a candle a narrow flight of stone steps led upwards to a small landing on which another candle burned the steps were very steep and the children stumbled up them their legs stiff after their long drive two bedrooms opened off the little landing opposite to one another they seemed exactly alike and were furnished in the same way too there were washstances with basins and in each basin was a jug of hot water wrapped around with a towel woodfires burned in the little stone fireplaces their flames lighting the rooms almost more than the single candles there youll have this room girls and dick and i will have the other said julian gosh woodfires in our bedrooms what a treat i shall go to bed early and lie and watch the flames said anne im glad the rooms arent cold i know i should cough if they were we havent coughed quite so much today said dick and immediately of course had a very bad fit of coughing the old woman downstairs heard him and called up at once you hurry up now and come down into the warm they were soon downstairs sitting in the warm livingroom nobody was there except old mrs jones pouring out tea isnt anyone else coming in to tea asked george looking all round surely all this food isnt just for us oh yes it is said the old woman cutting some ham in long thin slices this is your own room the room i let out to families for themselves weve got our big kitchen yonder for ourselves you can do what you like here make as much noise as it pleases you no one will hear you our stone walls are so thick after she had served them she went out of the room nodding and smiling the children looked at one another i like her very much said anne how old she must be if she is jenkins aunt but her eyes are so bright and young i feel better already said dick tucking into the ham george give timmy something he keeps poking me with his paw and i really cant spare him any of my ham he can have some of mine said george i thought i was hungry but im not after all i suddenly feel tired julian looked at her she did look tired and her eyes were ringed with black shadows finish your meal old thing said julian and go up to bed you can unpack tomorrow youre tired out with the long drive anne doesnt look nearly so tired as you do old mrs jones came in again and approved highly of julians idea that they should all go up to bed when they had finished get up tomorrow when you like she said and just come into my kitchen and tell me when youre down you can do just what you like here but all they wanted to do at that moment was to get into bed and go to sleep by the light of the crackling woodfires what a relief it was to slip in between the rather rough sheets and shut their eyes all except timmy he kept guard by the door for a long long time before he crept on to georges bed good old timmy chapter four in the old farmhouse the four children slept like logs all night long if they coughed they didnt know it they lay in their beds hardly moving and only timmy opened an eye occasionally as he always did on the first night in a strange place he jumped when a burning log fell to one side in the fireplace he stared sternly at a big bright flame licking up the chimney as the log burned fiercely he cocked up an ear when an owl hooted outside the window but at last he too fell asleep lying as usual on georges feet though old mrs jones would not have approved of that at all julian awoke first in the morning he heard the sounds of the farm coming through the closed window shouts of one man to another the lowing of cows the barking of one dog after another and then all together and the peaceful sound of hens clucking and ducks quacking it was nice to lie and hear it all feeling warm and lazy he looked at his watch good gracious it was almost nine oclock whatever would mrs jones think of them he leapt out of bed and awoke dick with the quick movement its almost nine said julian and went to the washstand this time there was only cold water in the big china jug but he didnt mind the bedroom was still warm with the burntout woodfires the sun shone outside but in the night the snow must have fallen heavily for everywhere was white good said julian looking out we shall be able to use our toboggans soon wake the girls dick but the girls were already awake for timmy had heard the boys stirring and had gone whining to the door george stretched herself feeling quite different from the night before anne how do you feel i feel really fine said george pleased do you know its nine oclock weve slept for more than twelve hours no wonder we feel better yes i certainly do too said anne with an enormous yawn oh look ive made timmy yawn too timmy did you sleep well woof said timmy and pawed impatiently at the door he wants his breakfast said george i wonder what there is i feel rather like bacon and egg goodness i thought id never feel like eating that again brrrr this waters cold to wash in they all went downstairs together and found their livingroom warm with a great woodfire breakfast was laid but only a big crusty loaf butter and homemade marmalade were there with an enormous jug of cold creamy milk mrs jones came in almost at once beaming at them well good morning to you now she said and a nice morning it is too for all the snow we had in the night what would you be wanting for breakfast now ham and eggs or homemade pork sausages or meat patties or id like ham and eggs said julian at once and the others said the same mrs jones went out of the room and the children rubbed their hands i feared we were only going to have bread and butter and marmalade said dick i say look at the cream on the top of this milk me for a farm life when i grow up woof said timmy approvingly he kept hearing the other dogs barking and going to the window to look out george laughed at him youll have to remember youre just a visitor when you meet those dogs she said no throwing your weight about and barking your head off they look pretty big dogs said dick joining timmy at the window welsh collies i should think theyre so good with the sheep i say i wonder what that dog was that barked at us so fiercely last night behind that gate at old towers do you remember yes i didnt much like it said anne it was rather like a nasty dream losing our way going up that steep hill only to find that horrid notice on the gates and nobody to ask the way and then that hidden dog barking ferociously just the other side of the gates and then the car crawling down the hill in that strange way yes it was a bit queer said dick ah here comes our breakfast mrs jones youve brought in enough for eight people not four she was followed by an enormous man with a mass of black hair bright blue eyes and a stern mouth this is my son morgan she said the four children looked at the giantlike man in awe good morning said julian and dick together and morgan nodded his head after giving them one quick look the girls gave him polite smiles and he nodded at them too but didnt speak a word he went out at once hes not much of a one for talking said the old woman not my morgan but the voice hes got when hes angry im telling the truth when i say you could hear him a mile away sends the sheep skittering off for miles when he shouts julian felt that he could quite believe it those are his dogs you can hear barking said the old woman three of them they go about with my morgan everywhere hes all for dogs he is doesnt care much about people hes got four more dogs on the hills with the sheep and believe you me if morgan went out in the yard there and shouted those four dogs away with the sheep on the hills far yonder would hear him and come tearing down here like a flash of lightning the children felt as if they could well believe this of the giantlike morgan they rather wished he would call his dogs his voice would certainly be worth hearing they set to work on their breakfast and although they couldnt eat quite all that mrs jones had brought they managed to do very well indeed so did timmy they especially liked the bread which was homemade and very good i could really make a meal just of this homemade bread and fresh butter said anne our bread at home doesnt taste a bit the same i say wouldnt mother be amazed to see the breakfast weve eaten today she certainly would considering that we havent felt like eating even a boiled egg for days said dick i say oughtnt we to telephone home julian and say were safely here gosh yes said julian i meant to last night ill do that now if mrs jones will let me hallo look isnt that our last nights driver going off he must have spent the night here the driver was about to get into his car when he heard julian knocking at the window he came over to the farmhouse and walked in at the front door and soon found the childrens livingroom im just off he announced the old lady gave me a bed in the barn last night never been so cosy in my life and i say ive found out why the car crawled so slowly up and down that hill to old towers last night oh have you why was it then asked julian with interest well it wasnt anything to do with the car said the driver and wasnt i thankful to know that it was to do with the hill itself whatever do you mean said dick puzzled well the shepherds wife told me they think there must be something magnetic down under that hill said the driver because when the postman goes up on his bicycle the same thing happens his bicycle feels like lead so heavy that he cant even cycle up and if he pushes his bike it feels just as heavy too so now he leaves his bike at the bottom and just walks up i see so the magnetic whateveritis got hold of the car last night and pulled so much that it made it go slow too said julian queer there must be some deposit of powerful metal in that hill does it affect all cars like that oh yes no one goes up there in a car if they can help it said the driver funny thing isnt it queer hill altogether if you ask me that notice on the gate and all i wonder who lives there said dick only an old dame said the driver shes off her head so they say wont let anyone in well we know that all right sorry i lost my way last night but youre all right now youre in clover here he moved to the door raised his hand in salute and went out they saw him through the window getting into his car and driving away waving a leathergloved hand out of the window is the snow thick enough to toboggan on wondered george it doesnt look like it lets go out and see better wrap up well though i bet the winds cold out on this hill and i dont want to start sniffing again ive had enough of that soon they were all clad in heavy coats scarves and woollen hats mrs jones nodded her head when she saw them and smiled sensible children you are she said cold it is today with a biting wind but healthy weather be careful of that dog of yours my boy dont you let him loose till youre well away from the farm in case he goes for one of my morgans dogs george smiled pleased to be addressed as a boy they began to wander round the farm timmy cross because he was on the lead he pulled at it wanting to run round and explore on his own but george wouldnt let him not till youve made friends with all the other dogs she said i wonder where they are must have gone out with morgan said dick come on lets go and look at the cows in the sheds i do love the smell of cows they wandered round the farm enjoying the pale sun the keen wind and the feeling that their legs belonged to them at last and were not likely to give way at any moment they hardly coughed at all and felt quite aggrieved when one or other suddenly began i shall let old timmy off the lead a bit now said george i cant see a dog about anywhere so she slipped the lead off his collar and he ran off joyfully at once sniffing here there and everywhere he disappeared round a corner his tongue hanging out happily and then the most appalling barking began the children stopped as if they had been shot it wasnt one dog or even two it sounded like a dozen the four rushed round the corner of a barn at once and there was poor timmy standing with his back to the barn growling and barking and snarling at three fierce dogs no george no dont go to timmy shouted julian seeing that george was going to rescue tim whatever happened those dogs are savage but what did george care for that she raced to timmy stood in front of him and yelled at the three surprised dogs snarling there how dare you get away go home i said go home chapter five things might be worse the three snarling dogs took no notice of george it was timmy they wanted who was this strange dog who dared to come wandering round their home they tried to get at him but george stood there swinging the leather lead and giving first one dog and then another a sharp flick julian rushed to help her and then timmy gave a sharp yelp he had been bitten someone came rushing round the corner it was mrs jones running as if she were a twelveyearold tang bob dai she called but the three dogs took no notice of her and then from somewhere came a voice what a voice it echoed all round the farmyard as if it had come through a megaphone dai bob tang and at the sound of that stentorian voice the three dogs stopped as if shot then they turned about and tore off at top speed thank god that was morgan panted the old woman clutching her shawl round her he must have heard the barking oh my little dear are you hurt she took hold of georges arm and looked at her anxiously i dont know i dont think so said george looking rather white its timmy thats hurt oh tim darling tim where did they bite you woof said timmy who though extremely startled didnt seem at all frightened it had all happened so suddenly george dropped down on her knees in the snow and gave a little scream hes been bitten on the neck oh look poor poor timmy why did i let you off the lead its not much george said julian looking at the bleeding place the other dog bit just where his collar is look and his teeth went through the collar not really into tims neck its really not much more than a graze anne was leaning against the wall looking sick and dick suddenly felt as if his legs were wobbly again he couldnt help thinking what would have happened if the three savage dogs had bitten george instead of timmy good old george she was as brave as a lion what a thing to happen said old mrs jones upset why for did you let him loose my boy you should have waited for my morgan to come along with his dogs and tell them your timmy was a friend i know said george still on her knees beside timmy it was all my fault oh timmy im so thankful youve only got that one small bite mrs jones have you any iodine i must put some on at once but before mrs jones could answer the giantlike figure of morgan came round the corner of the barn his three dogs extremely subdued now at his heels hey he said enquiringly looking at the four children and his mother the dogs attacked this one explained his mother you shouted just in time morgan but hes not much hurt you should have seen this boy here the one the dog belongs to he stood in front of his dog and fought off tang bob and dai julian couldnt help smiling to hear george continually called a boy but standing there in snowtrousers and coat a woollen cap on her short hair she looked very like a sturdy boy please come and get the iodine said george anxiously seeing a drop of blood drip from timmys neck on to the white snow morgan took a step forward and bent down to look at timmy he made a small scornful sound and stood up again hes all right he said and walked off george stared after him angrily it was his dogs that had attacked and hurt timmy and he hadnt even been sorry about it she felt so angry that tears came suddenly into her eyes she blinked them away ashamed i dont think i want to stay here she said loudly and clearly those dogs will be sure to attack timmy again they might kill him i shall go home now now youre just upset said kind old mrs jones taking georges arm george shook off her hand scowling im not upset im just angry to think my dog should have been attacked for nothing and im sure hell be attacked again and i want to see to his neck im going indoors she stalked off with timmy at her heels her head well up bitterly ashamed of two more tears that suddenly ran down her cheeks it wasnt like old george to cry but she was still not quite herself after being ill the other three looked at one another go with her anne said julian and anne obediently ran after george julian turned to the worried old woman you shouldnt stand out here in the cold he said seeing that she was shivering and pulling her shawl more closely round her george will soon be all right dont take any notice of what she says she what isnt she a boy then said mrs jones in surprise is it a girl she is as brave as that now theres a fine thing to be sure whatll morgan say to that but now surely she wont go home will she no said julian hoping he was right you never could tell with george shell soon get over it if we could get some iodine it would help though shes always terrified of wounds going bad where timmy is concerned come away in then said mrs jones and hurried back to the farmhouse refusing julians hand over the snow what an independent little old woman george was in the livingroom with timmy she had got some water and was bathing the wound with her handkerchief having first taken off tims collar ill fetch you the iodine boy said mrs jones forgetting again that george was a girl she ran to her kitchen and came back with a big bottle of brown liquid george took it gratefully and dabbed some on timmy who stood still quite enjoying all the fuss he jumped a little when the iodine stung him and george patted him and praised him he wouldnt mind having iodine dabbed on him all day long george if you would only make a fuss of him said dick with a laugh george looked up he might have been killed she said and if those dogs get him again he certainly will be im going to go back home not to your home ju but to my own at kirrin cottage oh dont be an ass george said dick exasperated anyone would think timmy had been injured for life or something hes only got a skin wound why spoil what may be a jolly good holiday just for that i dont trust those three dogs said george stubbornly theyll be out to get tim now i know they will i tell you im going home im not spoiling your holiday only my own well listen stay one more day said julian hoping that if she did george would see how stupidly she was behaving just one more day thats not much to ask it will upset old mrs jones dreadfully if you rush off like this and it will be difficult to make arrangements for you to go back today now that everywhere is under snow again all right said george ungraciously ill stay till tomorrow it will give timmy a bit of time to get over his fright but only till tomorrow tims not frightened said anne george he would have taken on all three dogs by himself if you hadnt gone to his help wouldnt you timmy woof woof said timmy agreeing at once he wagged his tail vigorously dick laughed good old tim he said you dont want to go home do you woof said timmy obligingly and wagged his tail again george put on one of her scowls and julian nudged the others to warn them to stop teasing her he didnt want george suddenly to change her mind and rush off home straightaway i vote we go for a walk said dick its a shame to stick indoors like this on this sunny snowy day anne are you coming i will if george does said anne but george shook her head no she said ill stay in with tim this morning you go off together anne wouldnt come so the boys left the two girls and went out into the keen invigorating mountain air once more already they felt better and were not coughing at all what a pity this had happened it spoilt things for everyone even for old mrs jones who now appeared at her front door looking anxious dont you worry now mrs jones said julian i expect our cousin will be all right soon shes given up the idea of rushing home today at any rate my brother and i are going for a walk up the mountain which way is best well now take that path said the old woman pointing and go on till you come to our summer chalet you can rest there before coming back and if you dont want to come back for dinner well youll find food in the cupboard there here is the key to get into the little place oh thanks said julian surprised that sounds good wed love to have our lunch up there mrs jones well be back before dark tell the girls for us will you and away they went whistling it was fun to have a day all to themselves just the two of them together they took the snowy path and began to climb up the slope of the mountain the sun was now melting the snow a little so they could make out the path fairly easily then they discovered that big black stones marked the way here and there a guide to the farmer and his men when the snow covered path and everything the view was magnificent as they climbed higher they could see the tops of more and more hills all of which sparkled snowywhite in the pale january sun i say if only we had a bit more snow what tobogganing we could have down these slopes said dick longingly i wish id brought my skis this morning the snow is deep enough for them down that hill wed whizz along like lightning they were glad when they at last came to the little hut or chalet that old mrs jones had spoken about after two hours climbing it was nice to think of having something to eat and a good rest its quite a place said julian slipping the key into the lock a little wooden house with windows and all he opened the door and went inside yes it was a very fine little place indeed with bunkbeds let into the wooden walls a stove for heating and cupboards full of crockery and tins of food the two boys had the same idea at once and swung round to one another couldnt we stay here on our own george would love it too said julian putting into words what dick was already thinking oh if only they could chapter six a funny little creature the boys were tired but not too tired to examine the little hut thoroughly though it really was more like a oneroomed house it faced across the deep valley and the sun shone straight into it julian opened cupboard after cupboard exclaiming in delight bedding towels crockery and cutlery and look at these tins of food and bottles of orangeade and the rest my word people who come to stay at magga glen in the summer must have a fine time we could light the stove to heat the room suggested dick pulling the oilstove into the middle of the room no we dont need to said julian the sun is pouring in and it really isnt cold in here we could wrap ourselves round in the rugs from that cupboard if we want to do you think wed be allowed to come up here instead of living down at the farm said dick opening a tin of ham with a tinopener that hung on a nail by the cupboard its so much nicer to be quite on our own and independent george would simply love it well we can ask said julian taking the cap off a bottle of orangeade can we find some biscuits to eat with this ham oh yes here are some creamcracker biscuits i say im really ravenous so am i said dick his mouth full pity george was such an ass she and anne could have enjoyed this too well perhaps on the whole its as well they didnt come said julian i think anne would have been too tired to come all this way on her first day and george certainly had a worse cold and cough than anyone a day at the farm will probably do her good gosh shes absolutely fearless isnt she ill never forget her standing up to those three savage dogs i was jolly scared myself im going to get a rug and wrap it round me and sit out on the doorstep in the sun said dick that view is too marvellous for words he and julian took a rug each and then sat out on the wooden doorstep munching their ham and biscuits they stared across at the great hill opposite is that a house on the slope over there near the top look said dick suddenly julian stared across at the opposite hill but could make out nothing it cant be he said the roof would be covered with snow and wed never see it besides who would build a house so high up plenty of people said dick its not everyone who likes towns and shops and cinemas and traffic and the rest i can imagine an artist building a house on one of these mountains just for the view hed be quite happy looking at it and painting it all day long well i like a bit of company i must say said julian this is all right for a week or two but youd need to be an artist or a poet or a shepherd or something to stand it all the time he yawned both boys had finished their meal and felt comfortably full and at peace dick yawned too and lay back on his rug but julian pulled him upright oh no were not going to take naps up here wed sleep like logs again and wake up in the dark the suns going down already and weve got all that long walk back to the farm and no torch to light our way if we go wrong there are those black stones said dick with another yawn all right all right i agree with you i certainly dont want to stumble down this mountain in the pitch dark julian suddenly clutched dicks arm and pointed upwards where the path still wound on and on dick turned and stared someone was up there skipping down the path towards them with a lamb gambolling around and a small dog scampering after is it a boy or a girl said julian in wonder my word it must be cold whichever it is it was a small girl coming along a wildlooking little creature with a mass of untidy black curls a face as brown as an oakapple and very few clothes she wore a dirty pair of boys shorts and a blue blouse or it might have been a shirt her legs were bare and she had old shoes on her feet she was singing as she came in a high sweet voice like a birds the dog with her began to bark and she stopped her song at once she spoke to the dog and he barked again facing towards the hut the lamb gambolled round without stopping the little girl looked towards the hut and saw julian and dick she turned at once and ran back the way she had come julian got up and shouted to her its all right we shant hurt you look heres a bit of meat for your dog the girl stopped and looked round poised ready to run again at once julian waved the bit of ham left over from their meal the little dog smelt it on the wind and came running up eagerly he snapped at it got it into his mouth and ran back to the girl hc didnt attempt to eat it but just stood there by her looking up she bent down eagerly and took it she tore it in half and gave one piece to the eager dog who swallowed it at once and the other piece she ate herself keeping a sharp eye on the two boys as she did so the lamb came nosing round her and she put one thin arm round its neck what a queer little thing said julian to dick where can she have come from she must be absolutely frozen dick called to the child hallo come and talk to us she shot off at once as soon as he shouted but she didnt go very far she half hid behind a bush peeping out now and again get some of those biscuits said julian to dick well hold some out to her shes like a wild thing so dick held out a handful of biscuits and called biscuits for you and your dog but only the lamb came gambolling up a toylike creature with a tail that frisked and whisked all the time it tried to get on to dicks knee and bumped its little black nose against his face fany fany called the small girl in a high clear voice the lamb tried to get away but dick held on to it it seemed to be all legs come and get it shouted dick we shant hurt you the little girl couldnt bear to leave her lamb she came out from the bush and took a few hesitating steps towards the boys the dog ran right up to them snuffling at their hands for more ham julian gave him a biscuit and he crunched it up at once giving sidelong glances at his watching mistress as if to apologise for eating it all himself julian patted the little thing and it licked him joyfully the little girl came nearer her legs looked blue with cold but although she had so little on she didnt seem to be shivering julian held out another biscuit the dog jumped up and took it neatly in his mouth running up to the little girl with it the boys burst into laughter and the small girl smiled suddenly her whole face lighting up come here called julian come and get your pretty lamb weve got some more biscuits for you and your dog at last the child came near to them as watchful as a hare ready to run at a moments notice the boys sat still and patient and soon the girl was near enough to snatch a biscuit and retreat again she sat down on one of the black stones marking the path and munched her biscuit staring at them all the time out of her big dark eyes whats your name asked dick not moving from his place afraid that the child would leap off like a frightened goat the girl didnt seem to understand dick repeated his question speaking slowly what is your name what are you called the child nodded her head and then pointed to herself me aily she said she pointed at the dog dave she said and he leapt up at his name and covered her with licks then she pointed to the lamb which was now gambolling round the boys like a mad thing fany she said ah aily dave fany said julian solemnly and he too pointed at first one then the other then he pointed to himself julian he said and then pointed to dick dick the little girl gave a high clear laugh and suddenly poured out quite a long speech the boys couldnt understand a word of it shes speaking in welsh i suppose said dick disappointed what a pity it sounds lovely but i cant make head or tail of it the child saw that they had not understood she frowned as if thinking hard my dadda he up high sheep she said oh your fathers a shepherd up there said dick but you dont live with him do you aily considered this then shook her head down she said pointing aily down then she turned to the dog and the lamb and cuddled them both dave mine she said proudly fany mine nice dog nice lamb said julian solemnly and the little girl nodded in delight then for no reason that the boys could see she stood up leapt down the hill followed by the lamb and the dog and disappeared what a funny little creature said dick like a pixie of the hills or an elf of the woods i quite expected her to disappear in smoke or something i should think she runs completely wild wouldnt you well ask mrs jones about her when we get back my goodness come on the suns getting quite low said julian getting up in a hurry weve got to put the things away and fold up the rugs and lock up buck up once the sun goes it will be dark almost at once and weve quite a long way to go it didnt take them long to tidy up and lock the little house carefully then down the path they went at top speed the sun had melted most of the snow farther down and the going was easy the boys felt exhilarated by their day on the mountainside and sang as they went until they were quite out of breath theres the farmhouse said dick and both boys were glad to see it their legs were tired now and they longed for a good meal and a rest in a warm room i hope george has recovered a bit by now and is still at the farm said julian with a laugh you never know with old george i hope shell like the sound of that hut well ask mrs jones about it tonight when weve talked it over with anne and george here we are said dick thankfully as they went up to the house anne george were back where are you chapter seven back at the farm again anne came running to meet dick and julian oh im glad youre back she said its beginning to get dark and i was afraid youd lose your way hallo george said julian seeing her behind anne in the darkness of the passage hows timmy all right thank you said george sounding quite cheerful here he is timmy barked loudly and jumped up at the boys in welcome he was very glad to see them for he had been afraid that they had gone back home they all went into the livingroom where there was an enormous woodfire looking very cheerful indeed julian and dick fell into the two most comfortable chairs and spread their legs out to the fire ha this is good said dick i couldnt have walked another step i dont believe i can even go up the stairs to wash weve walked miles they told the girls about their day and when they described the little summer chalet the two girls listened eagerly oh i wish wed gone with you said anne longingly timmy would have been quite all right wouldnt he george weve decided its only a skinwound actually you can hardly see it now but all the same im going back home tomorrow said george determinedly im sorry i made such a fuss this morning but honestly i thought timmy had been badly bitten thank goodness he wasnt still im not risking such a thing again if i stay on here with him hes sure to have those three dogs attacking him sometime or other and he might be killed i dont want to upset your holiday but i can not stay on here with tim all right old thing said julian soothingly dont get so upintheair about it there youve gone and started your cough again do you know dick and i havent coughed once today nor have i said anne the air is marvellous here i think i ought to go back with george though ju shed be miserable all by herself at home listen said julian weve got an idea dick and i one that means old george wont have to go home and nothing will make me stop here interrupted george at once nothing give me a chance to tell you what ive got up my sleeve protested julian its about that mountainhut weve been to dick and i thought it would be a marvellous idea if we could all five of us go and spend our time there instead of here wed be absolutely on our own then the way we like to be oh yes said anne at once delighted they all three looked at george she smiled suddenly yes that would be fun id like that i dont suppose those dogs would come near there and how heavenly to be on our own mrs jones said that her son morgan told her were going to have heavy falls of snow said anne we could spend all day long on those slopes with our toboggans and skis oh george what a pity timmy cant ski well have to leave him at the hut when we go off skiing do you suppose mrs jones will mind us going off there said dick i dont think so said anne she was telling us today that parties of children go there alone in the summer while their parents stay and have a peaceful time down here i dont see why she shouldnt let us go well ask her when she comes in with our high tea i said we wouldnt have tea and supper wed just have one big meal we didnt know what time youd be back and george and i had such an enormous dinner in the middle of the day that we knew we wouldnt want tea yes id rather have a big meal now too said julian yawning widely im afraid all i shall want to do afterwards is to go up to bed and fall asleep im marvellouslp tired in fact i could go to sleep this very minute i suppose you girls have been indoors all day long because of timmy no we took it in turns to go for a walk without him said anne george hasnt let him put his nose outside the door poor timmy he just couldnt understand it and he whined and whined never mind hell enjoy himself if we can go up to that hut said george who was very cheerful indeed now i do hope we can it would be glorious fun ju come and wash said dick seeing that julian had his eyes closed already julian come up and wash i tell you you dont want to miss your meal do you julian groaned and dragged himself up the stone stairway but once he had sluiced himself in cold water he felt much better and very hungry indeed so did dick we didnt tell the girls about that funny little creature what was her name now aily and dave her dog and fany the lamb we mustnt forget to ask mrs jones about them said julian they went downstairs feeling much fresher and were delighted to see that mrs jones had been in and laid the table they went up to see what there was for their high tea pork pie home made of course said dick and whats this golly its a cheese how enormous smell it julian its enough to make you start eating straightaway and more of that homemade bread cant we start no there are newlaid boiled eggs to begin with said anne with a laugh and an apple pie and cream to end with so i hope you really are hungry you two mrs jones came in with a pot of hot tea she smiled at the boys as she set the big brown teapot down on the table is it a nice day youve had away up on the mountain she said you look fine both of you did you find the hut all right yes thank you said julian mrs jones its a marvellous hut we yes yes its a good hut said mrs jones and its sorry i was the two girls didnt go with you such a fine day as it was and the dog not really hurt and to think that the girls want to go back home its sad ive been this day in my thoughts she really did seem hurt and grieved and george looked very guilty julian patted mrs jones on the arm and spoke comfortingly dont you worry about us mrs jones ive got a fine idea to tell you what wed really like is to go and live up at that hut the five of us then wed be out of your way and timmy would be out of the way of the farm dogs too do you think we might do that then george wouldnt have to go home as she had planned to do well now to go to that hut in this weather what an idea said mrs jones most uncomfortable you would be with no one to look after you and see to your wants and cook for you this cold weather no no were used to looking after ourselves said dick were awfully good at it mrs jones and my word the food youve got up there is enough to feed an army and there are cups and plates and dishes and knives and forks and all kinds of bedding wed have a smashing time said george joining in eagerly i dont really want to go home mrs jones its so lovely in these mountains and if the snow comes down as your morgan says wed be able to have winter sports all on our own oh do say its all right begged anne we shall be quite safe and happy there and we do promise to come down here again if we cant manage or if anything goes wrong ill see that things go all right said julian speaking in his most grownup voice well well its a queer idea you have said mrs jones still taken aback ill have to talk to my morgan about it first now set you down and eat your meal ill get my morgan to decide she went out of the room shaking her head her mouth pursed up in disapproval no fire no hot meals no one to manage for them what a dreadful time those children would have up in that hut in this weather the five set to work to demolish the good food on the table george allowed timmy to sit up on a chair too and fed him with titbits for a treat he was perfectly good and very wellmannered indeed i almost expect him to hand me a plate of something said anne with a giggle tim dear do pass me the salt timmy put a paw on the table exactly as if he meant to obey anne and george hastily made him put it down again what a meal that was the pork pie was so good that everyone had two slices as well as their boiled eggs then they started on the cheese which even timmy liked there was very little room indeed for the apple pie that mrs jones brought in at the end my goodness i forgot that an apple pie was coming said anne in dismay as the old woman walked in with a tray on which was a big apple pie and a jug of cream mrs jones when we were up at the hut we saw such a funny little creature said dick she said her name was aily and she had a lamb and a oh aily that mad little thing said mrs jones picking up the dirty plates shes the shepherds daughter a little truant she is runs off from school and hides away in the hills with her dog and her lamb she always has a lamb each year it follows her about everywhere they say there isnt a rabbit hole or a blackberry bush or a birds nest that child doesnt know she was singing when we first saw her said julian singing like a bird ah yes its a lovely voice she has said mrs jones shes wild as a bird theres nothing to be done with her if shes scolded she goes off for weeks no one knows where dont you let her come round that hut now when youre there shell maybe steal from you oh yes the hut have you spoken to morgan about it said dick eagerly yes i have indeed said mrs jones and he says yes to let you go he doesnt want trouble with the dogs either he says snow is coming for sure but youll be safe up there and you can take all your toboggans for therell be a chance to use them hell help you up with your things oh good thanks said julian and the others smiled and looked at one another joyfully thanks most awfully mrs jones well go tomorrow after breakfast tomorrow after breakfast up to that lonely hut on the mountainside just the five of them together what could be better than that chapter eight off to the little hut julian and dick were so sleepy after their long day in the cold air and their enormous meal that they could not keep their eyes open for long go to bed both of you said anne seeing them lying tired out in their chairs when mrs jones had cleared away everything yes i think wed better said julian staggering up oh my legs theyre as stiff as sticks good night you two girls and timmy see you tomorrow if we wake up the two boys stumbled up the stone stairs to bed george and anne stayed downstairs talking and reading timmy lay on the hearthrug listening his ears twitching towards anne when she spoke and then towards george as she answered this little habit of his always made them laugh its exactly as if he was listening but too lazy to join in our conversation said anne oh george i really am glad youre not going home tomorrow it would be the first time youd ever done a thing like that id just have had to come with you dont lets talk about it said george i feel rather ashamed of making such a fuss now all the same i shall be terrified if i see any of those dogs again when im with timmy what a bit of luck the boys went up to that hut today anne wed never have known about it if they hadnt yes it sounds fun said anne dont lets be too late to bed george it will be quite a pull up the mountainside tomorrow with all our things george went to the window its snowing hard she said just as morgan said it would i dont like him do you oh i think hes all right said anne and what a voice hes got he nearly made me jump out of my skin when he called his three dogs he must have the loudest voice in the world timmy youre yawning said george as timmy opened his mouth widely and made a yawning noise hows your neck timmy was getting rather tired of having his neck examined he lay still while george had another look at it healing beautifully she said youll be quite all right tomorrow will you like going off to that hut all by ourselves tim timmy gave her a loving lick and yawned again then he got up and trotted over to the door that led to the stone stairs looking back enquiringly at george right were coming said george laughing and she and anne blew out the lamp on the table and followed timmy up the stairs they peeped in at the boys room and saw julian and dick absolutely sound asleep dead to the world a thunderstorm wouldnt wake them tonight said anne come on lets buck up and get into bed ourselves weve a nice woodfire again and i shall undress in front of it move over timmy i want to stand on the rug in the morning the world was very white indeed as morgan had prophesied the snow had fallen thickly in the night and everywhere was covered in a thick white blanket that gleamed and sparkled in the weak january sun this is something like said dick as he looked out of his bedroom window get up ju its a marvellous morning remember weve got to take all our things up to that hut today do stir yourself mrs jones gave them a fine breakfast eggs bacon and sausages its the last hot meal youll have if youre going up to that hut she said though youll be able to cook eggs in the little saucepan up there if you set it on top of the oilstove and mind you dont get playing about round that stove when its alight or the whole place might go up in flames well be very careful promised julian ill send anyone back if they upset the stove yes i will so just look out timmy woof said tim amiably he was pleasantly excited with all the preparations for going and ran sniffing from one parcel to another the children were not taking all their things of course but mrs jones had made them pack a complete change of clothes each besides their warmest nightclothes and dressinggowns they had torches too and plenty of rope for hauling things up and down the hills and also they had six loaves of newbaked bread a large cheese about three dozen eggs and a ham so they were truly well provided for and theres plenty of butter packed in with the loaves said mrs jones and a large pot of cream ill try and send up some milk if the shepherd comes down hell pass the hut when he goes up again theres only a quart in that bottle there but youll find plenty of orangeade and lemonade in the hut and you can boil snow if you want to make cocoa or tea it was quite clear that mrs jones had no idea how many times the five had gone off on their own they smiled and winked at one another and took all her advice in good part she really was so kind so very concerned about them all she even packed some bones and dog biscuits for timmy heres my morgan now said mrs jones when every single thing had been put in a pile outside the front door toboggans and skis as well hes brought his snowslide with him to take all your goods the snowslide was like a long flat cart with runners instead of wheels an elongated sleigh the children piled on to it all the parcels and two suitcases they were all going to walk up as the snow was not yet too thick timmy danced round in great excitement though both he and george kept a wary eye out for the other dogs and timmy did not venture very far from george the giantlike morgan arrived his breath puffing before him like a smokecloud he nodded at the children morning he said and that was all he took hold of the ropes at the front of the snowslide and ran them over his shoulders ill take one said julian its much too heavy for one person to pull ha said morgan scornfully and walked off with the two ropes over his shoulder the snowslide followed easily strong as a horse my morgan is said old mrs jones proudly strong as ten horses said julian wishing he was as big and as strong as the broadshouldered farmer george said nothing she hadnt yet forgiven the farmer for being scornful about timmys bite the day before she followed the others carrying her skis and waved to kind old mrs jones as she stood anxiously watching them leave it seemed a long trek up the mountainside when things had to be pulled or carried morgan went first pulling the big snowslide easily julian went next pulling a toboggan and carrying his skis dick was next with another toboggan and skis and the girls came last with their skis only timmy ran at the front or the back as he liked enjoying everything morgan said nothing at all julian addressed a few polite remarks to him and received a grunt in reply but that was all he looked curinusly at the great strong fellow wondering about him and his silence he looked intelligent and even kindly but he seemed so dour and rough in his manners and behaviour oh well they would soon say goodbye to him and be on their own they came at last to the little hut the girls ran ahead to it exclaiming in delight george looked through the windows oh its a proper little house inside oh look at those bunks on the walls and theres even a carpet on the floor quick julian wheres the key morgans got it said julian and they all stood by and waited while morgan unlocked the door for them thanks so much for helping to bring up our things said julian politely awfully good of you morgan grunted but looked pleased shepherd comes by at times he said in his great deep voice and the five felt quite surprised to hear him saying even a short sentence to them hell take messages for you if you so want and with that he set off down the hill back to the farm with enormous swinging steps like a giant from an oldtime tale hes queer said anne looking after him i dont know if i like him or not what does it matter said dick come on anne old girl give a hand theres plenty to do what about you and george seeing what blankets and things are in those cupboards and making up some beds for tonight anne loved that kind of thing though george didnt she would much rather have carried in the things as the boys were doing but she went to the cupboards with anne and examined all their contents with much interest plenty of rugs and blankets and pillows said anne and enough china and cutlery for half a dozen families too i suppose old mrs jones has dozens of people here in the summer george ill put the food away if youll see to the beds right said george and went to make up four of the bunkbeds there were six of these altogether in rows of three three on one wall three on another one above the other george was soon struggling with blankets and pillows while anne set out the food they had brought with them arranging it neatly on the cupboard shelves then she went to look at the stove to see if it had oil in it for it would be very cold that night yes its full she said ill light it tonight because i expect well be out as long as its daylight wont we dick rather said dick unpacking some of the things out of his suitcase by the way theres a little wooden bunker outside with a can of extra oil and an enamel jug i suppose the jugs for fetching water from some spring or other in the summertime but we can easily melt snow for water will you two girls be long anne no weve almost finished said anne do you want something to eat before we go or shall we take some bread and ham with us and have a good meal when we come back oh take some sandwiches said julian i dont want to stop for a meal besides we cant be hungry yet make sandwiches anne and well take some of those apples with us too the sandwiches were quickly made and the boys filled their pockets with apples timmy danced round in delight you wont be quite so pleased tim when you find yourself in deep snow said dick i wonder if hell like travelling down the hill on a toboggan george oh hell love it said george wont you tim are we ready well lock the door ju and off well go chapter nine a strange tale the children did not bother about their skis that first day for one thing the snow was not quite thick or smooth enough for skiing and for another thing they longed for the swift excitement of tobogganing dick took george on his toboggan and julian took anne on his timmy wouldnt come on either of them race you to the bottom julian shouted one two three go and away they went swishing over the clean white snow at top speed shouting with laughter julian won easily because dicks toboggan caught on a root or small bush under the snow which upset it very suddenly dick and george were flung headlong into the snow and sat up blinking and spitting out the cold snow from their mouths timmy was terribly excited he came plunging down the hillside after the toboggans annoyed at the way his legs went into the snow barking madly he was most astonished to see dick and george fly into the air when their toboggan upset and pranced round them licking them and leaping on them in a most aggravating way oh get away timmy said dick trying to get up and being knocked down again by the excited dog go and knock george over not me call him george pulling the toboggans back up the hill was a tiring job but the swift flight down over the snow was worth all the pullingsup the four children soon had glowing faces and tingling limbs and wished they could throw off their coats and scarves i cant pull up our toboggan one more time said anne at last i really cant youll have to pull it up yourself julian if you want to toboggan any more well i do want to but my legs will hardly walk up the hill now said julian panting hey dick anne and i have had enough well go up and eat our sandwiches at the top of the slope where we can watch you the other two soon joined them and timmy was glad to sit down too his long pink tongue hung out of his mouth and he puffed his white breath out like rolling mist at first he had been puzzled by what he thought was smoke coming out of his mouth so continually but now seeing that everyone was apparently puffing it out too he didnt worry the five sat at the top of the slope eating their sandwiches hungrily very glad of the rest julian grinned round at them all pity mother cant see us now he said we look marvellous and nobodys coughed once i bet well be stiff tomorrow though dick was looking across the slope to the opposite hill rising steeply up a mile or so away theres that building i thought i saw yesterday he said isnt that a chimney sticking up youve got sharp eyes said george nobody could surely see a building as far away as that when the snow is on it did we bring the fieldglasses asked julian where are they we could soon find out if theres a house there or not if we look through those i put them into a cupboard said anne getting up ooooh im stiff ill just go and get them she soon came back with the glasses and handed them to dick he put them to his eyes and adjusted them till they were properly focused on the faraway hill opposite yes he said i was right it is a building and im pretty sure it must be old towers too you know the place we went to by mistake two nights ago when we lost our way lets have a look said anne i think i might recognise it i caught a glimpse of the towers when we swung round a corner on the way up old towers hill she put the glasses to her eyes and gazed through them yes im sure thats the place she said wasnt it queer that big rude notice on the gate and that fiercely barking dog and nobody about how lonely the old lady must be living there all by herself as they sat there nibbling their apples timmy suddenly began to bark he stood up turning his head towards the path that ran higher up the hill perhaps its aily that funny child coming said julian hopefully but it wasnt it was a small wirylooking woman a shawl over her head neatlydressed walking swiftly she didnt seem very surprised to see the children she stopped and said good day youll be the boys my aily was telling me of last night she said are you staying in the jones hut yes said julian we were staying at the farm first but our dog didnt get on with the others so weve come up here its fine marvellous view too if you see that aily of mine you tell her not to stay out tonight said the woman wrapping her shawl more tightly round her her and her lamb shes as mad as the old lady in the house yonder and she pointed in the direction of old towers oh do you know anything about that old place asked julian at once we went to it by mistake and well you didnt get into it ill be bound said ailys mother notices on the gate and all and to think i used to go up there three times a week and never anything but kindness shown me and now old mrs thomas she wont see a soul except those friends of her sons poor old lady shes out of her mind so they say must be or shed see me that waited on her for years this was all very interesting why do they say keep out on the gates asked julian theyve a fierce dog there too ah well young sir you see some of the old ladys friends would like to know whats going on said ailys mother but nobody can do a thing its a queer place now with noises at night and mists and shimmerings and julian began to think this was an old wives tale made up because the villagers were angry that they were now kept out of the big old house he smiled oh you may smile young man said the woman sounding cross but ever since last october theres queer doings there and whats more vans have been there in the dead of night what for id like to know well if you ask me i reckon theyve been taking away the poor old things belongings furniture and pictures and such my poor old madam she was sweet and kind and now i dont know whats happening to her there were tears in the womans eyes and she hastily brushed them away i shouldnt be telling you all this youll be scared sleeping here alone at night now no no we shant julian assured her amused that she should think that a village tale might frighten them tell us about aily isnt she frozen going about with so few clothes on that child shes fey i tell you said ailys mother runs about the hills like a wild thing plays truant from school goes to see her father hes shepherd up yonder where the sheep are and doesnt come home at nights you tell her theres a good whipping waiting for her at home if she doesnt come back tonight shes like her father she is likes to be alone all the time talks to the lambs and the dogs like they were human but never a word to me the children began to feel uncomfortable and wished they hadnt spoken to the grumbling gossipy woman julian got up well if we see aily well certainly tell her to go home but not about the whipping because i expect she wouldnt go home then he said if you pass by the farmhouse will you be kind enough to step in and tell mrs jones we are quite all right and enjoying ourselves very much thank you the woman nodded her head muttered something and went off down the hill walking as swiftly as before she said some queer things said dick staring after her was that a silly villagetale she told us or do you suppose theres something in it ju oh a village tale of course said julian sensing that anne hadnt liked it much what a strange family a shepherd who spends all his time on the hills a child who wanders about the countryside with a lamb and a dog and a mother who stops and tells such angry tales to strangers its getting dark said dick i vote we go in and light the oillamp and get the hut warm and light the tablelamp too itll be cosy in there im feeling a bit chilled now sitting out here so long well dont begin to cough said julian or youll set us all off indoors tim come on soon they were all in the hut the oillamp giving out a lovely warmth and glow and the tablelamp shining brightly well play a game shall we said dick and have a sort of high tea later lets have a silly game snap or something so they sat down to play and soon dicks cards had all been snapped by the others he yawned and went to the window looking out into the darkness that hid all the snowy hills then he stood tense for a moment staring in surprise he spoke to the others without turning quick come here all of you tell me what you make of this did you ever see such an extraordinary thing quick chapter ten in the middle of the night what is it dick what can you see cried george putting down her cards as soon as she heard dicks call julian rushed to stand beside him at once imagining all sorts of things anne went too with timmy leaping excitedly they all stared out of the window anne half fearfully its gone cried dick in disappointment but what was it asked george i dont know it was over there on the opposite slope where old towers is said dick i dont know how to describe it it was like a like a rainbow no not quite like that how can i describe it try said julian excited well let me think you know how on a very hot day all the air shimmers dont you said dick well thats what i saw on the hill over there rising high into the sky and then disappearing a shimmering what colour asked anne amazed i dont know all colours it seemed said dick i dont quite know how to explain its something ive never seen before it just came suddenly and the shimmering rose all the way up into the sky and then disappeared thats all well thats what ailys mother said mists and shimmerings said julian remembering gosh so that wasnt just a tale she told us there was some truth in it but what in the wide world can this shimmering be had we better go back to the farm and tell them there asked anne hopefully not at all wanting to spend the night in the hut now no theyve probably heard the tale already said julian besides this is exciting we might be able to find out something more about it we can easily watch old towers from here its one of the very few places where anyone can look straight across at it as the crow flies its less than a mile away though its many miles by the road they all gazed towards the opposite hill again though they couldnt see it of course hoping something would happen but nothing did happen the sky was pitch black for heavy clouds had come up and the distant hill couldnt be seen well im tired of looking out into the darkness said anne turning away lets go on with our game right said julian and they all sat down again dick watching the others play but occasionally glancing out of the window into the black darkness there anne was out of the game next and she got up and went to the food cupboard i think ill start preparing a meal she said well have boiled eggs shall we to begin with and ill boil a kettle too and make some cocoa or would you rather have tea cocoa said everyone and anne got out the tin ill want some snow for the kettle she said well theres some nice clean snow just behind the hut said dick oh wait anne you wont like going out in the dark now will you ill get it if you hear me yell youll know theres something going on timmy went out with him much to annes relief she held the kettle waiting for the snow and then suddenly there came a loud yell hey whos that anne let go the kettle in fright and it dropped on the floor with a crash making the other two jump violently julian rushed to the door dick whats up dick appeared at the doorway grinning with timmy beside him nothing much sorry if i frightened you but i was just scraping up some snow in the basin here when something rushed at me and butted me whatever was it said george startled and why didnt timmy bark because he knew it was harmless i suppose said dick grinning aggravatingly here anne heres the snow for the kettle dick dont be so annoying said george who was out there well i couldnt really see much because id put my torch down to scrape up the snow said dick but i rather think it was fany the lamb it was gone before i had time to call out i got quite a shock fany the lamb said julian well that must mean that little aily is about what can she be doing out in the darkness at this time of night he went to the door and called aily aily if youre there come in here and well give you something to eat but there was no answering call nobody appeared out of the darkness no lamb came frisking up timmy stood by julian looking out into the darkness his ears pricked he had been surprised when the tiny lamb trotted up out of the darkness and had had half a mind to bark but who would bark at a lamb not timmy julian shut the door if that kid is out there in this frosty night with only the few clothes she had on yesterday i should think shell catch her death of cold he said cheer up anne and for goodness sake dont be scared if you hear a noise outside or see a little face looking in at the window it will only be that mad little aily i dont want to see any faces looking in at the window whether its aily or not said anne putting snow into the kettle honestly i think she must be mad wandering about these snowy hills alone at night i dont wonder her mother was cross it wasnt long before they were all sitting round the small table eating a very nice meal boiled eggs laid that morning cheese and new bread and butter and a jar of homemade jam they found in the cupboard they drank steaming hot cups of cocoa into each of which anne had ladled a spoonful of cream no king or queen in all the world could possibly have enjoyed their meal more than i have said dick anne shall i take the milk and cream out into the snow theyll keep for ages out there all right but for goodness sake dont put them where the lamb can get them if it was a lamb that butted you said anne giving them to dick and dont yell again if you can help it however dick didnt see anything this time nor did anything come up and butt him he was quite disappointed ill wash the plates and cups out in the snow tomorrow said anne how long are you all going to stay up its awfully early i know but im half asleep already the air up here is so very strong all right well all pack up said julian you take those two bunks over there girls and well have these shall we have the little oilstove on or not yes said dick this place will be an icebox if we dont id like it on too said anne what with shimmerings and buttings and yellings i feel id like a little light in the room even if it only comes from an oilstove well i know you dont believe my shimmerings said dick but i swear theyre true and whats more i bet well all see them before we leave this hut well good night girls im for bed in a few minutes time the bunks were creaking as the four children settled into them they were not as comfortable as beds but quite good georges bunk creaked more than anyones i suppose youve got timmy in your bunk making it creak like that said anne sleepily well im glad im in the bunk above yours george i bet tim falls out in the night one by one they fell asleep the oilstove burned steadily it was turned rather low and shadows quivered on the ceiling and walls and then something made timmys ears prick up as he lay asleep on georges feet first one ear pricked up and then the other and suddenly timmy sat up straight and growled in his throat nobody awoke they were all too sound asleep timmy growled again and again and then he barked sharply woof everyone awoke at once timmy barked again and george put out a hand to him sh whats the matter is there someone about tim whats up do you think said julian from his bunk on the other side of the room nobody could hear or see anything out of the ordinary why was timmy barking then the oilstove was still burning its light throwing a small round pattern of yellow on the ceiling it made a small cosy noise as it burned a kind of bubbling there was nothing else to be heard at all it must be someone prowling outside said dick at last shall we let timmy go and see well lets lie down and see if he barks again said julian for all we know a mouse may have run across the floor tim would bark at that just as soon as he would bark at an elephant yes youre right said george all right well lie down again timmys lying down too now for goodness sake tim if it is a mouse somewhere do use your common sense and let it play if it wants to and dont wake us up timmy licked her face he kept his ears well up for a while the others all went to sleep except anne she lay with her eyes open wondering what had startled timmy she didnt believe it was a mouse so it was the wakeful anne who heard the noise when it came again she thought at first that it was just a noise in her ears the kind she often heard when she lay down to sleep and the room was quiet but then she felt certain that it wasnt in her ears it was a real noise but what a peculiar one its a kind of deep deep grumbling noise thought anne sitting up timmy gave a little whine as if to say he was hearing something again too a sort of thunderrumble but far far below me not above it grew a little louder and timmy growled its all right tim whispered anne it must be faroff thunder i think but then the shuddering began this was so astonishing that anne didnt know what to make of it at first she thought it was herself beginning to shiver with the cold but no even her bunk vibrated to her fingers when she touched the wooden side then she really was frightened she called out loudly julian dick wake up something queer is happening do wake up and timmy began to bark again woof woof woof woof woof chapter eleven strange happenings everyone awoke at annes call julian thought he was in bed and leapt out forgetting that he was in the top bunk he landed with a crash on the floor shaken and alarmed oh ju you forgot you were in the top bunk said george half scared and half amused are you hurt anne whatever is the matter why did you call out did you see something no i heard something and felt something said anne glad that the others were awake so did timmy but its all gone now yes but what was it asked julian sitting on the edge of dicks bunk and rubbing his knee which had struck the floor when he fell it was a a well a kind of very very deep rumbling said anne a deepdown rumbling very far away not like thunder up in the sky more like a thunderstorm underground and then there was a a shuddering i felt the edge of my bunk and it seemed to be sort of well quivering i cant quite explain it i was awfully scared sounds like a small earthquake said dick wondering if anne had dreamt all this anyway you cant hear or feel it now can you youre sure you didnt dream all this anne quite sure said anne i and just at that very moment it all began again first the curious grumbling muffled and deepdown as anne had described it then the equally strange shuddering it crept through their bodies till they were all shuddering a little too and could not stop its as if we were shivering in every part of us said dick in wonder sort of vibrating as if we had tiny dynamo engines working inside us yes youve described it exactly said george goodness when i put my hand on timmy i can feel him doing the shudders and its just like putting my hand on something working by electricity you know the sort of small vibrations you feel then its gone said dick just as george finished speaking im not shuddering any more it suddenly stopped and i cant hear that grumbling faroff noise now can you everyone agreed that both the noise and the shuddering had stopped what in the wide world could it be it must be something to do with that curious shimmering i saw in the sky over old towers hill tonight said dick remembering ive a good mind to go and look out of the window that faces the hill opposite and see if its there again he leapt out of his bunk and ran to the window at once he gave a loud cry come and look whew just come and look all the others timmy as well rushed to the window at once timmy standing on his hind legs to see certainly there was something queer to look at over the hill opposite hung a mist a curious glowing mist that stood out in the pitch black darkness of the night it swirled heavily not lightly as a mist usually does look at that said anne in wonder what a strange colour not red not yellow not orange what colour is it its not a shade ive ever seen before said julian rather solemnly i call this jolly strange whats happening here no wonder ailys mother told us those stories theres really something in them wed better make a few enquiries tomorrow its funny that both the shimmering i saw and that cloud too are over old towers hill said dick you dont think its something thats happening in old towers house do you no of course not said julian what could happen there that would make us feel the effects here in this hut that queer shuddering for instance and how in the world could we hear a rumbling from a mile or so away if it were not thunder and that certainly wasnt the mist is going said anne look its changing colour no its just going darker its gone they stood looking out for a short while longer and then julian felt anne shivering violently beside him youre frozen he said come on back to bed you dont want to get another awful cold and cough my word this is all very queer but i expect theres a sensible explanation probably there are mines around here and work is being done at night as well as day well find out said dick and they all climbed thankfully back into their bunks feeling very cold julian turned up the stove a little more to heat the room better george cuddled timmy and was soon as warm as toast but the others lay awake trying to get their cold hands and feet warm again julian felt very puzzled so there was a lot of truth in that womans peculiar tale after all they awoke late the next morning for they had been tired out with their exertions the day before and with the excitements in the night julian leapt out of his bunk when he found that it was actually ten to nine and dressed quickly calling to the others he went out to get some snow to put into the kettle soon breakfast was ready for anne was next to get up and she began quickly to prepare some food boiled eggs and ham bread butter and jam and good hot cocoa again soon they were all eating and chattering talking over the happenings of the night which somehow didnt seem nearly so remarkable now that daylight was everywhere brilliant with the snow and the sun trying to come out from behind the clouds as they sat round the table eating and talking timmy ran to the door and began to bark now whats up said dick then a face looked in at the window it was a remarkable face old lined and wrinkled yet curiously younglooking too the eyes were as blue as a summer sky it was a mans face with a long raggedy beard and a moustache gracious he looks like one of the old prophets out of the bible said anne really startled who is he the shepherd i expect said julian going to the door well ask him in for a cup of cocoa maybe he can answer a few questions for us he opened the door are you the shepherd he said come in were having breakfast and we can give you some too if you like the shepherd came in and smiled making many more wrinkles appear on his weatherbeaten face julian wondered if he spoke english or only welsh he was a finelooking fellow tall and straight and obviously much younger than he looked you are kind young sir he said standing there with his crook and anne suddenly felt that there must have been men just like this all through the history of the world ever since there had been sheep on the hills and men to watch them the shepherd spoke slowly for english words were not easy to him you want to send to send words to the farm he said in the lilting welsh voice so pleasant to hear oh yes please take a message to the farm said julian handing him some bread and butter and a dish of cheese just say were fine and all is well all is well all is well repeated the shepherd and refused the bread and cheese no i do not eat now but the drink yes i will have and thanking you i am for the morning is cold shepherd said julian did you hear queer noises last night rumblings and grumblings and did you feel shudderings and see a coloured mist over the hill yonder the shepherd listened intently trying to follow the strange english words he understood that julian was asking him something about the opposite hill he took a sip of his cocoa and looked over to the hill always it has been a strange hill he said slowly pronouncing some of his words queerly so that they were hard to understand my grandad told me a big dog lay below growling for food and my granny said witches lived there and made their spells and and the smock rose up smock what does he mean by that said george he means smoke i should think said julian dont interrupt let him talk this is very interesting the smock rose up and we saw it in the sky went on the shepherd his forehead wrinkled with the effort of using words he was not familiar with and it comes still young ones it comes still the big dog he growls the witches they cook in their pots and the smock it rises we heard the big dog growling last night and saw the witches smoke said anne quite under the spell of the lilting voice of the old shepherd the man looked at her and smiled yes he said yes but the dog is worse now and the witches are more bad more wickit much more wickit more wicked said julian how the shepherd shook his head i am not clever he said i know few things my sheep and the wind and the sky and i know too that the hill is wickit yes more wickit near it you must not go young ones for there the plough will not plough the fields the spade will not dig and neither will the fork this somehow sounded so much like a piece out of the old testament that the children felt quite solemn what a strange and impressive old man and yet he was only a shepherd still thought julian gazing at him he has absolutely nothing to do but think long long thoughts all the hours he sits watching his sheep no wonder he says extraordinary things but what does he mean about the plough not ploughing the fields i wonder the shepherd put his cup down on the table i go now he said and i take your words to mrs jones and i thank you for your kindness good day he went out with great dignity and the children saw him striding past the window his beard being blown backwards by the wind well said dick what a character i almost felt that i was in church listening to a preacher i liked him didnt you but what did he mean about ploughs not ploughing and spades not digging thats nonsense well it may not be said julian after all we know that our car wouldnt go down that hill fast and you remember that ailys mother the shepherds wife said that the postman had to leave his bicycle at the bottom of the hill even that wouldnt work so its quite likely that in the old days ploughs went too heavily and too slowly to plough properly and that spades were the same but why said anne puzzled surely you dont really believe these things i know our car went crawling down but that might have been because something went wrong in its works for a little while anne doesnt want to believe in ploughs and spades and forks that wont do their jobs said dick teasingly come on lets forget the queer happenings last night and put on our skis i feel pretty stiff after yesterday but a bit of skiing down those slopes will do me good what about it yes come on said julian buck up with the clearing away anne dick and i will get out the skis hurry chapter twelve out on the hills timmy didnt find skiing any fun at all because not being fitted with skis he couldnt keep up with the others when they tore down the hill at top speed at first he plunged after them but when he jumped into a great soft heap of snow and buried himself completely he decided that this kind of winter sport was not for him he clambered out of the snowheap shook the snow off his coat and stared forlornly after the shouting children they had skied before and were quite good at it the hill down which they went was very long and had a fine slope it ran smoothly into the upward slope of the next hill on which old towers house had been built julian did a marvellous run down and went swinging on up the opposite hill he called to the others i say what about going up to the top of this hill because were already part of the way up and skiing down and partly up our own slope again it would save time and give us a jolly good second skirun all but anne thought this was a very good idea she said nothing and dick looked at her shes scared of going up old towers hill he said are you afraid of the big big dog anne who lies under it and growls at night or of the lankhaired witches that sit on the hill and make their smoky spells dont be silly said anne cross with dick for reading her thoughts she didnt believe in either dog or witches but somehow she did not like that hill im coming too of course so she toiled up the opposite hill with the others quite ready to enjoy the lovely run down and to end halfway up their own hill look you can see old towers quite clearly now said george to julian she was right there not far off was the great old house set with towers built cosily into the side of the steep hill they stood still and looked at it we can even see down into a few of the rooms said julian i wonder if the old lady is still there mrs thomas the one that ailys mother used to go and work for poor old thing im sorry for her if she is said george seeing nobody keeping out all her friends i wish we could go and enquire at the house for something pretend weve lost our way and snoop round a bit but theres that fierce dog yes we dont want any more fights said julian now were almost at the top well wait for the others and then have a race what a wonderful slope julian look is that someone at one of the tower windows the one to the right said george suddenly as they stood waiting looking down at the big old house some way off below them julian looked at the tower at once just in time to see someone disappear yes it was someone he said someone staring at us i think i expect no one ever comes near this hill and it must have been a surprise to look out and see us did you make out if it was a man or a woman a woman i think said george could it have been old mrs thomas do you think oh ju you dont suppose shes being kept prisoner in that tower do you while her horrid son and his friends gradually steal everything you know we heard that vans went up to the house in the middle of the night hallo you two said dick labouring up with anne what a climb still the run down will be worth it i simply must have a rest first though dick george and i thought we saw someone at the tower window there the one on the right said julian when we get back well get our fieldglasses and train them on to that window we might possibly see some sign of anyone there dick and anne stared hard at the tower window and as they looked someone drew the curtains swiftly across there weve been seen and were not going to be encouraged to look at the old place said julian no wonder there are queer stories about it come on now lets start our run down they set off together each taking a different line whooooooosh the wind blew in their faces as they flew down the white slope gasping in delight at their speed julian and anne slid swiftly all the way down the first slope and halfway up the next but dick and george were not so fortunate they both caught their skis in something and shot into the air and then down into the soft snow they lay there breathless almost dazed with the sudden stoppage whew said dick at last what a shock is that you george are you all right i think so said george one ankle feels a bit queer no i think its all right hallo heres tim he must have seen us fall and come rushing down to help its all right tim were not hurt its all part of the fun as they lay there getting their breath halfway down the first slope a loud voice shouted in the distance hey there you keep off this slope dick sat up straight at once he saw a tall fellow wading through the snow towards them from the direction of old towers looking angry were only skiing shouted back dick and were not doing any harm who are you im the caretaker shouted the man nodding his head towards old towers this field belongs to the house so keep off it well come and ask permission of the owners yelled dick standing up thinking this might be a good way of having a look at the house you cant theres no one else here but me shouted back the man im the caretaker i tell you ill set my dog on you all if you dont do what i say thats funny said dick to george as the man waded back through the snow he says hes the only one in the house and yet we saw someone in the righthand tower only a few minutes ago the caretaker wouldnt have had time to have got here from the tower so he isnt the only one in the house there is someone in the tower as well queer isnt it george had held timmy by the collar all the time the man was speaking timmy had growled at the mans angry voice and george was afraid he might fly at him then if the other dog appeared there might be a fight that would be dreadful timmy might get bitten again she and dick tried their skis to see if they were still properly fixed after their fall and then went smoothly gliding off again the others were waiting at the top of the hill for them who was that man what was he shouting about demanded julian did he actually come from old towers yes and a surly fellow he was too said dick he ordered us to keep off that slope said it belonged to old towers and he was the caretaker and when we said wed go and ask permission from the owners he said he was the only one in the house but we know different yes we do said julian puzzled why should it matter to anyone if we ski down that particular slope are they afraid we might see something in the house as we did and why tell a lie and say there was no one else there did he sound like a caretaker well he didnt sound welsh said george and i should have thought that any owners would have chosen someone trustworthy from the village someone welsh wouldnt you this is all rather mysterious and if you add to it all the strange noises and things its extremely curious said dick in fact i feel it might be worth enquiring into no said anne dont lets spoil our holiday its such a short one well i dont see how we can enquire into the matter said george im certainly not going to that house while the dog is there and theres no other way of making enquiries even if they would get us anywhere which im pretty sure they wouldnt i say do you know that its almost one oclock said anne pleased to change the subject isnt anybody hungry yes im ravenous said julian but as i thought it was only about halfpast eleven i didnt like to mention it lets go in and have dinner i vote we finish up that ham they went to the hut and there standing in the snow outside it were two quart bottles of milk and a large parcel which timmy at once went to wagging his tail eagerly he gave a little bark he says its meat so it must be for him said george with a laugh julian tore off the paper and laughed too well timmys right he said its a big piece of cold roast pork no ham for me then ill have some of this pity we havent any apple sauce said dick i love it with pork well if you like to wait while i make some on the stove with a few of the apples we brought began anne but the others refused at once no one was going to wait one minute longer for their meal than they could help apple sauce or not it was a merry meal and certainly the pork was good timmy had a piece and thought that george was very mean not to give him the rest of the joint when they had finished with it oh no tim said george as he put an enquiring paw on her knee certainly not were going to finish it up tomorrow you shall have the bone then theres more snow coming said julian looking out of the window i say who brought the meat and the milk here do you think the shepherd i should imagine on his way back said dick jolly nice of him i wonder where that kid aily is id be scared of her getting caught in the snow and having to sleep on the hills in it i expect shell look after herself all right and her lamb and dog said julian id like to see her again but unless shes hungry i dont expect we shall talk of an angel and hear the rustle of her wings said anne here she is and sure enough there was aily looking in at the window holding up her lamb for him to take a peep too lets get her in and feed her and ask her if she knows who lives in old towers said george she might have seen someone in that righthand tower too as we did right ill call her in said julian going to the door she might know something always scouring round about the countryside he was right aily did know something something that interested everyone very much chapter thirteen aily is surprising aily was not shy this time she did not run away when julian opened the door she was still dressed in the same few clothes but her face glowed and she certainly didnt look cold hallo aily said julian come along in were having dinner and there is plenty for you the dog ran right up to the door and into the room when he smelt the dinner there timmy looked most surprised and gave a very small growl no tim no hes your guest said george remember your manners please the small dog wagged his tail vigorously there timmy hes telling you not to be afraid of him he wont hurt you said anne which made everyone laugh timmy wagged his tail vigorously too and the pair were friends at once aily came in then the lamb in her arms in case timmy might object to him but timmy didnt he was very interested in the little creature and when aily set him down and let him run about the room timmy ran sniffing after him his tail still wagging fast anne offered the untidy little girl some of the meat but she shook her head and pointed at the cheese aily like she said and looked on in delight as anne cut her a generous piece she sat down on the floor to eat it and the lamb came along and nibbled at it too it really was a dear little thing fany bach said the child and kissed his little nose bach is welsh for dear isnt it said anne she touched aily on the arm aily bach she said and the child smiled a sudden sweet smile at her where did you sleep last night aily asked george your mother was looking for you but she had spoken too quickly and aily didnt understand george repeated her words slowly aily nodded in the hay she said down at magga farm aily listen who lives at old towers asked julian speaking as slowly and clearly as he could many peoples said aily pointing to the cheese to show that she wanted another piece big mans little mans big dog too more big than him and she pointed at timmy the others looked at one another in surprise many men whatever were they doing at old towers and yet that caretaker fellow said he was the only one there said george aily listen is there an old lady there asked julian slowly an old lady aily nodded her head yes one old lady i see her high up in tower sometime she not see aily aily hide where do you hide asked dick curiously aily not tell never not tell said the child looking through halfclosed eyes at dick as if she kept her secrets behind them did you see the old lady when you were in the fields asked julian aily considered this and shook her head well where then asked julian look you shall have some of this chocolate if you can tell me he held the bar of chocolate just out of her reach she looked at it with bright eyes obviously chocolate was a rare treat for her she reached out suddenly for it but julian was too quick for her no you tell me what i ask you he said then you shall have the chocolate aily suddenly hit out with her hands and gave him a good punch in the chest he laughed and took both her small hands in his big one no aily no i am your friend you do not hit a friend i know where you were when you saw the old lady said dick slyly aily you were in the grounds in the garden how you know cried aily she dragged her hands out of julians hand and leapt to her feet facing dick looking furious and frightened here dont get so upset said dick astonished how you know demanded aily again you not tell no one of course ive told no one said dick who had only just thought of the idea that very moment aha so you get into the grounds of old towers do you how do you get in aily not tell said the little girl and suddenly burst into tears anne put her arm round her to comfort her but the child pushed it roughly away he dave went there not me not aily poor dave big dog bark wuffwuff like that and and and so you went in to get dave didnt you said dick good little aily brave aily the little girl rubbed her tears away with a grubby hand and left black streaks down her cheeks she smiled at dick and nodded good aily she repeated and took the little dog on her knee and hugged him poor dave bach so she got into the grounds did she said julian in a low voice to dick i wonder how through the hedge perhaps aily we want to see this old lady can we get through the hedge round the garden no said aily shaking her head vigorously fence there big high fence that bites everyone laughed at the idea of a biting fence but george guessed what she meant an electric fence she said so thats what theyve put round my word the place is like a fort locked gates a fierce dog an electric fence how on earth did aily get in then said dick aily have you seen this old woman many times has she seen you aily didnt understand and he had to ask his questions again more simply the child nodded her head many times aily see her up high and one time she see aily she throw out papers little bits out of the window aily did you pick them up said julian sitting up straight at once was there writing on them everyone waited for ailys answers she nodded her head yes writings like they do at school pen writings did you read any of them asked dick aily suddenly wore a hunted expression she shook her head then she nodded it yes aily read them she said they say good morning aily how are you aily does the old woman know you then asked dick surprised no she not know aily only ailys mam said the child she say on her papers aily you good girl aily you very good shes not telling the truth now said dick noticing that the child would not look at them when she spoke i wonder why i think i know said anne she took a piece of paper and wrote on it clearly good morning aily then she showed it to the child read that aily she said but aily couldnt she had no idea what was written on the paper she cant even read said anne and she was ashamed so she pretended she could never mind aily listen have you any of those bits of paper that the old woman dropped aily felt about in her few clothes and at last produced a piece of paper that looked as if it had been tom from the top of a page in a book she gave it to dick all the four bent over it reading what was written there in small rather illegible writing i want help i am a prisoner here in my own house while terrible things go on they have killed my son help me help me bronwen thomas good gracious said julian very startled i say this is extraordinary isnt it do you think we ought to show it to the police well there is probably only one policeman shared between three or four of these little places said dick and theres another thing the old lady might be off her head you know what she says may not be true how can we possibly find out if it is or not said george dick turned to aily aily we want to see the old lady we want to take her something nice to eat she is all by herself she is sad will you show us the way into the grounds no said aily shaking her head vigorously big dog there dog with teeth like this and she bared her own small white teeth and snarled much to timmys astonishment the children laughed well we cant make her tell us said julian and anyway even if we got into the grounds that dog would be there and i dont fancy him somehow aily show you way into house suddenly said the small girl much to everyones astonishment they all stared at her into the house said dick but youd have to show us the way into the grounds first if we are to get into the house aily no said aily shaking her head aily show you way to house aily do that no big dog there just then timmy began to bark and someone came by the door looking in as she passed it was ailys mother who had again been to take some things to her shepherd husband she saw aily sitting on the floor and gave an angry shout then standing at the door she poured out a long string of welsh words which the children didnt understand in a great fright aily ran straight to a cupboard her dog and lamb with her but it was no good her mother stormed into the hut and dragged aily out shaking her well timmy growled but ailys little dog was as frightened as she was and the lamb bleated pitifully in the childs arms i take aily home said her angry mother glaring at the four children as if she thought they were responsible for the childs keeping away from home i whip her well and out she went holding the protesting child firmly by one arm the children could do nothing after all she was ailys mother and the child really was a little monkey the way she wandered round the country you know i think wed better go down to the farm and tell morgan what we know said julian making up his mind i really do if this thing is serious and if the old lady is really a prisoner i dont see how we can do a thing but morgan might be able to hed know the police for one thing come on lets go down now we can stay at the farm for the night if it gets dark buck up lets go straightaway chapter fourteen morgan is surprising too george did not particularly want to go down to the farm as she was afraid of timmy meeting the farm dogs again and being attacked julian saw her doubtful face and understood would you like to stay here by yourself with timmy george till we come back he said you should be all right with tim hell look after you the only thing is will you be scared if any more rumblings and shudderings and shimmerings come again tonight ill stay with george said anne it would really be best if you two boys went alone im a bit tired and i dont think i could go as fast as youd want to right then dick and i will go together and leave you two girls here with timmy said julian come on dick if we hurry we might get back before dark they set off together and went swiftly down the winding mountain path still white with snow they were glad when at last they saw the farmhouse a light was already in the kitchen and looked very welcoming they went in at the front door and made their way to the big kitchen where mrs jones was washing up at the sink she turned in astonishment when they came in stamping the snow from their shoes well now this is a surprise she said drying her hands on a towel is there something wrong where are the girls theyre up at the hut theyre fine said julian you have come for something more to eat said mrs jones feeling certain this was the reason for their sudden visit no thank you weve got plenty said julian we just wondered if we could talk to your son morgan we well weve got something to tell him something rather urgent well now what could that be said mrs jones all curiosity at once let me see yes morgan will be up at the big barn she pointed out of the window where a big and picturesque old barn stood outlined against the evening sky it is there you will find my morgan you will be staying the night now will you not you will like supper a good supper well yes we should said julian suddenly realising that they had missed out tea altogether thanks awfully well just go and find morgan they made their way out to the big old barn morgans three dogs at once ran out when they heard strange footsteps and growled but they recognised the boys immediately and leapt round them barking the giantlike morgan came out to see what the dogs were barking about he was surprised to find the two boys there fondling the dogs hey he said questioningly anything wrong we think there is said julian may we tell you about it morgan took them into the almost dark barn he had been raking it over and he went on with his raking as julian began his tale its about old towers said julian and morgan stopped his raking at once but he went on again almost immediately listening without a word julian told him his story he told him about the noises of rumbling the shimmering in the sky that dick had seen the shuddering they had all felt then about the old woman they had seen in the tower and how aily had told of the pieces of paper and shown them one which proved that old mrs thomas was a prisoner in her own house for the first time morgan spoke and where is this paper he asked in his deep bass voice julian produced it and handed it over morgan lighted a lamp to look at it for it was now practically dark he read it and put it into his pocket id rather like it back said julian surprised unless you want it to show the police what do you think about it all and is there anything we can do i dont like to think of i will tell you what you are to do said morgan you are to leave it to me morgan jones you are but children you know nothing this matter is not for children i can tell you that you must go back to the hut and you must forget all you have heard and all you have seen and if aily comes again you must bring her down here to me and i will talk to her his voice was so hard and determined that the two boys were startled and shocked but mr morgan said julian arent you going to do anything about this go to the police or i have told you this is not a matter for children said morgan i will say no more you will go back to the hut and you will say nothing to anyone if you are not willing to do this you will go home tomorrow with that the giant of a man put his rake over his shoulder and left the two boys alone in the barn what do you make of that said julian very angry come on well go back to the hut im not going to the farm for supper i dont feel as though i want to meet that rude dour morgan again this evening feeling angry and disappointed the boys made their way out of the barn towards the path that led up to the hill it was almost dark now and julian felt in his pocket for his torch blow i didnt bring it with me he said have you one dick dick hadnt one either and as neither of them felt like making their way up the mountainside in the darkness julian decided to go back to the farm slip up to his bedroom there and find the extra torch he had put in one of the drawers come along he said to dick well try and get in and out without seeing morgan or old mrs jones they went quietly back to the farmhouse keeping a lookout for morgan julian slipped up the stone stairway to the bedroom he had been given a few nights before and rummaged in the drawer for his torch good there it was he went downstairs again and bumped into old mrs jones at the bottom she gave a little scream oh tis you julian bach now what have you been telling my morgan to put him into such a temper enough to turn the milk sour his face is wait now while i get you some supper would you like some pork and well weve decided to go back to the hut after all said julian hoping that the kind old woman wouldnt be upset the girls are alone you know and its dark now oh yes yes then you shall go back said mrs jones wait for one minute you shall have some of my new bread and some more pie wait now the boys stood in the doorway waiting hoping that morgan would not come by they sudclcnly heard him in the distance yelling at a dog in his loud really fierce voice taking it out on the dogs i suppose said julian to dick gosh i wouldnt like to come up against him if i was one of his men strong giant that he is he could take on a dozen men if he wanted to or a score of dogs mrs morgan came up with a net bag full of food here you are she said take care of those girls and dont go near morgan now hes in a fine temper is my morgan and he is not nice to hear the two boys thoroughly agreed morgan was not nice to hear they were glad when they were away up the path out of reach of his enormous voice well thats that said julian no help to be got from this quarter and were forbidden to do anything at all about the matter as if we were kids he kept telling us we were only children said dick sounding disgusted i cant make it out ju why was he so annoyed about it all didnt he believe us oh yes he believed us all right said julian if you ask me i think he knows much much more than we were able to tell him theres some kind of racket going on at old towers something queer and underhand and morgan is in it thats why he shut us up and told us not to interfere and to forget all about it hes in whatevers going on im sure of it dick whistled my word so thats why he was so angry he thought we might be putting a spoke in his wheel and of course the last thing he would want us to do would be to go to the police well whatever do we do next ju i dont know well have to talk it over with the girls said julian worried this would crop up just when were all set for a jolly holiday julian what do you think is going on at old towers asked dick puzzled i mean it isnt only a question of locking up an old lady in a tower and selling off her goods and taking the money its all the other things too the rumblings and shudderings and that queer mist well apparently those things have been going on for some time said julian they may have nothing whatever to do with what morgan is mixed up in which is im sure to do with robbing the old lady in fact those old tales may be a very good way of keeping people away from the place in these country places people are much more afraid of strange happenings than townspeople are it all sounds very convincing when you put it like that said dick but somehow i dont feel convinced i just cant help feeling theres something queer about it all something we dont know they fell silent after that walking one behind the other on the mountain path seeing the big black stones looming up one after the other in the light of julians torch it seemed a long long way in the dark much longer than in the daylight but at last they saw the light in the window of the hut thank goodness they were both very hungry now and were glad that mrs jones had presented them with more food they could really tuck in timmy barked as soon as they came near and george let him out of the door she knew by his bark that it was the boys coming back oh we are glad you came back instead of staying down at the farm cried anne what happened is morgan going to the police no said julian he was angry he told us not to interfere he took that bit of paper with the message on and never gave it back to us we think hes mixed up with whatever is going on very well then said george at once well take up the matter ourselves well find out whats going on and most certainly well get poor old mrs thomas out of that tower i dont know how but well do it wont we timmy chapter fifteen whats up tim the four children sat and talked for a long time sitting round the little oilstove eating a good supper what would be the best thing to do it was all very well for george to flare up and say they would see to things they would rescue the old lady from the tower but how could they even begin to do anything for one thing they didnt know how to get into the house no one was going to risk a battle with that fierce dog if only that kid aily would help us said julian at last shes really our only hope its no good going to the police it would take us ages to go down to the village at the bottom of the mountain and find out where the nearest police station is and wed never get a village policeman to believe our tale i wonder the villagers dont do something about old towers said dick puzzled i mean all those peculiar vibrations we felt last night and the noises we heard and the light in the sky when that mist hung over the place yes but i suppose all those things are seen and heard up here in the mountains much more clearly than down in the valley below said anne sensibly i dont expect that queer shuddering would be felt in the valley nor would the rumblings be heard and even the strange mist over old towers might not be seen thats true said julian i never thought of that yes we up here would see a lot and possibly the shepherd higher up on the hills would as well i dare say the farm down below us would see something too well we know they did because of morgans behaviour to us tonight he obviously knew what we were talking about hes also obviously hand in glove with the men in that place the big men and little men that aily spoke of gosh i wish shed show us how to get into that house how does she get in im blowed if i can think of any way with that electric fence all round it sounds impossible the fence that bites said george with a laugh fancy that child touching the fence and getting a shock shes an extraordinary little creature isnt she quite wild i hope she didnt get a whipping said anne she is a naughty little truant of course but you cant help liking her does anybody want more cheese and there are still some apples left or i could open a tin of pears i vote for the pears said dick i feel like something really sweet i say this stay up here is turning out rather exciting isnt it we always seem to run into trouble said anne going to the cupboard to fetch the tin of pears give it a better name anne old thing said dick adventure thats what were always running into some people do you know they just cant help it and were those sort of people jolly good thing too it makes life exciting timmy suddenly began to bark and everyone started up at once now what was up let timmy out said dick with all these queer goingson i feel as if it would be just as well to let tim examine anyone coming by here at night right said george and went to the door but as she was about to open it she heard a dog barking outside just beyond the hut she swung round im not letting timmy out that might be morgan with his dogs i seem to recognise that deep bark someones coming by said anne half scared my word it is morgan so it was he passed by the window and they saw his great shoulders and head bent against the wind as he went on up the hill he didnt even glance in at them but the three dogs who were with him began to bark furiously as they sensed another dog in the hut timmy barked back furiously too then all was quiet morgan had gone by and the dogs with him whew im glad you didnt let tim out as i suggested said dick hed have been torn to pieces where do you suppose morgans going asked anne its funny he should be going up the hill not even in the direction of old towers probably going to talk to the shepherd said julian hes farther up the hill with his sheep i say i wonder if hes in this too oh no said anne hes good i could feel it in my bones i cant imagine him mixed up with a gang of any sort nobody could of course they had all liked the shepherd but why else would morgan be going up to him at this time of night he might be going to tell him that we know too much suggested julian he might ask him to keep an eye on us or he might be going to complain of aily and her doings inside the grounds of old towers said dick goodness do you suppose that kid will get into trouble because we told morgan about her and gave him the bit of paper she found they all stared at one another in dismay anne nodded soberly yes thats it of course aily will certainly get into trouble over this oh why did we think of telling morgan what we knew poor little aily they all felt very uncomfortable about aily they liked the wild fey little creature with her pet lamb and little dog now perhaps she would be well beaten because of what they had told morgan none of them felt like playing cards just then they sat and talked wondering if they would hear morgan coming back they knew timmy would bark if he did sure enough he began to bark about halfpast eight and made them all jump that will be morgan coming back said julian and they watched the window to see if his head and shoulders would pass by again but they didnt neither did any dog bark outside then george saw that timmy was sitting with his ears pricked up and his head on one side why and if he could really hear something why didnt he bark again she was puzzled look at tim she said hes heard something and yet hes not barking and he doesnt look very worried either whats up tim timmy took no notice he sat there listening intently still with his head on one side what could he hear it was most tantalising to the others because not one of them could hear anything at all the countryside seemed to be absolutely quiet at that moment then suddenly tim jumped up and barked joyfully he ran to the door and whined scraping at the bottom of it with his paw he looked back at george and barked again as if to say buck up open the door well said dick in surprise whats up timmy has your best friend come to call shall we open the door julian ill go said julian and went to open the door cautiously timmy leapt out at once barking and whining theres nobody here said julian astonished nobody at all hey tim whats all the fuss about give me that torch dick will you ill go out after him and see what the excitement is out he went and flashed the torch around to find timmy ah there he was scraping at the little wooden bunker that held the oilcans and the big enamel jug julian was astonished whatevers come over you tim he said theres nothing here in this bunker look ill lift the lid so that you can peep inside and see silly dog he lifted up the lid and shone his torch inside to show timmy that it was empty but it wasnt julian almost let the lid drop down in his surprise someone was there someone small and halffrozen it was aily aily said julian hardly believing his eyes what on earth aily what are you doing here aily blinked up at him looking scared to death she clutched the lamb and the dog and didnt say a word julian saw that she was shivering and crying bitterly poor little aily bach he said using the only welsh word he knew come into the hut well get you warm and make you better the child shook her head and clutched her animals closer but julian was not going to leave her there in the little oilbunker on that cold night he lifted her up animals and all and cuddled her aily strove to get free but his arms were strong and held her close georges voice came impatiently from the hut ju tim where are you have you found anything yes called back julian we have were bringing it along its quite a surprise he carried the shivering child into the hut and the others stared in the utmost astonishment aily a cold forlorn and miserable little aily pale and shivering and the lamb and dog too bring her near the stove said anne and stroked the childs thin arm poor aily julian tried to set her down and the animals as well but she clung to him she sensed that he was good and kind and strong and his arms were very comforting julian sat down on a chair still holding the little creature closely the dog and lamb slid off his knee and ran sniffing round the room she was in the oilbunker out there she and the lamb and dog he said all cuddled up together partly hiding i should think and partly for shelter maybe shes slept there before with these two isnt she a poor little mite she seems very unhappy lets give her something to eat ill make some hot cocoa said anne george get some bread and butter and cheese for her and hadnt we better get the lamb and dog something too what do you give lambs milk out of a bottle said dick but we havent got a feedingbottle i dare say it will lap milk good gracious the things that happen here aily felt warm and comforted in julians arms she lay there like a little animal too cold and tired to be scared julian was glad to hold her and comfort her poor little thing what had made her come this long way so late at night she must have gone home with her mother he said watching the little dog hobnobbing with a delighted timmy and probably got a whipping and was shut up somewhere and then my guess is that morgan went down to see if she was there and to scold her and tell her mother to be sure and not let her out and morgan repeated aily sitting up in fear looking all round as if he might be there morgan no no its all right little thing said julian well look after you morgan shant get you see he said to the others i bet im right it was he who went and scared her and as soon as he was gone i expect she escaped from her mothers house and came up here to hide that horrible fellow if he shouted at her as he shouted at us shed be scared stiff i bet he was afraid shed go and give more of the game away unless she was shut up might even show us the way into the old house over on the opposite hill timmy suddenly gave a bark but not a joyful one this time anne cried out at once that may be morgan coming back hide aily for goodness sake or hell drag her out of here and take her back with him quick where shall we hide her chapter sixteen aily changes her mind aily leapt out of julians arms as quickly and surely as a cat when she heard that it might be morgan coming she looked round the room like a hunted thing and then darted to the bunkbeds with an amazing leap she was up on one of the top ones in a trice and pulled a rug over her she lay absolutely still the lamb looked up in surprise and bleated then it too leapt up the bunks as surefooted as a goat and cuddled down with its little mistress only dave the dog was left below whining miserably gosh said dick amazed at these incredibly sudden happenings look at that did you ever see such leaping shut up barking tim we want to hear if morgan is coming ju where shall we hide ailys dog he mustnt be seen or heard either julian lifted the dog up to the top bunk and put him with the other two there thats about the only place where hell keep quiet he said aily lie quite still till we tell you everything is safe there was no reply from the bunk not a word or a bark or a bleat then timmy began to bark loudly again and ran to the door im going to lock the door said julian im not having morgan and his dogs in here hunting for aily my guess is that he knows shes escaped from her mothers or maybe she ran off when he scolded her and thinks she went to her father the old shepherd hes got to get hold of her to stop her from spreading what she knows well for goodness sake dont let those dogs in here said george desperately i can hear them barking away in the distance quick lets sit round the table with the cards and pretend to be playing a game said dick snatching the cards from a shelf then if morgan looks in hell think everything is normal and wont guess weve got aily here i bet hell be sly enough to try and peep in without us seeing him hoping to spot aily if weve got her they sat round the table and dick dealt out the cards annes hands were trembling and george felt a bit weak at the knees anne kept dropping her cards and dick laughed at her butterfingers cheer up morgan wont eat you now if i suddlenly say what ho youll know i can see morgan peeping in at the window and you must laugh and play like anything see dick was the one facing the window and he kept a sharp eye on it as they played snap there was no sound of dogs barking now though tim sat by the door his ears cocked as if he could hear something snap said julian and gathered up the cards they went on playing snap i say dont grab like that youve almost broken my nail snap i said it first what ho said dick and that put everyone on their guard at once they went on playing but without giving much attention to the game now what could dick see dick could see quite a lot he could see a shadowy face some way from the window looking in yes it was morgan all right what ho said dick again to warn the others that there was still danger what ho morgans face had now come quite near to the window he evidently thought that no one saw him and that they were all too engrossed in their game to notice anything else his eyes swept the room from corner to corner then his face disappeared hes gone from the window said dick in a low voice but go on playing he may come to the door knock knock yes there he is said dick ju you take charge now whos there yelled julian morgan let me in said morgans deep growling voice no weve got our dog here and we dont want him set on again said julian determined not to let morgan in at any cost morgan turned the handle but the door was locked he growled again sorry but we cant unlock it shouted julian our dog might rush out and bite you hes growling like anything already bark tim said george in a low voice and timmy obligingly barked the place down morgan gave up if you see aily send her home he said shes gone again and her mams worried ive been looking for her this cold night right called julian if she comes well give her a bed here no you send her home shouted morgan and pay heed to what i told you down at the barn there or it will be the worse for all of us for all of us i like that said dick in disgust it will certainly be the worse for him and his friends when the secrets out awful fellow has he gone tim timmy came away from the door and lay down peacefully he gave a little bark as if to say all clear when dogs began to bark right away in the distance tim took no notice that means theyre going down the hill with morgan back to the farm said george thankfully we can get aily down now and give her something to eat she went to the bunk aily she called morgan is gone gone right away come down and have a meal we will give the lamb some milk and your dog some meat and biscuits ailys head peered cautiously over the side of the little bunkbed with a leap she was down on the floor as lightly as the lamb itself which followed at once landing squarely on its four tiny hooves the little dog had to be lifted out he was much too scared to jump to everyones amusement aily ran straight to julian and held up her arms to be taken into his she felt safe with this big kind boy he sat down with her on his knees and she cuddled up to him like a kitten george put some bread and butter and cheese on the table in front of her and anne put down a dish of milk for the lamb which lapped it greedily but most untidily the dog tried to get the milk too but soon went to the dish of cutup meat and biscuits put down by anne there the ailyfamily is fed she said my word what an excitement all this is julian dont let aily gobble like that shell be sick i never did see anyone eat so quickly she cant have had anything since the bit of cheese we gave her this afternoon aily snuggled back into julians arms contentedly when she had eaten every scrap of her meal she looked up at him wanting to please him aily tell how to get into big big house she said suddenly taking everyone completely by surprise julian looked down at her he had the dog on his knee now too though he would not allow the lamb to climb on as well aily tell me he said gravely good little aily bach aily began to try and tell him big hole she began down down down wheres this big hole asked julian high up said aily down it goes down but where is it asked julian again aily went off into a long jabber of welsh and the children listened helplessly how maddening to have aily willing to tell them her secret and then not to be able to follow what she said good little aily said julian when she came to a stop at last where is this big big hole aily gazed at him in reproach aily tell you tell you tell you she said yes i know but i dont understand welsh said julian gently despairing of trying to make the child understand where is this big hole thats all i want to know aily stared at him then she smiled aily show she said and slipped off his knee aily show come good gracious not now said julian not in all this snow and darkness no aily tomorrow in the morning not now aily took a look out of the window into the darkness she nodded not now in the morning yes aily show in morning well thank goodness thats settled said julian id dearly love to see this big big hole whatever it is now straightaway but wed only get lost on these hills in the dark well look forward to it tomorrow good said dick yawning i must say that i think thats best too what a bit of luck that ailys so grateful to you ju i believe shed do anything in the world for you now i believe she would too funny little creature said julian looking at aily as she curled up on the rug near the stove with her lamb and dog beside her how could morgan scare such a harmless little thing hes a brute jolly good thing he didnt see her when he looked in said george hed probably have broken the door down one blow of his fist and it would have cracked from top to bottom everyone laughed well good thing it didnt come to that said julian now then lets get to bed we may have quite an exciting day tomorrow i hope we manage to get to that poor old woman in her tower said anne thats the most important thing to do aily you can sleep in that topmost bunk where you hid ill give you some rugs and a blanket and a pillow it wasnt long before the hut was quiet and peaceful with all five children in their bunks and timmy with george the lamb and the little dog were with aily julian looked out from his bunk and smiled what a collection of people and animals in the hut tonight well he was quite glad there were two dogs no one woke in the night except george she felt timmy stir and sat up resting on her elbow but he didnt bark he gave her a small lick and sat with her listening the queer rumbling noise was coming again and then the shuddering though not so strongly as before george felt the wooden edge of her bunk it vibrated as if machinery was in the room below shaking everything a little she leaned out of her bunk and looked out of the window her eyes widened as she saw what dick had seen the other night the shimmering in the sky she could think of no other name for that strange quivering that rose and rose and finally ended very high up indeed seeming to lose itself in the stars that were now shining brightly george didnt wake the others as soon as the queer happenings stopped she lay down again perhaps tomorrow they would know what caused such strange things yes tomorrow would be very exciting chapter seventeen the big big hole next morning everyone was awake early they had slept well and were full of beans and excited to think that an adventure lay ahead to get into that old house with its many secrets would be marvellous aily followed julian about the room like a little dog she wanted to have her breakfast on his knee just as she had had her supper the night before and he let her he was ready to do anything she wanted if only she would show them the way into old towers wed better set off pretty soon said anne looking out of the window its snowing pretty fast again we dont want to get lost no thats true if aily is going to take us across country we shant have the faintest idea where were going in this heavy snow said julian rather anxiously ill just clear up a bit then well go shall we said anne do we take any food with us ju we certainly do all of us said julian at once goodness knows what time well get back to this hut george you make sandwiches with anne will you and put in some bars of chocolate too and some apples if there are any left and for pitys sake remember your torches said dick aily watched while the sandwiches were made and scraped up the bits that fell on the table to give to dave her small dog the lamb frisked about quite at home getting into everyones way but nobody minded it it was such a charming little longleggitty creature at last all the sandwiches were made and put into two kitbags the hut was cleared up and tidied and the children got into their outdoor clothes i think it would be easiest to toboggan down the slope and halfway up old towers slope said julian looking out into the snow it would take us ages to walk and its no good skiing because aily hasnt any skis and couldnt use them if she had oh yes lets take the toboggans said george pleased what do we do with the lamb leave it here and must we take dave the dog too however that was not for them to settle aily absolutely refused to go without her lamb and dog she gathered them up into her arms looking mutinous when julian suggested they should be left in the warm hut neither would she allow herself to be wrapped up warmly and only consented to wear a scarf and a woollen hat because they happened to be exactly the same as julian was wearing they set off at last the snow was still falling and julian felt seriously doubtful whether they would be able to find their way down the hill and up the other slope without losing their sense of direction the toboggans were rather crowded julian and dick were on the first one with aily and the lamb between them and anne and george were on the second one with timmy and dave between them george was at the front and anne had the awkward job of hanging on to both the dogs and keeping her balance too i know we shall all roll off she said to george good gracious i half wish we had waited a bit the snow is falling very fast now good thing called julian no one will spot us when we are near old towers they wont be able to see a thing through this snow julians toboggan shot off down the snowy slope it gathered speed and the boys gasped in delight at the pace aily clung to julians back half frightened and the lamb stared with astonished eyes not daring to move from its place squashed in between aily and julian whooooooosh down the slope to the bottom and up the opposite slope gradually slowing down julians toboggan came to a stop and then not far behind came georges slowing down too george got out and dragged her toboggan over to julian well she said her face glowing what do we do now wasnt that a wonderful run wonderful said julian i only whish we could have a few more did you like that aily no said aily pulling her woollen cap to exactly the same angle that julian wore his no it make my nose cold so cold she cupped her hand over her nose to make it warm george laughed fancy complaining about a cold nose when shes hardly wearing anything on her skinny little body youd think the whole of her would feel cold not just her nose aily do you know where the big hole is asked julian looking about in the snow the snowflakes were quite big now and nothing that was more than a few yards away could be seen aily stood there her feet sinking into the snow she looked all round and julian felt certain that she was going to say that she didnt know which way to go in this thick snow even he was rather doubtful which was the way back up the hill but aily was like a dog she had a sure sense of direction and could go from one place to another on a dark night or in the snow without any difficulty at all she nodded aily know dave know too she walked a few steps but her feet sank into the snow above her ankles and her thin shoes were soon soaked through shell get her feet frostbitten said dick better put her on one of the toboggans and pull her ju pity we didnt have any snowboots small enough to lend her i say this is a bit of a crazy expedition isnt it i hope to goodness aily knows where shes taking us i havent the foggiest idea at the moment which is east or west north or south wait ive got a compass in one of my pockets said julian and did a lot of digging in his clothes at last he pulled out a small compass he looked at it thats south he said pointing so thats where old towers hill is south is directly opposite our hut we know that because the sun shone straight in at our front windows i reckon we walk this way then due south lets see which way aily points said dick he set her on his toboggan and wrapped her scarf more closely round her now which way aily aily at once pointed due south everyone was most impressed thats right said julian come on dick ill pull ailys toboggan you can pull the girls for them they all set off up the rest of the slope of old towers hill aily on the toboggan with dave and fany the lamb and timmy sitting in state on georges toboggan the girls walking behind timmy was enjoying himself he didnt like the way his legs went down into the snow when he tried to run it was much easier to sit on the toboggan and be pulled along lazy thing said george and timmy wagged his tail not caring a bit what anyone said julian looked at his compass as he went and walked due south for some time then aily gave a call and pointed to the right that way that way she said she wants us to go westwards now said julian stopping i wonder if shes right by my reckoning were going dead straight for old towers now but we shall be going up the hill to the right of it if we go her way that way that way repeated aily imperiously and dave barked as if to say she was right better follow her way said dick she seems so jolly certain of it so julian swerved to the right a little and the others followed they went a good way up the steep hill and julian began to pant is it far now he asked aily who was petting her lamb and apparently taking no notice of the way they were going not that there was anything much to take notice of except snow on the ground and snowflakes in the air aily looked up then she pointed again a little more to the right and said something in welsh nodding her head well it looks as if were getting near this place of hers this big big hole whatever it is said juiian and on he went in about a minute aily suddenly leapt off the toboggan and stood there looking round with a frown here she said big hole here well it may be but id like to see it a bit more clearly aily said julian aily began to scrape down through the snow and timmy and dave obliyingly went to help her imagining that she was after rabbits or a hidden hare im afraid the poor kids led us on a wildgoose chase said dick why should there be a big big hole here timmy and aily had now got down through the snow to the buried clumps of heather that grew all over the slopes of the mountains in that district julian could see the clumps sticking up stiff and wiry in the clearing that aily and the dogs had made timmy you take timmy said aily suddenly to george he fall down down he fall like dave one day down down i say i believe shes looking for an old pothole said dick suddenly you know those strange holes that are sometimes found on moors sudden holes that drop right down underground theyre called deanholes i think in some places we found one once on kirrin island dont you remember oh yes that was in the heather too said george remembering and it led to a cave below by the seashore thats what aily meant by a big big hole a pothole on the moors timmy for goodness sake come away you may drop right down it timmy very nearly did go down the hole george just caught his collar in time but dave was wary he had fallen down once before hole said aily pleased big big hole aily find for you well certainly youve found your hole but how does it get us into old towers said dick aily didnt understand she knelt there looking down at the hole she had uncovered under the heather and the snow i must say that was a marvellous feat said julian coming straight to this place and finding the hole when she couldnt see a thing through the falling snow she really is as good as a dog good little aily bach aily gave one of her sudden smiles and slipped her hand in julians go down yes she said aily show way well wed better go down if its possible said julian not much liking the idea for he could see nothing but darkness inside the hole and had no idea of what lay below fany the lamb was tired of waiting about she gave a little leap to the edge of the big round hole and then put her small head in she kicked up her heels and was gone shes jumped into the hole said george amazed here wait aily you cant jump too youll hurt yourself but aily slithered into the hole then let herself go aily here came a small voice from below you come quick chapter eighteen inside old towers well did you see that she just let go and dropped said george amazed i wonder she didnt break her legs julian shine your torch down julian shone it down its a pretty good drop he said i think well take the ropes off our toboggans and let ourselves down on those i dont particularly want to break a leg or sprain an ankle just at present if we pull our toboggans over the hole and let their ropes hang down into it they will hold us safely said dick and pulled his toboggan right across the hole then julian pulled the other toboggan across as well and soon the ropes were dangling down ready to take each of the four children what about timmy asked george anxiously dave has jumped down though i wonder he didnt break a leg ill wrap my coat over him and tie one of the ropes round him said julian then we can let him down easily come here tim tim was soon tied up in the coat with the rope then dick slithered down on another rope and stood on the floor of the hole ready to take timmy when julian let him down it really wasnt very difficult aily looked rather scornful as the four children used the ropes julian laughed and patted her shoulder were not all goatlike you know he said we dont gambol about the mountains all day long like you aily well that was your big big hole what next he shone his torch round yes its a pothole theres a small underground cave here look is that a tunnel leading out of it yes said george as aily and the lamb skipped off together down into the darkness of the tunnel look at that no torch no lamp and yet she goes off into the darkness without any fear id be scared stiff shes got eyes like a cat said anne well do we follow her wed better or we shall lose her come on timmy said george and all five went down the dark winding little tunnel after aily anne glanced up at the rocky roof and thought with wonder of the thick masses of heather growing on its upper surface all covered with thick snow aily was nowhere to be seen julian grew worried aily come back but there was no answer never mind said dick theres probably only one way to go and she knows we must take it if we come to a fork well shout again but they didnt come to a fork the tunnel wound on and on going steadily downhill its roof was of rock and so were the walls but underfoot was sandy soil alternating with rocky ridges that made the going rather rough julian looked at his compass weve been going in a northeasterly direction more or less he said and that should be in the direction of old towers i think i know how aily gets into the house yes this tunnel must pass right under the fencethatbites and under the grounds and end somewhere near the cellars of the house said dick or possibly in them wheres that child they caught sight of her just then in the light of julians torch she was waiting for them in a corner of the passage with dave and fany she pointed upwards way to garden she said little hole there big for aily not for you julian shone his torch upwards sure enough there was a small hole there which appeared to be overgrown with weeds or heather he couldnt tell what he looked at the rocky sides of the upward passage to the hole and saw how easily aily could have climbed up to squeeze out of it and roam the gardens so that was how it was she had been able to pick up the notes that the poor old woman had constantly thrown out so hopefully aily must surely have been the only person who managed to get into the grounds without permission this way said aily and led them past the gardenhole and downwards again we must be under the house now said julian i wonder if but before he could finish his sentence he saw that the passage had led them into some old halfruined cellars it went through a halffallen cellar wall and aily proudly led them into a dark clutteredup cellar which with its many barrels and old bottles must once have been the winecellar what cellars exclaimed dick in amazement as they went through one after another dozens of them hey whats this aily he had come to where one high wall had been broken down completely but the breakage seemed to have been done by human hands for the breaks looked new and were not covered with grime and mould as were the other fallendown walls a vast opening had been made into what seemed at first glance to be a lowwalled cave then a curious sound came to their ears the sound of water water gurgling and splashing julian took a step forward to peer into the cave beyond the broken walls but aily tugged at his hand in terror no no not go there bad mans very bad mans bad place there i say look said julian amazed taking no notice of ailys tugging hand an underground river not just a stream a river flowing down through the mountain probably fed by springs on the way and i bet it goes right down to the sea somewhere we know the sea isnt far away bad mans down there said aily in panic pulling dick and george too bangbang big fires big noise you come in house quick gosh isnt this extraordinary said julian quite astounded what is going on here we really shall have to find out what in the world does aily mean anne and george were astonished too but had no desire to go along the river and find out better leave this for now and go up into the house said george after all the old lady is the important thing at the moment no wonder they imprisoned her in one of the towers so that she wouldnt know what is going on well im blowed if i know whats going on said dick im not quite sure if im in some peculiar kind of nightmare or not you come house said aily again and this time to her great relief they followed her timmy trotting at the back with george not quite knowing what to make of it all aily led them unerringly back through the smashed walls through the musty cellars and into some that looked as if they had recently been used for storeplaces tins of food stood about old furniture old tins and baths and cans barrels of all sizes and shapes we go soft said aily meaning that they were now to walk quietly they followed her up a long flight of stone cellar steps to a great door that stood half open aily stood at the top listening probably for the tall caretaker julian thought he wondered if the fierce dog was anywhere about the house he whispered to aily big dog in house aily no big dog in garden big dog there all day and night whispered back the little girl and julian felt most relieved aily find man said aily and shot off by herself motioning to the others to wait shes gone to find out where the caretaker is said julian my word did you ever know anyone like her gosh shes back again already so she was smiling mischievously all over her face man sleep she said man safe she took them through the door from the cellar into a perfectly enormous kitchen with a colossal range at one end black and empty now a larder door near by was open and aily darted into it she brought out a meat pie and offered it to julian he shook his head at once no you mustnt steal he said but aily either didnt understand or didnt want to for she bit into the pie herself gobbling great pieces down and then put it on the floor for the animals to finish which they were very pleased to do aily take us to the old woman said dick not wanting to waste time on things like this aily you are sure there is no one else in the house aily know said the little girl one man to watch he in there and she pointed towards the door of a nearby room he watch old woman and dog watch garden other mans not come in here oh well where do they live then these strange other men asked julian but aily didnt understand she led them to a great hall from which two wide stairways swept up meeting above at an even wider landing the lamb gambolled up and the little dog dave barked joyfully sh said all the four children at once but aily laughed she seemed quite at home in the house and dick wondered how many times she had let herself down into the pothole and come wandering in here no wonder she spent so many nights away from home she could always come and hide away in some corner of this big house they followed her up the wide stairs but aily would come no farther than the second floor she had brought them up two flights of stairs and now before them stretched a great picture gallery that led to another stairway at the far end the child hung back and refused to take julians hand whats the matter he asked aily not come here said the child shrinking back not go here not ever those peoples see aily and she pointed at the rows of great pictures each a portrait of some longdead owner of the house shes afraid of the portraits said anne afraid of all their eyes following her as she runs down the long gallery funny little thing all right you stay here aily well go on up to the towers they left aily curled up behind a curtain with dave and fany anne glanced at the rows of grave portraits as the four of them with timmy walked softly down the long gallery she shivered a little for their eyes seemed to follow her as she passed looking grave and disapproving up another flight of stairs and yet another and now they were in a long passage that ran from towerroom to towerroom which was the tower they wanted it was very easy to find out all of them had their doors wide open but one this must be it said julian and knocked at the door who knocks said a weak sorrowful voice surely not you matthew you have no manners unlock the door and do not mock me with your knocking the keys in the door said dick unlock it julian quick chapter nineteen a lot of excitement julian turned the key in the lock and opened the door a stately old woman sat in a chair beside the window reading a book she did not turn round and why have you come at this time of the morning matthew she said without turning round and how did you find the manners to knock are you remembering the time when you knew how to behave to your elders and betters it isnt matthew said julian its us weve come to set you free the old woman turned at once gaping in amazement she got up and went over to the door and the five saw that she was trembling who are you let me out of that door before matthew comes let me out i tell you she pushed by the four children and the dog and then stood uncertainly in the passage what shall i do where shall i go are those men here still she went back into her room and sank down in her chair again covering her face with her hands i feel faint get me some water anne sprang to pour out a glass of water from a jug on a table the old woman took it and drank it she looked at anne who are you what is the meaning of this where is matthew oh i must be going mad mrs thomas you are mrs thomas arent you said julian little aily the shepherds daughter brought us here she knew you were locked up you remember her mother dont you she told us she used to come and wait on you ailys mother maggy yes yes but what has aily to do with this i dont believe it its another trick where are the men who killed my son julian looked at dick it was clear that the poor old lady was not herself or else this sudden appearance of the children had upset her those men that my llewellyn brought here they wanted to buy my house she said but i wouldnt sell it no i wouldnt do you know what they said to me they said that in this hill far far below my house was a rare metal a powerful metal worth a fortune what did they call it now she looked at the children as if expecting them to know she shook her head as they didnt answer why should you know about it you are only children but i wouldnt sell it no i wouldnt sell my house nor the metal below do you know what they wanted it for for bombs to kill people with and i said no never will i sell this place so that men can dig the metal and make bombs it is against the law of god i said and i bronwen thomas will not do such a thing the children listened in awe the old lady seemed beside herself and rocked to and fro as she spoke so they asked my son and he said no as i had but they took him away and killed him and now they are at work below yes yes i hear them i hear the noises creeping up i feel my house shake i see strange things but who are you and where is matthew he keeps me here locked in my room he told me about llewellyn my poor dead son he is a wicked man matthew he works with those men those evil men she seemed to forget the four children for a little while they wondered what to do julian saw that the poor woman was not fit to take down the stairs with them and through the tunnel and certainly she could not get out of the pothole he began to wish that he hadnt been so hasty in his ideas of rescue it would really be best to lock the door again and leave her here in safety until he could get the police for certainly now the police must come we will leave you now he said and send someone soon to bring you out of here we are sorry we disturbed you and to the astonishment of the others he pushed them out of the room turned the key in the lock again and put it into his pocket arent we going to take her with us said george surprised poor poor old thing no how can we said julian troubled we must go to the police no matter what morgan says i see it all now dont you the mother forbidding the son to sell the old place in spite of the enormous amount of money offered the son refusing too and the men making a plot to get in somehow and down to this metal whatever it is and work it and killing the son said dick well it may be so but i should have thought that was a pretty drastic thing to do surely the son would have been reported missing very quickly and the police would have made enquiries nobody said the son was missing or dead did they except the old lady well lets not talk about it now said julian weve got to do something im sorry to leave old mrs thomas still locked up in that room but i honestly think she would be safer there than anywhere else they went down the two flights of stairs to the picture gallery aily was there still cuddling her two pets she was pleased to see them and ran up smiling she didnt seem to notice that they hadnt the old woman with them man down there very cross she said and laughed he wake now he shout and bang goodness i hope he wont see us said julian weve got to get out of here quick and go to the police lets hope he wont come rushing at us or call in that fierce dog they went downstairs at top speed looking out for matthew but there was no sign of him in person though there was a most tremendous row going on somewhere of shouting and banging aily lock door said aily suddenly pointing in the direction of the sounds man lock old woman aily lock man did you did you really lock him in said julian delighted you really are a monkey but what a good idea i wish id thought of it he went to the door of the room in which the angry matthew was matthew he called sternly there was a dead silence and then matthews astonished voice came through the shut door whos that who locked me in if its one of you men youll be sorry for it silly joke to play on me when you know ive got to go up and see to old mrs thomas matthew this isnt one of the men said julian and how the others admired his cool determined voice we have come to rescue mrs thomas from that tower and now we are going to the police to report all this and to report too that her son has been killed by the men who are working far below this house there was an astonished silence then matthews voice came again whats all this i dont understand the police cant do anything mr llewellyn the son isnt dead my word no hes all alive and kicking and he wont be very pleased with you whoever you are clear off at once but let me out before you go im surprised that alsatian outside didnt get you that i am it was the childrens turn to be amazed now so the son wasnt dead then where was he and why had matthew told old mrs thomas such a cruel untruth julian asked him at once why did you tell mrs thomas her son was dead then whats it to do with you mr llewellyn he told me to tell his mother that the old lady wouldnt let him sell that stuff deep down under the house the stuff that gets hold of cars and bicycles and ploughs and makes them heavy as lead magnetises them so they say well if he wants to sell it why shouldnt he but what i say is this he shouldnt sell it to foreigners no that he shouldnt if id have known that well i wouldnt have taken money from him to act like i did the voice rose and fell as matthew told his extraordinary tale then the man banged frantically on the door again who are you you let me out ive been kind to the old lady you ask her though shes difficult and strange in her ways ive been loyal to mr llewellyn though hes not easy no that hes not who are you i say let me out let me out if mr llewellyn catches me locked in here hell kill me hell say ive let his secret out hell say let me out i say he sounds a bit mad said julian thankful that the man was locked up he must be a bit simple too to believe all that the son told him and do everything he was told to do well wed better go to the police come on well go back the way we came lets just have a look down that river to see what the men are up to said dick just you and i julian its such a chance we neednt be seen and it would only take a few minutes the girls could wait somewhere with tim i dont think we ought to stop now said julian i really dont no dont lets said anne i dont like this house its got a horrid feel about it and i cant imagine what the shuddering would be like when the men start their work again deep down below whatever it is well come along then said julian and completely ignoring matthews yells and bangs the children made their way through the kitchen and down the cellarsteps flashing on their torches to light their way i bet matthew is wild that weve left him locked up said dick as they went through the vast cellars serves him right taking bribes from the son and telling lies to that poor old woman hallo weve come to where the men smashed the walls here to get along the river tunnel i suppose they found that was the easiest way to go down to where the precious metal was whatever it is they stood looking through the smashed walls at the gurgling river come come said aily dragging at julians hand bad mans there she was holding dave her little dog in case he fell into the rushing river but fany the lamb was gambolling loose as usual and quite suddenly she skipped off down the river tunnel her tail whisking behind her madly fany fany cried aily fany bach but the lamb thinking that she was going the right way gambolled on deafened by the rushing of the water aily ran after her as surefooted as the lamb hopping and skipping over the rough rocky bank of the river come back you little ass yelled julian but aily either did not or would not hear and she disappeared into the blackness of the tunnel almost at once she hasnt got a torch ju shell fall in and drown yelled george in a panic timmy go after her fetch her back and away went timmy obediently running as fast as he could beside the black churning water hurrying on its way downwards to the sea julian and the others waited anxiously aily didnt come back nor did any of the animals and george began to be very panicky about timmy oh julian whats happened to tim and the others she said theyve no torches oh why did i let timmy go we all ought to have gone theyll come back all right said julian much more confidently than he felt that child aily can see in the dark i really do believe and she knows her way about like a dog but when after five minutes not one of the four had come back george started forward flashing her torch on the rocky path beside the river im going to find timmy she said and nobodys going to stop me and she was gone before the boys could get hold of her julian gave a shout of aggravation george dont be an ass timmy will find his own way back dont go down there you dont know what you may find come on said dick starting off down the river too george wont come back we know that not unless she finds tim and the others wed better go quickly before anything awful happens anne had to follow the boys her heart beating fast what a thing to happen just the very worst possible chapter twenty in the heart of the hill it seemed like a bad dream to the four children making their way over the rocky edge of the underground river their torches had good batteries fortunately and gave a bright light so that they could see their way alongside the river but at times this rocky path they had to walk on grew very narrow indeed oh dear thought anne trying to keep up with the boys i know i shall slip i wish i hadnt these heavy snowboots on what a noise the river makes booming along and how fast it goes some way in front of the two boys and anne was george still calling for timmy she was very worried because he didnt come back to her as he always did when she called him she didnt realise that timmy couldnt hear her the river made such a noise in the enclosed rocky tunnel that timmy heard nothing at all but the sound of the churning waters quite suddenly the tunnel widened tremendously the river making a big broad pool before it tore on down the tunnel again the walls opened out into an enormous cave half of which was water and the other half a stretch of rough rocky floor george was most astonished but she was even more astonished at other things she saw two rafts sturdy and immensely strong were moored at the side of the deep pool and on the floor of the cave were what looked like tin barrels standing in rough rows presumably waiting to be packed on to the rafts at one side of the cave were stacked great heaps of tins and bottles and cans none of them opened and on the other side an equally vast heap of discarded ones all opened and thrown to one side big wooden crates stood about too though george could not imagine what they were for the cave was dimly lighted by electricity of some kind probably from a battery fixed up somewhere nobody seemed to be about at all george gave a call hoping that timmy was somewhere there timmy where are you and at once timmy came from behind one of the big crates his tail wagging hard george was so glad that she fell on one knee and hugged him tight you naughty dog she said fondling him why didnt you come when you were called did you find the others where is aily a small face peeped from behind the crate near by the one from which timmy had appeared it was aily she looked terrified and tears were on her cheeks she clasped her lamb to her and dave was at her heels she ran straight across to george crying out something in welsh pointing back up the tunnel george nodded yes well go back straightaway look here come the others aily had already seen them she ran to julian with a cry of delight and he swung her up in his arms lamb and all he was very glad to see george and timmy too they all had a good look round the strange cave i see what the idea is said julian jolly clever too they are mining that precious metal down here somewhere and putting it on those rafts there so that the underground river can take it right down to the sea i bet theyve got barges or something waiting down at some secret creek to take the stuff away at night whew said dick very ingenious and they count on the queer noises and shudderings and things tn frighten people and keep them away from this hill nobody dares to come prying round to see whats up the nearest farm is magga glen farm where the joness live said julian they would really be the only people who could find out anything definite which they obviously did said dick i bet morgan knows all about this and is in with the son who sold the precious metal to the men who came after it though it was his mothers theres no queer noise or anything down here no noise at all except the sound of the river said julian do you suppose the works arent going just now well began dick and then suddenly stopped as dave and timmy began to growl timmy in a deep voice and dave in a smaller one julian at once pulled aily and george behind a big crate and dick pushed anne there they listened intently what had the dogs heard was there time to rush back to the tunnel and make their way out before they were seen timmy went on growling in a low voice the childrens hearts began to beat fast and then they heard voices where did they come from dick peeped cautiously round the crate it was in a dark corner and he hoped he could not be seen the voices seemed to come from the dirertion of the great pool and dick looked over to it he gave a sudden exclamation ju look over there do you see what i see julian looked and was filled with astonishment two men had come up the tunnel from the sea evidently walking on the rocky edge of the river just as they themselves had done and were now wading in the shallows of the pool one is morgan whispered julian and whos the other man gosh its the shepherd ailys father would you believe it well we always thought morgan was mixed up in this but i didnt think the shepherd was aily had seen both morgan and her father she made no move to go to the shepherd she was far too scared of morgan morgan and the shepherd stood and gazed round a little as if looking for someone then keeping to the shadows they made their way across the great cave right to the back of it where another tunnel very wide led downwards into the hill as they went a strange noise began the rumbling whispered george and timmy growled again but oh doesnt it sound near what a terrific noise its got right inside my head it was no use whispering now they had to shout if they wanted to say anything and then the shuddering began everything shuddered and vibrated and when the children touched one another they could feel the vibration in the others hands and arms its as if were being run by electricity ourselves said dick astonished i wonder if its anything to do with that strange metal that is under this hill that makes steel things heavy so that ploughs wont plough and spades wont dig lets follow morgan and the shepherd said julian so excited now that he felt he must see everything possible we can keep well in the shadows nobody would ever guess we were here aily you stay here said julian big noise big big noise frighten fany and dave aily nodded she settled down behind the crate with her pets aily wait she said she had no desire at all to go any nearer that strange noise in her simple mind she imagined that possibly the thunder itself came from this hill and was made here yes perhaps the lightning too morgan and the shepherd had now disappeared into the tunnel right at the back of the cave on the opposite side to the great pool the five went quickly over to it and looked down it was very wide and very steep but rough steps had been cut in it so that it was not difficult to go down they trod warily down the steep tunnel astonished because it was dimly lighted and yet there were no lamps of any sort to be seen i think its the reflection of some great glare far below shouted julian above the rumbling the noise was so loud that it was almost like walking in the middle of thunder down and down they went and the tunnel curved and wound about always steep rocky and dimly lit suddenly the noise grew louder and the tunnel grew lighter the children saw the end of it the exit outlined in brilliant light a light that shimmered and shook in a most curious way were coming to the works the mine where that strange metal is shouted dick so excited that he felt his hands trembling be careful we arent seen ju be careful we arent seen they went cautiously to the end of the tunnel and peered out they were looking into a vast pit of light round which men stood working some curiouslooking machines the children could not make out what they were and indeed the light was so blinding that it was only possible to look with their eyelids almost closed all the men were wearing faceguards suddenly the loud rumbling stopped and the light disappeared as if someone had turned off an electric switch then in the darkness a glow formed a strange glow that came upwards and outwards and seemed to go right through the roof itself dick clutched at julian thats the kind of glow we saw the other night he said my word it begins down here goes right up through the hill in some strange way and hangs above it that shimmering must come from here too some kind of rays that can go through anything like xrays or something its like a dream said anne feeling george to make sure it wasnt just like a dream where are morgan and the shepherd said dick look there they are in that corner not far off look out theyre coming back the four children moved back quickly into the tunnel afraid of being seen they suddenly heard shouts and stumbled up the rocky steps even faster had they been seen it sounded like it i can hear someone coming up the tunnel behind us panted dick quick quick i wish that noise would begin again i know we can be heard someone was climbing swiftly up behind them there were shouts and yells from below too it sounded as if all the men were disturbed and angry why oh why had they followed morgan and the shepherd they could so easily have gone back to the cellars they came to the top of the steep rocky tunnel at last and ran to hide behind the crates hoping to slip into the rivertunnel without being seen they had to get aily before they fled where was she aily aily shouted julian wheres she gone we darent leave her here aily it was difficult to remember exactly where they had left her in this great cave theres the lamb cried julian thankfully as he saw it on the other side of a crate aily look out theres morgan shouted george as the big farmer came out of the tunnel and ran across the cave he saw the children and stopped in the utmost amazement what are you doing here he roared come with us quickly youre in danger the shepherd now appeared too and aily ran from behind her crate to him he stared as if he could not believe his eyes and then picked her up calling something to morgan in welsh morgan swung round on julian again i told you not to interfere he roared i was handling this now we shall all be caught fool of a boy quick we must hide and hope that the men will think weve gone down the tunnel if we try to escape now they will overtake us and bring us back he swept the astonished children into a dark corner and pulled crates round them stay there he said we will do what we can chapter twentyone an astounding thing the five children crouched behind the pile of crates morgan pushed another crate up so that they werc completely hidden dick clutched julian julian weve made fools of ourselves morgan was trying to find out the secret of old towers himself with the help of the shepherd they were about the only people in the neighbourhood who could guess what was going on the shepherd could see all the strange things we saw while watching his sheep on the mountainside and he told morgan julian groaned yes no wonder he was angry when he thought we were meddling in such a serious matter no wonder he forbade us to do anything more gosh weve been idiots where is morgan now can you see him no hes hiding somewhere listen here come the men said dick theres a crack between two crates here i can see the first man hes got an iron bar or something he looks pretty grim the men came out cautiously evidently not sure how many people they were after they advanced across the cave seven of them all with weapons of some kind two went to the upper river tunnel two went to the one that led down to the sea and the others began to hunt among the crates they found the children first it was ailys fault poor child she gave a sudden scream of fright and in a trice the men had pulled away the crates crash one by one they fell to the ground and the amazed men found themselves looking at five children but not for long with a terrifying bark timmy flung himself on the first man he yelled and began to fight him off but timmy held on like grim death morgan appeared from the shadows and surprised another of the men jumping on him and getting him on the ground at the same time catching hold of a second man and tossing him away he had the strength of a giant run he yelled to the children but they couldnt two of the men had penned them into a corner and although julian leapt at one of them he was simply thrown back again these men were strong miners and though not a match for the giantlike morgan they could certainly take everyone else prisoner including the gentle shepherd he too was penned into a corner only morgan and timmy were fighting now timmy will be hurt said george in a trembling voice and she tried to push one of the men away to get to him oh look ju that man is trying to hit him with that bar timmy dodged the bar and sprang at the man who turned and ran for his life timmy shot after him and got him on the ground but there were too many men and more were now coming up from the tunnel at the back of the cave pouring in with weapons of all kinds all of them were amazed to see the five children the men seemed mostly to be foreigners and spoke a language the children couldnt understand but one man was not a foreigner he was obviously the boss and gave his orders as if he expected them to be obeyed he hadnt joined in the fight at all the shepherd was soon overpowered and his hands bound behind his back morgan fought off for some time but then had to surrender he was like an angry bull stamping here pulling there roaring with rage as three men tried to tie his hands the boss came up and faced him you will be sorry for this morgan he said all our lives we have been enemies you down at the farm and i here at old towers morgan suddenly spat at him where is your old mother he shouted a prisoner in her own house who has robbed her you llewellyn thomas then he went off into a spate of welsh his voice rising high as he denounced the man in front of him julian admired the fearless morgan enormously as he stood with his hands bound defying the man who had been a lifelong enemy how many quarrels had these two had living in the same countryside trying their strength against one another julian wished intensely that he had obeyed morgans command and left everything to him but he had thought morgan was on the side of the enemy how stupid he had been its all because of us that hes caught thought the boy remorsefully ive been a fool and i thought i was doing something clever and right and now were all landed in this mess the girls too what will they do with us i suppose the only safe thing for them to do is to keep us prisoner till theyve finished this mining job collected a fortune from the metal whatever it is and gone llewellyn thomas was now giving some sharp orders and the men were listening timmy was growling held by the collar in a stranglehold by one of the men if he tried to squirm away the man twisted his hand in the collar a little more and poor timmy was halfchoked george was wild with despair julian had to keep stopping her from trying to make a dash to timmy he was afraid that these rough men would strike her though she was a girl aily sat in a corner hugging her lamb and dave who had been far too scared even to take a little nip at any of the men morgan was held by two hefty miners but quite suddenly he hurled himself sideways at one of them and sent him flying and then at the other who staggered away and fell over a tin with a great roar morgan stumbled to the pool and waded to the entrance of the tunnel that led to the sea his hands still tightly tied behind his back the fool said llewellyn thomas if he thinks he can get along that tunnel with his hands tied he is mad he will fall into that rushing river and without his hands to help him he will drown no dont go after him let him go let him drown we shall be well rid of him the shepherd struggled to his feet to go after his master knowing quite well that llewellyn was right no man could get along that rough edge to the river without his hands to steady him feeling along the wall at the side and one slip would put him into the churning hurrying river that ran at fullpelt down to the sea far below at the bottom of the hill but morgan did not mean to escape he was not going to struggle along beside that treacherous torrent he had come all the way up beside it with the shepherd and knew how easy it was to slip on the wet rocky edge no morgan had another plan julian watched him disappear into the tunnel and his heart sank he too knew that no one could walk along there without free hands to help him but what could anyone do the boss turned to the other men who were still staring after morgan he was just about to say something to them when a roar came to their ears not the roar of the torrent in the underground tunnel not the roar of the strange rumbling mine no the roar of a giant voice that crashed out of the tunnel and echoed round the cave it was morgans enormous voice morgan calling the names of his seven great dogs the children listened in amazement at this unbelievable voice dai bob tang come to me doon joll rafe hal the names echoed round and round the cave and it seemed as if the place was full of giant voices aily who was used to hearing the dogs called didnt turn a hair but the others crouched back in amazement at the sound of such a voice surely no one in all the world had ever shouted so loudly before dai dai rafe rafe the great voice boomed again and again seeming to be louder each time at first llewellyn thomas the boss was taken aback but then he laughed sneeringly does he think he can get his dogs up from the beach he said all that way down the tunnel hes mad let him be then again the great voice roared out the names of the seven dogs belonging to morgan and the shepherd dai bob tang doon joll rafe hal at the last name morgans voice seemed to crack the shepherd raised his head in dismay morgan had overstrained that great voice of his and no wonder no megaphone could possibly have been louder there was silence after that morgan called no more neither did he appear again the children felt scared and depressed and aily began to whimper the curious shuddering vibration began to creep into everything again and the boss turned sharply giving some more orders two of the men ran to the tunnel at the back of the cave and disappeared then things took on a curious shimmer as if a heathaze had spread everywhere and it began to feel very warm in the cave suddenly something happened at first it sounded faroff in the distance a confused noise that made tirnmy tug at his collar again and prick his ears he barked and the man who was holding him hit him whats that noise said llewellyn thomas sharply looking all round there was no telling where it came from but it grew louder and louder and then suddenly julian knew what it was it was the loud barking of seven angry dogs the shepherd knew it too and a glad smile came over his face he glanced at llewellyn to see if he recognised it as well yes the boss had certainly recognised that dreadful sound now he could hardly believe it surely it was not possible that morgans voice enormous as it was had echoed all the way down the tunnel and been heard by the sharp prickedup ears of the dogs who loved him but so it was dai the oldest dog who loved his master more than any of them had stood tense and listening ever since morgan and the shepherd had left them and from somewhere far distant echoing down to the end of the tunnel they were guarding dai had heard the faint echoes of his masters beloved voice his bark had told the other dogs the news and led by dai they had all rushed up the rocky tunnel surefooted on the slippery rocky path beside the racing river they came to morgan sitting beside the river not far from the big cave a little way down the tunnel it was a moment of joy for morgan and his dogs dai soon snuffled at his hands and bit the ropes in half morgan was free down now and hush commanded morgan he began to walk steadily back to the cave then motioned the dogs before him attack he cried in welsh and then to the mens horror the seven dogs raced out of the tunnel at a great speed barking growling snarling with a triumphant morgan behind them so tall that he had to bend double to leave the tunnel the men fled every one of them llewellyn had turned to run even before the dogs appeared and was gone dai leapt at one man and got him down and tang leapt at another the cave was filled with snarls and growls and excited barking timmy delightedly joined in for his captor had rushed away too even little dave ran to join this wonderful fight while the children stood amazed and thankful to see their enemy defeated who would have thought of this said dick sending the crates crashing down what an astounding thing hurrah for morgan and his seven dogs chapter twentytwo alls well that ends well morgan would not let the children stay underground any longer we have things to do he said in his deep voice which sounded rather hoarse now you will go back to the farm and telephone to the police for me you will say morgan has won and tell them to send a boat to the little creek i have already told them of there i will bring these men all the way down the tunnel to the sea go now at once obey me this time boy yes sir said julian this man was a hero and he had thought him a villain he was ready to obey his smallest command now then a thought struck him and he turned back the old woman he said mrs thomas that mans mother what about her and weve locked the caretaker up in his room you will not do anything but go to the farm and telephone said morgan sternly i will do everything there is to be done take aily with you to the farm she must not be here now go and julian went he and the others took one last look round at the men all pinioned by the dogs lying still and panicstricken then with aily and her lamb and dog he led the others up the tunnel again and at last back into the cellars i dont like leaving that old lady up there in the tower said dick no but obviously morgan has his plans said julian who was not going to disobey orders in any way this time i expect he has arranged something with the police we cant interfere now we messed things up a bit im afraid they climbed soberly up to the place where they had left their toboggans it took them some time and they were beginning to feel very hungry but julian wouldnt let them stop even to eat some sandwiches no he said ive to telephone to the police as soon as ever i can no stopping now well munch our sandwiches on the way down to the farm it wasnt very dificult to get out of the pothole for they had left the ropes dangling down julian and dick helped the two girls up by pushing them and they in turn helped to pull up the boys from the top of the hole aily scrambled up easily swinging delightedly on a rope and then flinging herself out of the hole the lamb leapt up in a miraculous manner and julian handed dave to the small girl timmy was hauled up in the same way as he had been let down he had badly wanted to stay with the other dogs but nothing would make him leave george well thats that said julian scrambling out last of all now lets see we could toboggan down this slope and halfway up our own slope that would save a lot of time aily youre to come with us to the farm no said aily yes aily bach said julian i want you to he took her small hand in his and she smiled her sudden little smile quite content to go along with this big kind boy even though she was afraid of going down to the farm for fear she should meet her mother aily good girl said julian setting the little thing on his toboggan aily shall have big piece of chocolate at the farm they tobogganed down the slope at a great speed without any mishap and halfway up the opposite slope it seemed queer to be out in the dazzling daylight after the dark tunnels underground their adventure below began to seem slightly unreal well leave the toboggans at the hut said julian as they dragged them up the rest of the slope anyone thirsty i am i think it must be something to do with that mine my mouth got as dry as anything as soon as we were down there everyone said the same ill run into the hut and pour out some orangeade said anne you stack the toboggans in their place ju and just see if theres enough oil in the can out in the bunker well need to fill the stove tonight and if there isnt enough we must bring some up with us julian gave her the key of the hut and she unlocked it and went in with george they poured orangeade into five cups and drank thirstily their mouths were drier than they had ever been before anne felt thankful that she didnt have to wait any longer for a drink i think the roof of my mouth would have stuck to my tongue she said putting down her cup that was lovely theres plenty of oil reported julian coming to drink his orangeade my word i needed this id not like to work down in that mine they locked the hut and set off down to the farm munching their sandwiches hungrily they tasted very good indeed and even aily asked for one after another timmy had his share and once they missed him and had to stop and call him has he lost his bit of meat in the snow wondered anne but no he like the rest of them was suffering from a very dry mouth and was busy licking the snow letting it melt in his mouth and trickle down his dry throat mrs jones was most surprised to see them when she heard julians request to telephone to the police she looked worried its all right mrs jones said julian comfortingly its a message to them from morgan everything is fine well tell you whats happened as soon as he comes home he might not like us to say anything till then the police did not seem at all surprised to hear julians message they appeared to be expecting it we will see to the matter said the sergeant in his deep stolid voice thank you and he rang off at once julian wondered what would happen next what had morgan arranged they were pleased to see mrs jones bringing in bowls of hot chicken soup as they sat talking round the wood fire she had hurriedly lighted in the livingroom oh just what we feel like said anne gratefully im still awfully thirsty arent you george and look timmy theres a nice meaty bone for you you are kind mrs jones you know i feel pretty awful about all this now said julian we shouldnt have interfered after morgan said we werent to i wish we hadnt he cant think much of us i vote we all apologise humbly said dick how could we have thought he was the villain of the piece i know hes dour and silent but he didnt look mean or cruel wed better stay down here at the farm till morgan comes back said george quite apart from wanting to say im sorry id like to know what happened so would i said anne and aily ought to wait for her father hell want to know that shes safe so they asked mrs jones if they could stay till morgan came home she was delighted of course now she said weve a roasting turkey today and you shall come and sup with us in our room for a change this all sounded rather good the children gathered round their fire to talk and timmy rested his head on georges knee she looked at his neck that man almost choked him she said oh look julian hes bruised all round his poor neck now dont start moaning over timmys neck again for goodness sake said dick honestly george im sure tim thinks the adventure was worth a bruised neck hes not grumbling he was jolly brave i think and didnt he enjoy himself when the other dogs rushed into the cave and he joined in the fight i wonder what theyll do about that poor old woman said anne she will be glad her son is alive i suppose but what a shock for her to know hes lied to her and sold what is really hers that strange metal under the hill well i imagine it wont be allowed to be sold now said julian what a plan that was to get men up that tunnel to mine the stuff and to send it down by rafts to waiting ships hidden in that creek we ought to go down and examine the creek it would be interesting to see what sort of a place it is down there it must be well hidden in a fold of the cliff i should think yes lets do that tomorrow said george thrilled i vote we stay here tonight i feel tired after such an adventure dont you i do a bit said julian well i suppose there wont be quite so much shuddering and shimmering and rumbling now funny that that hill should always have been so queer isnt it ploughs that will not plough spades that will not dig must be some kind of iron i suppose that magnetises things oh well its all beyond me morgan came back with the shepherd when it was dark julian went straight up to the burly farmer we want to apologise for being such idiots he said we shouldnt have interfered after what you said morgan gave a broad smile he seemed to be in a very good humour indeed forget it boy he said alls well now the police came up the river tunnel and all the men are safe in jail llewellyn thomas is a sad man tonight his mother is free and is staying with friends poor lady she doesnt understand what has happened and that is as well and maybe now the right people will get that strange metal its worth a hundred times its weight in gold come you in to your supper morgan bach and shepherd too said mrs jones in her lilting voice the children too are coming weve a roasting turkey its your birthday morgan boy well there now i didnt know it said morgan and gave his mother such a hug that she squealed lets go in to the turkey ive had nothing all day soon they were all sitting down before the most enormous turkey that the children had ever seen in their lives morgan carved it swiftly then he said something to his mother in welsh and she smiled and nodded yes you do that she said morgan collected some slices of turkey on a big enamel dish and then went to the door that led from the livingroom into the farmyard he roared loudly and the children jumped what a voice dai tang bob doon joll rafe hal hes calling the dogs said anne just as he called them up the tunnel well they certainly deserve a good dinner then down to the door came the seven dogs jostling each other barking excitedly morgan threw them the slices of turkey and they gobbled the tasty bits up greedily woof said timmy politely from behind him and morgan turned he solemnly cut a big slice and a little slice here he said to timmy and dave you did well too catch therell not be much left of your birthday turkey said his mother halfcross halfamused now fill your glasses again children and we will drink to my morgan a better son there never was anne poured homemade lemonade into the empty glasses while morgan sat and smiled listening to his seven dogs still barking together outside happy birthday happy birthday shouted everyone raising their glasses and julian added his own few words happy birthday sir and may your voice never grow less
