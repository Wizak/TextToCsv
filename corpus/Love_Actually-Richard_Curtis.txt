chapter one love is all around us whenever i feel unhappy about the state of the world the prime minister thought to himself i think about the arrivals gate at heathrow airport where happy smiling passengers greet their friends and relatives it seems to me that love is everywhere it isnt big news but its always there fathers and sons mothers and daughters husbands and wives friends and strangers when the planes hit new york peoples last phone calls werent messages of hate they were messages of love if you look for it youll find i think that love actually is all around us in a recording studio in london an ageing rock star was recording a new song i feel it in my fingers i feel it in my toes three much younger singers joined in enthusiastically love is all around me and so the im afraid you did it again billy his manager joe called out i know the old words so well we all do and thats why were doing these new ones right ok lets do it again the music started again billy sang i feel it in my fingers i feel it in my toes love is all oh no the music stopped and then started again i feel it in my fingers i feel it in my toes christmas is all around me joe smiled and so the feeling grows its written in the wind its everywhere i go so if you really love christmas come on and let it snow billy stopped singing this is rubbish isnt it he said yes complete rubbish great rock star joe agreed happily in another part of the city jamie was preparing to go out his girlfriend katya watched him from the bed im going to be late for the wedding he said anxiously its just round the corner youll be there in time you really dont mind me going without you he asked no im just feeling bad i love you jamie told her and he kissed her i know i love you even when youre ill and look terrible i know now go or youll miss it right jamie left the room then put his head round the door again did i tell you that i love you yes you did katya said impatiently now go a few streets away daniel sat alone in his home office thinking about the recent death of his wife he rested his head in his hands for a moment then he lifted his head picked up the phone and rang his friend karen karen its me again im sorry theres really nobody else i can talk to karen was in her kitchen cooking her childrens dinner of course we can talk she said its a bad moment now though can i call you back

so whats this big news she asked weve been given our parts in the christmas play daisy told her im the lobster the lobster said karen yes in the christmas play yes said daisy first lobster there was more than one lobster at the birth of jesus yes in a church by a river peter was standing with his best man mark it was his wedding day no surprises peter asked no surprises mark promised not like the stag night unlike the stag night those brazilian women were a mistake werent they they were especially because they were actually men thats true good luck they shook hands as the music started peter stepped forward and turned towards he back of the church and there walking towards him was juliet smiling happily in her white wedding dress mark picked up his video recorder and started to film juliet walked more quickly until she was standing next to peter the service began wedding music played songs were sung and at the end of the service peter and juliet exchanged rings the vicar smiled you are now man and wife he told them and the happy couple kissed peter turned to mark no surprises good he said no ive grown up mark replied at that moment the traditional wedding music stopped and from behind a curtain voices began to sing a beatles song the curtain went back twenty people were singing all you need is love juliet looked happily at peter did you do this er no peter looked at mark mark looked away all around the church people stood up and started joining in with their instruments at the front an electric guitarist appeared on the same day the new prime ministers car protected by police cars drove along downing street and stopped outside number there were crowds outside the building shouting his name journalists from tv radio and the newspapers pushed forward with their microphones and cameras the prime minister was a popular and attractive man inside downing street it was suddenly quiet after all the noise outside the prime ministers personal adviser was waiting for him welcome prime minister annie said i must practise my wave replied the prime minister he kissed her how are you feeling annie asked good powerful would you like to meet the people who work here yes very much if that means i dont have to start running the country yet annie led him to a long line of employees this is terence sir she said hes in charge good morning sir terence said good morning the prime minister answered i had an uncle called terence i hated him there was something very strange about him i like the look of you though this is pat annie said quickly good morning sir im responsible for arrangements in your private flat said pat good morning pat ill be easier to look after than the last prime minister no baby no teenagers no frightening wife and this is natalie annie said shes new like you hello natalie said the prime minister hello david i mean sir oh i cant believe i said that im so sorry sir thats fine said the prime minister he laughed as natalies face went prettily pink then he looked at her more carefully right said annie lets fix the country shall we good idea why not as the prime minister walked away he looked back over his shoulder and took another quick look at natalie then he went into his office oh no he said to himself how inconvenient chapter two alone and sad back from peter and juliets wedding jamie unlocked his front door and hurried into his living room another slightly younger man came into the room at the same time from the kitchen hello jamie said to his brother with surprise what are you doing here oh i came round to borrow some old cds chris replied did the lady of the house let you in yes lovely helpful girl i came back before the reception to see if she was feeling better jamie said listen perhaps we should take mum out for her birthday on friday what do you think i feel weve been bad sons this year ok chris agreed that sounds fine boring but fine katyas voice came from the bedroom are you coming back to bed darling jamie will be home soon by now on the same beautiful winter day daniel and his elevenyearold stepson were at his wifes funeral a crowd of about eighty people filled the church all dressed in black and now said the vicar daniel wishes to say a few words daniel stood up and faced the guests behind him was a large picture of his wife as she was before she died jo and i had a lot of time to prepare for this moment he began some of her requests were not very serious i have not for example brought claudia schiffer with me to the funeral even the vicar smiled but she was quite clear about other things that she wanted my darling girl and sams darling mum wanted to say her last goodbye to you not through me but through the words of the great the wonderful bay city rollers the bay city rollers were a pop group who were popular with young teenagers in the s their terrible song bye bye baby played loudly through the church and as the song played more pictures were shown including a twelveyearold jo dressed in a bay city rollers tshirt the guests smiled at the song and the pictures while their faces showed their deep sadness that night at peter and juliets wedding reception the guests were dancing mark was still filming sarah a friend whose phone never stopped ringing sat down next to him and watched him with interest for a few minutes before she spoke do you love him she asked softly who what peter do you love him i just thought id ask the question because it might be the right question i mean you might need to talk to someone and perhaps no one has ever asked you so you couldnt talk about it no no no is the answer no no so thats no is it yes er this dj what do you think is he the worst dj in history probably sarah replied well know definitely when he plays his next song the dj looked out at the wedding guests and heres one for lovers he said quite a lot of you are lovers i expect he played the beginning of a very wellknown and completely unsuitable song well now we know said mark the worst dj in the world sarah agreed no doubt the next day sarah was back at work in the large untidy offices of fairtrade a company which bought from poor countries at fair prices a beautiful girl at the next desk got up and knocked on the door behind her come in said harry mia walked into harrys office and smiled as her boss looked up sarahs waiting for you she said oh yes of course good good are you enjoying working here do you know whose advice not to listen to i think so mia left as sarah came in hi harry switch off your phone harry said then tell me exactly how long youve been working here two years seven months three days and i think about two hours and how long have you been in love with karl our mysterious chief designer her boss asked sarah looked surprised er she began two years seven months three days and about an hour and a half i thought so do you think everybody knows yes do you think karl knows yes oh that is bad news and i was just thinking harry continued that maybe its time to do something about it like what invite him out for a drink then after about twenty minutes say something like i would like to marry you and have your babies you know that yes and karl does too it would be best for all of us i think its nearly christmas certainly excellent ill do that thanks boss she opened the door to leave and a very goodlooking man walked in hi sarah karl said hi karl sarah replied outside harrys office she stopped and took a deep breath she switched on her phone and it rang immediately darling she said of course tell me she turned to mia could you turn the music down what is that song it was christmas is all around by the ageing rock star billy mack at a local radio station in watford on the edge of london a dj was playing billys new record as it came to an end the dj spoke to his listeners and that was the christmas song by billy mack who used to be a great musician has there been a worse song this century i dont think so the dj looked up and saw a second dj waving at him looking down at the list of guests in front of him he realized his mistake and yes i believe billy is a guest on my friend mikes show in a few minutes welcome back billy billy and joe were waiting outside the studio the programme was playing in the room and they didnt look very happy but ten minutes later billy was in the studio with dj mike so billy welcome back to radio and your new christmas song is love is all around yes but weve changed the word love to christmas yes said mike is that an important message for you billy no not really mike christmas is for people who can share it with someone they love and thats not you thats not me when i was young and successful mike i was greedy and foolish and now im greyhaired and alone wow thanks for that billy for what for actually giving a real answer to a question that doesnt often happen here at radio watford ask me anything you like billy said ill give you an honest answer ok heres one how do you think the new record compares to your old stuff oh mike you know as well as i do that the records rubbish in the next room joe looked very unhappy but wouldnt it be great billy continued if the number one record in the charts this christmas wasnt by a spotty teenager wouldnt it be great if it was by an old fool looking for new success at any price all those young teenage stars will be in a hotel bedroom on christmas day with a goodlooking girl and ill be in a cheap flat with my manager joe the ugliest man in the world feeling very unhappy because our idea for a christmas song failed so if you believe in father christmas children like your uncle billy buy my christmas song and enjoy the line thats too long for the music i think you mean if you really love christmas come on and let it snow yes horrible so here it is one more time mike said into his microphone for the listeners a possible christmas number one christmas is all around thank you billy after this the news is the new prime minister in trouble already billy went outside to joe smiling chapter three love hurts in downing street a few days later the prime minister and his ministers sat around a long table ok the prime minister said whats next one of his ministers spoke the american presidents visit carter told him ah yes yes im worried about that theres a very strong feeling in the party and in the country too that we must be more independent than the last government was i agree said another minister this is our first really important test we must show the president that we dont take orders from him right right i understand that but i have decided not to the prime minister told them not this time well try to be clever of course but lets not forget the us is the most powerful country in the world im not going to start a fight that i cant win the ministers accepted this unenthusiastically right continued the prime minister now how do i get a cup of tea and a biscuit in this place at that moment natalie came in with tea and biscuits the prime ministers face turned red as she smiled at him good he said later that day there was a knock on the door of the prime ministers private office come in he called natalie entered carrying some files in one hand and a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits in the other these have just arrived for you she said giving the files to the prime minister and this is for you too the prime minister smiled excellent thanks i hoped youd win natalie continued although of course the other man would get biscuits too if he was here but he wouldnt get chocolate biscuits thank you very much natalie said the prime minister after she left he lowered his head and hit it against the table top be sensible he said quietly to himself youre the prime minister at fairtrade harry and mia were discussing the christmas party not my favourite night of the year harry said trying not to stare at mias tight black dress and its your unhappy job to organise it tell me easy really harry said find a place for the party buy more drinks than anybody wants buy little things to eat hundreds of them and advise the girls not to go near kevin fine said mia are we inviting wives and families yes said harry i mean not children but husbands wives girlfriends you havent got a horrible twometre tighttshirt wearing boyfriend that you want to bring have you no ill just wait under the mistletoe hoping for a kiss their eyes met and an electric look passed between them right said harry as mia walked out harry shook his head like a man waking from a dream daniel was telling his friend karen his worries about his stepson sam spends all his time in his room daniel said hes probably there now theres nothing unusual about that karen told him my horrible son bernie stays in his room all the time and im glad he does but this is all the time and im afraid that theres something really wrong i mean hes sad about his mum but he could be doing anything up there if he was drinking beer and bringing women in i wouldnt know at the age of eleven well maybe not women maybe just beer the problem is his mum always used to talk to him and now the whole stepfather thing suddenly seems important it wasnt before its not surprising that this is a really horrible time just be patient and maybe check his room for empty bottles and sometimes when he comes out of his room i know hes been crying tears suddenly ran down daniels face it was such a waste when jo died and its going to ruin sams life as well i dont know what to do karen touched his shoulder be strong people hate men who behave like girls no one will ever want to spend time with you if you cry all the time youre right that evening daniel and sam sat together looking out across the river thames daniel took a deep breath so whats the problem sam he asked is it just mum or is it something else maybe school can you tell me you really want to know i really want to know but you wont be able to help i still want to know ok sam said actually im in love sorry i know i should be thinking about mum all the time and i am but im in love too and i was before she died theres nothing i can do about it arent you a bit young to be in love no right said daniel well thats not as bad as i thought why because i thought it was something worse worse than the terrible pain of being in love er no youre right terrible pain at the same time it was the end of the working day at fairtrade sarah was putting her makeup on when karl came towards her from the other end of the office passing her desk on his way out goodnight sarah he said goodnight karl karl left sarah threw her hands in the air at the thought of her lost opportunity then her phone rang yes she said into the phone im free tell me jamie had left london and katya for his farmhouse in france he had just arrived and his suitcase was still in the middle of the living room jamie sat down at a small table and looked sadly at the old fashioned typewriter in front of him alone again he thought later that same night the prime minister showed one of his ministers out of his office natalie was waiting outside natalie sir she came in with a pile of files put them down and started to leave again the prime minister spoke er im starting to feel uncomfortable we work so closely together all the time and i know so little about you it seems wrong theres not much to know natalie told him where do you live for example wandsworth the bad part my sister lives in wandsworth which exactly is the bad part right at the end of the high street natalie told him harris street near the queens head pub right yes that is the bad part and you live with your husband boyfriend three lovely children no ive just left my boyfriend actually so im back with my mum and dad oh im sorry said the prime minister no thats fine said natalie im glad hes gone she paused he said i was getting fat what he said no one is going to want a girl with legs as big as mine he wasnt a nice man actually in the end the prime minister stared at her right he said he appeared to go back to work then looked up again you know as prime minister i could have him murdered thank you sir ill think about it do that trained army killers are just a phone call away they looked at each other and laughed then she left the prime minister looked up at a picture of margaret thatcher on the wall did you have this sort of problem he asked it you did didnt you chapter four the real world back at home sam sat on the sofa while daniel walked round him thinking hard we can solve this he said to his stepson remember that i was a child too shes at your school right yes and how does she feel about you she doesnt even know my name and if she did shed hate me everyone at school thinks shes a goddess right said daniel so youve got no chance have you sam shook his head sadly billy the ageing rock star was being interviewed on a saturday morning childrens tv show by the wellknown presenters ant and dec so billy dec said there are three weeks until christmas and it looks like the problems going to be blue yes billy agreed i saw them on the show last week they werent very nice about my record ah bad boys said dec billy i understand youve got prizes for our competition winners yes i have said billy big pens with the winners names on them oh great said ant theyre wonderful billy said so if youve got a picture like this one here of blue one of the prizes you can write on it like this billy wrote a few insulting words about the pop group across the picture parents all around the country shocked by the language picked up the phone to complain there are lots of children watching billy dec said quickly oh yes billy nodded hello children heres an important message from your uncle billy dont do any schoolwork become a pop star earn lots of money and drink until you fall over and now its time for the advertisements and told the watching children quickly well see you soon bye in the next room joe hit his head against the wall peters best man mark ran an art gallery inside the gallery he was on the phone while three schoolgirls were laughing at a photograph on the wall of four large naked bottoms mark covered the phone with his hand and spoke to the girls actually he said theyre not funny theyre art he spoke into the phone again ok lets say thursday at my place great said peter but ive got juliet here can i pass the phone to her she wants your help oh no mark thought to himself ok fine he said into the phone thanks and be nice peter said im always nice you know what i mean mark be friendly im always mark hi juliet mark said he paused how was the honeymoon it was great there was another pause before mark spoke again so what can i do for you i need help juliet told him ive played the wedding video and its all blue and its got lines across it im sorry and i remember that you were filming a lot on the day and i just wondered if i could look at your stuff oh no i didnt really please juliet said i just want one picture of me in a wedding dress that isnt bright blue ok ill have a look said mark but i think i recorded something else over it so dont get too hopeful er i must go juliet was left holding the phone at fairtrade sarah was sitting at her desk on the desk in front of her was a picture of a goodlooking young man has there been any progress in your love life harry asked no sarah told her boss ive done nothing about it and never will because hes too good for me how true harry agreed sarah hit him lightly and he hit her back her phone rang and now of course you have a phone call said harry he turned to mia how are the arrangements for the christmas party going he asked good mia replied i think ive found a place a friend of mine mark works there whats it like good said mia its an art gallery full of dark corners for behaving badly in she looked at him meaningfully right said harry good well i suppose i should see it you should jamie was typing when he heard a knock at the front door of his french farmhouse he opened the door to a middleaged french woman good morning mr bennett she said with a strong french accent hello eleonore said jamie welcome back and this year do you have a lady guest ah no no change there its just me am i sad about that or not sad i think youre not surprised jamie said and you are staying until christmas yes good said eleonore and i have found you a perfect lady to clean the house this is aurelia behind eleonore another woman stood nervously waiting she was a pleasantlooking woman in her late twenties jamie stepped forward to greet her hello aurelia he said in careful french aurelia said hello very quietly also in french jamie said very slowly that he was very happy to have aurelia there confused aurelia looked at eleonore unfortunately eleonore told jamie like you she cannot speak french she is portuguese ah said jamie and thought for a minute then he wished aurelia good day in italian and told her in bad spanish that eusebio was a very good footballer she is ten years too young to remember a footballer called eusebio explained eleonore and muy bueno is spanish right said jamie sure well its nice to meet you and perhaps you can drive her home when she finishes her work asked eleonore of course jamie said con grande plesoro what language is that asked eleonore turkish later in the day jamie drove aurelia home along an empty road there was silence in the car and jamie looked out in embarrassment at the lovely valley they were driving through beautiful beautiful he said in italian aurelia looked confused mountains explained jamie in italian trees he added aurelia looked even more confused no right said jamie to himself stop talking now he continued driving chapter five special relationships outside downing street there were large crowds for the visit of the american president the car stopped and its doors opened in bright sunshine the president got out the prime minister stepped outside and shook hands with him he seemed quieter and less confident than the american mr president welcome he said im sorry your wife couldnt come she is too smiled the president although it would be rather lonely for her because im not married said the prime minister yes its sad isnt it ive never been able to get a ring on a girls finger im not sure politics and women go together really thats not my experience well the prime minister said as they walked into the building youre very handsome and i look more and more like my aunt mildred every day thats the difference between us they walked up the stairs im very jealous of your plane the prime minister added the president laughed thank you we love it too they passed natalie ah natalie hi the prime minister said good morning the president said hows your day natalie smiled and continued down the stairs that is a goodlooking girl the president said yes shes very good at her job said the prime minister american and british ministers and advisers joined the president and the prime minister for a meeting after some hours the advisers were still talking and there was no agreement no no no an american said we cannot and will not discuss that with you right said carter one of the ministers present but we thought you wanted our opinions this is unexpected it shouldnt be said the president the last american government said the same thing there are no new ideas here but if i may say so sir we hoped that your governments plans would be better carter told him the prime minister nodded his agreement as he had said though he didnt want to get into a fight and then lose it thank you alex he said to carter were not making any progress on this lets discuss something else shall we later the president and the prime minister sat alone in the prime ministers office well that was an interesting day the prime minister said im sorry we had to say no to you said the president we could say maybe now but then wed have to say no later i have plans and they will succeed we certainly got that message the prime minister stood up theres one final thing that i think we should talk about if you could just give me a second its something i feel strongly about ill give you anything you ask for the president told him unless its something that i dont want to give the prime minister went outside passing natalie who was carrying drinks he smiled at her shyly hi he said you sad man he thought to himself then he went into another office took some files and walked back when he opened the door he found the president and natalie standing very close together the presidents hand was around her waist natalie went red and moved quickly away but the president calmly took his glass for the prime minister for a second the world seemed to stop thanks for the drink the president said to natalie ill go now she said and she walked past the prime minister without looking at him natalie the president called out i hope to see much more of you as our two great countries work for a better future thank you sir said natalie the prime minister looked at the president he suddenly felt more confident the next day the two leaders took questions from journalists before the presidents departure mr president has it been a good visit a journalist asked yes excellent we got what we came for our special relationship is still very special the president smiled prime minister the journalist asked there was silence for a moment and then the prime minister spoke he looked very serious i love that word relationship he said it can mean anything cant it im afraid this has become a bad relationship the president takes everything he wants and doesnt allow the things that matter to britain we are a small country but were a great one too a country of shakespeare churchill the beatles sean connery harry potter david beckhams right foot and david beckhams left foot if a friend bullies us he stops being our friend we must be strong to stop the bullying he paused as he saw natalie in the crowd at the back of room and from this moment i will be stronger and the president should be ready for that the journalists were taking photographs and writing fast excited at having a real story the other ministers were all smiling mr president mr president what do you think sir the journalists shouted the prime minister looked across at him the president looked back angrily but with new respect then the prime ministers eyes turned to natalie who looked down at the floor the president left and the ministers were still congratulating the prime minister in his office when the telephone rang its your sister the prime ministers secretary told him he took the phone yes im very busy and important he said how can i help you have you gone completely mad karen said you cant be sensible all the time the prime minister replied you can if youre prime minister oh dear the minister for sport is on the other line no he isnt ill call you back no you wont karen put the phone down and then turned to her husband im the prime ministers sister she said to harry and so my life looks slightly boring what did my brother do today he stood up and fought for his country and what did i do i made a paper head for a lobster what are we listening to harry asked joni mitchell i cant believe you still listen to joni mitchell i love her and true love lasts a lifetime joni mitchell taught your cold wife how to feel did she said harry oh well thats good i must write to her some time and thank her a few hours later in downing street the prime minister switched on the radio beside his bed it makes you feel proud to be british a voice said so heres a song for our prime minister i think hell enjoy this jump by the pointer sisters played loudly in the prime ministers bedroom at first the prime minister just stood there then his arms and feet started to move and he began to dance he danced out of the door and down the stairs it had been a good day he was still dancing when he noticed his secretary he stopped erhe said trying to hide his embarrassment can we move the meeting with the foreign secretary to four oclock tomorrow certainly sir good thanks very much the next day jamie was eating breakfast in his farmhouse in france when aurelia came in and took his empty coffee cup from a pile of papers he offered her some cake would you like some er she smiled then she spoke in portuguese thank you very much she said refusing the cake but no if you saw my sister youd understand why thats all right jamie said in english ill have it just dont eat it all yourself aurelia told him still in portuguese youre getting plumper every day im lucky said jamie who hadnt understood a word she said i can eat as much as i want and i never get fat she looked at him and smiled his phone rang and laughing they both looked for it in the end they found it between the pages of the book he was writing after breakfast jamie decided to work in the garden he took his typewriter outside every time he finished a page he put it under his coffee cup aurelia came out took away the dirty cup and put down a fresh one thank you jamie said but as he spoke the wind caught his papers they blew up into the air and then towards the lake at the end of the large garden oh no screamed aurelia in portuguese oh no im so sorry its half the book jamie said worried aurelia caught some of the pages then ran after the others she stopped by the edge of the lake just leave them please jamie called theyre not important he stood up and followed her aurelia took off her dress jamie thought how lovely she looked in her underwear stop he called to her please just leave them aurelia of course didnt understand him and she dived into the lake jamie ran towards her shell think im not a real man he thought if i dont go in too its cold aurelia cried jamie stopped for a minute then took off his trousers and shirt and jumped in its freezing he shouted he and aurelia swam around after the papers this stuff had better be good said aurelia in portuguese it isnt shakespeare jamie told her in english i dont want to die saving rubbish that my old grandmother could write aurelia said just stop jamie shouted stop what kind of fool doesnt make copies i really must make copies of my work jamie said i hope there are no fish in here i hate fish try not to step on the fish oh what was that jamie cried as he stepped on a fish a short time later jamie entered the living room of the farmhouse with a cup of coffee aurelia was in a chair near his table with his jacket over her shoulders thank you jamie said thank you very much i know ill name one of the characters after you maybe you can put me in your story aurelia said in portuguese or give me of the money you make from it or jamie said thoughtfully i could give you of the money i make from it what kind of book is it she pointed at the wet pages she pretended to laugh then cry and then pointed to her heart ah said jamie he made a knife with his fingers ah murder said aurelia yes said jamie crime murder frightening asked aurelia she acted frightened to show him sometimes frightening and sometimes not he said but the writing is frighteningly bad there was silence for a moment neither of them knew what to say next i must get back to work said aurelia she acted cleaning and then maybe later you will take me home she acted driving he nodded they looked at each other its my favourite time of day driving you jamie told her its the saddest part of my day leaving you aurelia said they both looked away chapter six aching hearts mark was at home watching childrens television on a saturday morning when he heard the doorbell he turned off the tv opened the door and found juliet there with a large piece of cake in her hand she had clearly come straight from a bakery cake she offered no thanks he said good i find it difficult to share cake oh right can i come in er yes im a bit busy but they went inside i was just passing said juliet and i thought we could check your video i thought i could exchange it for some cake or she pulled sweets from her pocket for some sweets actually i was serious i dont know where it is ill look around tonight and then mark can i say something yes i know youre peters best friend juliet began and i know you dont like me very much he opened his mouth but she continued dont argue weve never become friends but i hope that can change im nice i really am well i buy a lot of cake but it would be good if we could be friends yes sure sure mark said coldly great said juliet feeling hurt but that doesnt mean well be able to find the video i had a good look when you first called and i couldnt see it so ill have to theres a video here that says peter and juliets wedding on it could that possibly be it ah yes said mark well yes she moved towards the tv and put the video in the machine ive probably recorded something on top of it mark told her all my videos have west wing on them now she sat down as the video started to play he stayed on his feet there juliet was walking down the centre of the church oh great thats lovely juliet cried this is just what i was hoping for i look quite pretty mark stood silently as again and again juliets face appeared on the screen youve stayed rather close to me havent you she said slowly they watched in silence as it became clear that there was only one person in this wedding video finally there was juliet leaving for her honeymoon waving goodbye the whole video she said all me yes mark said yes but you never talk to me juliet said you always talk to peter you dont like me mark didnt know what to say i hope its useful he said finally dont show it to too many people it needs cutting now ive got to meet someone for lunch an early lunch sorry he walked towards the door and then turned back i dont want to get hurt he said do you understand that he left without waiting for an answer outside the house he walked away then turned back then walked away again there was a knock on the door of the prime ministers office and annie came in annie my love my sweet my dream i need you to do something for me of course what would our countrys hero like annie said dont ask me why but you know natalie who works here the plump one do you think shes plump i think her bottoms quite big yes sir and she has very fat legs right well im sure shes a lovely girl but could you find her work somewhere else of course the prime minister looked out of the window for a minute then he sat down at his desk and started to write he had worked for hours when there was another knock at the door he jumped yes come in the door opened and a girl came in with tea it wasnt natalie prime minister the woman said thank you he looked at her and realized sadly what he had done late the same night daniel was in his office at home staring at a picture of his dead wife as the door opened and his stepson came in he tried to look more cheerful hi sam cant sleep i got some terrible news today sam told him what is it joannas going back to america your girl is american yes said sam shes american and shes not my girl and shes going back to america and thats the end of my life that is bad news daniel agreed we need kate and we need leo they went into the living room and put a video on titanic starring leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet came on in the middle of the film do you trust me leos character was asking up at the front of the ship i trust you kate answered they stood there with their arms out like birds flying daniel and sam put their arms out too daniel stood behind sam do you trust me he asked his stepson i trust you sam said fool daniel pushed him down onto the sofa and they lay back laughing you know sam daniel told him im sure shes a great girl but most people believe there isnt just one person for each of us there was for kate and leo there was for you there is for me shes the one sam replied right and her names joanna yes like mum daniel thought about this the next day jamie left his french farmhouse to return to england for christmas aurelia helped him fill every corner of the car with wine cheese and other presents for his family apologia jamie said in no known language grande familio grande tradizione di christmas presents stupidos he drove aurelia to the edge of town for the last time before the holiday then he got out of the car and put out his hand she took it well goodbye he said thank you said aurelia in portuguese i will miss you and your very slow writing and your very bad driving he smiled at her without understanding she gave him a gentle kiss on the mouth and then walked away jamie thought for a moment and then got back into the car he started the car and moved out into the road without looking a car drove into the back of his through the window of a record shop sam watched a video of billy macks christmas song behind billy seven girls dressed in red and white were dancing enthusiastically suddenly sam turned and ran home daniel ive got a plan he shouted as he ran into his stepfathers office

hair than in the photograph on sarahs desk have you been watching tv sarah asked him no yes every night oh good every day the nurses are trying to kill me nobodys trying to kill you darling michael

spending all that money on a woman who was not his wife all right ill have it he said quickly ill put it in some nice christmas paper the assistant said yes all right the assistant took the necklace and put it carefully in a box listen could we be quite quick harry said certainly sir i wont be long the assistant took out some paper and put it around the box there he said thats great i havent quite finished the assistant told him he took out a bag i dont really need a bag harry said nervously i can put it in my pocket this isnt an ordinary bag the assistant told him look he took out some little dried roses and put them carefully into the bag with the necklace then he opened another drawer actually i really cant wait harry said you wont be sorry the assistant said as he put more dried flowers into the bag i might harry told him looking around him just a few more seconds the assistant said he tied the top of the bag and then opened his drawer again have you almost finished harry

a kilo of oranges another one said in english i would like a oneday travel card said a fourth student seriously at one of the desks jamie was learning portuguese ive got a terrible stomach ache he said slowly in portuguese i think it was the fish when he left the building and entered the underground station he was still talking to himself in portuguese this is a very big fish he said loudly it tastes wonderful has she noticed you yet daniel asked sam no not yet but romantic films are like that arent they people only come together at the end of course daniel agreed i feel bad that i never ask you how your love lifes going sam said seriously ha ive finished with all that daniel said unless of course claudia schiffer calls chapter seven the night before christmas it was the evening before christmas and karen was allowing each member of the family to open one of their presents why dont you take one for yourself harry asked her maybe i will said karen i think i want this one she smiled as she picked up a small flat box a present from harry i have of course bought the traditional chocolates too harry told her but this is my other slightly special personal gift thank you karen said she opened it full of excitement then the excitement left her thats a surprise its a cd joni mitchell to continue your emotional improvement her husband said thats great my wonderful wife ha yes actually ill have to leave the room for a moment all that icecream darling could you make sure the children are ready to go ill be back in a minute she left the room slowly trying hard to keep the smile on her face at the same time a radio dj was talking to the nation its raining all over the uk he said and the big question is who is number one in the charts tonight is it blue or the unexpected success from billy mack well you probably guessed although you may not believe it its billy mack at billys record company where everyone was still in the office the noise from the celebrations was deafening you are the best joe shouted the phone rang and the room went quiet as billy answered standing on a table in the middle of the room hello he said hello billy the dj said were live across the nation and youre number one how will you celebrate i dont know either ill get drunk with my fat manager or when i put the phone down ill be invited to a lot of wonderful parties by rich and famous people lets hope its the parties said the dj and here it is number one from billy mack its christmas is all around oh no said billy not that rubbish again he put the phone down gina a young manager at the record company stepped forward holding her phone billy its for you darling billy took the phone hello elton of course of course of course send an embarrassingly big car and ill be there he gave the phone back to gina its going to be a very good christmas he said joe smiled at him looking rather lost among all billys new friends jamie stood at his parents front door with his hands full of christmas presents and rang the door bell the door opened look everyone its jamie his sister called back into the house his father mother sisters brothers and their children all came to greet him excitedly lovely to see you all said jamie putting down the presents and kissing everybody but ive got to go now but jamie darling said his mother shocked sorry jamie said there are some things that a

good night sarah he said good night karl i karl stopped happy christmas sarah smiled at him happy christmas as karl left sarah reached for her phone and rang a number hi darling she said trying to sound cheerful how are you is it partytime down there half an hour later she was at the hospital opening presents with her brother i love you michael sarah said i know said michael he paused i love you too karen stood in her bedroom listening to her new cd as joni mitchell sang about the pain of love tears ran down her face then she forced herself to stop crying put a smile on her face and went back to join her family peter and juliet were watching tv when their doorbell rang juliet went downstairs and opened the door to mark oh hi she said who is it peter called from the living room mark put his fingers to his lips and held up a big white card with a message on it say its carol singers its carol singers juliet called well give them a dollar and tell them to go away peter shouted mark pushed the button on a cd player at the sound of children singing christmas carols juliet laughed then mark held up other cards if im lucky next year the first one said he pulled out the second ill be with one of these girls the third card showed pictures of the four most beautiful women in the world but i just want to say the cards continued that to me you are perfect and my poor heart will love you until you look like this mark held up a picture of a very old woman then he showed a final card that said happy christmas he picked up the cd player and started to walk away but juliet followed him and kissed him gently on the lips mark smiled enough he said enough now later in the evening joe was drinking alone in his flat watching billys video on tv when his doorbell rang what are you doing here he said as he opened the door why arent you at elton johns i was there for a minute or two billy told him and then i had a lifechanging experience really come in said joe and what was this lifechanging experience he asked when they were inside it was about christmas said billy you realized that it was all around no i realized that at christmas you should be with the people you love

surprise yes ten minutes with elton john and suddenly youre in love with a man no im serious i left eltons place and all those beautiful girls to be with you at christmas there was a seconds silence well billy weve had a wonderful life together well thank you thanks man i feel very proud the two men put their arms round each other thats enough billy said lets get drunk and watch videos of naked women chapter eight the christmas concert in downing street the prime minister was alone very alone he looked through his christmas cards first he read a couple of boring ones he couldnt even read the signature on one of them the third card gave him a shock it was from natalie dear sir dear david happy christmas and i hope you have a very happy new year im very sorry about the thing that happened it was a very odd moment and i feel like a complete fool especially because if you cant say it at christmas when can you im actually yours with love your natalie the prime minister paused for a moment put the card down read it again and then made up his mind he picked up a phone and pushed a button jack he said i need a car now thank you then he left the room ran to his waiting car and told the driver to go to harris street wandsworth when the prime ministers car stopped in harris street the police car behind it stopped too the prime ministers driver turned to him here we are what number sir

prime minister and then to his driver terry i wont be long as they got out of the car with the bodyguard he paused this has to be a very private visit ok he whispered dont worry natalie said this was my school i know the way she led him away from the crowd to a side door karen and her family arrived at the school concert soon afterwards as they hurried towards the big hall they met the prime minister and natalie who were going the other way david karen said she gave her brother a kiss and he saw immediately that she was upset how are you he asked waving at the children are you all right

concert was a big success jesus mary joseph the cows sheep lobsters and other sea animals performed well in the christmas play even spiderman appeared on stage although nobody was sure why natalie and the prime minister watched together through a curtain behind the stage near the end of the concert one of the teachers went up onto the stage hiller school would now like to sing for you he said tenyearold joanna anderson will lead the singing a small girl came up onto the stage and started singing in a beautiful voice teachers and other pupils joined in the mariah carey song all i want for christmas is you behind them sam beat his drums enthusiastically as behind the stage the prime minister and natalie moved closer to each other the parents in front of the stage stood up joanna sang the title line for the last time on the word you she pointed at sam sam gave a smile of pleasure which disappeared as joanna turned again to the front at the end of the song paper snow poured down onto the stage then the back curtain opened to show a painted christmas scene and the prime minister and natalie kissing every parent in the school lifted their camera ah the prime minister whispered to natalie this is not quite as private as wed hoped what do we do now natalie whispered smile they smiled at the excited parents and wave they waved then they left the stage chapter nine love actually is all around at the end of the school concert karen said goodbye to some other parents while harry waited for her then she turned to her husband tell me she said what would you do in my situation what situation is that imagine your husband bought a necklace with a gold heart on it at christmas and gave it to somebody else oh karen would you wait to find out if its just a necklace or if its sex and a necklace or worst of all if its a necklace and love would you stay knowing that life will always be a bit worse now or would you get out oh god ive been such a complete fool yes but youve also made a fool of me and made my life foolish too daisy and bernie ran up to them pleased with themselves after the success of the concert and karen became a mother again bernie darling you

shoulder and turned joanna kissed him on the cheek and then ran back to her plane sam went happily to daniel who lifted him high into the air in a poor part of marseille in the south of france jamies

a small portuguese restaurant mr barros spoke to the owner where is aurelia why should i tell you this man wants to marry her he cant do that said the owner shes our best waitress at that moment aurelia appeared holding plates of food she saw jamie and her eyes widened she put the plates down good evening aurelia jamie said in portuguese good evening jamie she replied there was silence the
