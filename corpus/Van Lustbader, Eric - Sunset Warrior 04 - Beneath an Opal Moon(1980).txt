 the scarred man enters shaanghsei at sunset he pauses before the towering cinnabar escarpment of the western gate and turns in his dusty saddle above him a pair of ebon carrion birds spread their grotesquely long wings hovering startlingly set off by the flare of the sky piled clouds riding like chariots of crimson fire obscure for long moments the bloated ablate of the sun as it sinks slothfully toward the heights of the city already lost within the thickening haze it is a unique mark of the sunsets in shaanghsei that the city itself and the land all around it is first engulfed by the purest crimson sliding as the sun disappears behind the manmade facade into the amethyst and violet which heralds the night but the scarred mans deepset eyes slitted and as opaque as dry stones study only the winding muchtraveled highway behind him and the steady lines of jumbled traffic oxcarts piled high with raw rice and silk horsemen soldiers and traveling merchants businessmen farmers on foot moving toward him and the city the outbound flow is of no import to him his horse snorts shaking its head gently the scarred man strokes its neck below the short mane with a thin red hand the stallions coat is lusterless matted with the mingled dust of the highway the caked mud of narrow back roads and the grease of many a hasty meal the scarred man pulls at his hat a floppy felt affair which constructed anaesthetically does little more than conceal his long and haggard face satisfied at last he turns and slouched in his high and dusty saddle presses against his mount with his heels riding through the gate he raises his eyes as he moves watching the perspective changing deriving pleasure eric v lustbader from the shifting angles as he studies the endless basreliefs carved into the cinnabar of the dark western gate an epic monument to a dichotomy the triumph and the cruelty of war the scarred man shivers even though he is not cold he does not believe in omens yet he thinks it interesting that he enters shaanghsei through the western gate erected as a sinister reminder of a particularly odious aspect of mans nature but he asks himself would it really make any difference if he had made his entry into the city through the greenonyx southern gate the alabaster eastern gate or the intricate redlacquered wood and black iron northern gate then he throws his head back and utters a short bitter laugh no no not at all for at this hour of sunset they are all stained crimson by the lowering light the scarred man breaks into the populous surf of the great city and his journey is slowed by the milling throngs of people as if he is passing through a moving field of poppies he feels an end to long isolation far from the companionship of man a seemingly interminable time with only his stallion the stars and the moon as his family yet as he rides into the explicit riot of the city his mount walking through the clouds of jostling men and women and children fat and thin large and small young and old ugly and fair as he passes the bursting shops stalls stands with striped awnings the tangled buildings with their dense cluster of swinging signs advertising the tempting wares within he realizes that never before has he felt such an apartness from the warmth ofthe family of man and this peculiar alienness suffuses him with such completeness that his body begins to quake as if he is ill he digs his bootheels into the flanks of his mount and shakes the reins abruptly anxious to reach his destination through this vast kinetic sea he jounces metal jangling dusty leather creaking the grime of travel heavy upon him a torrent of filthy children their torsos ribbed like corpses brush against his legs like a separate eddy in this fetid surf and he is obliged to press his boots tightly against the stallions flanks lest howling they pull them from his feet he extracts a copper coin from his wide sash and flings it high into the air so that it catches the oblique light as it disappears into the swirling mass of pedestrians on his left the children abandon him rushing to follow the flight of the spinning coin they plow through the crowd tenaciously searching on hands and knees in the slime and offal of the street beneath an opal moon he moves on turning a corner at an acute angle following the street he inhales the rich musk of coriander and limes the heavy incense of charring meat the somewhat lighter scents of fresh fish and vegetables flashcooked in hot sesame oil as he passes the opening of a dark alley the thick sweet smell of the poppy resin for which shaanghsei is so famous hits him with such intensity it takes his breath away and he is dizzied the din of the city after so long on the road alone with himself is claustrophobically overpowering a constant harsh cacophony consisting of wails shrieks cries shouts laughter whispers chanting a glorious babble of voices testament to the indomitability of man within the deep shadows of the felt hat the scarred man is hollowcheeked a long bent nose leads inevitably to thick gnarled lips as if in his wild earlier years he had fought with his fists within the hempen circle as is the wont of certain of the folk of the western plains of the continent of man his hair is silver silken flowing long down his back held away from his wide wrinkled forehead by a thin plaited band of copper his face defiantly hairless exhibits the tracery of livid white scars puckering the flesh of his cheeks and throat like rain on the surface of a pond he wears a long traveling cloak of a dark indeterminate color owing to the grit of his journey beneath it a tunic and leggings of deepest brown hanging from his waist from a simple stained leather belt is a scabbarded curving sword widebladed and singleedged he pauses beside a wine stall on thrice blessed road and dismounting leads his mount out of the enormous crush of the thoroughfare as he strides into the dimness beneath the pattemed awning he spies the wineseller moonfaced and almondeyed arguing with two young women over the price of a leather flagon of wine with a sweep of his deepset eyes the scarred man takes in the curving bodies of the women their faces tipped high in anger but they are restless his eyes and while he listens and waits somewhat impatiently his gaze darts this way and that alighting on a face here the pale flash of a hand there for a moment he observes a man with eyes like olives and black curling hair so long that it covers his shoulders until he is met by another man and they depart the scarred mans head cocks at the thumping sounds of running feet shouts echo and diminish as a body rushes past outside elbowing through the crowd he turns away he asks the wineseller now free for a cup of spiced wine downs it in one eric v lustbader swallow it is not the rice wine of the region which he finds too thin for his taste but the heartier burgundy of the northern regions he purchases a flagon the sunset is fading the sky above shaanghsei turning mauve and violet as night approaches boldly from the east the scarred man leads his stallion left into a narrow alley crooked and filled with refuse and excrement there must be bones here hidden perhaps in the high dark mounds heaped against the sides of the building walls human bones stripped of all flesh all identity the stench is appalling and he breathes shallowly as if the air itself might be poisonous his mount whinnies and he pats its neck reassuringly the alley gives out at length onto green dolphin street with its dense tangle of shops and dwellings again the air is filled with the singsong cacophony of the city and spices blot out the more noxious odors half a kilometer away the scarred man finds the strawfilled sanctuary of a stable leading his mount to a stall he reaches up removing his saddle bags slinging them over his left shoulder he places two coins in the dark palm of a greasy attendant before venturing out onto green dolphin street he walks for a time down this wide avenue meandering pausing from time to time to peer into shop windows or turn over a piece of merchandise at a street stall he turns often to peer behind him as he moves from one side of the street to the other at last he comes upon a swinging wooden sign carved in the shape of an animals face the screaming monkey a dark and fumey tavern he enters and skirting the multitude of jammed tables and booths speaks to the tavernmaster for just a moment perhaps it is the din of the place which causes him to put his lips against the other mans ear the tavernmaster nods and silver is exchanged the scarred man crosses the room and mounts the narrow wooden staircase that folds back upon itself on the landing midway up his gaze sweeps across the smoky room bubbling with noise and movement natives of the shaanghsei region do not interest him outlanders do he studies them all most carefully and covertly before he completes his ascension he walks silently down the darkling corridor meticulously counting the number of closed doors checking to see if there is a rear egress before he opens the last door on the left inside the room he stands for long moments just inside the closed door perfectly still listening intently absorbing the beneath an opal moon background drift of sounds setting it in his mind so that even if he is otherwise occupied he will automatically hear any deviation then he crosses over the mean floorboards throws his heavy saddlebags onto the high down bed with its pale green spread moving iltunediately to the window drawing the curtains when they stop moving he pulls one side carefully back in the crook of one forefinger gazing out onto a heavily shadowed alley perpendicular to green dolphin street he is he knows within the heart of the city far from the long wharves of the shaanghsei delta still if he strains he can hear the kubarus plaintive hypnotic work songs filtering through the hubbub peering sideways he can just make out a slender section of the far side of green dolphin street a seller of herbed pork and veal is closing his shop and immediately adjacent the lights are extinguished in a dusty carpet shop as three brothers pearshaped and identical down to their embroidered saffron robes shutter the windows they are rich the carpet merchants thinks the scarred man letting the curtains fall back into place the more prosperous they become the heavier they seem to weigh as if they have been magically transformed into living embodiments of the taels of silver which they hoard the scarred man quits the far side of the room and satisfied that the curtains will hold in the light fires an oil lamp atop the scarred bedside table one corner is charred as if some former occupant had clumsily overturned the lamp he reaches into the recesses of his saddlebags withdraws the newly bought flagon of wine takes a long drink he washes at the nightstand until the water is black with grime and presently he hears light footfalls on the stairs his head comes up and his right hand grips the hilt of his curving sword he steps soundlessly to the wall adjacent the door and waits scarcely breathing a knock on the door a young boy tall and darkhaired enters carrying a tray of steaming food he comes to a halt seeing the room empty then the scarred man growls low in his throat and the boy turns slowly around he tries not to stare at the scarred man but he cannot help himself well says the scarred man put it down the boy swallows hard and nods he continues to stare the scarred man ignores this your father tells me that you eric v lustbader are quite reliable is this so his voice is thick and husky as if he has something lodged in his throat fright mingles with fascination the scarred man sees these often aligned emotions flickering upon the young narrow face well says the scarred man have you no voice then yes stammers the boy sir i have one close the door the boy complies have you a name the scarred man has gone to the night table he lifts a bit of fowl between the long nails of his middle finger and thumb the forefinger in between juts out oddly the scarred man swirls the meat in the thick brown gravy ignoring the long wooden eating sticks iying at the side of the plate pops it into his mouth excellent he says to no one in particular as he licks the tips of his fingers just the right amount of fresh black pepper he turns now kuo softly ah the scarred man studies him with an awesomely intense gaze but even though he feels fear kuo knows that he must not show it he stands ramrod straight concentrating on controlling his breathing he tries to ignore the sound of the hammering of his heart which feels as if it has lodged itself in his windpipe this is for you kuo if you do as i say a silver coin has magically appeared between the scarred mans fingers the boy nods hypnotized by the shining coin it represents more wealth than he has had in his entire life now listen to me carefully kuo my horse is in the stable down green dolphin street at the first stroke of the hour of the boar you must bring it to the alley at the side of this place this one he points one long forefinger toward the curtained window no one must see you do this kuo and once here stay within the shadows wait for me when i come there will be another silver coin for you is this clear kuo nods yes sir quite clear the secretiveness of his mission has excited him how his friends will envy him no one must know of this kuo the scarred man takes a quick step toward him not your friends not your brothers or sisters not even your father no one there is nothing for me to tell kuo says delighted with himself who would be interested in my delivering another meal upstairs beneath an opal moon not even that and the boy jumps at the force of those terse words then nods no sir the scarred man flicks his thumb and shot from the arbalest of his nail the coin arcs into the air shining kuos fingers enclose it and he is gone swiftly and silently the scarred man listens at the door then as the sounds of kuos descent fade he turns his attention to the food and for a time he is totally consumed in the act of eating sounds drift up to him given an eerie etherealness by the closed curtains the cries of the night vendors drunken laughter the heavy creak of woodenwheeled carts laden with to morrows produce and dry goods the snort of horses hoofs clipcropping on the cobbles a soft wind rustles the leaves of the plane trees lining nearby yellow tooth street night soft footfalls on the stairs and the scarred man is up wiping his greasy hands he bends extinguishes the flame of the oil lamp silently he skirts the bed opens the curtains dim fitful light from the thin corridor to the street seeps into the room as slowly as blood drips from a corpse the footfalls cease the scarred man has positioned himself well within the deepest shadows of the room with a good line of sight to the door he stands immobile one hand gripping the hilt of his sword as the door opens inward to reveal an ebon silhouette mistral comes a whispered voice who is the messenger says the scarred man the wind enter omojiru says the scarred man and the silhouette disappears as the door is closed there comes the sound of a lock being secured cascaras says omojiru have you found it the scarred man hears the tremor in the voice barely held in check as he watches the other in the inconstant light he notes the high forehead the flat cheekbones the narrow thinlipped mouth the intelligent almond eyes and thinks it was those eyes which took me in but now i know that he would be nowhere without his fathers influence i regret his involvement not because he is ruthless and unprincipled he would be useless to me without those traits but because he lacks the guile he believes he has that can be dangerous he sees omojirus lips compress into the narrow line of intransigence preparatory to violent action and he recalls this mans volatile nature how different you are from your kin omojiru the lyric v iustbader scarred man thought if your father but knew what you planned with me tell me omojiru hisses the words forced out of him as if they are under pressure and the scarred man looks away for just a moment embarrassed for the other i have found it at last omojiru moves involuntarily closer and now the quavering of his voice is unstoppable greed cascaras thinks and power how many would he kill to get them i do not have it yet what the enormous disappointment shows across the young mans face unmistakable even in the dimness but i know where it is ah then we will go to it yes says the scarred man that is the way of our bargain and he wonders at what point omojiru will try to kill him where omojiru whispers hoarsely is it the scarred man laughs silently how transparent he is he will do it now and take no chances we will go there together omojiru he says with great patience as if explaining a dif ficult and complex concept to a child yes yes of course we will i uh i only wished to know what to take on the journey and it would it would depend on where we are going now the scarred man laughs out loud i will tell you what to take omojiru the door flies open lock and hinges splintering and in that brief instant of shock as his head turns in the direction of the violent motion and sound the scarred man wonders why he heard nothing nothing at all the lights are gone from the hall and it is as if he looks out upon a starless night dense with a damp and clinging fog his hand withdraws his blade but already he hears the fearful sounds of struggle a strangled cry tom from the lips of omojiru conveying as much terror as pain the sound of a whirlwind in the room and across from him a great viscous bubbling a hideous animal grunting connoting coupling or death and with a shudder he realizes it is coming from omojiru something has him and is killing him the scarred mans great curving blade is out naked in the night lifted high over his head but something is careening at him from out of the darkness it is as if the night itself has beneath an opal moon abruptly come alive filled with vengeance and a cold implacable hatred his sword whispers in the air as it descends but encounters nothing fingers like bars of steel enwrap his right wrist twisting he fights jabbing with his left fist his feet his legs his knee lifts for a blow and something heavy smashes into it splintering the kneecap the scarred man grunts as the breath shoots out of him pain flares his left wrist snaps and he cries out his blade clatters to the floor he is borne as if weightless onto the bed a tightness against his chest and then more pain lancing through him turning his vitals to water he soils himself and is ashamed as the stench rises about him skin and flesh part his pulse pounds like surf against his inner ear and sounds become distorted his heart feels as if it is being squeezed in a vise pressure in his brain he cannot breathe and at the brink of unconsciousness the questions begin and repeat over and over until he must answer the meaning behind them gone from him the dark blood running out of his slack mouth his heart constricted beyond all limits and his brain screaming for release caring only about itself now yes hisses a voice from very near above him yes yes yes sounding to him as if it was coming from the other side of the world a balloon bursting against the fragile membranes of his eyes his mind screams filling his entire universe then his blood like water from a ruptured dam begins to fill the room soaking the bed wetting the floor coursing across the room rushing out into the black hall one city of wonders rubylegs moichi annainin awoke to the sound of the sea for what seemed quite a long time he lay with his eyes open listening with all his senses to the sluggish crash of the waves against the ancient wood he heard the clear sharp cries of the hungry gulls and thought for an instant that he was aboard ship then he heard the hoarse shouts of the stevedores and the singsong litany of the kubaru and knew he was in the port of shaanghsei this both saddened and uplifted him he loved this city perhaps more than any other on earth felt a peculiar and powerful affinity toward it though it was far from his home yet he longed most dearly for a ship under the soles of his boots in one fluid motion he was on his feet and crossing the wooden floor of the large room threw open the accordion jalousie windowdoors which ranged along the wall opening out onto the sea the sun barely above the horizon turned the water to chopped gold he lifted one huge hand grasping the upper lintel of the doorway leading out to the expansive veranda which ran the entire length of the building he breathed deeply of the damp salt air his nostrils dilated with the fecund scents while he rubbed distractedly at his heavily muscled chest you eternal he thought the sea the morning light spilling obliquely across the horizon played over his enormous frame his skin was the color of rich cinnamon and when his wide thicklipped mouth split in a grin which was often his white teeth flashed his eyes large and set far apart on his face were the color of smoky topaz though in certain low lights it was often said quite naturally in hesitant whispers reserved for the darkest of secrets that eric v lustbader deep within them one could see an odd crimson spark as of a reflection from some flickering flame his long hooked nose was further highlighted by a tiny perfect diamond set into the dusky flesh of his right nostril his thick hair and full beard were glossily black and curling overall it was a face filled with converging influences an intriguing admixture formed from facing adversity manmade and natural it was a foreign face according to those in shaanghsei who knew because above all else it held a riveting power alien to the people of this region of the continent of man moichi annainin stretched and his muscles rippled he sighed deeply feeling the inexorable pull of the sea just as if he were a compass drawn unerringly northward he was the finest navigator in the known world thus his present predicament was ironic indeed still he did not find it in the least amusing he turned back into the room moving in long lithe strides to a carved wooden table upon which sat a huge pitcher and a bowl of seagreen stone it was the hour of the cormorant the time had he been on a ship when he would return to the high poop deck to see all the sea before him feeling the tides and currents and breezes to take the first sighting of the day he bent pouring cold water over his head and into the bowl scooping it up in double handfuls splashing his face and shoulders he was drying himself with a thick brown towel when he heard the movement behind him and swung around llowan had come up the stairs from the harttins huge working area on the ground floor this tall spare man with the mane of silver hair like a giant cat was bandsman of shaanghseis waterfront in charge of all loading and unloading of cargo transported over the sea overseer of the citys myriad harttin llowan smiled hole moichi he said deliberately using the traditional sailors greeting glad you are awake a messenger awaits you downstairs he comes from the regent aerent moichi folded the towel and began to dress what news of a ship llowan are you not even the least bit curious why your friend should send for you at this early hour moichi paused said look here llowan i am a navigator and though i love your city dearly i have had the solidity of land under my feet for too long even though this be beneath an opal moon shaanghsei still i long for a good ships deck to stand upon he drew on coppercolored leggings over which he strapped leather sheaths covering only the outside of his legs he shrugged himself into a brilliant white silk shirt with wide sleeves and no collar about his waist he wrapped a forestgreen cotton sash into which he inserted the twin copperhandled dirks which were his trademark lastly he fastened a thin leather thong about his waist from which a silverhandled sword hung in a worn tattooed leather scabbard the diamond in his nostril flashed in the gathering light patience my friend llowan said since the defeat of the dark forces of the dolman in the kaifeng more than six seasons ago the sea lanes to shaanghsei have been clogged with merchant ships he shrugged running a hand through his long hair unfortunately one of the byproducts of peace is a surfeit of people all the navigators called to the last battle have returned home now it is only just that they get first preference for the ships of native registry you can understand that he turned sideways into the oblique light and moichi saw sharply delineated the cruel semicircular scar at the left corner of the bundsmans mouth arcing up to the base of the nose which had no nostril on that side why not be satisfied by the work i give you here my friend what awaits you out there his long arm extended sweeping outward toward the lapping yellow sea beyond the harttins wide ve randa that could be so compelling here you have all the silver all the women all the companionship you could ever wish for moichi turned from the deep voice stood in the doorway to the veranda staring out at the thick forest of black masts slashes of crosstrees the intricate spiderweb of the rigging of the armada of ships temporarily at rest in the harbor or off loading baled goods from faroff exotic shores too soon they would be setting sail again leaving shaanghseis clutter behind in their wakes only dimly he heard llowan saying i will send up the tea come downstairs when you are ready the messenger can wait i daresay alone again moichis gaze raced outward from the teeming foreshore riding the white crests of the rolling sea like a stormtossed gull recalling those long days and nights aboard the kiaku sailing south ever south with his captain ronin who had returned from amanomori transformed into the sunset warrior eyes clouded with memories of a lush jade isle un eric v lustbader named gone now beneath the churning waves and its lone sorcerous city of stone pyramids and gods with hearts as cold as ice a dreamlike ride on an enormous feathered serpent high in the sky through a land filled with sun onto a ship sailing for iskael his homeland where with his people he returned to the continent of man tojoin the kaifeng and the lightning of that last day of battle when he scrambled across a morass of seeping dead and dying warriors mounds of the slain and wounded friend and foe his clothes so heavy with blood and gore that he could barely move to greet the victorious daisan and what occupies his days and nights now moichi mused my friend we each owe the other a life more than either of us can repay and even now though he resides in fabled amanomori among the bujun his kin this worlds greatest warriors though we are far from each other still do we remain closer than if we were brothers joined in blood at birth for we have been forged upon the same anvil tied by the terror of imminent death and survived and survived moichi moved out into the sunlight farther south still than faroff amanomori was iskael so long since he had walked its blazing deserts and its orchards heavy with luscious fruit the long lines of stately apple trees whiteblossomed in spring ethereal clouds come to earth and in the blistering heat of the summer with the incandescent sun a huge disc of beaten brass to stand within their cool penumbra to reach up and pluck the hanging fruit ripe and golden he could not count his hurried arrival and even more hasty departure during the kaifeng he had spent all of his time aboard ship supervising the preparations for war plotting their course northward to the continent of man and all the while beyond the foreshore alive with frantic activity bristling with bright shards of weaponry and men saying their farewells to their families the dusky rolling hills of iskael beckoned forged by moichi and his people over centuries of struggle from barren ground into a land of plenty but that return for him did not count for the land was untouchable to him then he turned watching the head of the stairwell as yus head appeared she held a graygreen lacquered tray on which sat a squat ceramic pot and matching handleless cup she knelt before a low varnished table across from the massive wooden desk set against one corner of the room that moichi regarded despite his protestations as strictly llowans its hugeness made him feel uncomfortable of course he was used to the beneath an opai moon much more compact and functional writing desks built into the bulkheads in ships cabins but beyond that it reminded him of his fathers desk in the enormous bedroom in his familys house in iskael he went into the room observing yu she wore a creamcolored silk robe she was tall and slim with a fine pale face dominated by dark expressive eyes she had slid the tray soundlessly onto the tabletop and now sat with her hands in her lap and her head bowed motionless waitidg moichi could scarcely tell if she were breathing as he knelt at the opposite side of the low table yus hands unfolded like a flower reaching for the suns warmth and slowly precisely she made the tea ceremony he settled himself the quiet splash of the sea the cormorants and gulls cries a compradores shouts quite near the scent of the warm sun heating the salted wood and the barnacled tar the pale deft hands moving in their intricate orbits tying it all together mystifyingly moichi felt a peacefulness wash over him yu handed him the cup and he inhaled the spicy fragrance of the hot tea he lifted it slowly to his lips savoring the moment before he took the first sip he felt the warmth sliding down his throat and into his broad chest energy tingled his flesh after a time he finished his tea he put down the cup and reached out his hand put two fingertips under the point of her chin tilted yus head up it was a face filled with broad planes pale rolling meadows from which only the lowest of fleshy hillocks rose what other skills lie within that body he wondered idly and can it matter at all wasnt the wondrous tea ceremony more than enough yu smiled at him and her delicate hands moved to the fastening of her silk robe moichi stopped her putting his calloused fingers over hers holding them still he took his fingers away kissed their tips put them against her own then he stood up and bowed formally to her she returned it stillness in the long room he left her there as quiet as sunlight downstairs it was a completely different world kubaru barecheated and sweatsoaked trotted in and out of the wide wooden doors open onto the sprawling bund and just beyond the long wharves where the myriad ships waited impatiently eric v lustbader wheat dust stained the air hanging silvered in thick bars of sunlight slanting in through the doorway and the many windows lining the harttins seaward face llowan was talking with several stevedores perhaps discussing the disbursement of some newly offloaded shipment piles of brown hempen sacks and wide wooden casks filled the harttin separated by narrow mazelike corridors honeycombing the area moichi saw the regents messenger at once standing beside one of the narrow rear doorways leading out onto one of the streets of thecitys port quarter he was muscular but still with the thinness of a youth one side of his face was bruised a livid purpleblue fading to a yellow near the perimeter the flesh was still puffy the messenger recognized the navigator as soon as he saw him emerge out of the bustle of activity within the harttin he wasted no time with unnecessary formalities merely handed moichi a ricepaper envelope moichi broke the bluegreen wax seal of the regent read the note it said moichi apologies for the early hour of this summons but your presence is urgently required at seifuke soonest aerent typically moichi thought he had left off his new title old habits die hard moichi smiled to himself aerent is a rikkagin always will be no matter what other job he takes on the training is ineradicable and that i suppose is as it should be he is an excellent choice for regent of shaanghsei whether he is aware of it himself or no all right moichi said looking up lead on he waved farewell to llowan as he followed the messenger out out along the shaanghsei delta it was already sweltering even though it was yet early morning the jumble of narrow twisting streets which were among the citys oldest ran with seawater and diluted fish blood flies buzzed blackly and the thin nervous dogs rooted in the refuse heaped against the buildings walls hoping to find fresh fish entrails pairs of kubaru jogged by with loads hung between them on flexing bamboo poles bowed with the weight they were in a ricksha a twowheeled carriage powered by a kubaru runner there were many halts as they bounced along but their kubaru was very good and he quickly got them away beneath an opal moon from the frustrating crowds taking them down dark cramped alleys and bent lanes moichi watched the panoply of shaanghsei slide by him thinking of the changes within the vast city and because of those changes how it all stayed essentially the same its eternalness fascinated and awed him even though now there was no empress to rule just the roseandwhitequartz monument to her memory at jihi square where the citys delta met the regions major river the kiiro even though the greens and the reds or the ching pang and the hung pang as they were also known shaanghseis hereditary enemies united by the nowdead empress and their taipan for the kaifeng now held a balance of a truce between them even though the war which had gone on for more time than anyone living could remember and was some said the cause for shaanghseis creation was at last finished forever despite all these changes moichi thought shaanghsei abides prospering pushing ever outward mysterious deadly an entity unto itself alive and the giver of more pleasure and pain than any one man could conceive still for him it was not enough how did you get that he said indicating the messengers large bruise the young man touched the tender spot unconsciously with the tips of his fingers oh combat practice with the regent you know he never misses a day and he is an outstanding warrior even even now he looked away from moichi embarrassed by his blunder just then moichi felt a shift in the kubarus gait and he leaned out of the ricksha there was a disturbance in the street ahead and the runner was slowing they were out of the port quarter now and into an area swarming with shops of a bewildering variety a sort of permanent bazaar a cluster of people was blocking the street moichi saw and their kubaru was turning his head searching for an alternate route to the seifuke but before he could turn them around three greens separated themselves from the pack and swag gered up to the ricksha they were all heavyset men with greasy black hair tied back in queues they were dressed in black cotton tunics and wide pants shorthafted axes hung at their sides moichi was on the point of asking them to help clear the way when he saw one of the greens scowl and grasping his ax fling it whirring into the carriage it crashed into the chest erlc v lustbader of the messenger with such force that as his breastbone shattered he was propelled partway through the rickshas reed back the young man had not even had enough time to realize that they were under attack as blood spurted moichi jumped clear of the carriage keeping the small reed structure between his rolling body and the oncoming greens time seemed to leap forward as the period of shock passed and movement began all over people were running in every direction screaming and this helped somewhat but the greens were quartering two then three as the squat man who had thrown the ax leapt up into the carriage and jerked his weapon from the messengers corpse moichi had one dirk out the point lifted slightly higher than the heft crouched in the attackers pose he ran from them and they laughed as if they had encountered a frightened child instead of a warrior and they fanned out in a wedgeshaped path in a moment he had whirled one of the greens almost upon him and reversing the dirk threw it heavy hilt first directly into the onrushing mans face the green screamed and reeled backward from the enormous force of the blow blood gushed from his broken nose and he tried to spit out shattered teeth through his torn and ruined lips at the same time moichi was whipping out his second dirk rolling into the man he slashed once as he went by cutting the greens achilles tendon he picked up the greens fallen ax and hurled it without having time for a proper aim using his peripheral vision from whence he had seen the blu red movement heading toward him the airborne ax glanced off the second greens kneecap it hit him flat on and the man grunted as his leg buckled at the joint but he knew how to fall rolling and he came up the angle had been wrong and thus the knee was merely bruised not broken as moichi had intended he let fly his own ax moichi ducked and splinters of brick and mortar sailed at him filling the air as the weapon crashed into a building wall just beside his head the green was close enough now and moichi lashed out with his right leg feeling his arch make contact with the mans cheekbone at the precise angle bones splintered and the green moaned toppling over his tongue came out red and sticky almost torn in two by his own teeth but he was far from through he bounced off the wall hurled himself at moichi beneath an opal moon using his massive arms in a smashing blow against the navigators shoulder the dirk flew from moichis grasp and the greens fingers went for the throat the nails long and deadly moichi let the hands in looped his own around them slamming his balled fists into the others ears with such force that blood immediately sprayed out as the eardrums ruptured the green rose up bellowing with pain and moichi brought his massive hands together breaking his neck rolling the bloody body off him he rose watching the third green approach he was the squat man and he circled moichi with some caution his ax blade shimmered crimson in the sunlight moichi keeping the splintered brickwork of the wall at his back drew his silverhilled sword why did you kill him he said thickly we meant you no harm meant us no harm spat the green he was a red wasnt he for an instant moichi felt disoriented almost as if he had somehow slipped backward into time into the shaanghsei before the advent of the kaifeng what are you saying he breathed the reds and the greens are at peace the squat man hawked and a gob of phlegm spattered at moichis feet no more by the gods no more that illomened truce is thankfully at an end he brandished his ax menacingly it was unnatural we all felt ashamed as unclean as defilers of little boys by the great god of shaanghsei kaylro de war is returned to the streets of the city he rushed at moichi then and they fought close together for long moments breathlessly thrusting and counterthrusting each seeking a weakness in the others defence moichi shifted his sword to his left hand and in the same motion swung it at the squat man in a flashing flat arc thus occupied the other failed to see moichis right hand in time fingers extended and rigid as a board he turned far too late moichis hand edge first plowed into the nerve cluster at the side of his neck and the green crashed heavily to the cobbles the street was deserted now save for the strewn bodies the kubaru had long since disappeared but moichi could feel the eyes staring at him from the many shop windows taking deep breaths ignoring the fire in his left shoulder he hastily retrieved his dirks shoving them into his wide sash returning his sword to its tattooed leather scabbard he turned down a side street disappearing almost immediately from view eric v lu ader what i do not understand is what set it off that is one of the reasons for your hasty summons you know yes tell me then i am afraid that it is not a simple matter not simple at all moichi sat in a room on the second floor of the seifuke through the large leadedglass windows which were open now to catch any hint of a sea breeze he saw the thick verdant trees lining okan road still as a painting above the nearby slanting rooftops months before after the ending of the kaifeng they had cleared away the old palace of the empress levering its grandiose sleeping quarters and its vast work chambers its cold marble columns and long echoing halls not because of any disrespect to the fallen empress the monument in jihi square was more than proof of that the palace like its hereditary occupant simply belonged to another era in its place had been constructed a threestory dwelling smaller and more functional of rough oxidized brick relieved by glossy platinum fillwork at the interstices and edges this singular combination of the grittily stark and the softly sensual gave the new regents home a look of having been in the center of shaanghseis tumult forever this was the seifuke across a dark highly polished sandalwood table rikkagin aerent the first regent of shaanghsei sat in a highbacked chair of carved ebony he was a tall lean man with wide powerful shoulders thick braying hair and closecropped beard his face was the color of lightly cured leather seamed beyond his years it was dominated by a curving hawklike nose and dark eyes which could easily have been brooding but werent they were instead constantly full of light and life just the opposite of his dead brother moichi thought who had been doomfilled tortured by his own inner nature looking into those eyes of aerents one saw the rikkagin the superb military leader yes but one saw much more there was absolutely no opacity there they were clear and so deep that they seemed to go on forever and at the core what did one see more than a warrior more than a commander of men a man it was aerents deep and abiding humanity which in the end made him so extraordinary moichi thought and tuolin his beneath an opal moon brother his only family moichi shrugged inwardly war it was such utter madness was it luck that had allowed him and aerent to survive while tuolin was slain or was there some great force unknowable to man which guided the ultimate outcome of events he shrugged again it was like a return to the old days aerent moichi said the hate is there still even though none of them could say why or how it all began aerent nodded yes now it has begun again and it is as if the truce never happened they have short memories for some things the ching pang and the hung pang but how did it happen some skirmish between parties of the two the regent smiled ruefully if only it were that simple there might be some hope at least but as it is he shrugged what has happened he said deliberately putting his hands flat on the table is that dusings youngest son was found murdered late last night son of the taipan of the greens moichi whistled low in his throat and that is not all aerents heavily muscled arms straightened as he put weight on them into his hands levering himself up he stood weaving slightly for a moment until he was quite sure of his balance then he walked stifflegged somewhat awkwardly for the first several steps out from behind the barrier of the table crossing the room moichi would not be abysmally rude as to turn his gaze aside yet perhaps the sight of his friend walking compelled him to say i am truly sorry aerent about that young man the regent lifted a hand you did more than could be expected moichi he was a good lad he turned and smiled i thank the gods you are all right i still think i should call a physician to take a look at that shoulder now it was the navigators turn to raise his hand at least use some of this ice the regent said pushing a bowl across the table moichi acquiesced the cold would stop the swelling and it damped the ache at least for the time being moichi watched his friend as he made his careful way across the room to the window he looks more like an enormous insect moichi thought a praying mantis perhaps locked within the peculiarly articulated mode of locomotion devised eric v lustbader for him at length the regent made the window and sat down on the wide sill his long legs stretched out before him he put a long hand out feeling their gem hardness saying its gotten so i hate to hide them now i imagine it is not something one can easily get used to indeed no aerent smiled thinly and thought still luckier than some thank the gods i at least was spared the grief of soul which plagued tuolin strange that only at the point of death should he find love he was a warrior to the last and at the end a true hero thus shall he be remembered it is only just he sat straight as a ramrod looking inward while moichi waited without patiently thinking his own thoughts aerent felt the soft wind that sprang up drying the sweat on his back which had caused his green silk shirt to cling clammily to his skin then the sun had dimmed behind him as the quickforming summer thunderheads built up on the southwest quarter racing hastily inland as if late for some important assignation he sniffed once the incipience of rain it recalled to him like a flash of lightning that sleeting morning racing across the battlefield before the yellow stone citadel of kamado his sleek stallion thundering under him with such coordinated power and the fusillade he avoided by a mere hairsbreadth by rolling from his saddle but the ground was treacherous made slippery by the blood and gore of many so that the earth itself was hidden by the grisly mattress of the piled bodies his mount had stumbled and panicked and as it had swerved hysterically his booted foot caught the edge of the metal stirrup twisted sideways an inescapable trap he had been dragged across the humped ground over bodies and fallen weapons a hideous and lethal gauntlet armor had protected most of his torso and arms at the very end something had sheared away half his helmet so that he had mercifully passed into unconsciousness but there was nothing any physician could do about his legs the nerves were gone and in any case the damage to flesh and muscle was so extensive that they had had no choice they had left it to tuolins physician to tell him still he did not despair for he had no room in his bright soul for that bleak immobilising emotion there is something good in everything that happens aerent had thought or at the very least something important to be learned his body had been tested and he had come through now his mind was beneath an opal moon being put to the task here he would either survive or perish emotionally the physicians being useless to him once they had cut the dead flesh away he called for the engineers dismissing at once those who could not keep from smiling and who averted their eyes or who seemed bewildered by his summons for those were invariably the ones who told him that nothing could be done aerent did not believe this and at length he found a man who was both unafraid and who knew what would be required they should i feel be more than functional were the first words out of his mouth and aerent had been satisfied do it he had said money was no problem of course aerent was a hero of the kaifeng and already a groundswell movement was forming for his appointment as first regent of shaanghsei the city in effect had taken his legs from him thus the city would restore them to him no matter the cost the engineer he was the same man who had drawn up the plans for the seifuke had worked ceaselessly for a full season abandoning all other projects and at last he came to aerent with a long thin package perhaps a meter long wrapped in dark cloth it is done he said laying open the contents they were fashioned after the human skeletal leg structure the arcing bones carved from a rubylike substance that had all the tensile strength of the gem but also had the required flexibility the joints were masterpieces of construction gimbals and sockets of onyx and solid brass brushed with a dry lubricant which also protected the metal from moisture and daytoday wear it took half a day to fit the legs but then aerent would never have to take them off as he worked on the last adjustments the engineer had said of course we have many substances to mold over these bones so that the legs will seem almost real but he tightened the last screw and stood up admiring his handiwork to be quite frank i prefer them as they are it is what i would do if i were wearing them aerent had gazed at them for a long time searching perhaps for some emotion deep inside himself some guide yes he said at length i believe you are quite correct let us leave them as they are he put his hands on the ruby bones his fingers feeling along their lengths then with the aid of a chair eric v lustbader back he stood up for the first time and strangely the immediate sensation was one of enormous freedom it was not until much later that he realized how much lighter his new legs were compared to the ones of flesh and real bone the rain had begun aerents spine arched involuntarily as the first drops pattered against his back the sky above shaanghsei was dark and rippling like a great beasts underbelly thunder rolled distantly it was all right then after that the regent said moichi had to think for a moment yes i knew which streets to avoid aerent nodded good those idiots he meant the greens who had attacked moichi and the messenger omejiru dusings son was found in a room on the second floor of a tavern on green dolphin street which one the screaming monkey i am told not the most savvy of inns have you been there yet no i deemed it prudent to wait until morning nothing has been touched youve seen the body yes it was brought here dusing picked it up some time later how was the young man killed with great efficiency i am afraid it was no street brawl hardly accidental then no the sword strokes were as brutal as they were efficacious he was murdered by an expert murdered his sword was still in his scabbard i ascertained subsequently that it had not been used i see but why does dusing suspect the reds it comes down i think to the places omojiru frequented it was rumored that he was the black sheep of the family but the old man ignored this as much as he was able still it is fairly well known that the lad used the gambling houses in the tejira quarter territory of the hung pang the regent nodded soberly and then there were the girls it is said that omojiru had a voracious appetite for girls four and five a night none they tell me over the age of twelve his arms like corded steel and he was up again springing lightly across the room far more quickly than any normal man could beneath an opal moon manage it the mantis afoot omojiru it can be readily seen was far from a source of pride to dusing still he was family and of course a green all other distinctions have been made irrelevant by death moichi looked into his friends eyes i do not think that it matters to dusing whether or not the reds actually killed his son in that you are wrong moichi the regent said but i see your point the war between the greens and the reds is an inevitable course in shaanghsei i see that clearly now no truce could hold for long this city must find its own course not one man or one woman nor even a group of people can impose their ultimate will here even kiri knew that did not attempt to cross certain natural barriers and she was a hereditary ruler an extraordinary individual i doubt that anyone else could have united the greens and reds for the kaifeng well i am here now and i am not kiri i do what i can what i must to keep this city together but shaanghsei is an unstoppable entity and this is its intrinsic strength i firmly believe to tamper with it would be to risk the dissipating of its lifeforce and this i will not do you will not try to end the war aerent smiled i did not say that my friend i merely state what is one must learn in this capacity in what ways one can be most effective in shaanghsei it is often said that the direct approach is not always the most successful i talked quite briefly with dusing when he came with his escort to take the body of his son his mind is quite made up on this matter i am afraid now i must try other means to attain a reconcilia tion how can i be of help moichi said the regent nodded there are two things quite unrelated first come with me to the screaming monkey to aid in the investigation you mean you wish to prove that omojiru was murdered by someone other than a red aerent smiled i wish to get at the truth omojiru may indeed have been felled by a red assassin there is certainly enough motivation his gambling debts had risen alarmingly recently he shrugged perhaps he was expecting money from dusing which was not forthcoming the regent stood by the table now it had been brought from his old barrackshouse on dawndragon lane on his insistence it had served eric v lustbader him well and faithfully when he was a rikkagin he had said and it would do so again he had wanted no part of the ornate silverandcrystal desk which had initially been ordered by the contractors for this room he leaned over it now took a largebowled pipe from a black wooden rack and made himself very busy for several moments filling it with a dark tobacco only after he had methodically tamped down the full bowl and got the thing going did he continue his profile was to moichi as he said second i have just received a message of state from amanomori a fast clipper out of the southern outislands brought it in early this morning moichi sat up certain that here was news of his friend the daisan i am told he sucked at his pipe that the kunshins daughter will arrive on tomorrow mornings tide he swung around to face the navigator i wish you to keep her safe during her stay you mean babysit by god moichi cried standing up aerent smiled genially calm as ever you know azukiiro my friend do you believe that he would send us a helpless girl he shook his head by way of emphasis not the bujun no the kunshin sends us a daughter who he wants made aware of the world outside amanomori besides he grinned broadly the message of state specifically requested your aid in this matter aerent paused his pipe in his hand a thin curl of smoke drifted up against the side of his face making him squint as if he were gazing into the sun the regents dark eyes were on moichi never had they seemed so clear nor filled with such compassion he put his hand on the navigators shoulder my friend he said evenly dont think that i dont know you i understand your restlessness here your desire to return to the sea be assured that i have talked with llowan but for the time being there is nothing either of us can do there are no ships available now and we can only exert so much pressure on the shipowners guild the time is not yet right for you but soon eh soon rain beat down out of a low fulminating sky as they rode through the streets of the city they were without an escort an encumbrance aerent would not tolerate the seals of state were emblazoned on the regents mounts harness and on his own dark swirling cape and this was all he felt was required as for the newly rekindled war if dusing or lui wu for that matter the taipan of the reds learned that he had been attacked the assailants would be summarily executed by the beneath an opal moon taipans own hands an attack was hardly likely in any event since the regent was well known throughout shaanghsei there was construction on brown bear road and the ground there was mired in mud so they detoured taking quince street then park paradise until it bisected thrice blessed road from there carefully picking their way onto green dolphin street they dismounted before the swinging sign of the screaming monkey beaded in the rain and moichi called to a boy sitting just inside the doorway handing him two copper coins asking him to tend to their mounts inside the tavern it was dark the air thick they shook the rain off their capes inhaling the mingled scents of animal fat and charcoal fermented wine and sawdust it was quiet this early in the day most of the chairs were still raised on the tables still there were three or four figures seated eating and drinking a darkhaired woman with blacklacquered teeth lolled indolently in a far corner seeing them she let her wrapped cloak unfurl as if by accident and moichi caught a glimpse of a burnished calf and sleek thigh the woman sat up stretching so that her ample breasts arched toward him half spilling out of her lowcut robe the tavernmaster came out from behind the bar he was a short man with a barrel chest and legs like a bird his skull was hairless he rubbed his hands together and assumed an obsequious attitude in the hopes of forestalling the trouble which he expected was coming yes regent his thin voice was almost a whine how may i serve you some breakfast perhaps a cup of mulled wine on this terrible day neither aerent said we wish to see the room where the young man omojiru was found the other shuddered as if his worst fears had just been confirmed a monstrous act your grace simply monstrous the room is up the stairs last door on your left he closed his eyes for a moment when he opened them again they seemed somewhat moist forgive me if i do not accompany you but i understand aerent said nothing has been touched let me assure you your grace all has been left as as we found it tell me moichi interjected did omajiru pay for the room in advance eric y lustbader the tavemmaster peered at him why he did not pay for the room at all what do you mean aerent said the room was paid for by another man he arrived during the hour of the cicada omojiru did not arrive before the hour of the fox i am quite sure what happened to this man moichi said did you see him leave the tavemmasters face registered surprise why no but but in all the excitement it would have been easy for him to slip out do you remember what he looked like asked the regent the tavemmaster gave them as detailed a description as he was able they left him and mounted the stairs in the large room behind them the tavemmaster was taking down the chairs the darkhaired woman pulled her cloak about her again closing her eyes they could tell almost nothing from the room the curtains remained drawn and what little furniture there was seemed to be in place the bed of course was a mess the sheets and coverlets tom and rumpled stiff with dried blood and excrement and part of the floor was stained almost black moichi followed this out into the hall squatting down he scraped at the wood licked the tip of his finger blood he stood up blood on the bed and the floor a great deal of it almost as if an entire body had been drained he went back into the room aerent was on the far side parting the curtains he peered out the open window pulled his head quickly back phew someone ought to tell that tavemmaster to clean up that alley what a stink blood all over the place aerent moichi said you saw omajirus body could this be his blood the regent shook his head not the way he was killed the blood loss was minimal death came far too fast perhaps the other man whoever he is is omojirus murderer yes but that leaves us with the question of what happened to him moichi looked around once more they had searched in every conceivable nook and cranny and found nothing nothing but blood well the answer is obviously not here they found the boy outside throwing pebbles at passing bn ath an opal moon carts he danced a little jig at each hit the rain had turned into a light mist while they had been inside the screaming monkey the horses moichi said to the boy and he nodded leading them down the street just a moment moichi halted them as they were passing the dank black alley to the side of the tavern there seemed to be a lot of movement in the denseness small chitterings sibilant rustlings moichi went in and the others followed him into the shadows refuse and garbage excrement and a humped shape moichi bent down and hissed sharply a quick exhalation squeals of the rats scattering angrily before his looming presence there is something here he said something new to cause such activity in these normally nocturnal creatures his hand reached out fingers moving rapidly found stiff cloth a hard and irregular configuration beneath it blood stench and a sudden geyser of fetid gas death he choked gods it is a man together he and aerent dragged it into the light of day the boy turned away and vomited retching violently without letup the eyes were gone and of course the nose they had been busy through the night those creatures he could not have been there any longer than that they were both crouching over the corpse moichi glanced up saw the curtains blowing in the room they had just come from a neat drop he thought tidy let the scavengers of the city dispose of the body aerent was staring at the corpse his eyes widened by the pole star moichi look at this but moichi had turned his head knowing what the other had found and was watching the boy who terrified yet unable to leave had turned back he noted the boys paleness of skin under the yellow tinge the pinched look around the corners of his mouth the slight wildness of the eyes everyone in shaanghsei is inured to death moichi thought even the young just another fact of life here what would cause such a violent reaction in him it was a terrible death yes but was that the sum of it moichi who could have he grasped the navigators arm appalled have you seen this abomination death has erlc y lustbader been by my side for many long seasons until i think of it now as a kind of constant companion we have an understanding but this never have seen its like not on the battlefield not in the military prisons nowhere moichi nodded holding on to the boy now he looked again the chest was a gaping maw all white and black crawling with tiny things but there was nothing terrible about that it was nature the creatures of the world were due their right the truly monstrous thing was that all the blood was gone only man could do that because something had been done to this mans heart something perverse and evil slowly and calculatedly before he died and moichi still felt the chills reverberating through him making the short hairs at the back of his neck stand up a vestigial reflex from the time when man still swung through the trees walking with his knuckles scraping the earth someone had worked on this man with a cunning more than human and with an obvious dispassion that was quite a bit less than human not the quick flashing death of omojiru for this man moichi tightened his grip on the boys arm who is he the boy shook his head tell me then more sharply like the crack of a whip tell me the boy flinched closing his eyes but still he was silent tears stood out at the corners of his eyes tell me softly no no he said miserably i promised he opened his eyes pleading with moichi promised what he was relentless now you must tell me i promised him i would not tell anyone look moichi barked pushing the boy down on his knees before the corpse he is dead now dead do you understand the boy began to cry great gasping sobs shook him and moichi pulled him close stroking his head all right he said softly all right it does not matter now your promise do you understand what he was afraid of has already occurred you cannot hurt him by telling me what happened he is beyond that now he looked into the boys tearstreaked face kuo here sit here beside us after a time kuo told them what he knew of the man who had given him the silver coin and promised him another beneath an opal moon kintai how did they get it the manufacture of the saddle its as distinctive as a chop you know but theyre quite clever here given time they could probably come up with the exact town within the province and the horse anything there do you mean species moichi nodded aerent shrugged thats another matter entirely there is nothing remarkable about it but in any event he could have bought it anywhere really even if it were a luma they were sitting in the same room on the second floor of the seifuke where they had talked earlier in the morning kuo had talked for a long time before he had led them to the stable where he had quartered their mounts showing them to the stall where the dead mans stallion was housed he had brought it out at the appointed hour the night before precisely as the dead man had ordered only to find the horror in the alley where he had expected another silver coin and a few kind words i know little of kintai moichi said i am not surprised aerent faced the window his hands clasped loosely in front of him the storm had all but spent itself and here and there over the rooftops of the city he could see liquid wedges of cerulean as errant clouds followed in the wake of the rain the regent turned from the view of shaanghsei it is a landlocked region far to the northwest not much is known of it since its frontiers are beyond even the most northerly of the forest people with whom we have trading agreements what would an outlander from such a faroff place be doing in shaanghsei with the son of the taipan of the ching pang and who was it killed them both aerent tapped a long forefinger against his lips ruminatively i think what we must focus on is the difference of the modes of death i agree moichi nodded omojiru is killed almost instantly while the outlander suffers a most hideous and painfilled demise information what eric v lus ader we can only surmise that the murderer soughtinformation it must be of enormous importance to resort to that kind of torture my thoughts precisely aerent was tapping his lips again perhaps dusing should be told about this moichi observed it does not look now as if the reds were involved at all uhm dangerous to make that assumption at this stage i am afraid tempting though it may be to do so we do not know how many men were involved perhaps perhaps what moichi prompted aerent poured them wine handed moichi a crystal goblet imprinted with the regents seal in silver his brow was furrowed in worry there may be a military aspect to this that would quite logically involve both the reds and the greens there are still many peoples in the world who covet this port city with its vast wealth and strategic location surely you are not suggesting an invasion from the north the regent shrugged i cannot rule it out he sipped at his wine barely tasting it i can tell you one thing for certain my friend this matter is about more than just a murder much more he put his goblet down well we have done all we can for the moment i have sent for information on kintai and that will take some time to compile the newly formed shobai will be most helpful moichi laughed they had better by god without your aid those traders would have a tough time with the shaanghisei bongs the trading guild is a fine idea but who knows if it will work there are so many divergent members from so many lands they may burst asunder with a very loud bang he rubbed his hands together its getting late will you stay for dirmer another time aerent i am meeting kossori ach what you see in that layabout i cannot understand moichi smiled goodhumoredly i think perhaps it is more his personality that rubs you the wrong way regent huh i set no store by useless persons moichi you know that full well how they act is of no matter to me this friend of yours does nothing with his time helps no one tell me of what use is he to others or to himself beneath an opal moon he is a fine musician moichi said it was not the first time he wished he could say more that is as may be my friend but i have little respect for those lazy enough to loll about the squares of the city all day playing music and at night tonight he takes me to the sharida the regent turned abruptly away i will forget that i heard you say that moichi was puzzled is it so terrible then there are many slave markets within shaanghsei aerent spun around his face drained of colon do you not know what the regent touched his shoulder gently my friend you still have a great deal to learn about this city the sharida is a very special kind of slave market one i intend to destroy one day wont you tell me what it is aerent shook his head as if he were suddenly weary i will speak no more of it let your good friend kossori answer all your queries he ran a hand through his hair walking away from the table a little way his legs clicked quietly but now before you take your leave we have an important matter to discuss azukiiros ship tsubasa is scheduled to dock tomorrow at the beginning of the hour of the cormorant i trust that your latenight wanderings will not prevent you from meeting me promptly at three kegs pier eh he smiled moichi rose have no fear on that score aerent i will be there and by that time i trust there will be news of the current happenings in kintai he turned at the door by the way what is the name of this girl the kunshins daughter chiisai now it was moichis turn to smile a beautiful name at least what else did you expect said aerent it is bujun solo kossori lived on silver thread lane a crumbling narrow alley that belied its name there it was always dark with the shadows of the surrounding taller buildings days of twilight nights of perfect pitch blackness the alleys of the city had no night lights as did the wider streets avenues and squares this perpetual darkness did not seem to bother kossori on the contrary it amused him he professed to love the darkness with all that however he could rarely be found at home he preferred as aerent had indicated to spend his days in the wide sunsplashed squares of shaanghsei making music he was an exceptional musician adept at both the diets a wind instrument and the kyogan an ellipsoid stringed instrument quite thin the tuning delicate and most difficult to master on any given day kossori could be seen in his richly colored tunics at heidorii square during the morning and perhaps double hogshead square in the afternoon playing serenely as the swarms of people swept by him at a frantic pace he was not a large man but he had wide shoulders and a narrow waist which combined with his enormously powerful legs made him a figure of no little distinction his black hair was glossy and longer than was usual in shaanghsei the end of his queue reached down to the top of his buttocks it was but one outward manifestation of his inner iconoclasm he was a man of myriad acquaintances but few friends which made his deep friendship with moichi all the more unusual certainly it was his strangeness which in part attracted moichi who more often than not found himself bored by the company of people who seemed obsessed with the pursuit of wealth and women and no doubt it was those times more than beneath an opal moon any others that moichi felt himself pulled toward the crashing sea preferring the soughing of the humid salt wind through the straining lines the comforting pitch and roll of the tarred deck the flying spray at the cleaving bow as all canvas was let out before the following wind not that either of them lacked for women many was the night they would set out through the vast labyrinth of the city in search of the perfect wench they had of course never found such a one for then surely their sport would be through kossori had an enormous appetite for women not necessarily sex but seemingly more importantly for him companionship and more than once moichi had observed in his friend a serious even a desperate drive beneath their playful nights in the soft arms of the women of shaanghsei this evening kossori was in the center of jihi square in the shadow of the roseandwhitequartz monument to kiri the last empress of shaanghsei the sculpture was of a woman meta morphosing into the kaylro de the patron deity of the city said in legends to guard shaanghsei from all harm it was a seaserpent with a womans head and it was further said by those who claimed to have actually seen it that this was how kiri had died during the last day of the kaifeng that she had become the deity in order to help defend her city and who could gainsay them moichi thought gazing with fondness at kiris facial likeness in his adventures with the daisan he himself had been witness to stranger and more terrifying sights he approached kossori through the milling throngs rushing home to supper with families or in the many smokefilled taverns of the city after which a night of carousing would begin kossori was in the midst of a song he was playing the fliete it was one that he had made himself eschewing the more traditional substances of bamboo and ebony for silver the metal gave the blown notes a semisad plangency that was unique to this instrument moichi stood on the far side of the square watching and listening he studied the mans face noting again the angular features the high cheekbones the wide firmbridged nose and the light grey defiant eyes it was certainly a strong face bold and unconventional yet beneath that was a deeply hidden sadness echoed now by the music the song ended and moichi moved toward him kossori looking up spied him and smiled hola eric v lustbader hole kossori a fine tune is it new completed just this morning he stretched out an arm come and sit down in the shade of a legend it has been a hot day moichi glancing up said how long ago it seems to me the kaifeng uhm well the human brain has a remarkable ability for recalling the past pain and suffering dim thank the gods more quickly than the memories of pleasure which never seem to fade no matter how many years have passed he slipped his silver fliete into its worn chamois covering thence to its hard leather case we are well clear of that time moichi that i can tell you he shuddered the world is a far better place without the interference of sorcery there is white sorcery as well as black moichi said thinking of the daisan no my friend as far as i am concerned all sorcery is bad tsuzuru moichi knew this as a shaanghsei dialect word which had a number of subtle shades of meaning here he was certain his friend meant magic spell but he was surprised and said as much all these people he raised an arm flung it outward toward the crowded square taking in the people hurrying by know you as a fine musician kossori even the regent is not unaware i think but i know what you possess and i do not think fear is part of your makeup kossori sighed there is none else in all the world to whom i would dare admit this moichi but sorcery does indeed frighten me it frightens me because it conforms to no laws i can understand i feel impotent before it even with these he made fists of his hands put them in front of his face even poppa is no match for magic moichi laughed and clapped the other on the back come my brooding friend enough of this gloomy talk our world has been reborn again through the purging of the kaifeng and the dolman in this new age there is no room for sorcery on our world they stood up i think a bit of a workout at the doho will make us both feel a whole lot better quitting the spaciousness of the square they plunged into the narrow swarming streets at length turning left onto copper foil street it was the wrong end and they found themselves at once in the midst of three solid blocks of outdoor stalls so jammed with wares and milling customers that they felt like beneath an opal moon fish struggling upstream against a powerful current spices hung heavy in the air cinnamon marjoram thyme black pepper and heady nutmeg there were flapping multicolored rugs and pewter lamps molded into lewd vertical shapes fresh veg etables and dried fruits candies and exotic liquored sweetmeats fresh fish on shaved ice and crawling langoustes in their saltwaterfilled glass cases the cries of the vendors filled the air like the calls of strange forest birds carrying their strident staccato messages customers haggled prices and sellers cried out melodramatically pulling at their hair turning over their goods for feels of silver and winking to each other behind the purchasers back wire cages housed hissing lizards with bright beaded eyes and dry wrinkled hides smelling faintly of sweet loam small red and brown monkeys chittered from tiny wooden swings unconcernedly evacuating on the dirt below them while they pointed to the passersby yellow dogs with matted fur crouched tongues lolling by the sides of the stalls or ran loping through the angustate aisles children carried on their mothers back bawled redfaced tiny fists clenched or slept peacefully their heads at an angle resting on one shoulder at last they were through the crowds on the far side of the stalls here vendors had set up makeshift grills on which bits of meat and vegetables sizzled above coals glowing an incan descent white and brown smoke hung in the air pungent and tangy kossori led the way up a creaking wooden stairway the steps worn smooth by constant use they passed the first landing and on the second flight were obliged to press their backs against the wall in order to let a bulky man with an enormous chest and belly pass by them he wore only a loincloth and he was sweating heavily they knew him casually one of the many wrestlers who frequented the doho he nodded to them in greeting and went on past heading for the baths on the second floor they went to their lockers and changed into plain white cotton robes that covered them only to midthigh but instead of heading toward the doho proper they chose instead to climb the last flight of stairs to the roof they often went here because it was quieter not only more isolated but infinitely more pleasurable to be in the open as now beneath the lavender evening sky streaked with haze and the black silhouettes of the circling gulls above the distant harbor three sides of the rooftop were covered at their borders eric v lustbader by dwarf trees cultivated into gnarled twisting shapes these formed a dense tangle to screen the top of the doho from any prying eyes attempting to observe from neighboring rooftops the fourth side held a sharply sloping rock garden kept wet by a clever recirculating stream of water which dribbled over the rocks at their highest point this constant moisture allowed a wide variety of moss and lichen to grow in weblike patterns in the interstices so that the rocks appeared to be one variegated whole it was a beautiful sight a spot meant for deep contem plation and meditation and it had been there for as long as kossori had been coming here which was much of his life the floor of the rooftop was constructed of wide wood boards held down and together by hardwood pegs rather than nails it had been lacquered many times with clear coats that over the years turned the wood an almost bright yellow it was perfectly flat with excellent drainage outlets on all four sides so that there was never a problem with rain over the tufted tops of the stunted trees they could see the myriad oddly shaped rooftops of shaanghsei stretching as far as the eye could see seeming to roll right into the sea as they turned southwest the buildings hiding the low sweep of the bund and its long line of harttin the suns last degrees were slipping into the shimmering sea and now the reflected light became intense so that the nebulous clouds drifting high above the cityscape were lit an incandescent gold and plum even while the edges of the rooftops were darkening to black their outlines firming up and hardening after the glaring blaze they had endured during the height of the sunset this evening they were alone up here with the wind and the encroaching darkness spreading slowly westward like a prayer shawl drawn across the heavens by an unseen hand as they began their warmingup exercises moichi said tell me kossori what is it about aerent that rubs you the wrong way kossari waited until he had completed his deep breathing sequences before he replied its what he represents moichi i am afraid im just not very good with those in power the regents not a bad sort really its just what he has chosen to do but dont you think a ruler can be beneficent help the state through his power no kossori said simply i do not beneath an opal moon but surely my friend let me tell you something nothing good ever came out of power yes of course there are those whose intentions are at first good but the taste of power is too potent a draught and they too gradually get caught within its web there are no exceptions power corrupts in other words corrupts yes the mind expands with selfimportance while the soul withers into impotence there his head swiveled quickly and he whispered step back what quickly man do as i say moichi stepped back so that the line of twisted trees brushed against him he looked to where kossori was gazing south of them a shadow had materialized as if out of the night itself it was in violent motion yet silent and smooth running lightly then leaping across the narrow chasms between buildings as if it were but a wisp of smoke a cool breeze off the water rustled the spiky leaves of the trees and moichi shivered slightly feeling his muscles tense still he watched the shadow approach the fluidity of motion mesmerising for there seemed to be no disturbance to the continuous flow of energy run leap run leap now the shadow was spurting across the adjacent buildings rooftop the image abruptly blossoming but so swiftly did it move that moichi only recognized it for what it was as it landed on their own rooftop it was a man dressed all in matte black clothing wide trousers sash opennecked shirt his face too was black hidden by a mask which left only a narrow band of flesh just enough to give him unhindered vision exposed he came toward them over the polished wood dancing his feet seeming to glide through the darkening air in one hand he carried what looked like an oval box also matte black flat on top and bottom it dangled by a black rawhide cord his other hand was empty jhindo kossoris breath in a hiss close beside moichi moichi had heard of these legendary creatures they were hired as assassins and spies and it was said they knew so many methods to kill and maim to disguise themselves and to escape any trap set for them that they never failed in their clandestine missions this was the first time however moichi had seen one in the flesh and it recalled to him the tale the eric v lustbader daisan had told him of the jhindo who infiltrated the citadel of kamado to kill moeru but who instead was slain by his intended victim so jhindo were not invincible after all but he told himself soberly moeru had been a bujun and there were no greater warriors in all the world now here was a jhindo seemingly come against them kossori stood very still eyeing the figure who now approached them slowly he raised his hands palms outward calm and seemingly unperturbed please continue your journey we wish you no ill the jhindo said nothing but slowly lowered the oval box until its bottom sat on the roofs flooring he let go the cord he was a tall man and now as he spoke for the first time he seemed to somehow gain in height it is your ill fortune that you happen to be here at this particular time i cannot proceed further until all evidence of my departure has vanished kossori did not turn his head away from the jhindo but his low words were directed at moichi do not interfere my friend and above all do not turn your back on this one jhindo possess many small metal weapons which are quite lethal when hurled with precision face them and you have a chance i urge you to be on your way kossori said to the figure facing them yes said the jhindo i will be on my way just as soon as you both are staring sightlessly up at the stars he came at kossori then flinging out his left arm and kossori ducked away the movement now was almost too rapid for moichi to see clearly but the jhindo had feinted and from somewhere had brought out a thin twined cord knotted in the center this he whipped about kossoris neck and stepping behind him jerked back on the ends so that the knot jammed against the others windpipe kossori rose into the air with the force of the motion ugh moichi heard kossoris brief cry and moved to help but as he circled the two he saw that there was nothing he could do they were so tightly locked that any sudden movement might bring kossori under the attack of his blow he waited restlessly prowling it was an awkward position for kossori and he was kicking himself for letting the jhindo get the edge on him his breath was already laboring and the muscles in his neck were going numb from the rapid loss of blood his head throbbed and he beneath an opal moon knew it was just a matter of time until the cord would cause him to lose consciousness he used his legs first but the jhindo saw this coming and danced his own legs away then kossori used his elbows ramming them hard as if it was all he had and he heard at length the answering grunt and the cord went slack for just long enough for him to turn around so that he was facing his opponent a small blade flew out of the jhindos left cuff into the open palm of his hand and kossori let him have it watching the slash ballooning in toward him anticipating the angles vectoring on the final approach he used his right hand knowing that for him it did not matter for a blow on the inside of the jhindos wrist and the blade flew out into the night skittering brightly across the wood planks coming to rest at last bright as a droplet of blood shimmering but in its place was a jitte a doublebladed knifelike weapon and now the jhindos other hand was wrapped with a row of black metal spikes arching over the knuckles the jitte flashed in a blur the jhindos spiked hand following hard upon it a lethal onetwo strike the jhindo was appallingly quick faster perhaps even than kossori himself but there were many other elements that must be considered the jitte ripped aside kossoris white robe and his flesh shone palely underneath in the wan monochromatic light of the newly risen moon then the row of spikes went home sinking themselves into the flesh of kossoris right shoulder it was the end for the jhindq and to his credit his eyes registered this knowledge a split second before kossoris rigid fingers held at a peculiar angle slashed down upon him they moved more swiftly than the eye could follow the enormous force of the blow snapping the jhindos right wrist as if it were made of bamboo and in the same motion sweeping upward now in concert with the other hand breaking both of the jhindos shoulders and before his sagging body had time to sprawl upon the wooden rooftop kossori had delivered a final strike as quick and devastating as a living lightning bolt shattering the ihindos vertebrae moichi came up beside kossori feeling as if he were moving through water he had practiced with his friend many times had even seen the killing art of koppo used on wood and metal but never on another human being he was awed by the dev astation so few short bits of motion could wreak no wonder elic v lustbader kossori was never armed what need he of conventional weaponry when he possessed the secrets of koppo where did you letup that kossori the other was staring down at the broken body of the tall jhindo blood pooled darkly seeping through his ebon garb well have to call someone to clean up this mess he said almost distractedly kossori moichi put a hand gently on one shoulder are you all right quite good this one kossoris voice was like a ghostly spiral of smoke dissipating on the night air so fast kossori moichi stepped around in front of his friend saw the others eyes come slowly into focus he smiled and shook his head it takes a little time my friend the mental strain is the true difficulty in mastering koppo and of course one tends to get caught in a kind of killing vortex otherwise wed never have the strength he put out his hand and moichi glanced down at the humped body as broken as a discarded marionette ripped apart by a vengeful child kossori ripped off a strip of fabric from his robe and bound up the four puncture wounds made by the jhindos strikes i was lucky he said those things could have been poisoned moichi went the short distance over the wood to where the oval box squatted flat and ugly i wonder what he was up to kossori joined him nothing good of that i am certain open the box no doubt a clue to his nights work will be found therein moichi stooped and opened its lacquered lid he saw the queue first blueblack gleaming with fragrant oils that must have taken hours to apply the hair was carefully and expensively coifed this too had taken much time to achieve below the brown almond eyes were open as if in surprise the thick lips parted as if in incipient protest the yellow teeth still shining with a film of saliva blood had pooled about the stump of the neck a dark and brooding pond coagulating slowly held inside the vessel only by the thin coat of lacquer covering the interior i do not want any part of it i am asking you as a personal favor i beneath an opal moon my friend let me tell you i am no good at mysteries never have been that is an area of expertise over which you preside i would be a fool to dabble in anything about which i have so little understanding or natural facility but thats just it kossori if you will just listen to me i will explain how you can help me hmph kossori eyed him suspiciously but was now silent they were sitting at a rough plank table in a tavern on iron street that was crowded and bustling with business set before them were huge pewter plates filled with charred fowl and vegetables seared in hot oil and sesame seeds between them sat a firedclay flagon of yellow wine but their handleless cups were empty last night there was a murder uhm yes i imagine so one of several hundred in shaanghsei what of it if you will stop interrupting i mean to tell you kossori grinned and spread his palms placatingly by all means say on he commenced to eat while moichi spoke the strange thing is moichi concluded that the two were killed in disparate fashion kossoris shoulders lifted fell it only means that there were two killers simple he wiped grease from his mouth with the back of one hand moichi shook his head not so simple really omojiru was killed swiftly efficiently and coldly as if by a a machine kossori looked at him quizzically machine what is a machine too late moichi realised that he had no way of explaining this concept to his friend he himself had never seen a machine but had had it described to him by the daisan during their long trek through the thick jungles surrounding xich chih he would have to settle for a close equivalent i mean to say a nonhuman source i see and the other this outlander from where did you say kintai yes well how did he die oddly very oddly something about it was very disturbing he described what had been done to the mans heart kossori had put his eating sticks down beside the plate of halfeaten food extremely unpleasant i agree but there are more ways in the world my friend to get infommation out of eric v lustbader a human being than either you or i could collate in a lifetime the bujun it is said are the most adept at this kind of thing how do you suppose i can help two greens came through the front door glanced around the large room for a moment then chose an empty table just to the right of the door they sat down one facing moichi they began to talk i dont know really just a feeling he shrugged perhaps theres nothing after all the waitress approached them but they waved her off kossori patted moichis stout wrist anyway its good that you have an interest this citys not good for you you know moichi smiled the green facing him had looked over once he had seen it out of the corner of his eye but when hed taken a look the mans eyes had already slid away now he was careful not to glance their way he seemed deep in conversation with his companion i find myself more and more these days thinking of home i am afraid but thats all to the good dont you see kossori popped a last bit of vegetable into his mouth chewed and swallowed time you went home he smiled you dont know how lucky you are to have a family moichi had changed his angle slightly but he still could not see their hands he reached into his sash withdrew some coins finished he said and not waiting for an answer spilled the copper onto the table youre leaving way too much kossori observed wait for the change get up moichi said in an intense whisper we are leaving here right now he kept the greens in sight until they had closed the taverns door behind them on iron street with the crowds already somewhat thinned by the lateness of the hour he took them left then left again they moved quickly and silently into an alley which led out onto green cricket lane darkness closed about them within the alleys dense shadows at either end the brief yellow flickering of the wider streets night lights all right kossori said as they paused for a moment what did you see those greens he was peering ahead then behind i think they were looking for me but why beneath an opal moon offhand i can think of several reasons he told kossori about the earlymorning attack lets go but they had only taken several paces when he stopped abruptly put his arm across the others chest he nodded in front of us the sounds of boot heels rattling against the ground scraping against refuse the skittering of rats who goes there moichi called drawing his sword beside him he felt kossoris muscles tense as he readied himself for a long moment there was absolute silence even the tiny scavengers were still sensing the tension in the air moichi saw his shadow and kossoris flickering along the dank walls in front of him elongated past all human recognition limned by the night lights along blessant street behind them they seemed grotesque and monstrous in the terribly confined space moichi annainin out of the darkness in front of them we have come for you a solid voice used to command by what authority moichi inquired by the supreme authority of our taipan dusing of the ching pang lets take these scum kossori hissed in his ear but moichi ignored him what is it your taipan wishes of me he inquired that is for dusing to say the voice replied from the darkness moichi saw that now there was no light coming from the exit ahead to green cricket lane please do not attempt anything foolish the voice said and at that moment their shadows disappeared on the wall as bodies blocked out the light from blessant street behind them the room was lined all in bamboo split lengthwise and lacquered clear so that it gleamed in the low light emanating from the constellation of small oil lamps scattered about on low tables and mantelpieces above the skylight had been drawn back revealing the icy brilliance of the glittering stars remote seemingly as hard as diamonds the moon was in another quarter unseen the man who sat facing them was so enormous that he seemed to overflow the bamboo chair despite the fact that it was so outsized that it was obvious it had been constructed to order he wore saffron silk pants from which it appeared an entire tent might have been woven and a short wrapped jacket eric v luetbader with wide sleeves also saffron silk quilted and low cut in front so that much of his chest was exposed against the naked flesh dangling like a second heart was an enormous tourmaline which moved as he moved yet when one looked at this man one saw first his face which was etched with the hard cruel lines that only a lifetime of constant guerrilla warfare can cause it was a face flat and circular as a moon of a power as ancient as the delta upon which the nexus of the city was built dusing taipan of the ching pang the greens of shaanghsei belonged to the earth and it it was said to him gentlemen a voice like distant thunder as tactile as it was aural tea moichi nodded silently while kossori looked on still as a statue dusings eyes moved minutely and a young man in black cotton leggings and quilted jacket sprang into motion filling cups standing on an ornate silver tray on a table along one wall of the room moichi accepted his cup but kossori ignored his there was nothing moichi could do about this he sipped at the hot liquid dusing waited until he had taken that first drink before saying we worked well together once upon a time he meant during the kaifeng when all men were joined as if from one family but that was a long time ago the taipan had left just a long enough pause between the two statements to give the latter one an ominous note you are remembered with great fondness from that time by the ching pang moichi annainin he sighed and it was like a dam about to burst a sound of timbers cracking that is why i am showing you this courtesy instead of having you executed he snapped his fingers and the young man in black leapt to his side put a cup of tea into his hand it was lost inside that great fist he drained the cup in one swallow and how is the daisan moichi annainin he is well dusing good good the taipan had made his point why was i attacked this morning by ching pang moichi asked as you said yourself i am no enemy of yours yes dusing lifted a fat finger i had thought you a friend of the ching pang yet you traveled in the company of a hung pang spy beneatii an opal moon he was a messenger sent by the regent to fetch me to the seifuke that is all is it one eyebrow was raised interrogatively we shall find out presently he peered at moichi over the rim of the delicate porcelain teacup etched with gilt butterflies almost as if he were a demure girl on her first date i have had a talk with the regent a long talk and he has agreed to dismiss all hung pang from his service he has this did not sound at all like something aerent would willingly accede to do you doubt the words of a taipan for a moment his eyes blazed within their folds of fat then the light seemed abruptly extinguished and a thin smile played about the thick lips it did not reach any further but no of course not you would not be so discourteous would you moichi annainin no you have too many highly placed friends in shaanghsei not to see the supreme folly of such a course hmm he signaled silently for more tea got it can we get on with this kossori said and alarmed moichi gripped his arm what was that dusing raised one eyebrow what was that he reminded moichi of a great stage actor what was real and what was being put on for his benefit the taipan took the cup from his lips swung it from in front of his face mmm i see that your friend is somewhat more ignorant of the social graces than are you moichi annainin so be it then i shall come to the point directly i had been circling it only because it causes me much pain he put a great paw over his heart and now for the first time he rose up it is my son my youngest son omojiru murdered at the hand of the hung pang this is an unforgivable affront even your barbarian friend must be well aware of this eh moichi annainin i have no doubt that yore are now there was real fire behind his eyes and abruptly his face was transformed into a visage as awesome as that of some avenging god he took one trembling step toward them and moichi felt kossori tensing again prayed that his friend would make no move for though he had seen no sign of guards since they entered the taipans inner sanctum he entertained no illusions that they were alone here with dusing koppo or no if kossori made any threatening move they would both die within instants it is my son who is dead moichi annainin dusing bellowed the seed of my loins it is i and my family it is eric v lustbader the ching pang who grieve for him now what right have you to interfere in a matter that does not concern you but you are inaccurate dusing if i may point out i am already involved through the intervention of your own family as you put it the ching pang attempted to kill me this morning i do not take kindly to such a threat you cannot blame me for those deaths i have every right to defend myself i meant them no harm yet your companion was a known hung pang spy he was a messenger for the regent worse still the taipan cried by the gods moichi annainin the ching pang owe you no apology the hung pang work against us constantly war is war but now they have gone too far to coldly murder omojiru there is good reason to believe that the hung pang were not involved in your sons death dusing we have silence roared the taipan what do you as iskamen know of the hung pang or the ching pang only your friendship with the daisan stands between you and execution now omejirus death is our business and ours alone do i make myself clear eminently clear moichi said we are avenging that death even as we speak that is all you need to know he clapped his hands once chef will see you out without another word he swept from the room moving with astonishing grace for one of his enormous bulk i would as soon break his fat neck as look at him kossori said as soon as they were out on black fox lane moichi shushed him and they turned right walking down the wide thoroughfare without looking back he knew that the eyes of the ching pang were following their progress he kept their pace to a saunter even though he was anxious to quit this area of the city a ching pang stronghold one could trust no one here for they were all shopkeepers and streetwalkers priests and moneylenders alike in the employ of the greens gods kossori continued i can see no reason at all to have put up with that pretentious windbags pious sermon moichi glanced at him a smile playing along his lips that pretentious windbag as you so eloquently put it could have dismembered us at any moment he chose there must have been at least fifty ching pang waiting with weapons drawn behind the four doors to that room huh was all that kossori said but moichi knew that he beneath an opal moon was properly impressed so i take it youll stop this investigation then what gives you that idea moichi said oh well i dont know maybe the great hottentots ominous words back there had a bit to do with it otherwise i cant imagine where i could get such a farfetched idea he snorted moichi threw his head back and laughed clapping his friend on his broad back i would not worry overmuch about dusing kossori oh yes now youll tell me that his bark is worse than his bite i suppose his voice was heavy with sarcasm no no not at all i just have to be more careful in my movements thats all anyway i may not be here too much longer tomorrow morning i trust aerent will have the information i need on this land kintai and you mean to go there kossori exploded yes i guess i do at that i think we have reached a dead end in shaanghsei if we are ever to find out why those two were murdered kintai will be the place to begin want to come along me kossori laughed gods no i have no taste for that sort of thing at least take some time to think about it i am not apt to depart for several days yet all right if itll make you happy but i warn you the resultll be the same he rubbed his hands together now what say we forget all about this mystery of yours and spend some time at saitogcshi moichi laughed that certainly sounds relaxing kossori guffawed leeringly gods i hope not it was an ornate threestory structure of glossy black and vermilion lacquered wood reachable only across the exaggerated arc of a bridge that spanned the narrow but quite deep moat which completely surrounded the building it had been constructed on a piece of land originally quite near the sea but during the time of the idai na nami this great storms wave was said to have reached so high that it blotted out the sun who knows how long ago the sea had broken through sailing across the land with such titanic force that it literally gouged away the land forming two channels which became the basis for the present moat how saitogushi had been spared from eric v lustbader the devastation wreaked elsewhere by the idai na nami was still a matter of much conjecture within shaanghsei however onna who owned saitogushi was often heard to say that it was because she and her women were favorites of the kayiro de and had thus been spared many said that this must be so because without fail saitogushi was closed one night a week so that its inhabitants could make the pilgrimage across the city into the heart of the kubaru old quarter to attend services at the temple named after shaanghseis legendary protectress indeed the aura of the serpentine goddess could be felt as soon as one set foot upon the bridge whose metal railings were shaped into her likeness and set within the arched wooden floor was a golden basrelief sculpture of the kayiro de these manifestations of the supernatural combined with the high semicircular structure of the bridge itself to give one the feeling that one was passing through some invisible barrier leaving the real world behind entering some fantastic mythological kingdom where anything was possible this moichi knew by direct experience was far more true than any novice to these high portals could ever imagine for within saitogushis walls reposed the most sumptuous array of women gathered since the demise of tencho the doors were of beaten brass bound with a rockhard mirrorlike substance they opened inward as did those of a heavily fortified citadel and indeed the thickness of these doors would do any wartime fortress proud yet inside it was warm and comfortable off the long vestibule all visitors were divested of their street clothes no matter how rich and elegant they were hung with infinite care in tiny cubicles by faithful attendant children and the visitors led off to be bathed then they all donned the silken robes of the house thus did onna make it plain to all who entered her portals that they were under her rule no matter their standing in the community outside here onnas voice was law and in the time she had been running saitogushi it had not once been questioned bathed and newlyrobed moichi and kossori were led from the baths back into the vestibule the floor here was bare wood highly polished the walls too were bare but as they passed through a doorway that was almost a true circle save for the break at the bottom where the floor intruded they came upon the true world of saitogushi here all the floors were covered by deeppile scarlet carpeting within the small rooms which beneath an opai moon appeared to go on forever all the low tables round trays eating and drinking implements were of solid gold the cool dim hallways between these rooms invariably had ebony ceilings and fragrant cedar walls and other rooms somewhat larger were divided by delicate ebony railings sculpted into scrollwork there was even a miniature canton temple in one far corner of the sprawling spiraling structure so that patrons who were so inclined would not pass up a visit here for the sake of a missa or the spate of holy days which came in the spring and the high summer a woman in a pink silk robe with white carnations embroidered across it met them just over the threshold she was slightly plump making her seem the fleshly embodiment of the maternal symbol her face was painted white her lips a bright scarlet her teeth moichi knew were white and sparkling as were those of all her women which was in direct contrast to the freeiance prostitutes of the citys streets who were required to lacquer their teeth black the woman bowed to them smiling her black glossy hair swirled in an intricate pattern about her head stuck through it were a pair of ivory pins perhaps half a meter long she had dark laughing eyes and her chubby pale hands never seemed to be at rest but fluttered in the air about her semaphoring enigmatic messages she was always gay and excited as if she were the mother of the bride on her day of matrimony she leaned forward kissing them delicately on the cheek so nice to see you again boys she pointed a finger at kossori but you sweet i see youve lost some weight well well have you fattened up by the time you leave here her voice had the tenor of a fine musical instrument played by a virtuoso so pleasing to the ear that one had to strain to re member that it had taken her eleven years of intensive training to acquire it this was onna or more accurately onnashojin this was quite literally a title rather than a name it meant mistress which is precisely what onna was no one knew her actual name and because she had insisted on it at first she had become onna to all who spoke to her or of her theyre ready onna said she prided herself in knowing all her patrons wishes after they had entered saitogushis portals once at least as far as moichi and kossori were concerned she had never been wrong the women were waiting for them in one of the small rooms eric v lustbader golden trays with sweetmeats and a variety of exotic liqueurs from faroff lands imported under onnas express direction covered a multitude of tabletops two of the women were petite but wellrounded they had pale skin and features so startlingly similar they could have been twins and perhaps they were these were kossoris he never took less than two to bed actually he had begun with three when he had first come here but he found that late at night other women from saitogushis multitiered rooms would eventually slip into his bed after satisfying their own patrons it seemed that gossip of this nature spread almost instantaneously throughout the building kossori was a superb lover with an unusually high capacity for extended sex but even for him four women a night was more than he could handle afterward he confined himself scrupulously to two the third woman was one of a number whom moichi invariably chose she was slightly larger in frame than the other two brownhaired and with a dusky olivetinged skin which reminded moichi of the iskamen women he had left far behind try as he might he had never fully gotten used to the paleness of the shaanghsei women i will come to fetch you at the hour of the snake kossori told moichi as he gathered his women about him with his long arms more likely it will be i who will have to come after you moichi answered and the women giggled he was not hungry or thirsty and so the woman led him out along a passageway smelling of cedar its ceiling as dark as a starless night and up a spiraling flight of stairs to the second story she opened a door and they went in he heard the sound of the surging sea and he went across the room parting the fluttering curtains the window was open overlooking the ocean onna indeed never forgot a thing no matter how minute it might seem superficially she was after all in a business which was exclusively subjective and extremely personal and to forget anything a patron might desire would cause a disruption of harmony and harmony was in the end what saitogushi was selling this room was built as if it were a captains cabin aboard ship it might have been the only one like it in all of saitogushi or again it might be one among many there was no way of telling and did it really matter beneath an opal moon a low fog was rolling in billowing across the streets just high enough to reach a mans calves the moon was hidden by a bank of lowlying stratus perfectly horizontal hanging heavily in the otherwise spangled night sky moichi felt a gentle touch on his shoulder and he turned around the dark beams rose over her head obliquely faithfully following the slant of the roof the scent of cedar was strong even here but her musk was stronger she came into his arms and kissed him with her open mouth he felt the hot electric flick of her tongue her hands fluttered along his body and his robe slid sighing to the floor there was something tremendously erotic about being totally naked while she was still clothed and this reversal somehow reminded him of elena had he chosen this woman because of that her busy fingers reached for him and she gasped as she found him tumescent abruptly her robe was open hanging from her like the wings of a bird and she was using her thighs to climb his thick muscular body panting into the hollow of his neck outside in the sparkling branches of an ancient pine tree battered by the idai na nami but unbowed a great owl blinked twice into the lamplight streaming through the window called out hooting into the night in the dead of night he found himself standing in the center of a familiar street he was in shaanghsei but as he looked around he wondered how this could possibly be for the street was totally deserted it was green dolphin street he was certain for wasnt that the sign of the screaming monkey swaying in the wind almost directly in front of him yes of course and there was the alley where his head felt tight as if someone were squeezing it in a giant vise and now his nostrils dilated what was that stench he looked down in his hand was clutched a handwritten note he squinted but the uncertain light made it impossible to read nevertheless he knew what it said meet me in the allay on green dolphin street and he had come it seemed but why to this alley out of all of those on this long winding street the stench seemed fiercer and somehow he knew that it was emanating from the alley on the other side of green dolphin eric v lustbader street he should go there it was why he had come after all but he seemed frozen in his tracks as if split apart one half not obeying the other fear rooted him to the spot he did not want to venture into that dank dark alleyway and now he saw himself as if from a height an ethereal presence watching helpless as his body walked toward the alley no he wanted to cry out no stop dont go in there but he seemed voiceless too unable to quell the feeling of mounting dread which filled him as he saw himself enter the ebony portal yet now instead of disappearing into the shadows he found that he could follow himself and as he did the swinging sign of the screaming monkey green dolphin street then all of shaanghsei disappeared as if it had never existed he saw hovering his body bending over a lumped shape saw the corpse of the man from kintai destroyed blasted a hideous work of art an abomination and then he knew that it was not this pathetic remnant of a human being which had terrified him but rather that thing which had perpetrated this evil he forced himself to again look upon that horror so that he should never forget and in that instant an idea began to occur to him perhaps it was the angle in which he found the body or again the kind of wreckage made of its appendages something something chi wake up someone shaking him gently but he almost had it now and he turned away mumbling better let me do this another voice and a firm grip pulling him up up off the bed out of sleep annoyed he used the side of his hand in a swordstrike felt it caught in midair halted by a grip of iron take it easy my friend wake up it was kossoris voice moichi opened his eyes he left the bed without a word and dressed quickly looking back he saw her sleek skin dappled in moonlight and he leaned over kissed her lips then they were away it was the dead of night the moon had already long passed the zenith of its nocturnal path too low now even for the line of thick stratus it hung huge and swollen and pale as bone just over the black rooftops slipping slipping away toward the beneath an opal moon horizon the stars glittered coldly seeming as close as the moon we shall have to walk kossori said i dare not summon a ricksha he glanced at moichi are you all right moichi forced a laugh but his face was sober oh yes just i had a most peculiar dream thats all there were few people about now one or two drunks staggering along buildings walls a family asleep huddled in a sheltering doorway a pair of fragile old men rolling dice shadows flitted larger than life skittering along the brickwork like a magic lantern show as they drew near night lights then passed them aher a time kossori said quietly will you tell me then about the dream moichi sighed heavily still feeling mired in wisps of the nightmare i saw myself on green dolphin street opposite the alley where aerent and i found the body of the man from kintai a dog barked and then was still padding hungrily through the rubbish strewn helterskelter across an alley somewhere ahead of them i found myself examining that body again but now it seemed i do not know it seemed as if i was seeing it in a new light a light female voice came to them wafting from a darkened secondstory window in a building of brick to their led singing a plaintive shaanghsei folksong in the kubaru dialect what was different this time kossori asked thats just it i cannot remember he could make out the words now a tale of lost love ah well perhaps it is not so important kossori said in the village of my birth there is a fountain in a square dappled such a tiny square in among the beech it was there i met a man from the sea smelling of rich brine sealace twined about his feet dreams are often important continued kossori he shrugged philosophically at other times who knows i never saw him again my great merman perhaps he slipped away beneath the rolling waves but now i am in shaanghsei eric v iustbader and the sea is always with me my merman ah they came abreast of a house recently gutted by fire and through the gap could see all the way to the upper reaches of the city high on the hill lights still shone brightly in the large mansions of the walled city where the rich bongs lived guarded by the paid protection of the ching pang here and there sculptured trees defined themselves in the illumination taking on an almost celestial corona closer to hand a whippoorwill flitted from tree to tree calling now they had left the human voice far behind they turned a corner a light flared momentarily in an alley the smell of sweet poppy smoke was pungent in the air how did it begin for you moichi asked the koppo because he wanted to take his mind off the dream kossori whistled tunelessly for a moment imitating the whippoorwill trying to get it to answer him but either it could tell the difference between man and avian or it was gone moichi heard the clapclap cadence of their boots against the gleaming cobbles of the street clearly in the night the moonlight cast shadows as sharp as a swordedge it was selfdefence in the beginning kossoris voice earned eerily in the stillness only the cicadas gave concert even the night birds had disappeared i could never successfully handle a dirk or a sword he shrugged after i got beaten into the dirt twice i had had about enough the flames of shaanghseis night lights were narrow boundaries between which they passed like shades beyond there seemed to be nought but empty space echoing vertiginously i had no home then kossori continued and i went to the only place i knew well the bund when i was younger i would be there before dawn watching as the great three and fourmasted schooners maneuvered in to port or weighed anchor their bellies full of produce bound for distant shores and here he chuckled i used to imagine myself stowing away far belowdecks wedged between the huge sacks of rice where no one would find me coming out only when we were far out to sea too far to turn back and presenting myself to the captain some tall strong man with a face as tanned as leather offering to work as a sailor or even a cabin boy to pay for my passage no matter where we were bound what difference to me he laughed softly but i lacked the guts beneath an opal moon dhen or more likely i had too much common sense even at that age to attempt such a foolhardy adventure they would have made mincemeat of me he shook his head and began to whistle again this time dhe notes heavier darker seeming to come at random as if this meandering melody would help summon his past back to him still i suppose some things are best left to the imagination oh he pursed his lips preparatory to whistling then paused but you asked about the kappa ah well by that time i had already taken a piece of bamboo i had found in the market and was working out dhe placement of dhe air holes it was a crude fliete i admit but i was quite the crude musician then laughter in a doorway startlingly close by abruptly cut off i lived for a time on the ground floor of harttin along dhe bund staying just long enough in each one to avoid discovery he smiled once i fell asleep atop enormous sacks of poppy resin and dreamed dhe dream of emperors the tasstan took me for a while but of course there was never enough to go around of anything food clothing you name it it was heartbreaking and after several times filching halfrotting apples and moldy mushrooms i gave it up and never went back to the boats it was far too depressing a way of life there was nodding for me then nothing at all i wandered the wharves through the nights working widh the bamboo mete learning to play it slowly wonderingly ecstatically as one learns dhe body of a cherished lover sometimes dhe night cooks along dhe bund would hear me and call me in for a meal but when i tell you that music was my only solace i am not being melodramatic and it was only my music which stopped me from tying a stone to my legs and dropping into dhe harbor during these spells of depression i would spend long hours trying to reason things out morbidly returning to chat heavy weight which i would certainly need for i knew that i lacked the determination of spirit to voluntarily allow myself to go under and stay there until the water flooded my lungs he snorted an almost derisive sound that however was not all idle cerebration i had actually gone into the water one dark bleak night when i could no longer bear to be alone when even dhe stars and the incandescent moon ceased to be my friends and it seemed as if i was the only person in all dhe world everyone was a million kilometers away on those cold stars he glanced at moichi it sounds mad i know but eric v lustbader the more i thought of it the more convinced i became that it was real i began to shiver and before i really knew it i was stepping off the pier and was going down like lead down and down he shook his head convulsively thats when i knew it down there it was a hell terrifyingly real i wanted life to breathe to see the moon and stars the sun to feel the rain and the wind to live to live i struggled to the surface and dug my nails into the slimy wood of the wharf just above the waterline gaining my breath back after that i never truly contemplated suicide what was waiting for me down there in the deep was far worse than whatever little life held but that was a fortuitous night in my life no much more than that it was a kind of sign a symbolic turning point because it was just after that that i met tsuki i had just come from one of the bund taverns looking for a free meal without luck the one cook who liked me was off that night i walked back out strolling along the bund playing the fliete if only to distract myself from the complaints of my stomach the moon was full i remember a harvest moon they sometimes call it out in the countryside flat as a ricepaper disk and as glowing and golden as the sun itself in retrospect that was really the strangest part because thats what her name means the moon down the street an oxcart was approaching making its slow and creaking way she was redhaired and greeneyed with flecks of a soft brown swimming inside the irises her skin was full of freckles filled with the sun and she was wrapped in a seacloak of the deepest blue kossoris eyes had taken on a faraway look and he ignored the rumbling cart as it drew near she smiled when she saw me and stopped listening to the melody i still remember it want to hear it and without waiting for moichi to reply he pursed his lips whistling a meandering tune as rough and mournful as a barren moor on a chill winters morn while it was a far cry from the accomplished complex melodies kossori composed these days moichi nevertheless found within it a haunting quality prefiguring the artists development beautiful moichi murmured atop the oncoming cart a sleepy kubaru sat on a rough wooden bench next to him was a hunched figure asleep perhaps hood pulled over head the reins were slack in the kubarus hands as the ox mooched along a dog annoyed by the beneath an opal moon noise ran out from a doorway barking at the oxs heels until the kubaru lifted his head and shouted down at the yapping animal the cart trundled past them moving as slowly as if it carried within its wooden framework all the worlds worries it has a quality yes kossori said softly as if addressing the wind he had been silent for a time after the ending of the tune but still the awkward music of a boy you play very well she said to me and although i didnt i was pleased at the compliment who taught you she said i taught myself i replied really she raised one eyebrow you have real talent now i really didnt believe her and wondering what she could possibly want from me said now how would you know that lady i think perhaps i expected anger but instead she threw back her head and laughed then she pulled out the most beautiful fliete i had ever seen it was wrapped in tarcloth to protect it from salt air it was of ebony and all the air holes were rimmed with silver she began to play i could not in ten thousand years describe to you what she played or how but suffice it to say that she was a virtuoso i suppose that now you would like to learn how to play this way the laughter was still on her face yes i said yes i would then come with me and i shall teach you she lifted up one arm the seacape spreading out like a great wave until i was enfolded they had come to the end of the street a singular occurrence in shaanghsei where all thoroughfares seemed without real beginning or end it debauched upon a wide square one with which moichi was unfamiliar surrounded by twostory dwellings all with delicate wroughtiron balconies strung in an unending line like some grotesque confection the square was deserted and though these buildings were obviously entirely residential in nature they nevertheless had the appearance of being deserted an unthinkable actuality in crowded shaanghsei the townhouses of the rich kossori said as if reading moichis mind many of those who live within the walled city find it convenient to maintain residences in the citys lower reaches when they want to descend into the mud with the common folk he laughed a harsh discomforting sound how he hates authority in any form moichi thought and how he covets the wealth of the fat bongs who in truth rule this city kossori led the way taking them obliquely across the de eric v lus ader sorted square from right to left and presently they had plunged back into the twisting labyrinth of the citys streets taking purple peacock way into frostlight lane and thence to pearling fast road they were very far indeed from the nanking moichi knew shaanghseis main thoroughfare in point of fact they were a good distance from any wellknown landmark she took me to that inn kossori continued as if there had been no interruption in the flow of his narrative he was taking his time moichi knew but he was also aware that he was hearing a tale that was both extremely important to kossori and which he was quite certain no other had ever heard kossori was an individual of few friends and great reticence moichi was being accorded a singular honor and he was careful not to take it too lightly it was the same one where i had been thrown out earlier that evening now they were ever so solicitous for it seemed tsuki was wellknown here if she was not from shaanghsei then she was obviously a frequent visitor you did not ask her where she was from kossori glared at him as if he had been asking the other to get ahead of himself no he said slowly it never occurred to me to ask moichi shrugged and remained silent listening she had them bring food for me in all my life i never ate so much nor has food ever tasted so delicious to me in time i was sated and we went up a winding rickety staircase along a dark hall and thence into a warm room with an enormous high down bed against the far wall above its covers a double leadedglass window was open onto the now quiet bund and the ships at anchor just beyond the scent of the sea was very strong i can see where this is leading kossori turned to him no my friend he said quietly i dont believe you do he pointed left and turned off of four forbidden road into a crooked lane seemingly without a name i went to sleep exhausted the lane had begun to run on a slight incline and moichi became abruptly aware that they were ascending its winding way up a hill it was darker here the narrow houses piled one against the other without surcease too the citys night lights were fading left behind in the tangle of wider streets and the starlight where it touched them gave their faces and hands a slightly bluish cast beneath an opal moon i awoke late in the night kossori continued when the moon had already gone down i heard the cry of a gull quite close and that put me in mind of being on a ship far out to sea i think i even imagined i could feel the pitch and roll of the vessel beneath me i was still half asleep and turning over i came in contact with her curled body her warmth and the scent of her rich musk suffused me quite without thinking i put my arm around her she stirred and in her sleep put her hand against my cheek and neck with such tenderness and a kind of specialness that i cannot adequately describe save to say it was as if i were the first and only person she had ever touched in that manner i began to weep silent tears there was an inexplicable tightness in my chest and crying seemed the only way to ease it she awoke then by what stroke of magic i still cannot imagine her eyes so close to mine seemed like the sighting of a far shore through some mysterious telescope her kiss was the most beautiful in the world the lane in its myriad turnings and switchbacks at length crested giving out onto a rather wide street totally devoid of residential life large shops lined both sides without the usual secondstory apartment windows in evidence rather here the upper levels stared blackly at them windowless apparently used for storage only they paused for a moment moichi was moved by kossoris story but beyond that he found himself shaken by the intensity of emotions he felt being recreated it had obviously been an enormously powerful union and she taught you to play the fliete he said kossori nodded that and the koppo he pointed to a narrow alleyway running between the shops it is just behind there tonight the sharida but moichi grabbed his arm held him back the black death take the sharida kossori finish your story kossori smiled spread his hands but i have my friend i have told you all there is to tell but what happened to her where is she now this woman of yours kossoris face darkened gone moichi away very far away she disappeared one day as if into the very air i made inquiries all along the bund but no one had seen her if she had departed on some ship bound outward into the world no one knew of it and she never returned no kossori said never one hand went to his sash eric v leader but she left me this he lifted out an oilskin case from which he slipped a fliete of ebony and silver her fliete yes and of course theres the koppo she was an adept and as such well capable of teaching so now i know how to use my hands to break bones a feat which some believe is sorcerous in nature naturally thats not so well you know that ive taught you all the basic responses those as you well know are much easier to learn than the attacks but here is something im quite certain you dont know because we have never spoken of it koppo is nearly threequarters mental a gathering of internal energy a focusing an application derived through physical means he lifted his open hands up have you ever been in a battle with another kappa adept moichi asked i mean a real enemy not working with a teacher kossori smiled no and i doubt i ever will be there are extremely few koppo adepts in the world its tradition is ancient yet so shrouded in mystery that it is rare even to find an individual who knows of it let alone one who practices it but what would happen moichi persisted if you did come up against one hypothetically that is and as he asked the question he wondered what it was that was making him pursue this line of thought kossori shrugged concentrating im not sure really i doubt however that its outcome would be determined by force cunning is the key to victory against a koppo adept and quickness of course such battles i would imagine are quite brief even among adepts shock is one of koppos most potent traits its over almost before it begins but by cunning i mean that one would have to find a way of breaking ones opponents concentration a split instant would be sufficient unless one can manage that there is little hope of surviving such an encounter you see the koppos power is often called mizonotsuki or the moon on water the surface of a river gathers up the moonlight as long as the sky is clear but should a passing cloud slide across the moons face then the light is gone and darkness prevails he laughed and clapped moichi on his back but why be so serious my friend you need have no fear the only koppo adept you will meet would never harm you but moichi did not return the smile for his thoughts were elsewhere something kossori had said a word or a phrase beneath an opai moon he was not certain which had triggered off a remembrance up until now forgotten from his recent dream light and shadows it had something to do with then he had it and he exclaimed excitedly gripping kossoris arms i have it he cried i have it kossori the dream i had tonight it was trying to tell me something in it i recreated the scene of the reallife discovery of that body never mind that one was during the day and the other night the light pattern was the same that dappling was deep disrupting perspective just enough so that i did not know what i was seeing he saw kossori looking at him uncomprehendingly dont you see my eyes and therefore my brain picked up all the detail storing it away it was only my conscious mind which was fooled thats why it came out in the dream what came out in the dream that man from kintai moichi said excitedly i think he was killed by koppo crocus of sots it was a configuration of shabby tents a fivepointed star once no doubt they had been gaily colored but over the years sun and sand and rain and snow had faded the patterns until now they were barely distinguishable circling the tents at irregular intervals were reed torches set into holes carved into the tops of wooden pilasters these were quite old their paint and lacquer worn away so that the natural wood grain showed through and this had been smoothed and polished until it shone these pilasters depicted fierce warriors with great curling beards glowering expressions and rings through their noses mermaids with fishscaled tails wrapped around their bodies their upper torsos naked and very human bits of seashells and periwinkles peeping through their long winding hair or again maidens of war replete with ornate breastplates and greaves their calloused hands gripping long spears in all the place had the air of a rather disreputable carnival struggling to survive an anachronism in the midst of changing time they had at last quit blue illusion way the street of fancy shops and as they had plunged into the utter blackness of the alleyway kossori had said to him you must be mistaken my friend what you have described to me what was done to this unfortunate mans heart is certainly not koppo but a rather extreme perverse form of torture whose origins are totally unknown to me i do not mean his heart kossori but rather what was done to the rest of the body will you at least take a look at the corpse yes of course but i doubt ill confirm your suspicions beneath an opal moon he shook his head cant i interest you in something else let your friend the regent pursue this matter of the man from kintai no moichis tone was firm i want to see it through now and in any event i promised aerent there were pinpoints of light now in front of them where the alley apparently ended and he put a hand on his companions arm stopping him that reminds me aerent would not discuss the sharida with me what exactly is it i had assumed it to be merely another of the slave markets which proliferate throughout the city if that were so there would be no need to keep its constantly moving location a secret or to hold it only when the moon is down during that time some call the shallows of night it is illicit illicit yes kossori laughed as illicit as anything can get in shaanghsei aerent said that he meant to eradicate the sharida ah good luck to him say kossori breathed deeply of the night others have tried before him even the greens it is impossible best to forget its existence rather than attempt to destroy it but why is it so difficult you knew its location this night surely there must be others absolutely and that is what in the end assures the sharidas existence that sounds like a contradictory look my friend it is not a matter of how many people know of the sharida but rather who those people are he pointed ahead and they began walking again come i will show you what i mean thus they had come upon ebb tide square a curious name considering how far inland they were once perhaps it had been the site of fancy apartment dwellings but these had been abandoned over the years as the structures decayed and rotted until now they were totally unsalvageable as proper houses like the ruined stumps of an old mans once strong teeth shards of brick and woodwork still stood among the mortared and dustcovered detritus and in the center the rippling tents of the sharida if the makeshift structures appeared grubby and filled with patchwork it was a perfectly practical solution to the clandestine existence of the place for as moichi saw clearly now that eric v lustbader they were upon the flapping tents they were made so that they could be struck in a moments notice it would certainly be to the sharidas advantage to be able to pack up and disappear as quickly as possible too the shabbiness was in sharp contrast to the denizens of the sharida these were almost to a person swathed in dark anonymous robes or cloaks but once within the warmth of the tents they were obliged to let them fall open somewhat and moichi was startled to see that all of them men and women alike were of the wealthiest segment of the citys population they are the only ones who can afford to patronize the sharida kossori said in response to moichis query regarding this fact now you begin to see why the sharida is virtually invulnerable to any law it is these selfsame patrons who see to that moichi glanced discreetly around this largest of the tents the center one there were enough gold platinum and jewels here he surmised to keep the entire kubaru population of shaanghsei including the vast numbers who lived on the tasstan in the barber in food clothing and shelter for many seasons but what is it he asked that they can get here that they cannot obtain at any of the legitimate slave markets the sharida is a flesh bazaar like no other in the world the brazen torchlight illuminated kossoris dark gleaming skin highlighting his brooding eyes here only the most beautiful men and women young and in perfect health are sold and there is but one reason they are bought sex death for a time moichi said nothing his eyes wandering about the tent which was rapidly filling up now so that they were obliged to move closer together people now close enough to brush shoulders why do you come here then moichi said he felt overcome by shame and he was angry too for it was kossori who had brought him here without telling him what was going to happen i come here every so often to absorb by proximity some of the intense perversity which is its reason for existence but you brought me here without my dear friend i do not remember you taking the time to ask me about the sharida until we were already upon it and beneath an opal moon this after the rather explicit warning given you by the regent moichi was silent he was right he thought gloomily i cannot blame kossori for my own lack of responsibility but was it really that so simple an answer he thought not now life he had found rarely provides easy answers to anything that was for plays and such the real world was far too complex to distill down eliminate complexities and you invariably lose meaning it was after all that he had wanted to come to the sharida despite what aerent had hinted he concluded watch now moichi he heard kossori murmur at his side now it begins upon a stage at what had been arbitrarily designated the front of the tent a stage that moichi had not noticed before now stood a giant of a man he was shiftless and the titanic muscles of his arms and chest bulged glistening in the flickering torchlight as if they had recently been rubbed with oil this man had no neck his head as large and round as a great pumpkin seemed attached directly to his massive shoulders this night the sharida comes to shaanghsei he announced in a voice like a thawing river it is close to morning and before the dawn we will be gone it is little time yet there is time for celebration i am maomaoshan master of the sharida hunter of a flesh beyond the meat of food beyond the penetration of sex maomaoshan am the purveyor of a flesh designed for the ultimate sensations he reached out an arm as thick as a tree trunk sweeping it back theatrically thus do i direct your attention to the exquisite fruits of my nocturnal labors for my work is your gain and your only enemy now is the rising of the sun please then behold the coming of the supplicants of the dominion of death it was an effective speech moichi felt a slight shiver run through him though he knew this was but hocuspocus extremely artful he had to admit but hocuspocus nonetheless a section of the tents wall to the left of maomaoshan ballooned outward and a man stepped on stage he was tall with a finely muscled body of chocolate brown his startlingly pale blue eyes stared straight ahead oblivious to the intense stares of the throng he wore not a stitch of clothing naturally not moichi thought what need had these people to see their potential possessions with clothes on the thought might have been amusing had not the situation been so hideous eighty seasons old said maomaoshan the bidding begins at four hundred taels eric y lustbader moichi turned to kossori whispered four hundred taels of silver and when the other nodded thought my god that is a citys ransom movement in the crowd maomaoshan nodded four hundred taels yes sir and he looked around out of the corner of his eyes moichi saw a thin sandyhaired man in a dark cloak nod and four hundred fifty to you sir very good we are on our way but surely this magnificent soul is worth far more why for four hundred fifty i could ah yes madam thank you the bid is now five hundred moichi turned around saw a fieryeyed woman of indeterminate middle age she glared at him and he quickly turned back to the spectacle on stage so the bidding went until it reached a ceiling of seven hundred and fifty taels and the fieryeyed woman came rustling forward to claim her soul as maomaoshan had called the chocolateskinned man as soon as she had taken possession of the man the tent wall at maomaoshans side ballooned once more and a slender young woman stepped onto center stage she was blond and blueeyed as the bidding began moichi turned his head toward his friend whispered fiercely how can you condone this it is monstrous i dont condone it my friend i accept it as a part of life theres a world of difference there the bidding was sluggish and maomaoshan began to exhort the crowd regaling them with tales of the womans fiery nature fanciful yet effective and the bidding took off in a flurry he was quite a showman you yourself kossori continued do not believe in slavery yes yet you tolerate it here in shaanghsei why because well i suppose because its part of the way things are here i you see but the analogy kossori what they do here take a look on stage my friend no i mean a good long look have you seen anyone there who seems to object now that kossori mentioned it it seemed quite a curious thing none of the souls appeared in the least upset at what was transpiring perhaps they did not know but a quick query of kossori dispelled that notion no my friend all are quite aware of what is to happen to beneath an opal moon them it is not the finding of the souls which occupies maomaoshans time so much as the weeding out of the undesirables the slender woman was sold for five hundred taels you mean people queue up to to die moichi was incredulous that is precisely what i mean but why i cannot possibly perhaps he said quietly its that they desire release now a very special acquisition maomaoshan was saying from his lofty position there was a soft stirring within the throng as the wall parted and a man appeared he was not naked but rather was garbed similarly to maomaoshan he was barecheated though not nearly so big as the master of the sharida he wore dark pantaloons and high dusty boots around his waist was wrapped a wide sash into which was negligently pushed a curving dirk this man paused at the edge of the stage and reached backward as if through the tent someone were jerking viciously a woman stumbled after him out onto the stage immediately maomaoshan was into his spiel but moichi paid him no heed his eyes were riveted on the female she was naked as the others had been she was tall and a narrow waist accentuated her wide shoulders and flaring hips her legs were very long dont you see kossori said the sharida is part of the embodiment of the liberation of the spirit of mankind she had high cheekbones a thinbridged nose with delicate flaring nostrils like some animal at bay her defiant eyes were pure cobalt the deepest blue moichi had ever seen her hair was long flowing loose over her shoulders wild and tousled now as if she had been in a struggle it was the color of flame here the darkest part of the human soul is loosed and assuaged turned outward instead of inward to fester we all have it inside of ourselves in differing degrees her legs were the most beautiful moichi had ever seen firmly thighed and lightly muscled seeming to run on forever he lifted his eyes here lust and death commingle and his eyes locked with hers for just a moment a kind of shock traveled through his body until he was certain that his very flesh vibrated then the contact was broken the bidding began running briskly from almost every quarter of the crowd erlc v lus ader with but the minimum of intervention from maomaoshan he knew a prize when he had one what had happened moichi asked himself dazedly some message had been conveyed across the physical space separating them across the wider gulf of their different cultures the bidding stood at eight hundred and fifty taels hovering there for some moments come come maomaoshan proclaimed eight hundred fifty taels of silver is a paltry price to pay for this soul i can tell you honestly that a soul of this magnitude has not crossed my path in many a season now what yes sir my compliments the bid is now one thousand taels there was a concerted gasp as the throng reacted to the enormous price and heads craned to catch a glimpse of the bidder but moichi was staring straight ahead at the woman on the stage there was something peculiar her wrists she had moved slightly as if she too were interested in the person from the crowd who had offered that much silver for her and he could see now that her wrists were tied behind her back not only that but as she shifted further he observed that she had been working on the hempen bonds attempting to free herself he nudged kossori eh i thought you said that all who came here were willing kossori nodded thats so observe yonder moichi said indicating the woman on stage by the gods i dont understand the bidding resumed a rather elderly woman with a desiccated face upped the price to twelve hundred and a voice boomed out within the tent shouting angrily fifteen hundred now moichi turned to look for it was the same individual who had caused such a stir with his onethousandtael bid he saw within the crush of bodies a tall man in a black cloak which covered him from head to boot top moichi could not make out any features for the light was poor in that direction and the man had kept his hood pulled up yet he was readily distinguishable from those about him for he stood at least a quarter of a meter taller than any of them eighteen hundred called the desiccated woman the tall man shouldered his way forward brushing protesting people from his path he lifted his head to call out two beneath an opai moon thousand tsels by the god of iron and moichi thought he saw a cold glitter emanating from within the hood as if the light had caught the lens of an eye moichi turned back to the stage and found the woman staring at him and now he knew the content of her message twentyfive hundred tsels moichi bawled to make certain all could hear him what kossori caught his arm what are you about are you mad you dont have that kind of twentyseven hundred moichi did not have to turn around to know the voice of the hooded man he was closer now edging toward where they stood hard by the stage three thousand moichi called thirtyone hundred then in a lower tone you disgusting slime if you make another bid ill hey you kossori had turned around to confront the tall man while moichi called out thirtyfive hundred taels there was movement behind him as the hooded man fought the throng to get to him hissing i warned you now out of my way scum but now it did not matter because moichi had given the woman on stage enough time she had slipped her bonds and in a flash had torn the dirk from her captors sash having used the scuffle in the crowd as a distraction without a moments hesitation she plunged the full length of the curving blade into the mans flesh slipping it deftly between the third and fourth ribs on his right side there was so much noise now that moichi could not hear his cry but he was already moving come on he called to kossori and aware that the other was following him he leapt upward found a shoulder in the now densely packed crowd to launch him onto the stage so stunned was maomaoshan at this unseemly and singular conduct that he failed to react to moichis presence until it was far too late moichi hooked a boot behind the huge mans ankle and pulled maomaoshan went down like the side of a house moichi put his arm protectively around the womans bare waist feeling her warmth kossori was with him and as they made for the opening in the tents wall he glanced out into the crowd there his gaze alighted on the tall man who was flinging people from him as he made his way toward the stage eric y leader he was bellowing something that moichi could not make out for the din he had expected to see a sword in the mans hand by now or at the least some other weapon but the hooded mans hands were empty then they were through the wall and into one of the smaller dimly lit satellite tents this one obviously was where they held the souls to be bought because it was filled with young men and women all handsome all perfect ready to be possessed as maomaoshan would say the trio ran through this milling bunch who stared at them blankly murmuring to each other outside the night was cool some of the torches surmounting the ring of carven pilasters had uttered and gone out and moichi led them across the ruins of ebb tide square toward a darkened section of the perimeter he found the alley and they fled down this ebon path the sounds of their boot soles beating back for the moment the clatter of the pursuit moichi was certain who would be leading that pursuit and it was not maomaoshan this is madness kossori panted as they ranhow could you have save your breath my friend moichi said what is done is done they were coming up on blue illusion way and moichi knew that they were going to need some of that in order to escape the man in the black hood sounds echoed back at them in the narrow alley as the men from the sharida entered it anyway i doubt you would have allowed her to be sold to death knowing she was being held prisoner all right all right kossori brought them up sharply as they entered the wide street of shops theres little time so a debate is inappropriate now echoes behind them gaining rapidly take the girl right one block then take a sharp left youll know how to get home from there but what about you breath hot in his lungs shouts from behind them in the blackness of the alley at least they had stopped out of the line of sight of their pursuers never mind me kossori waggled a hand in the air i will decoy them now go quickly for this to succeed they must believe you and the girl are in front of me but go on now go on in a moment it will be too late and we shall all be caught like fish in a net off with you now moichi grasped the womans hand hurling them both down blue illusion way aptly named he hoped at the corner he beneath an opal moon resisted the temptation to look back rushed them both into the concealing shadows of the cross street looking up as they ran on he found he indeed did know which way to go and orienting he pushed them onward down black back alleys with the squealing rats leaping from their path along brightly lit streets and across treeshadowed squares until at length they broke out onto the nanking and moichi hailed a passing ricksha he was obliged to shout twice for the sleepy female kubaru appeared not to hear him at first he launched the woman unceremoniously into the covered section leapt beside her and gave the street address of his harttin as they began to move he slipped off his cloak covering the shivering woman and her magnificent nakedness they jounced along into the night aufeya he watched the play of muscles beneath the silk the strength of her thighs the tautness of her buttocks a pretty name she turned to face him watchful yet totally unafraid like some great mythical feline she was filled with a dynamic animalism what are you looking at she demanded have you never seen a woman before moichi went across the long room to the desk poured them both wine he turned holding one cup out to her her eyes never left his she made no move he shrugged put the cup down sipped at his have you i will answer no question she cut him off do not be so foolish as to think that because of what happened back there i owe you anything he went back near her sweeping aside the closed jalousies so that the bund quiet at this early hour and the peaceful harbor beyond were exposed it was still quite dark dawn some time away yet but small lit lanterns swung from spars like indecisive fireflies dispersing the blackness here and there if you had waited until i had finished he told her you would have known that i asked no question i was about to say have you ever seen anything more beautiful slowly almost reluctantly as if she half expected it to be some kind of ruse she turned her head away from him gazing out at the harttins view lyric v lusi ader moichi passed her stepping out onto the veranda and a moment later auieya followed what is a harttin aufeya asked it is the shaanghsei term for a trading warehouse all the wealthy bongs have harttin in which to store their produce as it is offloaded from incoming ships or awaiting exportation and this is your harttin no it belongs to llowan the bandsman of shaanghsei then what are you doing here waiting he went to the outer railing leaned his forearms upon it masts rose blackly before him combining with crosstrees and furled shrouds taut ratlines and rigging to give the scene a surreal geometric overlay aufeya took two steps toward him paused like a doe scenting water but unsure of what might lurk within the foliage lining its bank waiting for what for a ship querhida he saw her stiffen staring at him but she was silent a ship to sail home to iskael are you you are a captain or what a captain he smiled no i am a navigator he turned away his thoughts seemingly far away over the breast of the sea she regarded him for a time her cobalt eyes as black as coal he did not see it but she trembled ever so slightly her head shaking and she slipped her hands into the crooks of her arms folding them just below her high firm breasts as if trying to hold herself together the terror had come upon her again just after the storm had driven her small lorcha offcourse and into port it was a rugged craft but built expressly for sailing along the coast it was not an oceangoing vessel and thus could not withstand a fierce gale without the protection of a barber in which to ride it out she was dismayed to find that they had come upon shaanghsei a horrendous mistake but unavoidable now beyond the ports limits the storm still raged they had had no choice but to stay until the gale moved on or spent itself here the storm had divested them of some sorely needed supplies and she had gone ashore to restock that was when the man in the black cloak had found her terrified she had run from him and straight into the arms of maomaoshan thus she had been taken for the sharida it was but a clever ploy she knew in shaanghsei the open place where nothing could be beneath an opal moon hidden the man in the black cloak could not seize her directly without incurring repercussions he could ill afford thus he had made a deal with maomaoshan she had seen them talking knowing that the man in the black cloak was paying for her in advance her auction at the sharida that night would be a sham for she had already been sold then had come the intervention of this man and his friend fortuitous to say the least but was it she knew the deviousness of the man in the black cloak all too well was this but another ruse of his she would of course be more inclined to talk to a friendly face how could she be certain she shivered again involuntarily as she thought of the man in the black cloak and his vengeance dihos what a fool she had been but now the end had come no she told herself sternly not the end an end what that would be was still in doubt and she was going to do her best to see that she had at least some say in its formation you said you are from a land called iskael she said so abruptly that he turned his head toward her tell me about it where is it for instance far to the south moichi said farther even than amanomori she snorted derisively amanomori is but legend he shook his head have you never heard of the daisan of course everyone has he is my bondbrother and he lives there now he raised a hand as if brushing an insect out of the air but that is of no matter iskael is a land of hot sun filled with rolling deserts and rich orchards and the highest mountains in the world dominated by one peak taller than all the others it is said in the sacred tablets of my people that this mountain was made by the hand of god your people believe in one god yes querhida she stiffened and backed awayyou said it again her voice was a tightly coiled whisper you are playing with me you knew all along she was backed against the far railing her hands gripping the wooden rim with such force that her knuckles were bluewhite you work for him he heard the nearhysteria in her voice now knew she was on the edge stupidly took a step toward her no i promise i will die first she cried and whirling launched herself over the railing eric v lus ader moichi leapt wrapping his arms about her legs while she was in midair her forward momentum carried him mto the railing the top bar slamming into his stomach so that he bent over the air rushing out of him he almost lost her then but he gathered his strength and hauled her in back onto the safety of the veranda but he was offbalance and still somewhat out of breath and her planted heel on the back of his instep caught him by surprise he lurched backward with her on top of him felt her slim elbow drive powerfully into his side she fell on him twisting trying to get leverage and now he knew that words were useless the heel of her hand smashed against his shoulder but it opened her up and his right hand shot upward straight as a lance the blow to her cheek stunning her so that she fell limply at his side mouth hanging open eyes glazed and by the time she recovered he had made certain she was a captive audience listen to me aufeya he said calmly as she began to struggle listen to me and i will let you up i make no bargains with my enemies her eyes were on fire and if looks could kill he would be a charred corpse he slapped her across the face will you stop for a moment she stuck her neck out tried to bite him get away from me she screamed get away i will listen to none of your lies your tongue is like honey but i know who pays you exasperated without thinking he leaned forward putting his mouth over hers but what had begun as a means of shutting her up soon changed he felt her lips cool and moist under his and there was a slight taste like cinnamon tart and sweet at the same time as if she had just eaten a ripe apple and he felt the same kind of current pass through him that he had experienced when her gaze had first struck in the sharida perhaps she felt it too for her eyes flew open watching him several expressions darting across her features what what are you doing she whispered in a husky voice when he pulled his lips away moichi cleared his throat unconsciously relaxed his grip i meant only to silence you he began to move but she already held one of his own dirks at his throat he lay perfectly still feeling intensely her body iying half atop his her heat in proximity the heavy heaving of her breasts so close beneath the thin layer of silk there had not been sufficient exertion and looking into her eyes catching a hint of the struggle there beneath an opal moon he knew that she too had felt the certain magnetism now tell me the truth her voice was still low and thick with suppressed emotion or you will slit my throat he inquired she said nothing merely moved the blade of the dirk a fraction closer to the tendons in his throat you have already heard the truth from me aufoya i warn you do not fool with me now the razorsharp edge of the blade commenced to crease the skin you knew i am daluzan how could that be if you do not work for him i do not even know who him is he felt the trickle of blood even though the blade itself was out of his line of sight and he had not actually felt the thing moving i am a navigator remember i have been to many parts of the world i have been to dalucia twice daluzan names are unforgettable i knew the moment you told me yours she seemed to ignore this last and he became concerned that her hysteria had narrowed her perception to such an extent that she now would hear only what she wanted to hear where in dalucia voice as tight as a strung bow pulled back waiting for release he had the uncomfortable impression that the arrow was pointed directly at him the port of corruna we were bringing cedar and silks descrtbame la puerta de la corruna she snapped in idiomatic daluzan jao de carruna so she came from that city it was the capital of dalucia he knew he told her everything he could remember about the harbor she tossed her head hair like a burnished metal crown even in this darkness this means nothing if you are in his pay you are sure to be wellcoached my god aufeya what do you want of me the truth only who is this man you speak of i ask the questions she snapped as you wish yes as i wish she paused as if considering why should i waste my time explaining to you what you already know perhaps i do not know it she came to a decision let him sit up against a section of closed jalousies the point of the dirk hovered close ready to strike should he attempt to attack her eric v lustbader behind her silhouette he could see a thin line of pink begin to spread itself along the far horizon broken in myriad places by the hulls of the ships at anchor gray was in the sky now bleaching back the darkness and he could feel rather than see the wheeling of the gulls soon they would be calling calling to the ascendant sun this is my favorite time of the day the dawn moichi said the hour of the cormorant we call it at sea he thought of his appointment with aerent and the visiting bujun girl he would have to be going soon she watched him carefully if you had a ship you would go home to iskael that is what you said did he was surprised how odd no first i would go to kintai it was as if he had delivered a physical blow so shaken was she but she recovered enough to say what do you know of kintai nothing he said spreading his hands in truth i only learned of its existence this morning if you know something of the place i would be obliged how did you hear of it the tension had returned abruptly and he was wary again there was a murder here last night one of many i have no doubt but this matter is altogether out of the ordinary two disparate men were killed by disparate methods one the son of the taipan of the ching pang was slain by a professional and highly proficient swordsman the other was tortured horribly he was killed i believe by an arcane and ancient art known as koppo he paused here to observe what effect if any his words were having on her her eyes had gone dead seemed now as flat and opaque as stones drying in the sun this man was an outlander he came we believe from kintai she was on her haunches her gaze turned inward he could now have disarmed her with the minimum of personal risk yet curiously he decided to remain motionless i think we can help each other aufeya it seems more than coincidence that has thrown us together her eyes focused on him but she said nothing will you tell me about the man now i truly know nothing of him his name is hellsturm she said finally her voice containing a strange metallic edge and he has pursued me for ten thousand kilometers if i believe what you have just told beneath an opal moon me only i am left now to stand against him he has murdered cascaras is he the man from kintai she nodded kintai was where he had just come from where he had been searching for he is was daluzan like me a trader but what it is the man in the black cloak the one you bid against he is hellsturm and he killed the man from he killed cascaras she nodded again it could only be him her free hand curled into a tight fist pounded her knee oh how he must have gloated to see me here it was that cursed storm i should never have been near shaanghsei cascaras and i had split up he to come here to hide and i well it does not matter now it matters a great deal auleya he lifted out a hand palm upward wont you give me the dirk now no she said no i believe i believe i can trust you now but i dont know this place i will feel safer if i keep it for a while all right he said keep it as long as you like she put it away within the silk pants he had given her they were a spare pair of llowans work pants which he had liberated on their way upstairs as they came into the harttin his would have been far too big on her the sea was awash in pink and pale yellow as abruptly the sun heaved its top over the horizon true to form the gulls began their crying as they dipped toward the seas flat face searching out their breakfast their melancholy calling filled the air you said cascaras was tortured aufeya said how bad was it do you think as bad as it could possibly be im afraid he described to her what they had discovered she shuddered and some of the life seemed to go out of her for a moment then i must assume that hellsturm has broken cascaras that he is now in possession of cascaras half of the information information about what is there some form of attack being planned against shaanghsei he asked echoing aerents fear aufeya laughed harshly oh no she said nothing so mundane i assure you eric v lustbader below them along the bund sounds were starting up at such a rapid pace that they quickly began to overlap one another the commencement of another days city serenade an armada of fishing boats was already out at sea having successfully avoided the clogged shipping lanes through which laden clippers and schooners from the world of man were now maneuvering in order to take the spaces dockside vacated by ships that had spent the night in the barber and that now fully loaded had raised canvas and weighed anchor just before first light these passed each other in a stately quotidian dance making up much of the momings routine he had so many questions to ask her and so little time in which to ascertain the answers in fact he realized guiltily he had no time at all the hour of the cormorant was here and he must be off no matter how much he wished to stay with aufeya he had his duty to think of not only to the regent but to the daisan himself i want you to stay here he said standing up he could hear the movement downstairs of the kubaru and the stevedores he thought briefly about asking llowan for help but almost immediately realized that would be an unfair request the bondsman already had more to do than he had time in which to work each day and anyway kossori would be better able to handle aufeyas protection until he could return and return he would as quickly as possible with aerent in tow auleya rose also her beautiful face troubled where are you going her hand instinctively reached into her pants for the hilt of the dirk i have an appointment an official one i am afraid and it is one i dare not miss then let me go with you no i am sorry aufeya that is impossible this is an affair of state i wont stay here alone the fire had come back into her eyes and he was thankful of that she was quite a capable individual when aroused he smiled to himself at the double meaning i do not mean you to stay alone although i am quite certain that this is the safest place in all of shaanghsei for you kossori will guard you until i return he was with me last night at the sharida the man who decoyed hellsturm and the others she nodded yes quite clever but what has taken him so long beneath an opal moon he would not risk coming here until dawn brought out the citys crowds there was a chance they might try to follow him once they realized we were not with him there was a clatter on the stairs as if on cue aufeya drew the dirk with lightning speed and even moichi who was certain he knew who it was climbing the stairs felt his hand close about the hilt of his sword but it was indeed kossori and he relaxed visibly making the obligatory introductions there was no time for more than that as his friend went to the desk downing the wine he had poured for aufeya moichi told kossori he would be back as soon as he could and not to let aufeya out of his sight until then you had no trouble slipping away he asked i led them a merry chase my friend you can be sure kossori replied pouring himself another cup of wine downing this too all the way to the tejira quarter then down to the serpentine he sighed fuming to face them i have had a most tiring night my friend he grinned wolfishly as he eyed auleya and i see as a hero i am about to get my just reward moichi laughed shortly i would not be so anxious to try this one out kossori she is as deadly as a snow wolf is that so kossori eyed her even more keenly the more arduous the chase the keener one enjoys the spoils eh aufeya was still brandishing the dirk and moichi went over to her pay him no mind he is in rare good humor over this nights sport sport she cried we are most deadly serious here you cannot imagine the import of what has transpired no not yet moichi agreed with her but we shall soon enough i promise you just as soon as i return from three kegs pier nothing will happen while kossori is here a better protector in shaanghsei you could not find he changed rapidly into a fine honeycolored silk shirt with open neck and wide sleeves tight rustcolored calfskin breeches in the midst of this elegant garb his old tattooed scabbard seemed out of place indeed he put his arm around aufeyas shoulders took her back out onto the veranda they stood by the far railing in the harbor an enommous fourmasted schooner known as a globespanner in sailors vemacular was maneuvering slowly toward one of the long wharves reserved for just such behemoths eric v iustbader even with fully half its canvas furled it was a magnificent sight guided as it was by a trio of shaanghsei harbor boats dwarfed like toys beside its grandeur aufeya he said softly i will not be gone long looking into her eyes was a task now and he wrenched his gaze away with an effort i want to ask you something before i leave did you did you feel it also last night at the sha rida and then when our lips touched just before he was still conscious of his dirk in her left hand it hung down loosely its point toward the wooden boards of the floor she lifted her right arm and her fingers touched the contour of his cheek tracing it we are unique in this land you and i moichi it was the first time she had used his name and he felt a shiver pass through him we are both children of the one god these heathens of shaanghsei worship many gods as do most of the people of the world of man many gods must dissipate power dont you think some others believe in no god at all surely this is not good her hand was at her side again but his skin still tingled where she had brushed it with her fingertips no one had ever conveyed so much in such a simple common gesture i had thought the daluzan were the only people left who believed in the one god now i find you surely this cannot be coincidence i do not believe in coincidence what do you think it is then sei he said noting her uncomprehending look the bujun call it karma there are many words for it i imagine part of the lifeforce which brings people together at a certain time and place for some reason what is the reason with us he traced the features of her face with his eyes resting for a moment on the halfopen lips rosecolored and shiny impulsively he leaned toward her with his upper torso and kissed her then surprised he found her arms reaching up around his neck the kiss prolonged intensified her body warm all along the length of his own go now she said standing primly back she shook her hair copper where the sunlight struck it vejira con dihos and he saw her eyes glowing with the enormous fear she felt for the man hellsturm she struggled hard to suppress it and only because he was so close she went with him back into the room kossori watched beneath an opal moon them silently as they parted and moichi went quickly down the stairs he looked back just before the floor cut off his line of sight saw her standing in the center of the room with the new mornings light spilling all around her seeming to him a physical manifestation of the invisible aura she possessed her eyes met his just before he disappeared down the stairwell but the confluence of emotions he saw there confounded him all the way to his assignation snatch hree kegs pier was quite a distance down the bund from llowans harttin but once outside moichi resigned himself to walking a ricksha was out of the question though he passed several vacant ones these were cruising in search of those new to shaanghsei just off the docking ships who would not know any beker not only was walking far faster in the earlymoming crush of sweating kubaru hustling sailors stevedores knots of passengers fat bongs and their representatives and bodyguards and the inevitable giomu the sidewalk merchants who moved from pier to pier as passengers disembarked but it was infinitely cheaper since the hiring of a ricksha was based on time not distance time was quite literally money for the kubaru it was the beginning of a fine day the air clear completely devoid of the haze which enveloped the city to a greater or lesser extent each evening the sky was white where the pale sun burned still fairly low on the horizon but aloft the curving vault of the heavens was a deep endless blue traces of white puffy clouds trailed like unfurled sails here and there deep within the cries and bustling confusion of the bund as he shouldered his way along moichi became engrossed in the seemingly endless riddle into which he had quite unsuspectingly plunged what had begun as an apparently simple act of reprisal now had become something quite complex and it was being made clear to him sinister if aufeya was right he had discovered the identity of the murderer but knowing who he was and running him to ground were two different matters he knew the man hellsturm had all of shaanghsei within which to secret himself but as long as aufeya was also hidden here he would not leave appar beneath an opai moon entry cascaras had but one half of the information hellsturm wanted he would stay in shaanghsei until he got it or until moichi captured him in this he knew aufeya could be most helpful in fact without her he would have no clue as to where to find the man in the black cloak for he realised now he had no idea what hellsturm looked like he knew only that he was tall hardly enough information to set about finding him in this awesome labyrinth but moichi possessed the real trump aufeya for hellstunn wanted her desperately if one could judge by the distance he had pursued her he had still been filled with auteyas aura as he had come down the stairs into the harttins busy commercial area briefly he filled llowan in on who was upstairs and why then telling the bundsman where he was headed he stepped outside he was almost within sight of three kegs pier now and he was close enough to see that the bujun ship had not yet docked he breathed a sigh of relief if he hurried he just might have time to give aerent some of the more important details of what had transpired this past evening briefly his thoughts turned to aufeya he would have preferred not to leave her but he knew that even had he been able to take her with him she would be in more danger out here hellsturm he was quite certain had not come to shaanghsei on his own over and above the fact that the murders in the screaming monkey indicated there had been two attackers he was sure he had seen others moving to hellsturms command just before he had ducked out of the main tent in the sharida in this respect aufeya had been dead on shaanghsei was too much of an open place despite the intricate webs of secrecy which inundated it for outlanders but this could work both ways while hellsturm was obliged to work circumspectly to capture auteya he could by the same token take advantage of the citys enormously effective spy network to aid him in finding out where she was hiding no all things considered the harttin was the safest place for her and there was kossori moichi would rather have him guarding aufeya than a score of ching pang with that he cleared his mind of the matter and prepared himself to meet the daughter of the kunshin the regent was awaiting him three quarters of the way out on three kegs pier the pier itself was clogged with kubaru runners and stevedores preparing for the bujun ships arrival because the vessel was not a merchantman there were no bongs eric v lusttader of shipping agents about which was lucky moichi saw now as he went carefully along the wooden planks their space and more had been taken up by a military honor guard fully three pilings in length as he passed their glistening fastidiously pruned ranks he came upon aerent who was gazing out to sea presumably in the direction of the coming ship he held his hands behind his back and this pose combined with the brilliantly shining dress breastplate with its plumed shoulderguards caused him to appear once again as the commanding rikkagin of the forces of mankind hole aerent moichi called the regent spun around on his ruby legs the sunlight lancing through them made them seem eerily translucent causing him to cast a crimson shadow aerent smiled ah good morn good morn he unclasped his hands from behind his back rubbed at the side of his nose and how did you find the sharida to your taste perhaps moichi laughed no regent i think not when all is said still he cocked his head there are some good elements to it aerents face darkened as he said tell me one then it was at the sharida that i found out who murdered omojiru and the man from kintai this was not strictly speaking quite true for he had found out about hellsturm after leaving the sharida but he could not pass up the opportunity to consternate aerent the regents surprise was evident and moichi began to outline what little aufeya had told him at that moment they heard a sharp cry from the far end of the pier and both turned a lookout had his hands cupped to his mouth here she comes he cried and turning pointed into the sunrise sure enough as they squinted against the light dazzle the sails and masts and then only moments later the bow of the tsubasa could be made out as the bujun ship appeared over the horizon moichi staring longer at the vessel than the regent drew in his breath involuntarily look at that aerent he said excitedly she fairly flies over the water as if she were a winged creature and aerent looking again saw that this was true the tsubasa which had just before been at the limit of their vision now had leapt into prominence beneath an opal moon where is this daluzan woman now moichi the regent inquired she is quite safe at the harttin he was about to add that kossori was with her when he remembered that his friend did not know of the musicians martial prowess clearly we must interview her as quickly as possible he rubbed at his beard this bujun arrival has come at an accursedly inconvenient time in light of what you have just told me well theres nothing for it but to make the best of it we cannot afford to offend the kunshins daughter can we i have been informed that she is carrying a communique from the daisan i daresay you will be interested in that my friend there was a contained rustling behind them from the military contingent on loan from several of the citys ranking rikkagin as the tsubasa hove to just outside the harbors limits she had cut sail drastically and now seemed to float majestic upon the water patiently awaiting a sea lane opening into port she was a most beautiful vessel moichi thought sleek somewhat slimmer than the oceangoing schooners common to the shaanghsei area her upper hull was painted a glossy black from the sheerstrake to just above the waterline where a thin gold band separated it from the vermilion of the lower hull its bow was high and curving with the figurehead of a cock this was he knew the bujun symbol for growth and exploration this woman is daluzan and the man in the alley was too aerent mused moichi did you know that kintai is on the northwest border of dalucia moichi turned from the bujun ship making its painstaking way into the harbor with the aid of a small shaanghsei escort boat to look at the regent interesting it appears as if i should take my leave of this place after all aerent with the kunshins daughter just about to arrive impossible why you can take care of her surely in any case it is a moot point dont you think you have no ship i do now moichi said aufoyas lorcha is docked at fire line pier i mean to sail it north to dalucia and what of this man hellsturm i want him as do aerent and aufeya is my means to trap him uhm risky that the woman the quicker we get him the safer it will be for her eric v lus ader the tsubasa was nosing into three kegs pier now and kubaru and stevedores alike rushed to and fro along the length of the wharf handling the thick hempen ropes thrown down to them by the bujun crew they hauled on these ropes lifting their voices in singsong litany working in concert in time to the music at length securing them to the thick metal stanchions along the wharf this was one of the many incalculable benefits which made shaanghsei the most important as well as the wealthiest port on the continent of man its waters were deep enough quite close in so that large vessels even the four masted behemoths needed not stand off at a safe distance from shore and ferry their cargo to the mainland ships were loaded and offloaded directly at the piers thus saving time and money at khiyan for instance where moichi and the daisan had embarked aboard the kioku for their long voyage south this had not been possible the ship standing off had had to send a longboat in to pick them up the shuddering of the pier brought him out of his thoughts timbers creaked and waveless lashed at the wooden pilings beneath them the tsubasa had docked chiisai was an apt name for her she was the only daughter of the kunshin and she looked like a flower moichi had no idea what her name meant but what he thought of the moment he saw her appear on the high poop deck above him was a plum blossom dark and vibrant she was small he saw as she approached them coming slowly down the ornamental gangplank stepping onto the pier to meet them but that he soon found was deceiving for she was no girl but a fullblown woman she had a delicate flowerpetal face with long darkalmondshaped eyes and the high cheekbones of the bujun her mouth was wide and sensual which was unusual she wore the wooden clogs used for ceremonies and she was garbed in a silk robe reaching down to the tops of her feet it was pure white perfectly dazzling in the strong sunlight embroidered upon it was a series of leaping flying fish in a pale bluegreen this was all as it should be but as she came to a halt before them and bowed they bowing back in turn moichi became aware of something odd about her appearance for a moment he was quite at a loss to define it then abruptly and with somewhat of a shock he saw that her hair was bound in the traditional bujun queue usually reserved for the male warriors beneath an opal moon two tall bujun stood still as statues at either side of the upper end of the gangplank still on the ship no one had accompanied her down this too seemed odd for this was the kunshins daughter she smiled aerent regent of shaanghsei i bring greetings from my father the kunshin from all the peoples of amanomori and from the daisan we wish you well in your new post and offer our congratulations from within the folds of her robe she lifted out a small wooden box sealed all around its edges with pitch to keep out the moist salt air upon its top was imprinted in platinum the seal of the kunshin of the bujun three plovers in full flight within the circle of the world with all our good wishes she extended the box toward him aerent moichi saw had been taken somewhat by surprise now as he took the gift from her he seemed very moved thank you chiisai it is an honor to receive such a token oh it is but a simple gift regent i assure you chiisai said her eyes were still laughing aerent used the edge of his dirk to slit through the congealed pitch he pried open the lid of the box and stared inside he was quite still for several moments then he carefully lifted out the platinum ring it was a setting of exquisite manufacture the setpiece of amanomoris finest precious metalsmith within the setting sat a perfect pearl into the stunned silence chiisai said innocently my father felt this was a fitting gift for the ruler of the greatest seaport in all the known world slipping the ring upon the fourth finger of his right hand his heart finger aerent lifted his gaze to her face i am most delighted chiisai and overwhelmed he gave her the present he had selected for her a shaanghsei quilted jacket of the finest silk and artistry upon which had been embroidered both a blue heron the shaanghsei symbol of grace and a rampant tigress bujun symbol of mastery of the land now he felt it to be totally inadequate in light of his own gift but she seemed genuinely delighted with it donning it immediately aerent stepped back a pace about to introduce moichi but chiisai looking up out of the corner of her eyes said and this must be moichi annainin ten thousand pardons for my bad manners but i required some little time to acclimate myself that is quite all right lady she laughed please call me chiisai it would be most eric v lustbader unforgivable of me to continue this formality with you so great a friend of the daisan she gazed up at him without a trace of awe but with a respect and affection he found surprising in its intimacy he wished for me to give you this when i saw you moichi expected her to hand over the communique aerent said was to be forthcoming but instead she embraced him her grip firm and warm as one warrior would another a link stronger than blood moichi thought my bond brother the daisan misses you greatly moichi and him she stepped up beside him put her arm through his as carefree as a little girl well i see you have turned out the honor guard aerent it is to your liking chiisai the regent asked as to its grandeur and display most certainly she ducked her head yet i must tell you in all candor that it was quite unnecessary this is a visit of an unofficial nature my father wishes and i wish to make it quite clear that there should be no official tours no dinners in my honor no escort in short absolutely no affairs of state i see aerent said as they began to walk past the precise gleaming rows of the honor guard though he most assuredly did not may i ask then the nature of your visit to shaanghsei you may she said laughing regent you must learn to treat me as a woman and as the daughter of the kunshin indeed lady i shall endeavor to do so good now as to my being here my father feels strongly that i should not spend my entire life on amanomori the daisan agreed with him i am here to learn that is why you see official parties and such will do me no good in fact i prefer not to have it widely known who i am moichi laughed you set us quite a formidable task chiisai in shaanghsei secrets of that nature are difficult indeed to keep from spreading how is the daisan aerent said well and happy my father is delighted to have him by his side they are quite inseparable these days they often ride out from the castle spending many days in the wilds with only the plovers for company i am happy to hear it the daisan wished me to inquire after your injuries but i beneath an opal moon see that there is no need she had no more than glanced at his articulated ruby legs once since stepping ashore they were at the foot of three kegs pier now and about to enter the maelstrom of the bunds frantic activities behind them stevedores were offloading chiisais baggage directed by the bujun sailors there was no sign of either captain or navigator and this moichi found strange indeed but there was little time to contemplate such matters for chiisai was already leading him into the hive of the bond her skin moichi observed as she reached back to pull him forward and the wide sleeve of her robe slid back for a moment was lightly tanned this too was out of the ordinary bujun women prided themselves on soft white skin and wide bamboo parasols he had been told by the daisan were plentiful in the streets of the cities rain or shine the jostling of the kubaru the smell of the spices the grain dust clouding the air the shouts halfsongs were all like stepping out into the surf of an unquiet sea chiisai seemed to know where she was going for she took them into the throng heading toward the far side of the bund there almost directly across from three kegs pier was a small blueandwhite tent set up just in front of harttins windowless wall they stopped in front of the tents opening and she said what is this place it is the tent of a shindai lady aerent said a shindai she said it as if tasting a new flavor testing its sound out on her tongue yes as the local diviners are called a fortuneteller how delightful may we aerent frowned personally he did not like the shindai certainly set no store by their divinations but save for their systematically fleecing the visitors they were completely harmless by all means moichi for his part as he allowed himself to be dragged inside the tent wanted no part of this he was frankly anxious to return to auteya it was dim inside the tent and already hot but he could make out the figure of a woman with a vaguely porcine face for all that she was quite pretty as she stood up and met them smiling welcome she said you have come to see your future she spoke to them all but moichi had the uncomfortable sensation that she was directing her remarks to him alone eric v lustbader lovely lady the shindai said please take this deck of cards and arrange it in any manner you desire chiisai took the pack turned the bottom one over then one after the other she looked at their faces they were all blank i do not see how it can matter she said but complied with the shindais request then she handed the cards back the shindai held the cards in her right hand face downward with her left hand she picked up the top card turning it face up on it was imprinted the figure of a bird ah the shindai said you are about to embark upon a long and arduous journey aerent laughed you are a little late shindai this lady has just come from such travel nevertheless the shindai said firmly travel is indicated and in the future she slid the card face up to the bottom of the deck turned over the second now the top card it depicted a statue of a halfclothed human placed quite oddly in the midst of a forest this is what aids you what chiisai exclaimed a statue the statue is the symbol of artistry and beauty again the shindais hands moved and the third card was displayed the figure was difficult to discern for it seemed a black pictograph against a black background but now as the shindais hand moved the light hit the card in such a way that the black disappeared leaving behind like spindrift at a low tide a spare shape etched in black it appeared to be a human skull death chiisai breathed now really the regent began thinking this had gone on far enough and that he was a fool to allow his guest to be frightened by this shindai witch not death lady the shindai interrupted him in a voice that brooked no further interference with her work most assuredly not death this is what crosses you a man a man will desire your death everyone in the tent heard her added emphasis will yes the shindai nodded he does not appear to know that you even exist now then why will he want to kill me that i surely cannot tell you lady the shindais hands were quiescent now beneath an opal moon is that it chiisai asked yes the three servitors have been exposed they are the governors of the immediate future chiisai turned to moichi have yours done now he was about to protest when aerent caught his eye gave him a discreet but distinct negative shake of his head without a word moichi took the deck and shuffled the cards quickly and negligently he wanted only to end this bit of nonsense he handed the pack to the shindai she displayed the first card it was the sun the shindai cleared her throat she seemed somewhat startled this is the symbol of goal i must say that i have never before encountered it in the guise of the first servitor most unusual here it would be the significator of great change second card this had an entirely black background like chiisais third card before it had metamorphosed to white the more common colon in its center was what appeared to be a bier etched in white and upon that reposed a female figure also outlined in white this is what aids you a corpse moichi almost laughed in her face the past the shindai said evenly even as her hands were bringing up the third card this time they could all hear the tiny gasp of her indrawn breath the third card was blank no one said chiisai isnt that marvelous not no one the shindai said gravely everyone everyone crosses me moichi scoffed but that is impossible perhaps so the shindai said yet it is what the third servitor reveals aerent dipped into his sash and placed a silver coin in the shindais hand but she shook her head oh no sir i cannot take any payment for this reading it is my gift to this couple she looked at moichi and chiisai you are mistaken shindai moichi replied we are no couple if i am in error sir then i do apologise most humbly but either way i will accept no payment she placed the silver coin back into the regents sash as deftly as if she had been a pickpocket good day to you all she said bowing good day eric v lustbader after the stifling interior of the tent the colorsodors sounds of the port quarter of shaanghsei swept over them like an invigorating tide i hope aerent said that you take these divinations in the spirit in which moichi stopped listening he was watching a kubaru runner hurtling along the bund pellmell he knocked over a stevedore leapt over a chestnut merchants impromptu stall he seemed to be heading directly toward them and three kegs pier moichi thought he looked vaguely familiar and at that moment he caught the kubarus eye the man obviously recognised him for he veered away from the dockside and sped hurriedly toward them he shouted bowled over a pair of kubaru sacks of rice flew into the crowd opening and spilling out cries of anger trailed him the kubaru paid no affection completing his run he reached moichi you must come now san he said the combination of the dialect and the cutting of the words caused by the mans panting made it difficult to understand him completely still the gist was readily apparent come now right away now moichi recognised the kubaru and felt a knife twisting in his vitals the man was already pulling at him and he needed no further urging without a word he set off with the kubaru at his side hurtling down the bund what has happened chiisai asked turning to the regent aerents face was ashen for he too had recognised the kubaru i am afraid to speculate chiisai please come with me taking her elbow with his left hand he guided her toward the bunds landward fringe there he hailed a passing ricksha and lifting her into it and quickly following her he gave the runner an address take the streets he told the kubaru we are in a hurry llowan was the first to meet moichi at the doorway to the harttin he seemed to have aged and his hands were shaking i cannot imagine how this happened moichi he said his voice unsteady there was so much business this morning such confusion he shook his head sadly but there is no excuse this is my fault moichi put a hand on his shoulder whatever has happened it has nothing to do with you i brought them here then he was mounting the stairs three at a time emerging to find beneath an opal moon the room looked as if a fierce storm had hit it the bed was askew chairs were broken llowans enormous hardwood desk was demolished a pile of broken firewood in the far corner the jalousies had been smashed in at least three places and fearing the worst moichi went out onto the wide veranda shards of the jalousies furniture littered the floor and he knelt staring at the droplets of blood strewn about he picked through the debris not knowing what he was searching for until he found it his dirk lay just under his fingers both blade and handle smeared with blood still wet he picked it up stood looking around wiping it off they were not here he went back into the room started toward the far end aufeya was gone which meant that she was not dead but had been taken by force there had been no time here to get information from her where would they have taken her surely not somewhere within shaanghsei a foreign city where they would be at a disadvantage but would they have also taken kossori at that moment his eye caught a dark spot in among the desks debris he leapt forward hurling the cracked wood and hanging brass fittings from his path within a crude tent made by the splintered desk he found the body the face curiously had been untouched and it appeared as calm as if the man had been sleeping but the body arms and legs were broken in too many places for him to count but it was the hands which magnetized his attention they were bloody pulps the knuckles looking as if they had been crushed one by one with precise and sadistic care moichi felt cold sweat break out along his face this broken corpse was all that was left of kossori the man who could defeat half a dozen ching pang without breathing hard what devil moichi thought numbly had done this but he already knew the answer lwo pursuing the devii the aorta lit jet is good to have a rolling deck beneath my feet again he breathed deeply of the salt spray and fumed briefly gazing over the sterns sheerstrake shaanghsei was but a memory floating somewhere beyond the lowlying haze to the south can you really speak their tongue she asked he nodded affirmatively and she continued it is most strange is it not to think that all the peoples of the world devised one tongue long ago that amply fits them all the bujun have their own tongue she nodded true but we all speak the common tongue also odd that these people do not she meant the daluzan he went slightly forard putting his hands on the rail separating the elevated aft deck from the rest of the sleek lorcha and cupping his hands at the sides of his mouth called to the men in the shrouds ganarse las velas a babor immedi ately he saw with some satisfaction they altered the sails so that they picked up more of the following wind and the vessel began to sweep to port navegas viento en papa there came an answering shout from the sailors in the shrouds the lorcha now sailed before the stiff wind with every centimeter of canvas full out racing up the coast of the continent of man northeast to dalucia they had come eventually and taken the ruined body away silently and without disturbing him as he had stood in the center of the room exactly where aufeya had stood staring at him as he had leh aerent had seen to that but the regent had not come upstairs and moichi had been grateful for that because erlc v lus ader he thought that he could not bear to see another living human being then without lashing out with his dirk he blamed himself deeply and without quarter it did no good for the pragmatic part of himself to point out that he had done what he had thought best that he had had no way of knowing how had hellsturm found out about the harttin for he had no doubt that hellsturm was behind the death of his friend and the snatch what a pejorative word snatch but it was proper and fitting for the most heinous of crimes lust as it did no good for him to ask himself what else could i have done it was just too ironic that his meeting at three kegs pier had not been a high affair of state as he and aerent had believed it would be he could have taken aufeya after all god what a monstrous death and aufeya perhaps she already lay in her own lost fluids in some dank back alley like her friend cascaras a gaping hole in her chest over her heart oh god he cried inwardly let it not be so then where had hellsturm taken her it could be anywhere he had heard a sound on the stairs as someone came up who would dare he felt rage burning within him and whirled he found that he was still holding the dirk he had given to aufeya it was chiisai what did she want he thought savagely feeling an unreasoning resentment it was her fault if she had not arrived i thought you might like to talk she said to someone who is a foreigner also and with that his anger dissipated and he felt ashamed no one was at fault sei he thought karma is that not what he had told aufeya that seemed so long ago now another lifetime he was a good friend moichi said his eyes wandering around the room he put up a valiant fight but perhaps the odds were too high he could take on six men at a time she came toward him through the rubble interesting he must have been up against a most formidable foe moichi was abruptly sick of the room and he went out through the ragged gap in the ruined jalousies onto the veranda the day was still fine the weather bright and placid the air was the most pellucid he had ever seen it here reminding him of the air far out at sea beneath an opal moon chiisai stepped through after him he looked for the spot where he had found the dirk iying abandoned then he looked closer where the dirk had been was no piece of wood neither was it the floor of the veranda he knelt reached out what have you found chiisai asked im not certain he stood up with it surely he could not be mistaken it was a strip of silk ripped from the shirt he had given aufeya there seemed to be blood on it he turned it over for a moment nothing registered then he saw it for what it was a symbol or more accurately a pictogram he knew it was kubaru but he did not recognise it quickly he told her ask llowan to send up that kubaru the one he sent to three kegs pier to fetch me in a moment she had returned with the man he stood hesitantly inside the room even after chiisai had indicated to him to go through he would not move without a sign from moichi when at last he came out and stood next to the navigator moichi could see the real concern on his face i am most sorry san the kubaru said most grieved thank you moichi inclined his head i am indebted to you he indicated the bloodsoaked strip of silk perhaps you may help me again whatever you ask tell me moichi held out the silk what this means the kubaru took the strip as gingerly as if it were a priceless piece of handblown glass that is a kubaru symbol it it not yes the kubaru nodded it means home after he had gone moichi said to chiisai home aufeya left that for me clever woman hellsturm takes her back to corruna that is where i must go now but you shall not go alone chiisai said i must he told her aerent cannot go with me i was not speaking of the regent oh no he said you will stay here with him here in shaanghsei as your father ordered did not aerent tell you i brought a communique from the daisan there seemed to be the ghost of a smile playing at the corners of her mouth as she lifted out a small metal cylinder from beneath her robe handed it to him he opened it suspiciously it was written in the daisans erlc v lustbader own hand moichi my friend he read chiisai can be the only one to deliver this to you she will do so directly by hand and only when the two of you are alone and unobserved what she told aerent is only a halftruth this was done to protect him as well as herself chiisai is with you now under my orders of course the kunshin had no objections she is to stay with you now no matter what is to happen until such time as she deems it appropriate to do otherwise i am leaving this to her discretion you know me well enough that i need say no more our trust is our bond as brothers moichi looked up at her but she only shook her head i know less of this than you do he was certain she was iying but knew that she had good reason to do so this was hardly his concern in any event if she meant to come that was all right with him as long as she kept her place and did not get in his way she smiled at him i know what you are thinking oh really what with a deft gesture merely a flick of her wrists her silk robe had parted and now slid off her shoulders puddling the floor at her feet you see she said i can be of help moichi stared underneath the fallen robe she wore an intricately carved breastplate of black metal inlaid with gold filaments tight black leggings of the supplest leather around her waist was buckled a thin belt studded with pinkandwhite swirled jade from which hung the two traditional bujun swords the katana and the longer daikatana she laughed when she saw his expression a kind and gentle sound i should have realized moichi thought all the signs were right in front of me the shrouds cracked in the wind and the yards creaked as the daluzan lorcha sped through the water they were professionals the men who manned this craft and it had not taken them long to accept moichi he spoke their language and he knew what had happened to aufeya since she had been missing they had been terrified at the prospect of her death so we return home armazn said he was the bosun a burly man with a thick shock of white hair and a seamed leathery face beaten into a proud configuration by the wind beneath an opal moon ei sun and salt sea his eyes were bright bits of lapis liquid and knowing but withholding depths from the casual observer he shook his head now i had no good feeling about this voyage from its inception i begged aufeya to find some way to reach a bargain with that man hellsturm moichi said armazon nodded spray flew into his face as the lorcha bucked down then up through an oncoming wave a babor moichi cried to the helmsman and the vessel immediately swung to port it was a welldesigned craft moichi saw and he appreciated this it was tremendously responsive much less ponderous than the larger threemasted schooners but because of its smaller size it was much more prone to subjugation by the whims of the sea if auteya had set sail in a threemaster she never would have run afoul of that storm to his left the coastline was a greenandbrown ripple distancing itself as the lorcha moved out to sea basta he cried and the lorcha returned to its northeasterly course what did she say moichi had returned to conversation with the daluzan bostun say the man snorted why she laughed at me and said you poor fool no one can make a bargain with hellsturm once he is given a task to perform there is no one who can stop him given a task repeated it because it had been some time since he had heard so much daluzan the language had so many nuances spoken inflections changing the meaning of words which if written were constant that he needed to be certain of what he had heard armazon nodded hellsturm is working for someone who the bosun shrugged i do not know i am not family it is a matter strictly for the seguillas y oriwara you mean the seamerchant family he squinted up a moichi yes aufeyas family you did not know moichi shook his head in any other land it might have been a strange name but he knew the daluzan custom divas for two people to combine their names when they were wed he had of course heard of the seguillas y oriwara when he was in corruna it would have been surprising if he had not the family was quite wealthy and owned a sizable fleet of merchant ships eric v lus ader you have heard of milhos seguillas piloto yes one of the finest men in corrufla in all of dalucia for that matter then he had to go and marry the foreigner he spat sideways into the creaming sea that was his downfall mark my words well he looked at the backs of his hands strong and blunt and capable as dark as tanned leather the sea had made them that way dead now the senhor is dihos make peaceful his soul there was something peculiar in the inflection that made moichi ask how did he die the senhor seguillas violently piloto he died abominably if the truth be known how did it happen armazon spat again over the side lust passing the time en piloto something to do to wait out the journey i think you misunderstand armazon he said seriously i wish only to get aufeya back and to destroy hellsturrn anything you can tell me he broke off at the others grating guffaw pardon me piloto but you are a foreigner unused to our ways you wish to destroy this man hellsturm very admirable i admit he is an evil man but you do not know him we have a saying in dalucia piloto easy to say hard to accomplish you know it eh no well now you do i have seen what hellsturm can do he murdered my friend ah i will destroy him bravo bravo armazon clapped his hands derisively you will pardon me piloto if i do not join in the celebration just yet eh i have a somewhat more pragmatic turn of mind than do you apparently you were about to tell me about the senhors death ah yes so i was he was murdered in a duel he squinted up at moichi once again gauging the response to what he had just said oh yes i know what you must be thinking one enters a daluzan duel as a matter of honor and one accepts honorably what dihos decrees as the outcome that is part of daluzan law it is fixed a constant no one may interfere in a daluzan duel his face was a sea of seething emotion as if the words like individual bricks falling from his lips anticipated the crumbling of some strong wall his voice became beneath an opal moon a hiss of suppressed hate i tell you this piloto as certain as i am standing on this deck speaking to you now someone violated that sacred law someone interfered moichi stared at him silently the man was working himself up into a state of great agitation this is how i know piloto i knew milhos seguillas well very well i might even say we sailed together on many a prosperous voyage not all the time as master and bosun if you catch my meaning aboard ship well piloto who am i to tell you the tenets of the sea are much different than those held on land eh restrictions are lifted prohibitions vanish like so much mist eh eh here one is free to be oneself the chains of class and wealth neer apply that was the kind of man milhos seguillas was he was a high lord who cared more for the sea and those loyal to it than all the silver in the world he squinted up at moichi she is a cruel mistress the sea eh piloto we both know that she is harsh and unforgiving but like a lover she cradles those who are faithful to her you think that superstitious nonsense he hawked and spat clearidg his throat as if from the clotted emotion spilling out listen to me well piloto milhos seguillas was an expert swordsman expert he would not have been killed so quickly in a duel unless he paused his mouth hanging open as if he felt himself on a precipice and in voicing this hidden knowledge he had begun to fear his own words he was poisoned piloto poisoned just before the duel began i saw the body i know a substance few know of derived from a plant indigenous to a region far to the northwest but daluzans they have little contact with poisons but for senhor seguillas to be poisoned in such a manner this could not possibly be accomplished by his opponent moichi pointed out precisely piloto you have cut directly to the heart of the matter senhor seguillas foe has a cunning accomplice one so fantastically clever that the senhor never even suspected what are you saying armazn lust this piloto senhor seguillas was poisoned by his wife my god man do you have any proof of this proof piloto aye proof enough not such that would prick the interest of a magistrate but ill warrant enough to satisfy me i knew senhor seguillas and i know his wife does aufeya know anything of this matter eric v lustbader not a bit piloto leastwise not from these lips ive breathed nought to a soul save yourself then why have you told me you said you wished to save aufeya piloto well and good you are not daluzan you are not blood you can go where others constrained perhaps by the conventions of the land cannot you must help aufeya and senhor seguillas you must avenge his death kill aufeyas mother moichi looked away from those blue eyes burning with a manic passion thick cumulus were building themselves low on the horizon ahead of them to the northeast their tops were pure white but as they continued to mount he caught a glimpse of their dark undersides storm clouds a squall was forming it was far off too distant to be an immediate threat for the wind had not yet changed but the gulls to port were already beginning to wheel crying toward the high shore he stared into those blue eyes i can promise you no such thing armazn aufeya is my concern not her mother or her dead father the bosuns eyes blazed and he trembled with rage cobarde spittle flew from his glistening lips you meddle in matters over which you have no understanding you are an outlander what is dalucia to you less than nothing he laughed grimly ah for you save yourself the misery piloto throw yourself overboard before you reach corruna let the sea take care of you for you look death in the face and you do not even know it he went away from moichi in a rush leaping forard swinging around the mainmast almost colliding with chiisai as she came aft before disappearing into the forard hatch chiisai came up from the position she had taken near the bow soon after they had set sail all the day she had stayed there studying the configuration of the shoreline constantly checking it against the detailed maps aboard the lorcha we are making exceptional time moichi she said making no mention of the altercation with armazn she pointed to port see there already we are near the coast city of singtao there where she pointed he could see the cinnabar smudge of the urban sprawl far smaller than mighty shaanghsei but important in its own right the citys color was no illusion of the light for it was here that the famed red clay was exported to the world of man it was the finest in all the world and beneath an opal moon artisans no matter where they resided insisted upon using it the light was peculiar now because the vast bank of squall cumulus had not lowered entirely and the sun caught behind it nevertheless managed to fight through the underside so that the sea was illuminated by what sailors called the trail of the oruborus brilliant as molten metal where the rays hit it as deep and brooding as iron everywhere else above the storm the sky was a peculiar canary yellow fading to a cold dense gray his nostrils dilated and he scented it is coming now he told her and quickly as if to underscore his words there came a deep but distant rumble of thunder echoing across the sea he looked to port all the gulls were gone now having sought the safety of the shore for us too moichi thought un buque the piercing call of the lookout vibrated in the air a ship donde he called adelante he gazed straight ahead for a moment he saw nothing but the heaving sea made dark and dull by the confluence of the flying thunderheads they were very close now then he oriented and saw the triangular sail emerging from out of the cloud bank which now seemed to dip right into the heaving water whitecaps were appearing with alarming rapidity cudl clase de buque he called to the lookout these were unfamiliar waters to him better to rely on the daluzans here momento pilots the wind gusting erratically was plucking at the canvas with intensity as the storm approached the rigging sang its mournful tune normally he would have called for them to strike canvas but some sixth sense born to him upon the sea caused him to delay he wanted a positive identification first he swung abruptly around as a particularly strong gust threatened to turn them firme firme hijo this to the helmsman who he knew was young do you not think we should make for shore chiisai said not yet moichi had turned back was listening for the lookouts identification hellsturrn already has a sizable head start on us we cannot afford to let him build on that advantage he has outrun the storm i have little doubt we must weather it i have felt the force of the storms here in the northwest eric v luetbader she was of course speaking in relation to her home amanomori moichi thought of shaanghsei being in the south which it was in relation to the rest of the continent of man and that was in a seagoing threemaster do you think but moichi had signaled her to silence he was concentrating a lorcha the lookouts cry came daluz one of theirs chiisai said vigilarse cuidadosamente he cried to the lookout watch it closely because there was something not quite right he turned to the helmsman a babor aprisa quickly now the lorcha swung to port heading in toward the shoreline moichi after a brief glance into the shrouds kept his gaze fixed on the other vessel whats the matter chiisai asked he ignored her calling rohja don estd a young sailor working at midships called for a man to replace him scrambled aft piloto he was tall with a broad chest and muscular arms his face was long and thin dominated by the dark brooding eyes of a predator he was dressed in a white cotton shirt dark trousers and a purple headband an exceptionally functional outfit what do you make of that moichi said pointing to the oncoming ship the sailor peered ahead a lorcha the design is daluzan that is not the same thing he continued to peer ahead but the low light was making sightings difficult strange sail he said what do you mean just that i have never seen a daluzan vessel with black canvas before perhaps you should ask armazon i am asking you rohja gaze flicking from the oncoming craft to the cumulus behind it flash of lightning bluewhite upon the mirror of the sea the other lorcha had altered course but it could be heading into shore as was moichis vessel he kept their course heading in but his head was full of the calculation of vectors he needed no instrumentation for this i think they mean to intercept us piloto they may just be heading in to shore as we are moichi pointed out the angle isnt right tell me rohja would senhora seguillas y oriwara send a ship after her daughter not likely piloto no one knew where we were bound or beneath an opal moon even that we had gone until after we had set sail rohja was increasingly agitated but moichi remained calm the lorcha is primarily a merchant vessel is it not correct me if i am wrong it appeared now as if the other lorcha would reach them before the storm did that is true piloto but i must point out that is so only on short voyages around daluzan waters for a trip along the coast he shook his head it is far too small a vessel to be in the least practical you would not be able to load enough cargo to make the voyage worthwhile that of course was the point the anomaly of the other lorcha it was coming on far too fast to be carrying any kind of load he called sharply to the helmsman recobrarse el curve the man spun the wheel as sailors leapt to the rigging and the lorcha swept to starboard then righted itself they were now moving out at a tangent away from the shore into the full face of the storm the wind howled just below gate level and the sky was a grey mass low and roiling like steam from a kettle the horizon to the northeast had disappeared into a kind of continuous blur as rain slanted violently down you have been of much help rohja moichi said now go and fetch armazn from belowdecks we shall surely need him the man left the aft deck immediately in a moment the bosun appeared with rohja just behind him both were armed with straight narrowbladed swords not daluzan then chiisai said if they are not we shall see very soon now moichi moved back along the deck until he was standing next to the helmsman listen to me closely now hijo and move this vessel as i speak immediately do you understand each moment is vitas and any delay may undo us i understand piloto good the other lorcha halt altered its course away from shore it was close now tacking away from the wind so that it could cut across their bow and intercept them hijo moichi said steer us directly for them piloto the man was starred do as i say oruborus take you moichi barked head for him now armazn rushed aft with robja in his wake as he discerned brlc v lustibader their course the lorcha swung in an arc directly for the other vessel are you mad ammazon cried with all sail and in this gale we shall surely destroy each other sheer off moichi ignored him addressing rohja instead will the canvas take the strain rohja glanced upward yes piloto there is no problem from rips moichi heard his tentative tone but but there may be some danger of capsizing with all sail if the storm caught us dead on we would go over and down like a stone he is right piloto armazon brandished the sword either way it is suicide sheer off devilfish take your eyes the helmsman was sweating and moichi mummured reassuringly to him firme hills firme they were heading directly at the oncoming lorcha the fierce wind propelling them dizzyingly across the waves they were coming up on it with appalling swiftness the storm front just behind it was gaining on the other ship fittings creaked as the canvas strained in the bucking wind and men scrambled constantly to keep the sheets at their proper angle they were making all speed but moichis gaze had swung away from the other lorcha he watched the rising of the squall calculating distances and speed the vectors coming together it was going to be very close dimly he heard chiisai call his name he fumed saw armazon sword gleaming mounting the short companionway to the raised aft deck get away from there piloto leave the helm you will kill us all in your madness chiisai moichi said softly so that she could hear stand just here on the other side of the helmsman see that we stay bow on to the other ship no matter which way he twists stand off this deck bosun he said moving forward as he un sheathed his own sword you have a job to do i want the men armed in the event we are boarded see to it i shall see to your death first piloto he swung wildly at moichi who slid his upper torso away from the blow and at the same time sent a vicious twohanded slash obliquely across the others blade it sheared through like a stalk of ripe wheat moichi stepped up sheathing his sword and let fly a beneath an opai moon balled fist into the bosuns face his arms flung out wide armazon plummeted backward onto the main deck there he lay stunned rohja moichi called see that he is all right then make certain the men are armed i want no surprises quick y now there is little time he returned to the helm saw that they were still dead on good he murmured very good the other lorcha was now quite close so close in fact that he could see the individual men manning it what rohja he saw the man he had just returned from belowdecks look to the other ship are those daluzan no piloto they are not moichi had thought not those men were larger than the daluzans broadshouldered and heavily muscled in a narrowwaisted athletic way they had hair as yellow as the sun and their skin was so fair it appeared almost white what folk mans that lorcha tudescans came the reply who are they chiisai said i have never heard of them nor i moichi replied but we are about to find out rohja scrambled aft in answer to moichis summons the tudescans are from the north from a land above dalucia what could they want from us are they pirates no piloto not to my knowledge though they are most certainly a villainous lot moichi considered this for a moment there were six different words for villainous in daluzan that he was aware of perhaps there were more and all had their own various shades of meaning the one rohja had used had many ramifications too many to contemplate now but he filed the information away for later study ahora the two lorchas were bearing down upon each other now and he could see the frantic activity on the other ship as it tried to maneuver away so that it could close alongside as it had worked out moichi was obliged to cut it very fine and if it did not work their vessel would be beam on into the ravaging squall with all sails full and that would be the end as armazn feared nothing in the world could save them from going down eric v lustbader steady he urged the helmsman steady they are trying to shake us off sheets of rain so heavy they were almost solid were closing in rapidly cutting light drastically judging distances accurately was now a major problem mainly because the blurring effect tended to foreshorten the distance so it took a fraction of a moment longer for him to guide the lorcha as his brain interpreted the images of his vision and made the necessary readjustments howling gusts of wind buffeted the sails giving the men great difficulty but they were very good and their course held true still he shouted encouragement and they redoubled their efforts beside him the helmsman had begun trembling in just a few short moments the two bow waves would be mingling it was going to be that close steady he crooned into the wind steady as she goes masts bending in the gale a sharp cry along the maindeck ignore it keep her bow on moichi cried he pulled the shaking helmsman tom his post he had done as much as could be expected the yards creaking howling like the hounds of hell steady now he told himself his fingers gripping the helm guiding it he felt the thrill of the ship wash over him then knew she had recognised his competence acknowledged his leadership she acquiesced truly his now to command the men sweating hauling on the lines heels trying to find a noslip purchase on the tarred deck right there felt chiisai close beside him welcoming her warmth and support right here the rain rushing toward them like a vast funereal shroud a waterfall of black liquid metal thick and blinding yes right here the other lorcha big and dark looming over them like a gargantuan tombstone blotting out even the oncoming storm with its bulk with the ebon of its spread sail taut and leathery as a bat wing abrupt wetness beginning and the helmsman crying out in fear because he thought it was the first onrush of the other ships bow wave washing over them and moichi crying beneath an opal moon ahora now now hard to starboard he spun at the wheel but the seas were already so heavy that there was enormous resistance chiisai leaned into it with him and then the trembling helmsman his teeth chattering and his eyes rolling wildly so that the whites showed all the way around heave heave the helm began to turn by the oruborus put your weight into it heave the lorcha bucked swung to starboard a solid wall of water rose up and the helmsman was screaming again because he could already feel the titanic death shudder of his vessel as the other lorcha hit it dont let up heave and they were into the squall another world crossing the threshold the downpour obscured everything and they hung on to the wheel all three of them lest they be washed overboard but moichi was already turning his head toward the port side watching watching through the clouds of hissing water seeing as if through some magic viewer the smudge of the other lorcha made dark and bulky by its angle and proximity turned broadside into the storm in its attempt to veer away from their charge it was breaking up he heard the splintering even above the crash of the storm thought he could even discern cries in a strange language guttural cuneiform writing come to life in speech dying now amidst the torn spars and splintered hull he heaved with them bringing them out of their starboard arc back onto a straight course he relinquished the helm to the helmsman and turned to find chiisai staring at him she put one small hand fingers outspread on his chest his shirt had blown open and she touched his bare skin rain drove at them relentlessly filming their faces running down their necks they were drenched to the skin merma s tales during the long night he dreams of home of waiting iskael baking in the swollen summers sun it is the season when nothing moves along the vast tracts of the desert not caravans which in the fall will journey forth laden with spices and cedar not pilgrims making the arduous trek to the holy sites at the foot of the mountain built so it is said by the hand of god it is the time when the desert is ruled by the scorpions and sand snakes during the day and the fleet pack rats at night it is the time when he is a boy already tall and muscular when he rides his fathers land on horseback supervising much of the work he is accompanied by aleph his tutor a man of indeterminate age who is present in order to assure moichis father that the boys secular and religious studies do not suffer because of his work my boy aleph calls to him as they rein up atop a low bluff it is time for your midday lesson not today aleph he says please moichi i cannot force you but i am constrained to point out that your father is already most anxious about the slow progress of your studies this will do nothing to assuage his anxiety it is my life aleph moichi says i know you understand this even if he does not the other nods this is quite correct my boy but neither am i the one with the ferocious temper you are not the only one brought on the carpet if matters are not to his complete satisfaction i know what you put up with he says and i appreciate it but today the sun is hot and the shaded waters of the brook in the northwest quadrant seem irresistible beneath an opal moon aleph sighs all right go take your swim but in return you must promise to rendezvous with me here just after sunset we shall return home together as your father would wish it moichi lifts a hand in assent digs his boot heels into his mounts flanks and he is off galloping down the far side of the bluff over the rolling fields of wheat in the manner of dream movement he finds himself at the brook dismounted staring through a gap in the dense greenery he sees the frothy water so inviting but this day the brook is not deserted despite its distance from any major or minor roads within the stream stands a girl with short auburn hair he moves slightly to get a better view and sees that she is in the process of disrobing already she is without her blouse and her skin clouded with freckles is tanned almost to the color of teak lithe muscles ripple as she bends placing the blouse on the far bank and he catches an alltoobrief glimpse of one breast firm as a ripe apple the nipple hard then she turns her back and he sees the deep groove of her spine shadowed all the way down to the tops of her buttocks so unutterably erotic that he feels his legs begin to tremble with the force of his longing the water rushes onward hiding her feet and ankles the bottoms of her calves she wears only a pair of cutoff pants now and her bare legs like the bifurcated stalk of some exotic flower hold his attention they are beautifully formed so full of a hidden excitement that for a moment he imagines himself to be a desert explorer who after seasons of searching at last comes upon a previously undiscovered mine of precious gems his breath comes as hard as a bellows and he is terrified that she will hear his stentorian wheezing the blood pounding through his veins sounds like hammer blows upon his inner ear and his head seems to jerk with every pulse as if in terrible confirmation of his thoughts the girl turns looks directly at him he freezes not even daring to breathe he stares mesmerised as if seeing an ethereal faerie creature come to life her eyes are enormous and as green and bright as polished jade long sooty lashes giving them a highly mysterious aspect a broad forehead small nose and generous lips her face is captivating then she turns away miraculously without having noticed him and he feels a kind of chill after that hot hot stare as if a cloud had passed before the face of the sun eric v lustbader her hands are working now in front of her hidden from him and this too increases the eroticism of the moment then incredibly she sways slightly back and forth as she works her pants down her hips and she is completely naked she begins to turn again but he can stand no more moving back into the deep shadows of the foliage he feverishly tears at his clothes he is sweating buttons catch at the material of his shirt cloth sticks to his back and arms as he tries to pull it off at length he is ready and moving to the gap he thrusts himself through and without pause hurls himself into the water of the brook it is like ice and his flesh is raised in goose bumps he lifts his head from the water shaking the droplets from his brows and eyelashes but he is alone in the brook for as far as the eye can see they sailed into the port of corruna on the wings of fair weather and a stiff fresh wind out of the southeast quarter far from the sprawling splendor of shaanghsei that tended to awe the initiate corruna was nevertheless a beautiful sight the daluzan port was comparatively small and perfectly compact stone jetties mostly manmade thrust out into the blue water amply accommodating the many swift lorchas that as rohja had indicated plied daluzan waters on shortrange trade immediately to the northeast a deep lagoon was sheltered by a narrow curving peninsula like a welcoming cape to weary travelers in larger craft near the bow moichi could make out seven threemasters at anchor there the city itself was laid out in a wide crescent the arms of its extremities encircling the port corruna was a swath of white cubicular buildings built aroundspectacular circular plazas whose centers were invariably filled with beautifully sculpted fountains or small arboreal sanctuaries bells seemed to peal almost constantly emanating from the blunt towers of myriad iglesias the daluzan culture did not use brick in its constructions perhaps for aesthetic reasons used only wood paneling and stippled stucco in its interiors almost without exception the buildings of the city were made of a kind of fired adobe that was meticulously sealed against the cold of the winters then thickly whitewashed to a matte finish if the houses of corruna seemed at first colorless the citizens beneath an opal moon were just the opposite for their clothing in which they took inordinate pride was of the most brilliant colors every shade and its harmonic was represented amid the tight formalism of the men and the swirling rumes of the women the lorcha nosed slowly alongside a jetty and fore and aft lines were thrown to waiting hands moichi awaiting their docking was watching armazn he had made an enemy there he knew when he had knocked the bosom down in front of his crew he shrugged mentally there had been no help for it but he knew that while he was here he would have to keep a weather eye on the man he had told chiisai the gist of his talk with armazn but nothing further was said of the matter they bumped against the wharf and moichi moving back to midships stepped off the lorcha followed by chiisai as they stood there breathing deeply adjusting to being on land once more rohja came up you will no doubt wish to go to the house of the seguillas y oriwara he said allow me to be your guide if you give us the directions i am quite certain we will find our way moichi said if you would be amenable i would ask you to do something for me if i am able i will be most glad to help good i want you to hang around here do whatever you normally do i want to know if any ship coming in on the same line as we did docked here it would be oh either early this morning or late last night do you think you can do that rohja grinned adjusted the purple headband his eyes were bright aye piloto it will be easy do not make the mistake of taking this lightly rohja moichi cautioned this man we follow is most dangerous and he is certain to have confederates here i do not want to place you in jeopardy please do not trouble yourself on that score rohja said i can take care of myself no one will know what i am about that includes armazon moichi said pointedly rohja snorted i need no reminder on that score piloto there was no love lost between the two of us long before i sided with you back there lust be careful armazn is an old man he will cause me no trouble rohja was about to go but on impulse moichi held him back by asking do you know anything about the duel in which the senhor was killed eric v leader the sailor thought a moment then shrugged not much piloto i did not myself see it i was not in the employ of the seguillas y oriwara then but i was told that the senhor was overmatched from the outset was the senhor an expert swordsman by all accounts he was but there is an ancient daluzan proverb excellence is fleeting for perfection does not exist there is always someone better a most sobering thought chiisai said robja was one of the few daluzans moichi had encountered who had a true grasp of the common tongue they had used it now not only for her benefit but to ensure privacy in this public place indeed rohja agreed most melancholy but we daluzans believe that it teaches one humility do you know rohja moichi said whether it was a fair duel all daluzan duels are fair piloto by definition armazon seems to think otherwise ah armazn well i cannot say that i am at all surprised why is that well he loved the senhor piloto yes as if they were brothers but something transpired during the last year of the senhors life i do riot know what none of the men i suspect do but perhaps four seasons before the senhor was killed in the duel he ceased to use armazns lorcha he turned and pointed this one in point of fact the senhors fleet is vast you no doubt know but he steadfastly sailed with armazon until he shrugged it happened very abruptly you know very strange after so long a time did they have a fight if there was one it did not occur in public and of course armazn would never speak of it but what has this to do with what armazn suspects happened in the duel lust this ever since the senhors death he has changed that is understandable given no no i mean over and above the feelings of grief he has become i dont know someone else unrecognisable to any who knew him in the old time when the senhor was alive he is driven by an emotion i detest guilt he shrugged over what i do not know moichi looked over the others shoulder at the gently rocking beneath an opal moon lorcha perhaps we will never know now listen rohja we should meet tonight can you suggest a place the sailor thought for a moment aye there is a fishermans taverna near here along the docks it is called el cambiro it lies at the foot of calle crdel where the street ends at the sea he squinted up at the sun igive me until midnight piloto these matters you know cannot be rushed sailors are a stony lot on land he grinned broadly until the liquor loosens their tongues eh it took them some time but at length they were directed to the plaza de la pesquisa it was constructed of shimmering white cobbles which flashed in the sunlight like diamonds in its heart was a thick copse of green olive trees half hidden within which was a tiny bubbling fountain this last was of a grey stone roughgrained j almost like coastal granite carved into the shape of a man with brawny shoulders a full curling beard and the tail of a fish he had deepset eyes and arching eyebrows his hair was composed of ringlets of tiny crustaceans the stone swept up behind him apparently left in its natural state so that it looked like a miniature cliff from whose lip the water spewed out and over him his entire surface gleamed under the liquid lens of the font the daluzans are a religious people moichi said to chiisai when she commented on the statue much given to superstition folklore and myths i heard about the kaylro de of shaanghsei from the daisan she said still staring at the miniature figure yes well i think that the time of her physical manifestation is gone now though no doubt her spirit will never leave shaanghsei but time is cyclic dont you think these creatures she indicated the fountains figures or others very like them will return again in some other age no doubt moichi said with a wry twist of his lips but not i trust in ours the buildings around the plaza de la pesquisa were a good deal larger and more ornate than most they had seen on their way through the city and this oversize effect gave to the plaza a rather austere grandeur that was singular in corruna there were benches of scrolled wrought iron scattered at different points around the copse on one two old men small erlc v lusdader and with sundried skin like leather sat smoking pipes and chatting idly in the shade they were both dressed in pure white linen suits as elegant and neat as if they were on parade this color moichi knew was reserved here for the elderly perdoname senhores don estd la casa de la senhora seguillas y oriwara they both looked up ceasing their low chatter staring at him from head to foot they gazed at chiisai for a time before returning their attention to him one of the men pointed a bony finger at moichi said something to his companion in daluzan dialect so rapidly that moichi failed to understand it the other man laughed shortly not unkindly cocked his head his seablue eyes on moichi the old man who still pointed at moichi said you are not daluzan not of the blood he tapped the side of his nose with a finger i can tell he smiled enigmatically his square teeth were stained yellow by smoke but you could pass i warrant in a pinch ill just bet you could yes he stretched backward pointed over his shoulder there lies the house you seek on the far side of the plaza he smiled again is it not always so in life his companion nodded sagely at his side though he had been addressing moichi good day to you senhor senhora good luck moichi nodded murmuring his farewells and with chiisai went out from the edge of the copse across the sunsplashed plaza past the rustling olive trees the buzzing cicadas the small blackwinged birds flitting from tree to tree leaving the figure of the fountain behind moichi wore a seagreen silk shirt with wide sleeves and tight cobaltblue trousers which he had tucked into his high brown sea boots his sword hung scabbarded at his side and the twin copperhilled dirks were thrust casually into his wide leather belt chiisai still wore her armor breastplate but had changed into tight pants the color of palest sea foam also tucked into her high boots over her armor she wore her shaanghsei quilted jacket her twin scabbarded swords were clearly visible the seguillas y oriwara house was an enormous whitefacaded twostory structure on the north side of the plaza its left side abutted another building but on its right a street led off the plaza lush trees lined this thoroughfare and what portions of the house moichi could make out behind this verdant beneath an opal moon screen were covered in ivy reaching around along the upper story on the front of the house one was obliged to approach the copperandhardwood staircase facing left for it curved out and around as gracefully as a swans neck as it ascended toward the high double doors at the front of the dwelling these were woodpaneled banded with bronze strips which moichi was certain had at one time found service on an oceangoing schooner for time and the minerals of the sea had combined to give them a greenish patina they went up the staircase and moichi knocked on the doors the small wroughtiron balconies projecting from the upper floor windows in front contrived to put them in an obliquely banded light the doors swung ponderously inward two short darkhaired daluzans in black cotton onepiece suits held the doors but the man who confronted them was not daluzan at all he was tall towering even over moichi dwarfing chiisai he was too thin for his height this was ones immediate impression his gaunt face was hairless except for a thin black mustache which drooped forlornly on either side of his mouth his dark eyes were almondshaped and his skin had a yellow cast the vault of his domed head soared upward above his narrowbridged nose this man is from shaanghsei moichi thought yes the man said in perfect daluzan what is it you wish not the most cordial of welcomes moichi thought the man wore a daluzan suit in light yellow which consisted of highwaisted trousers and loosefitting shirt tied about the waist with a narrow braided cord sash if he was anned he concealed it well we wish to speak to the senhora seguillas y oriwara moichi said i am afraid that will be quite impossible senhor the senhora is entertaining no visitors nevertheless i believe the senhora will wish to see us we have come to corona aboard one of her own lorchas and bring news of her daughter something glittered far back in the mans eyes and he inclined his head follow me please i will inform the senhora the doors were closed behind them as they went down a eric y lustbader short vestibule and passing through an arch of stained glass entered into the main hall of the house this was two stories high and was domed almost cathedrallike paneled in pecan wood and hung at regular intervals with small tapestries de picting scenes of the sea and its denizens sea lions porpoises whales sounding at the end of the hallway a most singular stairway wound upward it appeared at this distance to be carved out of an enormous ships figurehead a maiden of the sea long tangled hair blown back by the wind on either side of the hallway rolling doors stood closed as they passed the first one on the right moichi saw it slide open for just a moment and glimpsed within the shadows beyond dark flashing eyes in a young female face the man with the drooping mustache led them through a rolling door further along on the left and into a drawing room then bidding them wait he left them here the plaster walls were painted green as dark as the depths of the ocean and were hung with paintings whose subject matter was invariably religious in nature the daluzans must have a very different feeling about religion chiisai said pacing from painting to painting how depressing is there no happiness associated with their gods they believe in the one god chiisai moichi said as do my folk as yet the kami are unknown to these people kami umhum the minor gods whose task it is to guide the souls of the dead back into their new lives moichi realized he knew very little of bujun religious thought we see existence as an enormous wheel life is merely one part of it she was at the last painting now and she paused death we believe brings an end to the corporeal only the spirit lives on and is returned to life guided by the kami and the individuals karma that is most important she was interrupted by the sound of the door sliding back they both turned framed in the doorway was the figure of a statuesque woman her hair was long framing her oval face and it was startlingly of the color and luster of silver she had the kind of face which would shine through all around her no matter the circumstances moichi could feel her intense aura all the way across the room and was reminded piercingly of beneath an opal moon aufeya she wore a silk suit of deep green which perfectly matched her large inquisitive eyes i am the senhora seguillas y oriwara she said in a voice like an ice floe may i know why you have come here somehow moichi was not surprised by this abrupt and decidedly inhospitable greeting the daluzans were quite schizophrenic in this regard they were fiercely polite even to the point of exasperation but on the other hand they could as easily be disconcertingly blunt when they so chose my apologies for disturbing you senhora moichi said inclining his head slightly he used the polite grammatical construction i am moichi annainin of iskael and my companion is chiisai of amanomori he paused hoping for a reaction he got one the senhoras eyes widened a fraction and she stepped into the room the mustachioed man stood just outside the rooms threshold as still as a statue an iskamen and a bujun the senhora said with some of the chill gone from her voice moichi could hear its true melodiousness an odd pair to say the least she indicated the man behind her chimmoku tells me you claim to have sailed here aboard one of my lorchas which one the chocante moichi said armazn is the bostun i see the senhora glanced back at chimmoku for a moment her hands clasped against her long thighs i did not even know that particular craft had left corruna senhora your daughter commandeered the chocante indeed the eyes flashed briefly and where was she headed moichi annainin that i do not know i came across her in shaanghsei no point in telling her about the sharida she told me she had been blown off course by a storm that she had not meant to come to shaanghsei he took a deep breath now for the difficult part she also told me that she was being pursued by a man he paused again expecting an outburst but the senhora stood calmly before him her expression unchanged tell me moichi annainin the senhora said slowly why have you come here your daughter has been abducted moichi said the senhora turned and glanced at chimmoku again before addressing moichi i am afraid dhere has been some mistake pardon me for saying so senhora but no mistake has been made a man named hellsturm erlc v leader hellsturm yes you know him then what no no i know no such person the name seemed odd to me that is all this man hellsturm snatched aufeya the senhora drew herself up her eyes imperiously cold what is it you want from me senhor money ships you have made a grave error you will get nothing from me now if you will senhora he felt as if reality were slipping through his fingers dreamlike perhaps my knowledge of daluzan is inadequate shall i repeat myself your yes i know my daughter has been abducted by a man with an odd name quite a fanciful story a mermans tale in daluzan idiom my friend was murdered by this man hellsturm he gave his life to protect aufeya i am sorry about your friend moichi annainin truly i am but you see this has no interest for me the senhora nodded in dismissal i have no daughter at last her hands unclasped now good day to you both chimmoku will see you out with that she turned and left them there outside they stood at the edge of the plaza for a moment the seguillas y oriwara house towered over them mute and mysterious they went toward the copse of olive trees sat down on a bench near the fountain the old men were gone but the blackbirds had not abandoned their arboreal world oblique light found its way into the plaza between the gaps of the surrounding buildings and the tops of the trees were aflame with the light of sunset were you able to understand what was said in there moichi said chiisai nodded pretty much im excellent in linguistics she changed into daluzan to illustrate why do you think the senhora was iying to us moichi raised his eyebrows and smiled well i see you are a fast learner she laughed i had rohia teach me in the evening when he was off watch very clever of you his smile faded as he recalled the beneath an opak moon i recent scene inside the seguillas y oriwara house something is very amiss ill say the senhoras daughter leaves corruna secretly is threatened by a strange man is finally captured by him and the senhoras only reaction is to deny aufeyas existence it makes no sense not yet it doesnt but at least we have a starting point you mean the senhora that is exactly what i mean but she will tell us nothing then we shall just have to find a way of making her talk wont we on the other hand if rohja successfully finds out about where that other ship docked we might not need the senhoras help at all chiisai pointed out moichi was about to tell her that life never seemed to be that simple when he heard a hissing sound from within the shadows of the dense foliage and he turned one hand on the hilt of his sword lust above and to one side of the fountain he saw the vague outline of a human head he and chiisai rose and went closer standing beside the fountain he saw the face clearly then and recognised those eyes as the ones regarding him from behind the sliding door in the seguillas y oriwara house senhor she breathed and he nodded i could not help but overhear what you told chimmoku do you know what has happened to auteya as i told the senhora moichi said she has been am ducted oh dihos the young womans cry was choked off as she brought her hands across her mouth what do you know of this moichi demanded the woman seemed to shrink back into the shadows murmuring let me try chiisai whispered to him and then to the woman what is your name senhora tola senhora i am aufeyas doncella chiisai turned her head maid moichi whispered i am chiisai she said and this is moichi we are friends of aufeya she pointed for emphasis moichi saved her life in shaanghsei tola stared from chiisai to moichi is this so moichi nodded how how does she look tola asked eric v lustbader both chiisai and moichi looked bewildered she was fine moichi said but you must have seen her before she left yes now it was tolas turn to look puzzled but that was many seasons ago no one here has seen her since she she left with the tudescan who was that chiisai asked what was his name why hellsturm of course she wrung her hands oh i knew that was an illomened day chiisai leaned forward touched the doncella are you certain tola aufeya left corruna with this man hellsturrn ay yes senhora how could i forget that day the senhora told all of us as far as this house is concemed my daughter is dead what do you mean chiisai asked dihos i have been gone too long perdoname i must go wait chiisai cried but tola was gone darting into the trees and out the other side using the shadows of the building to reach the far side of the plaza they found a smoky taverna of white adobe and blackened wood in between a barber shop and a building that was obviously a communal medical clinic there was a long queue passing through the wideopen doors and out into the street inside they could make out the shapes of several prone figures and smell the scent of various herbalbased medicaments the taverna was not as crowded as those in shaanghsei it was painted a brilliant white its low ceiling banded by thick beams one wall was taken up by an enormous stone hearth whose function was obviously ornamental for the kitchen could be seen behind a wooden coppertopped counter they found an empty table the only people near them were a pair of cures daluzan priests garbed in the traditional black dresses and stiff square hats one was quite young with rosy cheeks and a thick bulbous nose the other obviously older with saltandpepper hair and a spadeshaped beard was a cure of no little rank moichi observed for around his neck swung the gold chain and heavy doublecross pendant symbol of the daluzan church as they sat down a stunning waitress brought them a pot of compana the very fine local wine golden in colon moichi ordered for them while the woman poured the wine is it not interesting chiisai said after she had sipped at beneath an opal moon the cup that now the matter of auteya has been somewhat clarified and also made more complex yes we now know why the senhora disavowed her to us at least it was not a lie in that sense no but on the other hand she made no attempt to aid us and i find that curious after all auteya is her daughter would she really prefer to see her dead rather than lift a hand to aid her chiisai shrugged we could debate that point all night and not reach a satisfactory conclusion moichi grinned at her as the food arrived you have a way of cutting right to the heart of the matter chiisai i like that now this is what i propose when we leave here i will return to the seguillas y oriwara to find out what i can as for you there is yet another avenue that needs exploration cascaras the daluzan hellsturm tortured is from here also aufeya told me that he was once a trader of sorts i would like you to follow that up but where shall i begin i hardly know enough of corrufia yet there is a place in the centerof the city the mercado it is a meeting place for the merchants and traders not only of corrufia but of all dalucia i would suggest you start there perhaps someone knows where in kintai he journeyed hmph chiisai exclaimed with mock hurt you just dont want me around when you interview the senhora whatever gave you such an extraordinary idea i saw the way you looked at her i didnt look at her in any special way he lied i was joking actually she smiled archly but now i wonder youve protested so vehemently on another subject moichi said pointedly i want both of us there when we rendezvous with robja so meet me at the top of calle cordel just before midnight she nodded and began to eat as their conversation sputtered to a halt moichi was able to pick up some of what transpired between the two cures at the next table the money goes don gode said the cure with the spadeshaped beard the entire western facade of the iglesia must be dismantled so that it can be enlarged do you suppose eric v lustbader we can count on the palliate for all the funds for this his tone was disdainful but all that stained glass is so frightfully expensive said don gode the young cure surely don hispete we can devise a less expensive style in enlarging the iglesia and the money saved could be used to help feed and clothe my dear don gode the other interrupted heaving a great sigh as if the cares of the world were couched upon his shoulders have you any conception of the areas of corrufia our iglesia encompasses these are monied parishioners men and women of great prestige and honor and our new iglesia must reflect this grandeur but we are taught yes yes i know all that don hispete said irritably i was once in the palliate seminario myself although dihos knows it seems faraway to me now but when you have been with us here a sufficient amount of time you will begin to understand the complexities of running an iglesia in the palliate he reached into a serving dish plucking out a tiny boiled potato dripping with cream he popped it into his mouth said around it as he chewed what you must remember don gode out here in the field as it were is to forget everything you learned at the seminario he laughed uproariously swallowing he plucked up another potato come come my boy surely you know i speak figuratively but the hard truth is that life out here is much different books after all are no substitute for life eh he lifted one fat forefinger a thick gold ring gleamed embedded in the pink flesh near its base do you understand no he brought a sliver of meat to his mouth chewed on it i agree it would be very nice to use the money we have so laboriously raised to aid those neediest but reality dictates otherwise grease glinted along his halfopen lips a bit of meat sat on his rounded chin atop the curling black hairs of his thick beard however much our hearts tell us to do otherwise we have a duty to the palliate that must override such personal preferences he took a quick gulp of wine and belched we get our money from our parishioners don gode let me tell you its quite a task making ends meet in these times oh seasons ago it was much easier but we have grown since then and times have changed quite naturally it is now a most complex business money makes the palliate flourish don gode never forget that faith is all well and good we beneath an opal moon mastery of the whole world but this too you will comprehend when i return from the land of the opal moon for a moment chiisai stood perfectly still she felt as if she had lost all breath and the rhythmic thudding of her heart was lilce a series of concussions against her rib cage mar she cleared her throat martyne did i hear you aright did cascaras say he was journeying to the land of the opal moon yes i did not recall it before why surely its merely a figure of speech merely a figure chiisai stared at her you do not know know what cascaras often talked in such flowery language it was a kind of verbal code he made up for himself to protect his destinations from those who might overhear not this time she put down her empty cup and rose you have been of enormous help more than you realize at last i know the cause of all of this martyne was staring at chiisai curiously for this last she had said to herself im glad i could help but never mind perhaps ill be able to explain it to you one day goodbye martyne and on light feet she left the mercado behind her a shadow detached itself from a darkened corner and slipped out after her into the night the room was painted a very dark blue deeper even than the evening sky the hue was enhanced by the domed ceiling crisscrossed by narrow arching gilt beams around the walls too the blue plaster panels were surrounded by gilt edging paintings of ships were hung at intervals the room was dominated by an enormous down bed very high with a brass headboard and a coverlet of exquisite manufacture of various shades of green great leadedglass windows opened out onto a lush garden in back in all it was an unusual chamber bespeaking iconoclastic tastes yet by far the most remarkable feature was the painting it hung as huge as a harvest moon directly over the bed in a heavy ornate gilt frame it was so arresting so chilling that one was compelled to wonder how she could sleep at night beneath its visage it depicted a daluzan farmer muscles bulging skin sweatslick in an open field painted in such perspective that it ap eric v iustbader peered to go on forever flat and changeless one great arm was around his wifes waist she cowered into the protection of his massive chest and shoulder as she desperately held on to a small child in his other hand the farmer held a great woodenhandled scythe which he had obviously been using to harvest his field now however it was raised into the darkening night sky for swooping down upon him and his terrified family was an enormous creature half man half bat the wide wings seemed to beat at the heavy air long curving talons extended from animal hands and human feet darting at the farmers throat just as the senhora seguillas y oriwaras extended fingers were slashing at moichis neck yet oddly he was able to take all the room in as they struggled across the floor moichi knew the basic blocks but this could only be termed a holding action for he had no offensive training in koppo too if she was an adept it would not take her long to circumvent his knowledge of the basics his flesh stung and his bones began to ache he blocked another vicious strike aimed at his collarbone were it to land he would be immediately disabled he rolled her over using the force of her own momentum to bring them both around fully and as he rode on top for just an instant used his superior weight to drive his elbow and forearm into her stomach still she came on with a nose strike that would surely render him unconscious if it struck in utter desperation he jammed his elbow home again crouched and used the full bulk of his shoulder driving downward thinking of her as a male opponent oh the breath whooshed out of her and she began to double up she tried to gasp but he held her down and no air was coming in she gagged about to choke on her own vomit and he let her up pinioning her arms behind her in a grip like iron she rocked against his shoulder gaining her wind astonishingly rapidly he felt the strength returning to her arms he tightened his grip on her wrists now senhora he said like it or no you will listen to what i have to tell you he stared coldly down at her her eyes flew open the pain fast diminishing and as he watched the tiny brown flecks in the jade he began to realise how extraordinarily beautiful she was with an effort he began to speak cascaras is dead sen beneath an opal moon hora tortured and then butchered in a shaanghsei taverns what is that to me she said savagely i know no one by that name she twisted violently attempting to free herself from his savage grip perhaps not he said calmly but i think you do know of him for he was a friend of your daughters when i met her senhora auteya was in shaanghsei about to be sold at auction in the sharida a swift intake of breath and for the first time he saw true emotion swimming within the jade seas of her eyes fear yes the sharida senhora where a hideous death awaits all who are sold this would certainly have been her fate had not i and a friend intervened later she told me she was being pursued by a man the same man who i believe murdered cascaras it was but ill fortune which took them both to the same city for they had planned it otherwise he watched her face closely and it seemed to him that it was constantly changing now but perhaps it was only the dim light combining with his own fancy auleya was terrified of this man senhora and i made the mistake of leaving her for a time he came and took her the man and in the process slew my friend and i tell you now senhora i mean to find auteya and bring her back just as i mean to destroy this man hellsturm her arms pinioned behind her caused her firm breasts to thrust out at him as if awaiting his caress in their battle the tied top of her blouse had come undone and now he could see all of the tops down almost to the nipples these were most apparent as they pushed against the thin material he tore his gaze away and said now i want you to answer my questions she stared up at his face and under her acute gaze he felt himself suffused with a peculiar feeling let go of me she whispered please her eyes closed for an instant then opened she was very close to him he shifted his grip on her wrists to aid circulation and this brought her torso forward so that the hardened tips of her breasts grazed his chest release me she murmured against the hollow of his neck release me and ill tell you all you wish to know she moaned as if in pain all i know then as if she were reading his mind i will not use the koppo slowly his hands came away from her wrists but he did erlc v lustbader not take his eyes from hers for it was there that he would know if she meant to betray him she flexed her fingers bringing them upward she stared into his eyes her fingers came against him this time softly with no malice what do you wish to know voice like the sigh of the wind at night her arms reaching her fingers climbing his chest past his shoulders until they went behind his head twined in his hair she pulled his head down to hers i shall tell you she whispered everything but her lips opened under his her tongue licking at his teeth her torso pressed against him and then she moved in some subtle way he was unable to fathom and her legs were apart scissoring about his hips he felt the frantic pressure of her as his arms surrounded her pressing at the base of her spine a rustling and then a soft moaning echoing on and on and on there was time now before she met moichi at the top of calle crdel and striding along corrunas nightdark streets she began to look for an open taverna hoping that it was not too late she needed some time alone to think she had taken the first corner on her side of the street as soon as she had left the mercado even though her mind had been filled by what martyne had unknowingly told her it was a matter of routine bujun training it was in fact part instinct which was perhaps one of the reasons why it was so monstrously effective turning the corner was the first basic used whenever one was in a foreign city and she had automatically begun to listen to the sound of her own footsteps then sorting one by one through the other sounds of the night around her trees rustling in the wind the cicadas whine and explosion of distant laughter echoing a door slamming and further away a dog barking angrily then she picked up the footfalls and she had known she was being followed almost as soon as she had made the turn she did not vary her pace but continued to walk down the street as if nothing was amiss she required two things now from her surroundings another corner and a deep doorway although a dark alley would do too in a pinch corner came up and she went around it to the left her eyes beneath an opal moon alert for the deep shadows time became critical now because there was little of it she had to have disappeared before found it slipped in on the left waited listening intently she remained quite still as she heard the sound of the footfalls approaching she tensed her muscles ready to she frowned something wrong in the sound chiisai gods she thought its martyne chiisai she began to sweat because she knew what was wrong now the sounds of the footfalls had changed there were two to look out for and she was remembering what had been done to kossori could see a figure now martyne a silhouette turning chiaroscuro as she passed a lantern then a return to darkness and it had to be now before she passed once more into light it was a chance and chiisai briefly debated whether to let her pass by but this too was dangerous especially if martyne was on the other side darted out one hand reaching for martynes arm the other cupped over her opening mouth back into the doorway what are you doing here she whispered fiercely chit the hand came over her mouth again whisper i came to warn you martyne said softly breathlessly someone is following you i know oh and then oh im sorry now ive ruined it chiisai gazed out along the street perhaps not she strained to hear the footfalls the heavier ones and now she heard them knew it was too late to get the other woman safely away from here well she would just have to push her back into the shadows and hope no one saw her dont worry martyne whispered im armed she reached silently down to her waist withdrew something chiisai stared at it it was fully half a meter in length longer than any knife she had ever seen before its blade was of an unusual construction triangular chiisai had seen one like it in a village in the countryside of amanomori it was a hunters knife it was explained to her the blade giving it exceptional force when it pierced the animals flesh one must reach a vital organ quickly and without destroying the flesh for one hunts eric v lustbaler onlyforfood this knife of martynes she knew was a potent weapon perfect for close combat its a missra martyne whispered a tudescan military weapon chiisai saw by the way she held the missra that she knew how to use it and abruptly she was happy to have this strange woman at her side for she could pick out at least five distinct sets of footsteps closing now she drew her daikatana the bujun longsword it was named as was the custom with all weapons at the moment it had first tasted blood chiisais was known as kishsushi the deathrider she could see the glint of metal now as they passed through the penumbra of the lantern and then returned to darkness she turned to martyne whispered if we should get separated somehow meet me at the top of calle cordel at midnight no one must follow you there do you understand martyne nodded you can count on me chiisai fervently hoped so with a chill battle cry chiisai leapt into the street the daikatana held high above her in a twohanded grip already beginning its lethal downward sweep as soon as she had planted her feet firmly on the cobbles they were massive their shadows looming larger by far even than moichi but she was a bujun a warrior from birth kishsushi split the night air humming then slammed into the collarbone of one of the men on the left opening him up to his navel the corpse danced drunkenly spewing blood and organs into the street the man had not even had time to cry out their swords were straight perhaps heavier than her own doublebladed but they had not been forged by the bujun the supreme masters in such things her blade wove a deadly web of silver in the air as pink and gold sparks flew at the points where the weapons intersected clashing deafeningly one against the other her opponents she saw now were sturdy tudescans immensely powerful and disciplined these two before her worked in perfect unison timing their blows and movements as if both sword arms belonged to one body chiisai was aware after only a few moments that martyne had neither been iying nor exaggerating about the savagery of beneath an opal moon the tudescans these were animals in the guise of men murderous fanatics appallingly dangerous she began to feel fatigue for it was as if she battled an ungiving brick wall yes she supposed she was quicker in her reflexes but these warriors had only to move their huge weapons fractionally in order to block her thrusts this of course was what they were counting on once she slowed down even slightly they would move in for the kill there was a strategy open to her she could feign more fatigue than she actually felt thus forcing them to commit themselves prematurely but this she felt certain would fool but one of them still she slowed down her defences and immediately the tudescan on the right attacked her with ferocious acumen chiisai cried out and ducking beneath the murderous blow swept her sword in on a horizontal strike leaning into it with all her might the man went down as if poleaxed now she stepped back hearing for the first time the sounds of battle behind her martyne she withdrew her shorter blade and now she stood feet wide apart doubly weaponed she attacked slashing high against one warrior using kishsushi in a horizontal strike across his chest this he blocked effortlessly by bringing his own sword up obliquely but chiisai had already begun the inward movement of the shorter sword he saw it at the last instant and all he could do was move his body it was not nearly enough to save him the blades point punctured him on the left side but as chiisai compensated for his defensive motion the sword slashed in toward his spine his knees buckled and he knelt on the cobbles as if praying to his gods then he toppled over and lay still the fourth tudescan moved in more cautiously but she had made a mistake in watching his face and thus missed the blur of his swordpoint it had not been aimed directly at her so there was no reflex action on her part but the warrior had contrived to slap her short sword a glancing blow still the blade was so huge and the force behind it so awesome that the strike sent her short sword whirling out of her grasp clattering across the cobbles she went low then high and he blocked them both and all the while he was forcing her back slashing at her again and again she realized that she was expending energy more rapidly than she would want she saw too that she was coming eric v lustbader to an alley which meant a more confined space she would be at a distinct disadvantage wielding the long daikatana the only thing to do was to get rid of it thus in the entranceway to the alley she allowed him to disarm her then she fell rolling into him with enough force to bowl him over as he went down she withdrew her dirk and slashed out stabbing he was now constrained to release his own sword for at these close quarters it was more of a hindrance than a help but he got one hand up quickly enough to ward off her first blow deflect the second and then he was into a counterattack which almost undid her she panted and fought while he endeavored to get on top of her in order to use his superior weight to full advantage she knew however that if she allowed this to happen it would be the end for her and so she switched hands driving the dirks blade from the opposite side he saw it only at the last moment and he tried to deflect it again but this time he was unprepared for the angle and thus missed its coming in nevertheless it was not a killing blow the blade passing through the fleshy area just above the pelvis on the right side he gritted his teeth and tried once more for supremacy but chiisai held on twisting the blade with a tenaciousness that balked him then he threw her off and gaining his feet stumbled off down the alley thinking only now of resuming from whence he had come chiisai aware of his intent was obliged to make another splitinstant decision to stay and help martyne or to follow the tudescan in the end it was not much of a decision because realistically the odds were piled on one side and the odds said that if she were able to successfully follow this warrior without being detected he would lead her to hellsturm once his base was known she would hopefully still have time to make the rendezvous with moichi sheathing her daikatana and retrieving her short sword she went carefully down the alley following the tudescan home you know you look daluzan her fine face was softened now by the loss of tension streaked with a combination of saliva and sweat that is why i did not believe your story and moichi thought she looks almost as young as aufeya beneath an opal moon now younger in some sense she possessed a kind of littlegirl quality that was hard to describe soft and vulnerable yet without a trace of the weakness he despised in people i am quite wealthy senhora seguillas y oriwara said softly as you no doubt know this makes me a target she was completely naked iying beside him atop the coverlet of greens her body magnificent in its dusky sensuality shadows pooling in the sweeping concavities lent her flesh a mysteriousness of aspect matching her spirit there are very few days that go by when someone or other is not seeking money she sighed softly turning against him in the enormous bed the darkness of the painting rising above their heads was subtly oppressive i rarely go out now because often far too often these people no longer ask but demand her eyes stared into his can you understand that position being a man he laughed attempting to leach away some of her returned anxiety it had leapt from her to him at first contact and had pursued him doggedly throughout their time of loving but with the koppo she shook her head you see you dont understand whether i am a warrior whether i can defend myself in whatever manner i choose has absolutely no bearing on this she put a hand on his chest spread her fingers caressing his skin tell me would a man whether skilled or not as a warrior ever find himself in such a position he saw her point and shook his head no she relaxed somewhat you mean that dont you yes of course i would not say it otherwise not even to please me do i not please you in ways that are more honest for the first time since he had met her earlier that day he saw her smile yes yes as i have pleased you as you have pleased me yes he took her hand from his flesh kissed it do you not care about your daughter she came onto her back staring up at the domed vault of the cathedral ceiling a very long time ago she said in a quiet voice wrapped in the veils of the past i was an independent woman i sailed the seas on my own ship battled taking what i wanted commanding a crew of thirtyseven all fiercely loyal to me and me alone does that surprise you she looked over at him for a moment just the flick of a glance eric v tbader not particularly there is a storm inside of you i felt it all the time we made love a tidal wave of emotion you are far too strong to be known as someone elses wife no matter how influential or wealthy he might be she made no comment to this merely returned her gaze heavenward and continued was happy yet at the same time filled with an inexplicable sadness which would overwhelm me when i lay down to sleep it got so that i began to dread then hate the night i could not remain in my cabin oppressed as i was by that nameless terror so i would walk the decks avoiding those on watch save for the bosun who the first night he saw me up and pacing brought me a mug of hot grog and every night after that it helped somewhat being alone in the night as if i could cleanse myself in the starlight and the moonlight but all that ran through my head was the thought its not enough but what was it i wanted a nightingale perched upon the branches of the spreading pine in the garden outside the opened windows began to sing over its shoulder he could see the thinnest slice of the new moon like a sliver of delicate melon served up at the end of a banquet above the treetop the sluice of the stars part of the river of heaven as sailors throughout the known world called it soon i became convinced that it was more money i craved thus i assuaged my sadness and fear by falling in with someone i met in a faroff port by the shore of a river that has no name we made a pact i was given many implements which would aid me and within the space of a single season i had gathered in more money than i had in the previous eight or nine i began to sleep at nights and i was certain that i had found my cure my partner of course got half of all i took in but that bothered me not at all for the ship was always riding low on the sea with the vast amounts of gold and silver and precious stones i had acquired so it went for many seasons the ease of it at first astounding and then in the course of time taken for granted but all too soon i found myself again not able to sleep at night as i lay awake crying in my cabin i had not after all found my cure he watched the rhythmic rise and fall of her breasts as she benen n opalmoon g spoke the play of soft light and shadow over the features of her face now my partner requested certain things of me assignments you might call them some i had no compunction against doing others did not sit well with me but when i balked my partner insisted and i found myself abruptly in an untenable position thus i began to be manipulated as i was coerced now this peculiar unformed terror seized me always until at last i could bear the pain in my mind no longer i went to my partner and said that i had no stomach for the work i was laughed at she spat in my face and told me that didnt i know all who worked for her did so for the length of their own lives i told her that i could not bear to work for her a moment longer and threw at her feet all the arcane implements she had given me she was enraged she shook her fist at me saying that she could slay me now but would not that one day i would remember that moment and wish she had destroyed me then she turned her head and looked at him the light turning her jade eyes black for a moment but i had to leave you see for i had at last found out what it was that distressed me so in the course of my travels i had met someone i had left him you see well i had to my work dictated that now i realized that he was what i missed so terribly that it was a scar upon my heart throbbing every night i never saw him again of course one never does in situations like that the world is far too vast and in any event too much time had passed to make such a search practicable thus when i took leave of my partner i went ashore in search of a man who would make me happy in due time i met milhos seguillas and never again have i been to sea she was silent for a moment and moichi found himself wondering despite his fascination with her story just what all this had to do with aufoya i do not want my daughter to repeat my mistakes she said at last i am afraid there is not much one can do about such things life it seems is oftentimes the only valid teacher yes i have learned that the hard way what do you mean she sat up as if some inner turmoil would not now let her rest we have not been on the best of terms aufeya and not for a long time and before she left before she left what eric v lustbader little we did speak to each other was awful we argued constantly about what she turned her head away from him for a moment her thick hair sliding across her shoulders oh well the usual things between mother and daughter everything everything was blown out of all proportion why did she run away then she was silent still turned away from him he reached out and touched her neck she did run away didnt she i dont want to talk about it he could feel the tension singing in every muscle of her body yes you do he told her gently i think you want to talk about it very much she moved back against him a minute shift but it conveyed so much he felt the vibrations realized belatedly that she was crying silently perhaps ashamed that he should see her thus more naked than ever she could be in purely physical terms slowly he put his arms around her holding her to him feeling the weight of her breasts against his wrists he rocked her gently waiting for her to continue at length she did i had only been in corruna a very short time when i met milhos you see before that directly before mat i had been in rhein tudesca on the last of my business assignments for my partner i had met a man there a strange magnetic beautiful man and for the time i had been in port well i stayed with him it was hellsturm outside the nightingale had ceased its song and now even the darkness itself seemed to be holding its breath but the night seemed a million miles away to him part of another universe where people loved and laughed did mundane things such as have dinner go out to a play or perhaps just stroll quietly down near the sea here a kind of chilling numbness had entered the room at some time when he had been looking elsewhere now it seemed to enwrap them both even as the leathery wings of the gigantic manbat sought to enfold the daluzan family above their heads many seasons later he came to corruna for he had heard that was where i was bound when i left him by that time i was already married to milhos and deeply in love but none of that seemed to matter to him he wanted me he was persistent but at last i prevailed upon him to leave me alone i beneath an opal moon spent a night with him milhos knew none of this then i knew how he would take it he was a man of great honor then for many seasons life went on and i forgot all about hellsturm i became pregnant and i had aufoya both milhos and i were delighted she grew up time seems to accelerate when you have a child then inexplicably hellsturm returned as if from the mists beyond time itself and it all began again except this time there was aufeya she put her hands against her face her fingers slender and lovely her long nails gleaming when she took them away her eyes seemed haunted the green dulled she was at an age when everything seems difficult she is an extraordinarily beautiful girl my aufeya and at that time she was just ripening she was wild and never more so than at that age she longed to be a woman and thus delighted in keeping around as many men as she could manage it was a goodly number i objected to this most strenuously sending them away and she was furious but i did not think it right i too was wild when i was her age and i begrudged her no wildness of her own but i had had no benefit of parents in my youth and had gotten into so much trouble that at times later i would wonder how i lived to become a woman this danger i could not allow to touch aufeya yet my restrictions only served to make her more contrary and we argued ceaselessly she shook her head and he watched her eyes into this came hellsturm wanting the same thing this time i refused him utterly it was out of the question i told him i had thought i suppose foolishly that one night would get rid of him forever she ran her fingers through her hair her head lifted and now he saw the motes in her eyes as bright as flecks of gold he got to aufeya at school at the mercado at a taverna there were any number of places he told her many things some i imagine based on truth but he has a way of twisting everything even the truth so that it serves his purpose he has a tongue of gold that one she took his hand palm upward traced the lines of his thumb and fingers easy enough to guess what happened next he seduced her as he had seduced me so many seasons before but in the process he poisoned her mind against me she went off with hire dihos only knows where and that was the last i saw of her what about the senhor said it very softly he felt her shudder i had to tell him then naturally his temper was at times uncontrollable and as i said he was a eric v lustbader terribly proud man he challenged hellsturm to a duel now moichi recalled in full armazns words and wondered could he be right could the senhora have been in league with hellsturm against milhos seguillas but for what reason there was one possible answer the senhora had loved her husband but perhaps she loved her daughter more dihos i was terrified i knew from experience what hellsturm was like and i knew that despite his prowess milhos had little chance of surviving against him so i pleaded with him i cried i screamed i threatened but it was no good i am not daluzan you see i am not of the blood l had no clear idea then just how sacred was the daluzan duel once the challenge had been given there was no way to rescind it even if milhos had wanted to which he certainly did not there was no turning him away she stopped abruptly as if she had come to the end of her tale go on he prompted there is nothing much left to tell really milhos met hellsturm and died there was silence for a time and he listened to the quietude of the night interrupted only briefly by a soft clatter of wings he wondered if a storm was on the way inside this room he had no way of telling if the wind had shifted i had heard about the duel before i must confess her hand moved back and forth over the turnedback coverlet smoothing nonexistent wrinkles aboard the lorcha he continued trying to get her attention but then it had a somewhat different ending oh she did not even turn around it was said that the duel had not been fair she laughed without humor would that it were so moichi for then hellsturm would be fair game for me to hunt down and kill i hate him with all my heart and soul but hes taken your daughter she went with him willingly then tell me why when i met her she was terrified of him he has pursued me for ten thousand kilometers she said to me people change perhaps she has grown up she knows now just how evil people can be he felt the need to return to the other question there was talk of you poisoning your husband in order to let hellsturm win the duel beneath an opal moon her head turned what who told you such a lie armazn ah i might have known it makes no sense oh yes moichi it makes perfect sense because he was devoted to the senhor she nodded yes and hopelessly in love with me chameleon that was the basis of it the bujun were masters at observing nature and learning from it the chameleon was a harmless creature it was nonaggressive and it could be outrun by many predators what nature had given it was the remarkable ability of camouflage so that it could blend in with any surrounding the bujun had taken this and adapted it as the basis of their surveillance techniques now she knew that it was not going to work because there was something missing in order to be able to blend in with ones surroundings one first needs those surroundings in shaanghsei or in her own native eido there would be no problem but this was corruha she needed people and there just werent any so it was not going to work because the only way that wounded tudescan would lead her to his base was if he believed that no one was following him had he even suspected her presence he would lead her on a roundabout and if she were going to sightsee she preferred to do it on her own naturally the density of people during the daylight hours is much higher than at night but cities such as shaanghsei or eido never sleep and even in the dead of night there are a sufficient number of people about not in corruha by sound alone she was liable to be given away and the moment he suspected she would have to call it off because of the roundabout now each moment she delayed increased the chances of his spotting her she did the only thing she could do she went off the streets he rolled off the bed went across the room to the windows stuck his head outside and sniffed a redwinged blackbird disturbed by the intrusion clattered away in alarm a storm eric v leader was indeed coming from the west back inside the room he kept his back to the huge painting it still gave him chills perhaps they had a fight he said a falling out he meant aufeya and hellsturm i hope so knowing them both it seems likely he turned on her you are certainly taking this calmly her dark eyes watched him intently for a moment you do not know my daughter at all well moichi she precipitates fights like clouds release rain fights are one thing he said patiently but she was obviously terrified of the man he tortured cascaras then murdered him cascaras was a friend of aufeyas oh well there you have it then hellsturm is a jealous man when it comes to his women she said to me only i am left to stand against him i know what i heard in any case cascaras was old enough to be her father that would certainly not deter her by god senhora i do not understand you he thundered quite right my darling you dont she reached up for him now come here what do you want what do you think he knelt atop the bed and she drew him toward her he kissed her opened lips his mouth sliding down the smooth column of her neck she was quite irresistible apart from the lushness of her body moichi had been with women who were as finely formed but she had an aura that was palpable a kind of sexual intensity which spoke directly to the very core of his being downward to her hanging shivering breasts mmmm she moaned afterward the first thing she said was you are in love with aufeya his head snapped up and he stared into her eyes what makes you say that a mother knows she laughed not unkindly he pulled away from her embrace this is fun for you she smiled and why not i havent had much fun lately her fingers reached for him can you tell me honestly that you did not enjoy it yourself no but you know very well what i mean yes she said her eyes flashing i know only too well beneath an opal moon but you must take my word for it aufeya is in no danger hellsturrn will not harm her how can you be so certain because she said softly i have promised to return to him the major problem now was the inconstant moon clouds had begun moving in from the northwest riding past the face of the horned moon its silver light played in and out because of the nights monochrome illumination perspectives and distances were difficult enough to judge under normal circumstances these were far from normal circumstances distances were of course increased and motion was constant but cerebration was continuing all the time the only real danger was at the edges chiisai raced across a flat rooftop slowing only just before the low tile parapet now the moon had gone in once more and the dense shadows leapt upward distorting the space between the buildings corrections had to be made on the run she sprang across the narrow abyss hit a small stone on landing and tumbled immediately drawing herself up into a compact ball rolling dissipated much of the momentum and she was on her feet again silently flitting amid the flock of bats hovering about the rooftop the tudescan had never left her sight and now though he checked behind him at odd intervals and was quite thorough in other ways using shadows and doorways where he could he was totally unaware of her across the maze of corruna they fled the hunter and the hunted its part of the bargain we made she said he cannot touch her now but i tell you that he already has that is quite impossible then something has changed perhaps there is an element you know nothing about he would not put in jeopardy what he desires above all else restless he went back to the window searching for the moon it was only a wan glow now behind small and puffy cumulus driving in from the northwest eric v lustbader a storm for certain he thought it was nearing midnight i have to go he said will you come back her voice seemed suddenly small in the huge room with the cathedral ceiling and the fearful painting yes he answered how could i not but perhaps not again tonight in the morning then all right she turned on him abruptly and he saw a fear shining in her jade eyes he started slightly seeing aufeya there promise me youll come moichi her fingers gripped him with a fierce pressure there is only you now in all the worldi are you not my friend moichi she asked desperately has this evening meant so lisle to you it has meant a great deal to me he said thinking that perhaps he did understand her now he had been given a gift something quite precious something she withheld from almost everyone save hellsturm now it was ironic almost amusing if it had not been so utterly desolately tragic this womans love for her daughter transcended everything else now it was his turn he could accept or refuse it means a great deal to me it always will we are friends you do me a great honor it was formal even seeming somewhat stilted after their previous intimacy yet he knew full well one was of the flesh and the other well it was quite easy to make the body perform drawing the spirit in was quite another thing there was no known coercion for that only corruption as if on cue they came together kissing each other chastely on the lips inside he felt her spirit swirling toward him felt his emerging they danced the room was quite still presently they drew apart she to draw on her robe he to dress for the street before he left he asked her one question why do you have that painting in this room it is of the diablura do you know of it no in the daluzan beneath an opal moon religion the diablura is the ancient of night the emperor of evil the devil the devil yes why is it here to remind me always come and sit next to me little one the daisan had said little one was what chiisai meant they were in the palace of the kunshin just outside of eido the capital of amanomori have you any idea what you wish to do with your life she looked at him he had been in amanomori for some time now but she never tired of searching the seemingly endless configurations of his strange visage every time she thought she had committed it to memory she would look again and find it different than she had remembered it though she might have seen him just the day before sometimes there was only some subtle change at other times the differences were great he might appear frightening to others like a god embodied and come to earth for more than anything else this was perhaps what he was yet to her he was much more he was a brother a brother she had never had but had always yearned for are you playing my fathers role now she asked him only half serious he smiled his peculiar smile a devastating gesture and she realised abruptly how she cherished his friendship and his love he stood up towering over her he took her hand in his her skin feeling the harsh abrasive hide of the gauntlet shall we go outside the construction was of a question but the inflection was not it was just past midday the heat of the lemoncolored sun struck them enveloping them in its warmth cicadas shrilled and grey plovers shot up from their hiding places in the tall grass the horizon was laced with the domed configurations of the cryptomeria and the high swordedged pines far in the distance loomed the purple slopes of fugiwara wreathed now in a gentle haze and before it she knew was the newly completed shrine at the site of haneda castle birthplace of the daisan destroyed in the titanic death struggle between dorsefrith and the dolman during the time of his birth eric v lustbader are you happy here though the daisan spoke perfect bujun the ancient of languages which only a few bujun still learned the configurations of his mouth lent his speech peculiar inflections which took some time to decipher chiisai wondered at his using the old tongue she of course being the kunshins daughter was also fluent she longed to know what he wanted or at the very least what it was she was expected to say as if divining her thought he said tell me the truth little one nothing else is important all right she said gratefully feeling as if a great weight had been taken off her under his intense gaze she felt a melting within herself and with it a subtle tension which had been holding her ebbing no im not he nodded i understand you do she had not believed that anyone would which was why she had until this moment held this knowledge secret even in some ways from herself oh yes he said his voice like the rolling of thunder over a vast plain too have known the restlessness which now haunts you there was no reason to hide it little one but my father my darling your father understands these things he asked me to speak to you because he knows well the power of bujun tradition i could not tell him these things directly he surmised this i want to go away she said for the first time trulyrealizing it herself but i dont want him to think that i am abandoning him i am quite certain that whatever sadness he feels will be dispelled by his thoughts of your happiness he looked away from her now that thats settled where would you like to go i why i dont really know would you care to sail to shaanghsei even recalling it now hearing his echoey voice again in her mind she knew he had said it with complete innocence totally devoid of overtones or hidden meanings she had been delighted and had accepted immediately he said when you arrive i want you to see a friend of mine little one you have heard me speak his name often my bondbrother beneath an opal moon moichi yes moichi annainin this is very important little one i want you to see moichi annainin i want you to give him the gifts i have for him how long shall i stay in shaanghsei she asked he fumed to her the sunlight striking the odd planes of his face never had he looked more startling nor more beautiful to her that is entirely up to you but i imagine that you may wish to stay there quite some time now as she flitted like some human bat across the sloping rooftops of corruna chiisai wondered at that longago meeting she thought that for once the daisan had been proven wrong for she had surely not stayed in shaanghsei for any length of time yet though she might well have felt alone and afraid in this strange city she felt only a kind of excited warmth stealing over her was this truly why she had come to the continent of man and was it merely a coincidence that she had arrived at shaanghsei it was after all the continent of mans largest port and not so coincidentally the closest one to amanomori still she could not put out of her mind the fact that the daisan had suggested it as her destination she had never questioned that nor secondguessed herself surely it had been she and she alone who had been master of her fate she had always been free to choose whatever destination she had desired she had chosen shaanghsei or had she echoes of the daisans last words to her rebounded in her mind now i imagine that you may wish to stay there quite some time old he know something that she did not she shrugged mentally putting the puzzle aside for the moment she had more pressing matters to occupy her attention they were now in the far western quarter of corruna and the tudescan despite his twists and sums was still heading almost due west at this rate they would soon leave the city far behind them she glanced upward for a moment checking the position of the moon to gauge the time it was but a diffuse glow now sifting through the scudding clouds which had begun to move in more strongly from the northwest perhaps a storm she thought and fervently hoped that it would hold off until the tudescan reached his destination he was still moving west and she knew that unless she broke edc ye lus ader off she would never make the rendezvous with moichi sweat broke out along the line of her forehead and on her upper lip but wiping it away she remembered martyne and silently prayed to her gods that the woman had been victorious and would make the rendezvous in her stead for the moment she ignored the other problem for now the tudescan was at last slowing carefully making a final check in all directions this was it and waiting until he had completed his survey of the surrounding area she swung down from the rooftop into the street behind him grateful because the diminished light was making longrange surveillance hazardous they were in a section of the city densely packed with twostory buildings only corrunas iglesias seemed to be taller windowless with flat undecorated roofs warehouses she surmised for it was here that the major overland trade routes to other daluzan cities and to the lands beyond dalucias borders converged at corrunas western outskirts here for the first time she saw families of people asleep in the streets against building walls in darkened doorways these were workers who awakened each day just as dawn was about to break in the eastern sky to meet the vast silent caravans arriving from faroff lands and were paid a few coppers to offload the myriad dry goods ferrying them on their backs to the nearby warehouses of the merchants she went carefully between them as the wounded tudescan had not wanted to wake them and at length in a huge courtyard she spied a small caravan of perhaps six camels waiting to depart they were within the shadows of the high western gate of the city it was to this group of men squatting around a small fire that the tudescan went chiisai dared not get close enough in the quiet desolate night to hear what they were saying but she crept up until she had a decent view one put a blanket onto the ground for the wounded man working on him while another squatting near the prone mans head questioned him about what had transpired there came a quick movement from the squatting man he shouted something that was quite incoherent to her and hauled the wounded man up onto his feet he seemed enormously powerful there came more shouting and abruptly she felt movement behind her and whirled saw two huge eyes staring past her out of a small face it was a young cambujo girl one of the many children of the workers bniiath an opal moon families who lived here without proper housing she had been awakened by the noise and now craned her neck to see what all the commotion was about chiisai returned her attention to the scene of the argument just in time to see the brief flash of metal as the angered man thrust a knife into the stomach of the wounded man he threw the corpse from him with the tip of his boot as if it was just so much fetid garbage could this be hellsturm if so he had not taken kindly to his henchmans failure now chiisai could feel the presence of the young girl closer behind her so near in fact that she could discern the others shivers she turned her body slightly and opened out her right arm the girl crawled into the warm space and chiisai wrapped her in her cloak then as she watched the caravan camp she knew that she had run out of time all the men were standing one of them kicked desultorily at the fire another swung a canvas saddlebag onto the neck of one of the camels she saw now that the animals had been feeding they were nearly finished when that happened she knew the caravan would be off she looked at the shivering girl crouched beside her head on her shoulder then back to the readying caravan from her sash she drew out three copper coins held them out so that the girl could see what they were then she pressed them into the small hand closing the fingers around them the girl lifted her head staring at her wonderingly and chiisai put her lips to the girls ear for long moments the girls eyes were wide black as obsidian do you know where to go chiisai whispered in daluzan the girl nodded emphatically you must start now chiisai said what is my name chiisai the girl said she smiled up at the strange face chiisai goes northwest waters edge r alle crdel was deserted when he arrived it was just before midnight he judged squinting up at the smudge of moonlight this too was fast disappearing as the cloud cover thickened he sniffed could smell it now the storm he pulled his daluzan cloak tight about him but the rising wind plucked at its edges exposing the silken lining had this been one of milhos seguillas if so he knew it was a singular honor that the senhora had given it to him she was so much a lady he looked around him shuttered doorways and darkened windows only a few flickering night lanterns for company where was chiisai he glanced upward reflexively again but now all traces of moonlight had left the sky in the distance he thought he could hear a rolling boom of thunder a thin grey dog with a matted coat padded down a side street stopped regarded him for a moment then lifted its leg and urinated against the side of a building the dog turned and sniffed it before mooching slowly onward nose to the ground for any trace of something to eat the trees whispered their enigmatic sighing song they bowed slightly past midnight now where was she he turned abruptly at a sharp sound boots against cobbles for a moment they stopped and he turned away then they resumed he turned back a woman came into view tall and longnecked her face beneath an opal moon was in shadow she stopped when she saw his bulk tentative now but unafraid he saw that she carried a weapon in her left hand at the ready who are you he said she said nothing but continued to stand in the center of the street there was no one else around he moved a step closer the shadows made it impossible for him to tell anything about her this he did not like the knife with the triangular blade was lifted so that he could see its explicit threat come no closer she warned her voice floated to him eerily on the night he felt the change in atmospheric pressure and the rolling crack of thunder was unmistakable he stared from the black pool of her face to the knifeblade with a start he saw that it was dark and shiny blood this woman had but recently been in some kind of fight are you in need of help he asked she stood as immobile and silent as a statue are you hurt i am unharmed she said after a time will you leave willingly or the blade moved a fraction higher i am here to meet someone he said a friend i will not move now she took a step forward partially into the aureole of light from a nearby lantern swinging in its cage as the rising wind tossed it you are not daluzan no he saw her face for the first time long and narrow and attractive a strong face full of character he wondered who she was then it occurred to him that she would be asking herself the same questions i am moichi annainin of is kael this statement seemed to quell some of her suspicion and he saw her relax somewhat he saw her peering at him closely you are not tudescan he stiffened what know you of tudescans here too much she said my friend and i were attacked by five tudescans some little time ago they followed her from the mercado and chiisai she stepped up to him placed the knifepoint just under his breastbone eric l ustbader he made no move merely stared into her eyes they were large and glossy and intelligent quickly now tell me she snapped are you friend or chiisai is my friend he said evenly taking no offense at her brusque manner she is the only daughter of the kunshin of the bujun she is royalty said the other she did not tell me she would hardly wish it known he said he noticed that the knifepoint still touched his shirt front i set a rendezvous with her earlier to meet me here just before midnight now the knife disappeared inside the others cloak i am martyne she said chiisai told me to meet her here at midnight if we were separated in the melee we were what has happened to her she is all right she killed three of the tudescan warriors and wounded a fourth perhaps she did this deliberately for she allowed him to escape and then went after him clever girl moichi thought but now they were out of touch with each other he shrugged mentally there was nothing he could do now but carry on with what he had planned to do he had no idea where she was he would just have to wait to see if she contacted him come on he said turning i have to meet a daluzan in a taverna at the foot of calle crdel you might as well come along i want to hear the whole story el cambiro was at the foot of calle crdel hard by the wooden wharves of corruna the smell of the sea was thick in the air rich and heady and robust and moichi breathing deeply felt instantly invigorated the creaking of the ships fittings as they rested some distance out at anchor came to him as sharp and clear as if they had been alongside that was the water he knew an excellent conductor of sound both above and below fishermen were already taking down their nets from where they had hung drying in the hot sun all the long afternoon now they spread them out along the quiet quays before the dew got to them roofing the hemp to pick out the last few bits of seagrape and flotsam that had caught there the day before then rolled them carefully up into long lines taking them two men to a net on board their fishing lorchas stowing them on deck and covering them with an oiled cloth tarp beneath an opal moon a bit of canvas fluttered in the wind thumping the slapslap of the tide against the piling increasing as the coming storm whipped up the surface of the sea beyond the sanctuary of the port he could see that the sea was already heavy visibility was unusually clear and the horizon restlessly shifting with the swells stretched blackly away the taverna was a low squat structure of whitewashed plaster with a swinging wooden door through which lemon light poured beckoningly and with a creaking sign over its frontage depicting a giant crab so elaborately carapaced it seemed pre historic they went inside the place was as wide as it was deep its roughhewn walls echoed in the plain wooden tables and chairs stained with a combination of drink and seawater the ceiling was low with thick wooden beams striping its length an enormous fire crackled in a stone hearth set into the far wall a dark wood bar curved along the lefthand wall behind it shelves lined with bottles it was smoky inside and smelled of liquor and fat and tallow moichi led martyne to an empty table in a corner opposite the bar where he could see the door without having to turn around they ordered a local brew as thick and dark and almost as sweet as mead the place was not quite half full a seaman sat slumped over near the hearth his head cradled in his burly arms a line of empty glasses at one elbow no one bothered to take them away not even when he twitched in his sleep and sent one of them crashing to the earthern floor a pair of weathered sailors their faces lined and scarred played dice the rattle rhythmic and soothing like the slap of the sea against a ships hull the fat man with greasy jowls and a threedayold beard behind the bar hummed a tuneless sea chantey wiping at the already gleaming bar top it was well past midnight a tall daluzan sailor came in and taking off his knit cap smacked it against his thigh several times he went to the bar and the fat man drew him a drink then went back to his wiping the sailor took the glass to an unoccupied table and slumped down he took a long swallow smacked his lips noisily moichi sipped at his drink not liking it much martyne had eric y iustbader told him as much as she knew but he wished that she knew more she had obviously provided chiisai with a crucial clue to the key of this entire affair this she had repeated to him but he still had no idea what it meant he was abruptly angry at chiisai for running off unfortunately he had to agree with what she did to allow such a chance to slip past would have been inexcusable but of a sudden he felt in the dark and it was a truly uncomfortable sensation he felt as if he were battling shadows the door opened pulling him away from his gloomy thoughts a cambujo boy thin and small came in and looked around he had a package under his arm he spotted moichi and trotted over to where he sat with martyne he handed moichi the package and started to leave whats this moichi asked the boy turned around shrugged only what it seems senhor a package for you how do you know me the boy shrugged again as if this were his only gesture the man on the pier who gave me the package he told me what you look like what man what did he look like it was dark senhor very little light i did not notice he turned away and ran out the door moichi stared down at the package for a moment it was fairly small wrapped in oiled paper with fishermans twine carefully he unwrappped it martyne gasped it was a mans heart covered in blood it was wrapped with a sweat andbloodsoaked purple headband rohjas moichi covered the thing up with the oiled paper and very quietly said i want you to get up and walk out of here as if nothing has happened go back to the mercado and forget all about this do you understand i want to help martyne whispered anything i can do i have just told you what you can do please do it now i will have chiisai contact you when it is safe when all this is over im sorry i brought you here martyne it was foolish on my part please go now she stared at him for a minute then nodded briefly she slid out of the chair and went to the door went through it without looking back beneath an opal moon when she had gone he stood up he left rohjas heart where it sat covered on the table and left the taverna now he burned with a cold fury there was nothing but the sea and the sky the racing clouds had erased even the shadows he thought that it would be fruitless but he did it anyway nothing could have stopped him he prowled the jetties and wharves the tavernas and fish markets the homes of the waterside cambujos and the two or three gigantic warehouses dockside he searched for hellsturm surely it had been he who had barbarously plucked the heart from the young seaman he recalled martynes description of the tudescans they are like beasts but she was wrong for no beast would ever do such a thing for sport beasts hunted to eat killed so that they might continue to live there was a terrible calculatedness in this that went far beyond bestiality it was demonic just the splashing sea and the lowering sky and moichi annainin between striding the creaking timbers of the docks his eyes alight with a ferocity as the anger shook him and along with it he knew he felt a kind of seeping despair for the world would neverchange men and women and yes children too would die as others were being born and new cities would be built upon the rubble of the old and ever ever would there be those who practiced dark secret rites the evil they worshiped seeping from them like coagulating blood he was alone in the dark for now even the fishermen who had earlier been abroad were belowdecks in their lorchas asleep before the coming of dawn the last guardians gone it seemed to him and now corruna was alight with the myriad dreams of its inhabitants and he alone in all the city awake he thought unbidden of kossori of the mans youth when he was utterly alone along the shaanghsei bund and he felt tears welling up behind his eyes now he knew what it was like so desolate not like the real world at all even animals had somewhere to go at length having exhausted his search and perceiving that it was near daylight he turned his mind to more practical matters chiisai she was his only possible link now to hellsturm she would if she could he knew send him a message but to where she knew of three places he might be in corruna the taverna el cambiro where she knew they were to meet rohja the house of the senhora seguillas y oriwara and au eric v lustbader feyas lorcha he rejected the first immediately even if he had met rohja chiisai knew that they would be there for only a very limited amount of time much too risky another kind of risk held true for the house chiisai would have no way of knowing how his interview with the senhora turned out whether he was now considered friend or foe there that was out only the lorcha remained the sailor on watch saluted him as he came up the gangplank has anyone come on board tonight moichi asked him other than members of the crew the man shook his head not on my watch piloto but i have only just come on who had the watch before you armazon piloto he is below now all right i am going to see him if anyone comes anyone at all call me immediately aye piloto moichi went forward easing himself down the companionway below decks he went past the tiny but superbly efficient galley fortard into the crews quarters most of the berths were of course empty as many of the men had chosen to spend the night in the city with their families or girl friends annazon was not in his berth he turned and went aft to the captains quarters this was where aufeya had slept and even on the return voyage moichi had not stayed there preferring to give it to chiisai now he found armazon asleep on the captains wide bed one arm flung across his face moichi woke him oh its you armazon said thought wed all seen the last of you he rolled back onto the bed has anyone come aboard tonight huh no nobody moichi went up the companionway and off the lorcha he had just stepped onto the timbers of the pier when he thought he caught a movement deep in the shadows near a pile of wooden casks they were empty rotting husks now he saw a small face appear and took his hand from the hilt of his sword he moved toward the face but it darted away from him and he was obliged to leap over the barrels he grabbed hold of the small body come here little one he said who is it you seek he saw her clearly now a small girl beneath an opal moon begging your pardon senhor but would you tell me your name before i answer moichi laughed yes of course i am moichi annainin he gazed at her and who might you be he sat and put her on his lap alma senhor i have a message for moichi annainin tell me it then he said on edge she lifted one small hand up to his face please senhor let me see your nose my nose why in then he perceived that she was looking for the diamond set into the dusky flesh of his nostril have you found it then yes senhor the message is from chiisai she told me to come to this lorcha but to speak only to you i have been here for some time i went aboard earlier but the man blocked my way and said he had never heard of you and to go away when i didnt he said you would be away all night but told him to take any message that might come i did not believe him senhor and you did well not to moichi said tousling her hair tell me alma what did this man look like she described armazon chiisai found me near the western gate senhor there a small caravan was about to depart not a trade caravan for we knew nothing about it she said to tell you that she is well and that she travels northwest she follows the caravan yes senhor did you see any of the men in the caravan not well enough to describe them to you was hellsturm among them he wondered i did right to wait senhor yes alma you did its scary here at night is it she nodded yes it is that man from the lorcha came around once or twice looking for me but i hid behind the barrels and he didnt find me moichi hugged her affectionately you are very brave he dug into his sash and gave her a silver piece this will buy much food and clothing alma but if you take it you must promise me youll do something what senhor talc y lustbader buy yourself a warm cloak he stood up putting her on the timbers her arms reached up and he lifted her she kissed him on the mouth a decidedly unchildlike kiss off with you now he said softly see that you go straight home he watched her silently as she ran down the length of the quay as unobtrusive as a shadow and disappeared amidst the streets of the city he went aboard the lorcha again coming silently into the captains cabin he hauled armazn out of the berth what what are you doing the other spluttered no one came aboard asking for me eh why no he said righteously i told you that anyone who says different is a blasted liar his fingers pried desperately at moichis grip but it was like iron its you who lie armazn he jerked the bosun toward him about the senhora now about the cambujo girl he dragged the man off the bed his pants were half off what a twisted mean soul you have you disgust me listen listen armazn cried it was probably robja who has filled your head with all these stories about me they are totally untrue believe me he wishes only to become this ships new bostun hell say anything to get that moichi slapped him across the face and he whimpered shut up you insect robja is dead but while he lived he said not one word against you to me he began to drag the man down the ship to the companionway the little cambujo girl found me on the dock but she lies armazn pleaded i wouldnt give the little beggar food thats all and who could blame me if i gave some to her id have to give to all of them do you think im an idiot to believe such a tale he hauled the bostun topside he found a suitable length of hemp and tied armazns wrists above his head then he slung the man up over his shoulder and began to ascend the mast terrified armazn screamed ill see you pay for this gods what are you going to do to me ill see that the senhora seguillas y oriwara hears about this you do that moichi said grimly as he tied a knot to the crosstree he let armazn go so that he hung there by his wrists back on the deck moichi turned to the man on watch saying beneath an opal moon tell the men whosoever cuts this man down will answer to me the sailor switching his gaze from moichi to the strung bosun swallowed convulsively and said aye piloto i will tell them dawn was just breaking and the gulls had begun their echoing cries as they began skimming the sea in search of food apparently the storm had changed course during the night and brushed by the city there had been no rain moichi went away from the rising pink sun from the coming warmth from armazns cries after a while there was only the sound of the hungry gulls it is descanso he said she is at the iglesia i have come to see her yes i know his eyes were hooded in the shadows of the doorway his long drooping mustache giving him the aspect of a lean and hungry animal she asked me to give you the directions do not have much time she anticipated this also she did or you chimmokus thin eyebrows lifted but his gaze remained impassive i i had nought to do with it do you miss shaanghsei moichi asked abruptly the man stirred uneasily perhaps he said sometimes but the senhora lives here in corruna here too i am did you meet her there in shaanghsei yes along the bond along the bund yes is this important i thought you might be the man here are the directions the bells were tolling from its tall spire shining gold in the newly wakened sunlight bronze turned bright and brittle as they swung in the belfry the sound was somehow melancholy it was a towering structure brilliant white now at the top in shadows lower down near its arched open doorway the last pools of the night to left and right flanking plane trees large ancient whispered in the wind the doors were of oak on their lower half thin strips of hardwoods one light the other dark above so that a kind of eric y lustbade natural toning was achieved without the use of paints or lacquers a wide white stone stairway led up to the doorway daluzans drifted in wrapped in cloaks of muted colors the women who dominated this early in the morning all wore lace shawls about their heads inside it was cool and echoey incense drifted in the still air and there seemed to be a distant drone of muted chanting low backless benches of highly polished wood ran the length of the interior from back to front separated by three aisles where the seats ended in the front there was a flight of low steps leading up to a platform on the right was a carved wooden pulpit and on the left was what looked like a miniature balcony stone figures lined the walls on either side he went down the center aisle and found her near the front he slid in beside her im glad you came she said without fuming her head senhora i have little time but she merely smiled and put a long forefinger against her lips there was movement at the front of the iglesia and the congregation rose a priest appeared behind the pulpit and moichi was astonished to see don hispete the cure with the spade beard on whose conversation he had eavesdropped at dinner the night before don hispete lifted his arms said todos y cads uno sea ustedes bienvenidos a la iglesia del dihos santo the congregation knelt bowing their heads moichi found himself again surprised the cures voice his public voice was totally different from the one he had previously heard this was persuasive and charismatic bien the congregation resumed to their seats this is the day of descanso don hispete said a most important and indeed significant day on our calendar for it recalls to us the sufferings of our forefathers this is a day for sorrow for us to feel deeply the loss of those departed and those far from home and by this day remembering to free our daily lives yet descanso has another purpose for it is this day that we devote ourselves to the acknowledgment of evil so that we may know its many shapes and therefore rise up against it and protect ourselves from its wickedness thus my children we should feel the diabluras great itn opal moon wings flutter in the air about us for without him we could not understand the eternal goodness of dihos thus we reflect on the deeper meaning of the descanso and its difficult revelation of the darker side of ourselves and in that recognition we better define our own goodness afterward she ascended the stairs with moichi and took him behind the pulpit through a plain but quite solid wooden door they went down a short stone corridor at the end of which was another door she knocked and immediately opened it they were in don hispetes rectory it was small and cozy and cluttered in a quite homey way there were several overstuffed chairs a functional wooden desk and highbacked chair and shelves upon shelves of books all the way to the ceiling half of the lefthand wall was a leadedglass window beyond which he could see a leafy garden a small door half open led out to it don hispete had apparently just sat down behind his desk but when ho saw them enter he rose and came around the side to greet them senhora he said smiling almost reverentially and bowing he put his lips against the back of her proffered hand don hispete the senhora murmured we loved your summon she fumed as if startled to find someone standing next to her oh by the way this is moichi annainin a friend of mine bienvenido senhor the priest inclined his head but did not extend his hand the social amenities it seemed were reserved for those he knew well may i offer you a drink he was looking directly at the senhora please he reached out a tall crystal decanter threequarters filled with deep red wine he poured them all drinks and then lifting his own goblet said salhud he drank deeply and they followed suit don hispete put his goblet down on the desk beside him and returned to his highbacked chair he folded his hands across his stomach how may i be of assistance to you senhora has hellsturm resumed to corruna she said abruptly the priest stroked his spadeshaped beard with one forefinger before spreading his hands senhora i cannot but she had already risen had gone across the small room now she stood before the window apparently regarding the foliage of the garden eric v lusbader such beautiful trees she said you know don hispete those olive trees there are old very old indeed grandfathers of their line yes senhora indeed they are its such a pity to destroy them once more the priest spread his hands they reminded moichi of a sea anemone about to ensnare an unwary fish one hates to see the destruction of nature senhora wherever it might be but in this case it serves the purpose of dihos because it will further his glory oh yes her voice was as sweet as honey the glory of dihos must indeed be served for that is the primary function of the palliate but don hispete she turned away from the window to face the cure the palliate cannot function without the support of the congregation is that not so i cannot imagine that the palliate would pay for well everything two thin vertical lines had appeared in the center of the priests brow is that not so she repeated reluctantly don hispete said it is so senhora but i fail to see what and this expansion that the iglesia is contemplating is expensive is it not almost exorbitantly so one might say now really senhora i must and it requires the support the complete support of every parishioner does it not don hispete yes senhora it does but everyone must know he is expected to but those with oh shall we say aboveaverage wealth are being called upon with somewhat more er zeal than are the others don hispete sat as still as a statue now i am one of those so i know firsthand as it were the priest tried to speak had to clear his throat before beginning again the senhora is not contemplating withdrawing her pledge his voice seemed thin and strangled now why i contemplate nothing of the sort her voice was still sweet but it was obvious that she was mocking him wherever did you get that idea how absurd she sat down beside moichi now she continued shall we return to my first query senhora you put me in quite a difficult position his face held a pained expression you know well that i cannot break beneath an opal moon my sacred trust to the palliate a thin line of sweat was rolling slowly down one side of his face i do so love those olive trees don hispete i had not realized until i came here just how much i would miss them if they were cut down and you know now that i think of it there are others who feel just the same way i do now senhora please his voice was a whine now but her eyes had locked onto his and at length his gaze lowered to the hands clasped in his lap he has been in the city he said softly here and gone he left at dawn what was he doing here her voice was as sharp as a whiplash and don hispete winced under its dominance that i do not know senhora this i swear it was not on business of the palliate the priest looked up ashenfaced he made a quick sign across his chest dihos no senhora we ismissed him after that last uh incident incident her voice was filled with loathingand contempt is that what you call it now well you were always quick with the euphemisms don hispete shuddered please senhora his voice had been reduced to a whisper who does he work for now i i am not certain i she stood up and somehow it became one of the most threatening gestures moichi had ever seen i cannot tell you senhora the priest babbled clutching the gold chain about his neck as if he feared she might lose control altogether and strangle him don hispete this interview is temminated it had the finality of a door slam she fumed and on cue moichi stood up wa wait senhora the cure rose still fingering his chain please she fumed back waiting calmly now that her victory was assured he blew air in and out of his mouth in rapid gusts the skin of his face was gleaming i have heard that he works now for la saqueadora sardonyx the senhora cried out as if she had been run through with a blade don hispete came around the desk his face filled with fear senhora what eric y lustbader moichi grabbed her felt her trembling uncontrollably as if gripped by some terrible force get me out of here she gasped at him what is it quickly for the love of dihos she cried quickly he picked her up and took her out down the corridor through the now empty iglesia proper on the wide stone steps dazzling in the sunlight he set her down senhora he said what happened she kept her arms around him for support as she said you were right dihos you were right i understand it all now for gods sake senhora tell me he cried moichi sardonyx is the freebooter who was my partner so long ago tears welled up in her eyes she vowed a terrible vengeance upon me and now it has come hellsturm will not honor his pact with me now that was but part of the deceit dihos he has taken her to sardonyx i am undone she sobbed against his shoulder senhora he said softly senhora he stroked her hair felt her softstrong body quaking against him he only partially understood her grief he knew but a tightening knot in his stomach made him realize his concern for aufeya the danger to her was not only real it was dire it was the northwest for him now upon the fleetest of steeds senhora he said i must go after hellsturm now and you can help me she looked at him tears still rimming her eyes he tried to smile how ridiculous she said to continue to call me that i cannot continue to be so formal with you moichi not now and not ever again he saw the dancing motes in her large jade eyes call me tsuki he felt that all his breath had left him and for a moment he thought he might stumble kossori he thought oh my god kossori she is your love llree the firemask timatdons normally the rain would have worked against him but now he blessed its delayed arrival the storm had stalled off the coast and now had turned around heading inland with much of its initial force dissipated out at sea it did not matter to him that the hoofprints of the caravan were all but obliterated by the dust turned to mud because he knew where they were bound he had tsuki to thank for that as well as for the luma he now rode and the one whose reins were attached to the back of his saddle tsuki the moon it meant where are you now kossori my true friend i hope you approve i think you do the rain slanted down hissing a graygreen blanket limiting visibility soaking everything it obscured his pursuit from prying eyes he was already half a days ride from corrunas western gate heading northwest for kintai his lumas slick coat was a tawny topaz fitted with a black leather saddle silver pommel and red leather harness the somewhat smaller mare was a deep blue in colon he was grateful for these luma for their high intelligence combined with their great speed and endurance made them more desirable than mere horses but he knew they were wild and difficult and expensive to train thus there were few of them about he plunged off the far side of a ridge of brown fertile land into a long softly undulating valley he wiped the rain from his eyes trees were sparse here and for as far as he could see low brush and scrawny brown plants dominated he dug eric v lustbader his heels into his lumas flanks and rattled the reins the stallion leapt ahead lifted his head snorting into the wind how strange life is moichi thought stranger than any tale ever spun at night in a warm tavern or around a leaping fireside how it returns in a circle the end is the beginning if kossori had but known he defended tsukis daughter with his very last breath a death moichi thought should not be useless sad yes that life should come to an end but inevitable too and being so should there not be meaning in the final act in this the iskamen and the bujun were somewhat alike perhaps in other ways also it was a heros death for kossori more heroic now than he would ever know or again perhaps he would know if as the bujun believed the soul is spun out interweaving a long procession of lives until perfection is achieved and one leaves the endless wheel of life and death so for the iskamen god is history his father never tired of telling him and in history lies mans only salvation now at this moment as he pounded across this plain so desolate in the rain flying after evil moichi knew that his faith had survived the blood of his forefathers pulsed through him too strong to be long discarded or ignored tears came to his eyes mingling with the rain as he thought of his father and the mans enormous faith in god perhaps you were not so very wrong after all moichi thought recalling their bitter arguments of faith the long silences suffered by the rest of the family the long days and nights of anger and frustration all the time lost because they were so strongwilled but he knew now that they had not fought over faith no that had been a convenient but spurious battleground both of them had chosen rather spitefully you were so intolerant of me father how you resented my growing up so independent of your will i was so unlike jesah who perhaps because he was the second you were able to mold into your own likeness he did whatever you told him while i resisted why would you not let me be father what was it you were so frightened of it couldnt be as you professed so many times that i would turn away from god because you caused that to happen to me yourself he rattled the reins again sounding the litany of his long journey over the land i will never know now because you took that answer with you when you died like god there was beneath an opal moon not a forgiving moment in your life the end was indeed like the beginning all life is so personal he thought wonderingly there was death in the air he sniffed again and though he was far from his beloved sea he knew it still he believed in auguries not in any superstitious way but in the manner of the iskamen whose turbulent history was filled with such messages from god guiding his people the rain lessened somewhat and as the mistiness lifted he could discern in the fulminating sky low fantastic shapes alight in the darkness of the billowing clouds far to the northwest lightning forked bluewhite and ghostly a moment later came the crack and aftertremor of the thunder rolling against his ears onward the luma fled no cultivated field no house no sign of man at all could he see just the pattering of the rain then as the rain further abated a line of weathered mountains appeared marching like battered veterans along the horizon toward yet another war i have no hope now she said into his chest as he held her it is sardonyx and i am vulnerable vengeance is mine saith the god of my people he said recognising the words of his father you do not understand moichi this is sardonyx we speak of and you must know before you leave she is a sorceress he laughed sorcery is gone from our world tsuki but she shook her head no she can do the impossible then she is but a conjuror a clever one i have met some of those it is all illusion no moichi no please do not make that mistake i know believe me that which she creates is real terribly real beware of her power beware of it it was nearing sundown and the high mountains loomed over him he was in the last stretch of the vast plain trees were more plentiful now and grass grew long and wild so that his luma was obliged to slow their pace wary of rodent burrows hidden from view almost directly before him he saw the slopes of two mountains meeting in a narrow defile which seemed the only way through it was a question of light now it would perhaps be safer to camp here for the night then proceed through the narrow pass at first light but far too much time would be lost eric v lustbader that way and the caravan already had a large head start on him there was no choice really he made full speed toward the defile to the east the sky was still dark and unsettled but above and to the west ahead of him it was clear lavender and plum as if bruised by the storms passage the plunging sun was too low for him to see directly but the world was filled with its reflected illumination the moon was already out a thick crescent and as crimson as a drop of blood the way became immediately rocky and grassland sparser as he neared the foothills guarding the mountain range great boulders of granite and sparkling schist built themselves on all sides soon he was engulfed in the defile itself thick jutting shelves of rock shot up high into the air oblique the evenings light spilling down them like a cataract turning the entire gorge mauve natural rock terraces stretched themselves above his head rising in tiers until they were lost in the haze as the sky darkened into night the rock walls seemed to close in on him the terraces expanding until but the merest sliver of sky remained signs of the caravans passage were more in evidence here at first he believed this to be a result of the more sheltered position in the defile but as he looked closer he discerned that the signs were fresher he was closer to his quarry than he had realized this place seemed devoid of life no avians flew overhead not even the scavengers no lizard no insect he began to experience an acute sense of isolation so strong that it was almost tangible the nature of the rocks had changed also he was obliged to pause and light a brand made of tightly woven hemp treated with pitch by this flickering light he saw that the rocks were now streaked with orange and sulfurous yellow and their configurations had become contorted almost tortured as if they had been formed during some painful upheaval of the earth he reined in and drew his sword around a bend ahead of him he saw the glow of another torch he waited uncertain even of what to expect it was a solitary figure on horseback and now as it approached he saw that it was a woman she was impossibly tall narrowskulled and sunkeneyed she was dressed in a beneath an opal moon simple farmers tunic of duncolored cotton she was unarmed greetings she said her voice floating toward him ghostly in the confines of the defile greetings moichi answered i heard your approach she said i get so few visitors these days i was curious to see i hope you dont mind not at all he said but im afraid that i have lime time for small talk or pleasantries at the moment you are in a hurry yes she nodded its plain to see your mission is urgent is it all right if i ride along with you to the end of the defile then we may talk without my hindering you moichi nodded and spurred his luma forward the woman turned her mount fell in beside him there was just enough room for them both the jiggling of their harnesses echoed eerily off the rock faces whither are you bound she asked i know this land well perhaps i can help direct you to your destination its plain youve never been here before the mist was returning although the rain seemed to have departed i already have directions thank you he said as politely as he could muster he frankly did not like having anyone distracting him in such a perfect place for an ambush if she had heard his approach could not others they might be incorrect you know the woman said thoughtfully that often happens these days people are not so conscientious as they used to be not very fashionable i expect though i know little enough of the world who was it gave you these directions moichi glanced at her briefly what was wrong with her face the inconstant light of the torches made it impossible to see clearly a friend he said noncommittally a friend echoed the woman yes of course it would be well even friends are liable to make a mistake when much time has passed moichi was about to ask her to amplify that statement when she said i fear i have tarried too long already at your side she spurred her mount into an awkward gallop and in but a moment had disappeared into the deepening mist ahead he wanted to call her back for he had been puzzled by their rather onesided conversation but there was nothing he could do to deter her save shout and that he could not risk he rode on keeping to his former pace and presently he it erlc l lusher felt rather than saw the sides of the defile widen raising his torch he could just barely discern that the rock faces had begun to lose a bit of their steepness this effect increased rapidly and he picked up his pace soon he had emerged on this end the defile debauched onto a long valley above the sky was streamered with stars below the land seemed as flat and featureless as newly glowed fields over the rolling grasslands he flew the wind whipping against his face cool and invigorating he revered in the open space around him feeling as if he had newly awakened from some nightmare where he had been trapped in a coffin not long after he spied a pinpoint of light on the near horizon cautiously he made for it the signs of the caravans passage were fresher still than at the last site where the camels dung had been warm as he neared he saw that it was a small cottage set on the near bank of a wide sluggish river which he saw straggled west for a short distance before turning south perhaps half a kilometer past the house he drew in and sat atop his luma for a time looking about and listening to the chirruping of the cicadas and the quiet croaking of the river frogs above him the moon seemed greatly magnified as if seen through a lens it was as red as blood at length he dismounted and led the luma forward he peered into a window saw only an old woman her back toward him abruptly he was famished and striding to the door he opened it and stepped inside the old woman was bent over a circular stone hearth set in the center of the floor on a sort of stone plinth close the door she said without turning around the night air is cold and it disturbs me her voice had the quality of chalk screaking along a slate board she had a thin face he saw as she at last turned around a patchwork of skin it seemed crisscrossed and sealed by the seams of time and the skin seemed glossy as if it were not skin at all she had a wide looselipped mouth upon which red paint had been carelessly smeared and shiny button eyes that were all pupil like a birds are you hungry she said but she was already seeing the table with roughhewn bowls and crude utensils i have a stew all ready now that she mentioned it he did smell the rich aroma of food and his mouth began to water he looked beyond her blineal an opal m saw a black metal pot hanging over the flames of the hearth have you seen a small caravan pass this way he asked come she said sit and eat she was ladling the stew thick and hot into the bowls there was a large loaf of black bread on a wooden board a knife iying beside it he sat downhavent been outside all day she said dont do that so much anymore did you not see the rider then the rider a rider oddlooking very tall surely she came this way i believe you met my daughter shes not here obviously she is hunting at night its the only way here all our game is nocturnal the old woman pointed to his bowl is my cooking so poor he took a bite of the stew it seemed to have no taste he sniffed it smelled delicious do you follow the caravan the old woman said she reminded him of someone its plain to see youre a traveler something caught his eye an nt you hungry of course you are eat up now what was it time seemed to have slowed down he began to hear his own breathing as stentorian as that of a dragons he seemed to have trouble moving also as if the air had turned to jelly go on with you eat eat comer of his eye a million miles away took some time to register firelight dancing pretty pattems hauled himself together mentally slipping slipping away firelight not the firelight below that glinting like the sea on a moonlit night remember the time for gods sake wake up will you whats happening colors running together something important there moonlight chopping the surface of the sea into ten thousand fragmentssss pull yourself together man and concentrate concentrate no circle that was it dont let it slip away now away no stop it the hearth was not round it was pentangle pentanglc you nitwit dont you un derstand he did lunged across the table at the old woman caught her wrist eric v lusbader fast sliding away from him colors streaming all around him like a flight of bubbles feathers fanning the hot humid air sticky and sweaty after working all day in the sun tremendous thirst tongue sticking to the roof of his mouth bloated and so dry that all he could think of was get her he screamed at himself twisted his arm felt her wrist snapping like an old dry twig the old woman reeling backward the house in tremor she stumbles the house shimmers she falls the house dissolves about him dazed moichi sat in the grass hands flat on the earth he felt as if he wanted to vomit unperturbed the night chirruped and croaked on around him as if nothing untoward had hap pened some paces away the luma heads to the earth munched grass contentedly what did they know abruptly he did vomit it was over as quickly as it began he felt weak and he turned over lay back staring up at the infinite river of stars glittering and close by as if he could gather strength from their illumination the moonlight hurt his eyes so he closed them he found that his chest was heaving as if he had run a long distance but hed run longer than that he knew he had run for his life tsukis words had saved him he had met sardonyx and almost been defeated almost what information had she desired from him and what had he given her not much he was certain he opened his eyes he walked back to the luma feeling somewhat bener and swung up beneath the river of starlight he headed northwest after the caravan demoneye when he saw her his heart lightened she crouched in the lee of a great glittering granite boulder perhaps a thousand meters from the encampment just another shadow immediately he saw her he dismounted and leading the luma behind him crept toward her the animals were perfectly silent and would remain so now they knew the enemy was close chiisai whirled her short blade out but he passed into a patch of starlight and she recognised him they embraced joyfully thank the gods you have come at last she whispered her beautiful oval face sobering my horse gave out yesterday and i have been on foot ever since quickly he brought her uptodate im so relieved that martyne was unhurt i was worried about her since i left but as for auteya i think perhaps we are already too late what do you mean he hissed has hellsturm already killed her then why dont you stop him calm yourself she said i understand your concern but the fact is she is not within the caravan not here but how is that possible i cannot say for certain moichi then shes already at mistral with sardonyx mistral a strange castle tsuki informed me on the northwest shore of an even stranger lake known as the deathsea it is inhabited by this sorceress and he told her all he knew of sardonyx i see chiisais brow was furrowed in thought there seem to be plans within plans here eric v lustbader what do you know martyne told me yes the land of the opal moon i could scarcely believe it when i heard she put her back against a rock and after taking a quick glance at the caravans encampment continued there is a legend that i have heard although i do not think it has bujun origins perhaps it had its genesis during the time that amanomori was part of the continent of man you mean during the sorcerous wars yes it is said that there came into being at that time a place where all time ceased to exist where all time coalesced an opening in the fabric of our universe like the incision of a surgeons scalpel perhaps it had been inadvertently created as a byproduct of the continuing pernicious spells being conjured or perhaps through a means totally unknown to our world in any event the eye of time once it was discovered opened up terrifying possibilities if one could slip through for instance all secrets of the future could be had and brought back victory for the first sorcerer through would be assured yet it was not to be so simple a task for this eye of time was inimical to humans and even sorcerous spells proved no protection from the deadly vortex thus the site was abandoned and its location forgotten and thus it passed into the realm of legend are you saying that sardonyx has learned of this eye of times location chiisai nodded but what good would it do her this is the future those sorcerers would have come to they would have found nothing you miss the point moichi if sardonyx manages to gain entry there she can go back to the time of the kaifeng or beyond to a time when sorcery was potent she could bring back all the sorcerous creatures he raised a hand enough i see what you mean but are you saying that the location of the eye of time is here in kintai chiisai nodded the legend tells us that the eye is located in a land where the moon is always full and when you look at it it appears round as a ball not flat as in other lands its color is not the silver of the north nor the gold of the east nor the blue of the west nor the orange of the south no it is of all these colors and more an opal moon almost involuntarily moichi looked skyward but look there chiisai the moon is horned and is as red as a rose yes she whispered so it is but the legend states that beneath an opal moon the one entrance to the land of the opal moon is across a plain lit by ninsowaru the demoneye so here we are yes then if sardonyxs castle is near here she has been in possession of that bit of information for quite some time this is not what cascaras and aufeya possessed no there is unfortunately more she sighed after the end of the sorcerous wars there came into being a story about an artifact it cropped up in a number of disparate places giving that much more credence to its veracity somewhere it was postulated was the artifactkey to the puzzle of the eye of time some even claimed that they had seen it but since each gave a different location and none it seemed proved to be correct its actual existence was discounted by most still others dreamed and hoped keeping its name alive the firemask there was a brief hissing along the narrow ledge of shale he remained motionless staring into the tiny ruby eyes of the scaled lizard its horned ridged crest making it seem like an apparition out of prehistory its forked tongue licked out questing along the rock as it regarded him incuriously a slow pulse beat in the hanging flesh at the juncture of its neck and lower jaw then it had scuttled past him into a crack in the rock face it stared stonily at him he squinted upward streaky clouds faintly luminescent drifted overhead but never came near the bloody moon he ignored the pain in his chest straining his ears listening for the tiniest sound out of place because there was a lot of loose shale down there below him and a totally silent approach he knew was next to impossible it could be a lot worse he reflected hellsturm could be a jhindo and then he would be in for it because the night was the jhindos world but hellsturm was only a koppo adept he laughed inwardly but there was little humor in it he was not after all the daisan and the tudescan had destroyed kossori while he waited crouched high on the narrow ledge alone in the night he had time to think it had begun well enough he and chiisai had both decided that they could not let the caravan reach its destination which they knew now to be mistral hellsturm and presumably now sardonyx already knew half of the vital information auteya possessed the other half lyric v lustbader how explosive that information was pieced together from what martyne had told them about cascaras and what auteya had told moichi about hellsturm this became the only possible conclusion together cascaras and auleya had discovered the location of the fabled firemask whatever hellsturm now brought to mistral would have to be intercepted there was no alternative the caravan encampment was centered in a shallow dell bordered on the left by a dense copse of oak trees and on the right and to the rear by sheltering rock there were four tudescan warriors but hellsturm was shadowed by another man short and squat but as muscular as a bull this man was not tudescan but moichi recognised him as a tulc a member of an obscure tribe of folk to the north they lived on the vast snowcovered steppes and wore the skins of predatory animals such as the wolf and the bear their headmen wore the skulls of these animals covering the top halves of their faces moichi had come across a tulc aboard the second ship he had signed on with what the man was doing so far from home moichi never learned but it had not even occurred to ask him for moichi too was far from his native land and had no desire to talk about his own reasons for leaving but he had learned other things from the man the tulc were a fierce people and in many ways only semicivilized what one was doing with hellsturm was impossible to ascertain in all there were six a fair matchup chiisai had whispered grinning but he had not shared her optimism the tudescans were up and battleready in an instant even though he and chusai had come upon them as silently as they were able they had another advantage however for the tudescans seemed contemptuous of a woman warrior until that is chiisai dispatched the first man they sent against her with one swipe of her daikatana she ducked under the attack of the tudescan and skewered him from front to back just below the breastbone cursing hellsturm immediately sent two men against her for her part chiisai was as calm as the water in a lake as she faced this dual charge she stood her ground unmoving hands placed one above the other on the long hilt of her weapon holding it vertically so that the tip touched the earth the tudescans split coming at her from either side so beneath an opai moon massive were both the warriors they appeared to be giants rumbling toward her the one on her right drew fractionally first beginnimg an oblique strike left to right the strike came and twohanded chiisai brought the daikatana up to block precisely as if she were holding a wooden staff that had neither cutting edge nor swordpoint in the same motion she continued the sweep horizontally and down so that as the point dropped below the second warriors incoming blow it lanced inward with a blur slicing the tudescan open from his right side through to his spine his weapon flew from his hands as he went down now she ducked under the first warriors cut and leaning forward tried a reverse blow this he parried and in counterattacking used such force that she was almost struck from her fighting position she recovered in time to deflect a strike aimed at her neck but the flat of the heavy sword smashed into her shoulder she winced and twisted her blade upward so that the point pierced the warrior just above his adams apple slashing into the brain moichi was now fully engaged in combat with the remaining tudescan warrior the man struck twice and on the third blow succeeded in separating moichi from his sword moichi cursed himself silently for not having been a better student but he had never been sufficiently interested in swordsmanship pity he had not known about this moment then the tudescans face split in a feral grin as he moved m for the kill that expression stayed permanently in place he had not even seen the motion of moichis left hand foolishly the grin still in place he stared down at the thick copper handle protruding from his chest he coughed once and pitched backward there was only hellsturm now and the tulc that one moved toward chiisai as moichi turned to confront hellsturm the hood of his cape had been pushed back and for the first time moichi saw his face he was stunningly handsome this came not so much from the individual features of his face his nose was too straight his mouth just a touch too wide the lips thick and sensual but from an intermix which made of the whole something unusual there was about him the distinct air of an animal dangerous cunning and amoral all part of the undeniable masculine magnetism which had drawn both tsuki and aufeya his deepset eyes were black and this too seemed to be the eric v lustbader only color he wore his leather helm was ebon as were his chainmetal corselet leggings and high boots the only touches of color were at the front of his helm and on the buckle of his wide weapons belt here had been painted a small bloodred cross surrounded by a circle of the same hue moichi picked up his dirk wiping the blade clean on the dead mans cloak then retrieved his sword during this time his eyes never left the figure in front of him he put away the dirk held his sword point slightly higher than hilt in front of him hellsturm smiled at him and came forward his white teeth gleaming in the moonlight sharp and moist and pinktinged he did not touch the sword that swung slightly scabbarded at his side you know what i am it sounded like the sibilant whisper of a summers breeze and the dissimilarity between visual and aural was so enormous that he was shocked hellsturm might have been talking to his lover moichi winced inside when he thought of tsuki and aufeya he had a chance if he could get hellsturm to draw his sword if he couldnt he lunged forward in a feint but the other danced nimbly away and shook his head his tongue clicking against the roof of his mouth so that now he sounded like an old lady oh no he said no no no and raised his hands like blades moichi sheathed the useless weapon maneuvered so that his side was presented giving a narrower target but hellsturm was too swift and he came on and it was all moichi could do to deflect with his wrists the three four five handstrikes in rapid succession he backed off but hellsturm followed he blocked an eyestrike but only partially deflected the next pain like a hot lance shot through his chest and he did the only thing he could do to stave off death he ran he had the face of a weasel chiisai thought set into a head that seemed far too big for the torso even though that was itself quite massive he looked like a freak he had tiny eyes and almost no nose but the large gaping nostrils gave him the animallike countenance his ears too were small but the beneath an opal moon lobes were distended possibly by the stones set into them he was dressed in wolf pelts and he stank she allowed the tulc the first strike its tremendous force shook her down to her ankles and had her blade been forged anywhere other than amanomori it would certainly have been shattered he allowed her not a moments letup but swung at her over and over without discernible rhythm so that she found it increasingly difficult to defend herself each time he appeared to fall into some pattern of attack he would shift out of it and she would find herself slightly offbalance and thus vulnerable her arms began to ache the pain becoming fierce in no time at all until it became a chore to lift her own sword over her head the tulc came on a feral grin lighting his face she had seen that kind of look before knew what this man would do to her before he killed her in that instant of inwardlooking she missed it the movement had to have been minute but ordinarily she would have picked it up too late the blur shot toward her and she felt as if her right shoulder had been dipped in flame she cried out as the force reeled her backward she stumbled and the daikatana flew from her grasp she landed hard clutching her shoulder where the spike was embedded it had come from the hilt of the tulcs sword some hidden spring releasing it now he stood over her staring stonily down and threw his blade from him he withdrew something from beneath his furs and when chiisai saw it gleaming in the moonlight she knew that she was finished the lizard had gone but a small sound had taken its place and he tensed knowing that hellsturm was on his way still he had no clear plan he had known only that he had to get away from the machine of death find some sort of cover now he wracked his brain trying to recall everything kossori had ever told him or showed him about koppo he did not give way to despair though he knew that this man who now pursued him had killed kossori and he had thought his friend all but invincible the sound came again no more than the scrape of leather against rock but now he could see the beginnings of an outline already closer than he had imagined not much time left eric v eustbader he resisted the impulse to move right now he was fairly certain that hellsturm had not spotted him despite the fact that he was moving in the right direction no sense in giving the tudescan any more of an advantage than he already had the trouble was his own mind was a blank he still had no idea what he lost the silhouette one moment it was there the next gone where was hellsturm he thought desperately there was total silence now but a kind of deafening noise pounded against his eardrums and he realized he was listening to the sound of his own pulse he scanned the darkness before him felt it rather than heard it and was in the process of turning to meet it when the blow hit him glancing off his forehead and then he was rolling halfdazed knowing that if he had been motionless when the blow caught him it would have split his head open like a ripe melon he struggled to his knees but hellsturm kicked him hard in the side and he went down hellsturm was on him not giving him time to recover and he was having to block a series of vicious swordstrikes to his sternum without benefit of a clear head or proper leverage sweat was in his eyes and he shook his head back and forth very quickly to clear his vision but this only intensified the pain sharp points digging into his back and dust rising clogging his nostrils and he was almost pinned now and that would be it because he knew that once he became immobile for even the briefest time he was dead meat they were at the verge of the shale ledge and as another swordstrike blurred toward his face he felt them going over tumbling weightless for just an instant as they were hung suspended in midair then abruptly gravity took hold once more and the earth rushed up toward them with terrifying swiftness he willed his body to relax but hellsturm was still on top of him and moichi hit with his right shoulder first the full weight of both bodies combined with the momentum he felt as if he were caught in a vise he cried out feeling something inside tear and then heard a popping that was surprisingly without pain and he knew that his right arm was dislocated knew too that there was no hope now none at all beneath an opal moon she had seen this weapon before it had a long wooden heft ending in a sickleshaped metal blade from the end of the heft swung a long link chain with a studded metal ball the sight of it terrified her with good reason chiisai was a shujin that is a grand master in martial arts only shujin were allowed to wear the daikatana and she was one of only a few women in bujun history to be so skilled yet chiisai had known defeat in amanomori once her opponent had wielded this weapon she was paralyzed with fear she had never beaten this weapon and would not do so now the chain whirled in the air circling and as it lashed out with blinding speed the tulc grinned she screamed as the chain whipped about her neck driven by the force of this throw and the weight of the ball the sound was not unlike the snapping of a hungry wolf her breath cut off and she began to strangle her continued screams but a soft susurrant rattle deep in her groat as in a nightmare when one opens ones mouth to call out and no sound is heard panic welled up inside her clutching at her stomach she gagged watching the grinning gaptoothed face looming sweatily over her as his thick filthy hands drew tighter by small degrees the chain around her throat he threw the weapon casually into the air caught it by its heft chopped downward in a tight arc the sickle blade carving a swath closer and closer to her heaving breasts she struggled feebly with her legs and he hauled back on the chain as if she were a fish on a line her lungs felt as if at any moment they would burst a pearly blackness invaded her mistily seeping into the edges of consciousness and she knew that death was near she was hypnotized into immobility staring up at him impaled certain that this was indeed happening but to someone else not her not her then she saw him do a curious thing keeping one hand wrapped around the chain he let go of the heft with the other hand dropped it to his belt of polished teeth carefully not taking his eyes off her he unwound it then the blade came down sliding through the leather ties holding her breastplate together he used the blade again to turn it over away from her now she had only a thin layer of clothing and he stared mouth half open at what lay beneath the silk he unbuttoned his pants and they slid down the hairy trunks of his legs eric ilustbade her gaze slid down to the juncture and the outrage of what he was going to do somehow galvanised her out of her immobility she no longer thought about her one defeat or this strange weapon which had caused it it was life now and life only she went back to basics for all she had left was the jai a movement she had had to learn before the cut the parry or the strike she heard again her instructor hanid saying to her if you cannot get your sword out in time there will be no need of any of the rest do you understand she hadnt really then but she had learned it anyway learned it well for hanjd was the finest iaijutsu master of all the bujun now she understood and blessed him thus it seemed to the tulc that there was no movement at all one moment she was exposed at his mercy and he straddled her rampant the next he felt a sharp spearing pain lancing through his groin and lower abdomen his eyes bulged and spittle drooled from one corner of his hanging mouth he dropped the weapon all sensation was gone from his legs and they would not support him he tumbled to his knees straddling her outstretched legs his trembling hands claspedhis oozing vitals holding them inside his rent flesh in front of him awesomely close was the juncture of her thighs and he stared longingly there as a chill swept through him colder than any he had ever experienced before and he thought of the huge snowwolves of his frostrimed steppes and the intense joy of the hunt as an orgasm the hot red blood spilling upon the virginwhite earth so stark and in its way holy and now with every pump of his laboring heart his own blood was pouring through his impotent fingers into the dust before him the last thing he saw was another part of him lying on the ground near him he reached for it as if with it he could hold on to the life that was fast slipping away from him he toppled over dead before he hit the earth chlisai was clawing desperately at the chain strangling her the weapon itself was caught beneath the tules heavy corpse and she had to roll him over in order to extricate it and thus ease the pressure her nails were gone and her fingers bloody as she at last freed herself from the chain tears welled in her eyes as her lungs heaved involuntarily vertigo set in and she knew she dared not get up she lay on the wet earth gasping feeling that she would never get enough oxygen felt the pins and needles the numbness beginning bene th an opal moon along her nose and cheeks and lips knew that the carbon dioxide was building too rapidly and deliberately slowed her breathing slow and deep deep and slow for what seemed to her an endless time she was content to just breathe such a simple ordinary function staring sightlessly up at the slow wheel of the sparkling icy stars and the bloodred moon crying crying but knowing now that it would be all right it came in on his blind side and he lost all hearing there he was moving away but it was not enough and the kappa blow caught him just above the right ear my god he thought this is no man but a monster he reeled drunkenly away bouncing off a boulder but hellsturm followed relentlessly once he felt the granite at his back he knew what he must do and gritting his teeth against the pain and the shock he slammed his right arm against the curved rock face at what he estimated to be the proper angle light flashed behind his eyes and he groaned his stomach heaving felt the pop though as the bone returned to its socket pain flared as shock dissipated its effect on the nerves thunder following on the heels of lightning sweat broke out all over his body and he shivered taking a deep breath he wiped his eyes with his good arm as he lurched away from the rock felt hellsturm close behind him and he ran into the night climbing as if this alone could save him god is my savior he found himself thinking he watches over me always it was what his father used to say to him as a child just before he went to bed he found too that he no longer found it a saying to scoff at it had its own meaning for him now it was a kind of inner strength that stopped him from giving in to despair sounds close behind him told him that hellsturm was gaining the blocks the constant movement would be useless now as he felt the energy draining from him with each step he took but he knew now it had been useless from the beginning nothing more than a holding action that had only prolonged the inevitable what had made him think that he would be any match for this devil he had fought beside the worlds greatest hero but what made him think that he was one himself still he sped upward his soul unable to admit defeat even as he was haunted by its specter he ascended toward the stars erlc v lustbader and the bloody demoneye which hung over him like the gloating greedy face of sardonyx the ledge upon which he ran described a sharp turn to the left and he followed it up the stone crumbling under his boot soles using his hands along the inner face to guide him help propel him along running stumbling catching himself breathless running once more his lungs were straining and his throat felt as if it were covered with dust excessive sweat pouring from his body by the exertion only further depleted his fast fading strength water he needed water suddenly this seemed an even more powerful imperative than outrunning hellsturm abruptly he quit the ledge swinging up onto the true face of the rocky hillside tore two fingernails in the process but now he was heading inward still climbing away from the plain below scrambling over rocks and scrub brush hunting buying time the only thing left that was of any use to him he crested the hill panting willing his breathing to slow moving downward now on the far side and he found himself amidst lush foliage he felt the first faint surge of distant hope because he could scent it now water his toe struck a projection a rock or a root he could not tell which and he tumbled down the last bit of the incline and then was on his knees on the narrow bank scooping the cold water of the stream into his mouth in great gulps until he remembered and stopped though his body cried out for more and his mouth was still dry he took a last mouthful but instead of swallowing let it stay in his mouth then he ducked his head and splashed his head and shoulders it soothed the ache somewhat he spat out the last of the water knowing that if he took too much he would vomit it all up at the first hard sprint he picked himself up and carefully forded the stream which was wide but quite shallow the gurgling water not even cresting his boot tops but the stones at its bottom were sharpangled and slippery and he did not want to risk a fall he gained the far bank without incident and moved into a thick copse of pine he climbed a ridge turned and followed it until he found a spot that suited his needs here he had an excellent view of the stream without himself being exposed he crouched and waited and with each moment he grew stronger yet he knew full well that mere physical strength would not be enough beneath an opal moon he put his back against the bole of a tree smelling the heady scent of the bed of brown pine needles carpeting the rich earth all about him hearing the sad call of whippoorwill high up in the branches overhead he looked upward saw a brownandwhite speckled owl close by but there was something strange about it he looked again its eyes were closed the owl was nocturnal so it should be wideawake at this time why wasnt it then he had the answer and with it came the knowledge of victory he had a chance now he knew one chance in ten thousand but it was better than no chance at all but he had to have time to think it through it was the moon even though it was not full it was yet magnified in this strange land and its bloody illumination was of such a burning brightness that it had caused the owl to shut its eyes moonlight on the water of the rushing stream like a key jarring open a lock in his mind a memory had surfaced one of the reasons kossori had once told him that koppo takes so long to master is that it is more than haymental one must learn to attain a spirit as calm as moonlight that is an attitude of dispassion being at once aware of the landscape in general as well as of the specifics of detail while this attitude is maintained the koppo adept may be considered invincible but should some element be inserted which is distracting which interferes with this attitude then as a cloud passing before the face of the moon turns all the world dark and shadowy he can be undone demoneye exploded into a thousand shards as hellsturm plunged into the stream and gained the far bank he paused there his senses questing for his prey without moving the rest of his body moichi felt around on the pine carpet with his hands until he found what he wanted he hefted it in his left hand judging its weight then tucked it into his belt around the back so that it was out of sight but in so doing his elbow had passed through a small patch of moonlight and like a hound to the scent hellsturms handsome head swiveled around orienting on him the tudescan launched himself up the incline more swiftly than moichi had thought possible his long lean legs pumped in seeming defiance of gravity the lethal hands were raised and moichi moved back he eric v eustbader stumbled and was obliged to block a blow as he was falling backward the mans strength was appalling even at this stage and moichi almost felt his nerve break as he was borne under the demonic assault they were getting through now and there was no more time in a moment he would be beaten into a pulp he gritted his teeth as he used his right arm the one that had been dislocated to block the blows raining down on him the pain was like a living thing eating at his flesh but it could not be helped because he needed his left hand it darted behind him the fingers closing around the cool hard surface pulled it out now head on fire from an only partially deflected tigerstrike now now now tsuki he called over here quickly it was a desperate thing a ploy once used so often that now no one used it hellsturrns head jerked eyes opened a fraction his hands hesitated an instant a cloud passing before the face of the moon out of the shadows and the darkness moichi swung upward with all his might trappinghellsturms right hand between the trunk of the pine and the sawedged rock in his fist there came a sharp cracking sound as if a tree had been felled the skin shredded and moichi bore down grinding the rock into the bone blood spurted as the knuckles splintered one by one hellsturms head snapped back and his sensual lips drew away from his teeth the whites shone all around his eyes and moichi could smell the stench of his sweat but hellsturm still had his left hand and he used it now driving the rock from moichis grasp oblivious to the pain using it as if it were a mace to bludgeon his opponent moichi drove upward with the toe of one boot caught hellsturm in the stomach but his chain mail absorbed most of the impact and he bore down he had hold of moichis right shoulder now and he dug his fingers into the already wounded socket pain was a blanket that completely covered moichi his eyes teared and he cried out his arm hanging numb and useless with the agony but now his left hand was scrabbling at his belt and he grasped the hilt of one of his dirks he tried to withdraw it beneath an opal moon but in the battle it had somehow gotten fouled in the fabric of his shirt hellsturm his handsome face twisted into a mask of hate and bloodlust continued to dig into the flesh of his shoulder pulling at his arm in another moment the bone would be pulled from its socket again and the pain would be overwhelm ing if he passed out now he had it the dirk came free and without further thought he slashed upward not really aiming because there was no time he felt the bone slipping grinding against the socket and he yelled the blade of the dirk shot through the night the edge opening hellsturms face from the right eye across the bridge of the nose through to the left eye hellsturm let out a howl like an animal and his body jerked upward on his feet he stumbled backward his ruined hand to his ruined face he tripped and almost righted himself but the incline was too steep and there was too much blood on him he was blind and blood filled his ears and mouth and he had no balance he crashed backward obliquely and his spine cracked against the trunk of a pine his momentum was such that he spun off drunkenly careening down the embankment spinning until he hurtled into the rushing stream entangled in the rocks the bloody illumination of demoneye dappling the body as if it were no harsh intruder upon the harmonious landscape the anvil beyond the ending on the plain was the forest and beyond that the bright shore of the deathsea it was midday before they breached the far verge of the forest it seemed a dismal place heavily overgrown with dense tangled foliage ropy vines and thorned creepers the earth in between littered with great malevolentlooking mushrooms as lividly white as snow but there seemed little in the way of fauna what birds inhabitated its upper reaches were strictly nocturnal disappearing before the sun heaved its bulk above the torn horizon they were both relieved to quit its dark and intense interior but what they saw now surprised them for the deathsea was a deep and waterless scar upon the face of the land a rotting skeleton divested of all skin and flesh the deathsea was dust and swirling ash glittering unrelievedly in the sunlight undulating sharply its sloping sides turning into a baking oven they paused at the edge of it staring directly across its length and there upon the far shore just visible were the shadowy towers and fenestrations of mistral the home of sardonyx they decided almost immediately to take the shortest route through the deathsea the thing was perhaps twice again as wide as it was long and they estimated it would take them the better part of four days to skirt it the temperature climbed alarmingly as they descended and once moichi considered turning back but he could not bring himself to voice his thoughts his mind ever strayed to aufeya and what she might be suffering at the hands of sardonyx and his resolve deepened beneath an opal moon all about them was dust and decay not the kind of oozing rot one might find in the depths of some leafy jungle or in a fetid swamp but rather a peculiar kind of desiccation that bordered on fossilisation as if all moisture had been sucked from the sea the deeper they descended the fiercer the heat became a dry baking heat which mounted until they felt as if they were roasting on a spit yet the absolute lack of humidity made it bearable and kept them going the sun was white and hung swollen seemingly motionless above them moichi who had much experience with terrible heat in the doldrums of the southern latitudes wrapped an extra shirt over the top of his head and around his forehead bidding chiisai do the same he did not want either of them passing out with sunstroke they spoke infrequently and then only in monosyllables much of this had to do with the heat the expenditure of energy was debilitating yet there were other reasons also just past noon they ate desultorily without appetite chiisai would have foregone the meager meal entirely if he had not insisted that she eat something the sunlight sapped the bodys energy all too quickly the floor of the deathsea levered off now but they seemed still to be in the shallows presently as if dropping from a shelf they found themselves descending on a steep incline to the true bed of the deathsea they paused once in the afternoon to water the luma which like camels tended to store up much of their needed liquids chiisai took two sips of the tepid fluid but moichi declined limiting strenuous exercise he knew how to conserve his bodys own water and keep drinking to a minimum this might be crucial later on if they ran into any unforeseen difficulties that required water in the depths they passed a skeletal carcass rearing up higher than a house the rigid dry bones casting thin escarpments of shadow bars of dark and light rippling across the seabed the immense skull which lay half buried in the dust was long and narrow almost all jutting jaw it had double rows of teeth and minimal cranial cavity further on they came across the desiccated carcass of another kind of creature this one seemed to have had wings the bones spread out on either side of the carcass delicate and perfectly round and he saw where there was a break hollow eric v iustbader the lack of water vapor of course made the deathsea perfect for the preservation of onceliving things he would have liked to explore more of these fossils for they were of a sort he had never seen before but he had no time nor any way to search them out at longdistance the brilliance of the place combined with the distortions caused by the intense heat made it impossible to see anything before they were almost upon it even husks as large as these longdead creatures the sky above them was cloudless white where the sun hung fading to a pale blue but now he saw before them a kind of haze hanging between them and the far shore he shook his head and shaded his eyes fearful that the heat was playing visual tricks he nudged chiisai and she followed his pointing finger nodded what they saw was a cloud so low down that it seemed to brush the floor of the deathsea its top did not rise higher than the shoreline it seemed to be moving fuzzy and continually in motion and definitely headed toward them then it was upon them and they were abruptly engulfed in a swarm of giant flying insects there was a droning buzz in their ears but the creatures themselves moved too fast to get a good look at they were merely blurs whizzing and darting yet not once did any creatures come close enough to touch either one of them and they seemed harmless enough they urged their luma onward and were soon past the horde they glanced back watched the insect cloud make its slow steady way across the deathsea moichi wondered what they fed off since there was nothing to eat in this desolate place dusk came early for them since as soon as the sun dropped below the seas high bank to the west their evening began even while the rest of the world was still bathed in sunlight it was a blessing for the temperature began to drop almost as soon as the shadows began to creep over the bed of the sea apparently whatever the ground was composed of did not retain the days accumulated heat for long soon they were engulfed in shadow they stopped early and made camp exhausted not only from the days journey but from their toils of the night before all the day moichi had kept his damaged right arm close to his side forearm resting across his thigh the heat felt good on it they settled into a space with the gigantic ribs of some beneath an opal moon creature arching over their heads like a cathedral shell its skull was wide and thick a long straight horn protruding from its forehead there was unfortunately nothing with which to make a fire and as the temperature plummeted they regretted this deeply it seemed inconceivable that just a short time ago this dust and air had been shimmering with heat the luma stood close together snorting their blown breath making tiny clouds of mist and moichi and chiisai took their cue from their steeds huddling together for the warmth their own bodies provided there was time for talk after they ate but both seemed reluctant to do so moichi had seen what she had done to the tulc but he still had no idea what had been done to her he knew chiisai well enough to understand that she was a naturally gregarious person and this silence was disturbing yet still he held back from speech he felt instinctively the importance of her initiating this talk that she had something on her mind he took as a given how is your shoulder her voice was soft and muted although there was no wind to speak of down here at the bottom of the sea is the pain bad not so much now the heat helped a great deal you should put it in a sling considering where we are bound thats not a very good idea its going to be of little use to you in any event tomorrow ill see if i can get it over my head youre mad yes perhaps she laughed but it seemed to choke in her throat and she was crying against his shoulder silent tears rolling down her highboned cheeks its all over now chiisai he said the words sounding foolish to his own ears what is terror she whispered but the face of ones own fears this is a saying among the bujun one which i had heard many times yet never really understood until last night i stared death in the face moichi and i was not afraid but the talc she hesitated and he knew that this was what had been eating at her the source of her brooding silence bars of red and black striped them moonlight and shadow caused by the giant curved rib cage within which they huddled his luma stamped once and was still the tulc would have taken erlc v lustbader me dead or alive i dont think he cared perhaps even he wished to see me die while he was still she stopped unable to go on for long moments yet otherwise she seemed in control her body was calm her arms clutched him more strongly and he knew that she had not yet come to the difficult part for her i have never been with a man and when i saw him standing over me standing there and i could not allow that to happen i i was afraid and i am ashamed the last was said in a rush as if once having made up her mind to tell him she was making certain she would not back off at the last instant i lost my nerve no he said they were so close that his deeper voice had a kind of sonic overtone it saved your life nothing to be ashamed of in that im not fit to be a warrior let alone a shujin listen to me chiisai he said cupping her chin so that she looked directly into his eyes one thing i learned very early in life is that good healthy fear is at times the only thing that keeps you alive just think youre here now to be listening to me if you hadnt been afraid he shrugged still she was silent perhaps time was all she needed then again perhaps not he shrugged mentally his own battle had been quite an ordeal through it some ghosts had been ex orcised but he knew others still remained that night he dreamed of coming home not in bright searing flashes or odd disconnected scenes not to put a fine point on it in the timeless imageladen language of dreams but rather as if he were awake recalling the incidents of his past the wind had told him at least that was how he would always recall it he awoke come cormorant and went up on deck it was the biythee his first ship the sea was as calm as a sheet of slate and the sun was a glow as it hung incipient just below the eastern horizon where its pale light had already pushed back the night but everything was not the same as when he had gone to bed the difference was the wind sometime during the short southern night it had changed backing up until now it was coming out of the south he took a deep breath and scented it there hanging like a pall he crossed to the starboard taffrail his eyes scanning the beneath an opal moon horizon but there was nothing to see save sea and sky sky and sea still it was there he turned and called out the change in course to the helmsman then cupping his hand beside his mouth he cried into the rigging and within moments all canvas had been broken out moments later the first mate came on deck and moichi informed him of the change he had been away it seemed to him for a very long time but perhaps this was merely subjective certainly alaraat seemed unchanged the iskamen port city from whence he had first set sail so long ago teemed with life yet as he maneuvered the biyhee in toward the wharves he could detect here and there a new edifice or some reclaimed ground he remembered as wilderness now transformed into a square or a tiled plaza but this was natural for all healthy cultures must expand over time the tall shady palms were still there however lining the shore on the near side of the first buildings his father had been the last person he had seen when he left as a boy turning his face up for the brusque farewell kiss that moichi thought was more tradition than emotion and now it was his father who brought him home again for that was the message the wind had brought him that his father was dying and so it was the main hall of his familys house was ablaze with the myriad white candles of death it was just past midmorning and there seemed little activity no one paid him any heed until his brother jesah opened the cedar door to what he knew was his fathers room and stepped into the hallway they stood staring at each other while servants hurried by them these two brothers who were so dissimilar both physically and psychologically where moichi normally seemed massive he was dwarfed in the presence of his younger brother who was a veritable giant of a man and of course jesah followed their father in all things he had always been contemptuous of his older brothers interests considering them unworthy of one who might have been nay should have been shouldering responsibility as future leader of the family jesah cleared his throat well he said youve come home moichi you picked a perfect time to show up i came because hes dying jesah ah yes he clasped his hands in front of him a gesture which he affected believing it gave him a rather solemn li eric v iustbader surgical air moichi rather thought it made him look like a prissy school instructor from what faroff land did you come i was on the high seas seventeen days out from bylantetan a long way away im surprised you made it hes my father yes i know that just what does that mean youve been away a long time but i see you havent changed i did the only thing i could it was you or me you could never defend yourself decently that boy was killed one of us had to take the blame and leave iskael you wanted to leave the resentment in jesahs voice was tangible you dreamed of shedding your responsibility to father and to me and the girls the family never mattered to you let jesah take care of that you thought it is what he loves anyway moichi stared at him it was the first time he had gotten an inkling that perhaps jesah did not relish his position jesah i he began his brother cut him off father has been calling for you he said curtly i would see him all right as if he were giving permission to an outsider he stepped aside to allow moichi entrance he had been in his fathers room many times as he was growing up when he was a child it had been his parents room until his mother had died of a disease no physician could diagnose quite naturally his father felt that it was a sign from god and there followed a year of prayer and stringent discipline as if the entire family had been guilty of some sin for which each member now had to atone it was a place unlike any other in the house the stoneandbrick kitchen for instance was light and airy with many windows overlooking the rolling grassland the sitting room was dark and cavernous dominated by the immense flagstone fireplace whose hearth seemed like the mouth of god when he was small the great flat stones rising through the roof and reaching he had once believed to the very heart of heaven his father may or may not have instilled this grotesque and absurd image but surely he did nothing to dispel the notion the bedroom he shared with lesah he always beneath an opal moon found cozy and comforting the girls rooms were in the opposite wing and he had never seen those but his fathers room was enormous easily the largest in the house bigger even than the sitting room or the kitchen which included the long cedar dining table around which the entire family sat without fail three times a day and of all the rooms in the house it alone had a sloping roof this owing to the fact that it was part of the original dwelling which over time and the furtherance of a large family his father had found it necessary to add to considerably it felt old too not the oldness associated with must and death and well aging but rather a peculiar kind of stolid antiquity which moichi found secretly delightful like a warm down comforter thrown over the shoulders on a chill winters night when he was quite small he used to love to creep clandestinely into the room and just sit not moving not touching anything not even looking anywhere in particular just sitting in his fathers great scarred wooden chair by the desk which might have contained all the secrets of the ages and letting the aura of the room seep slowly into him and he found as he grew older and thus more subject to the daily aggravations of life that this rooms silent breathing atmosphere had the power to calm him as if it were somehow alive now there was a different feeling about the room as he stepped over the threshold and pushed the door to behind him he felt again the ancient quietude hovering but held at bay perhaps by the new sadness here he crossed the bare polished floor and stood beside the high brass bed he seemed suddenly very tall the slanting roof almost brushing the top of his head so that he unconsciously stooped a little the figure in the bed seemed frail indeed and he realized with a start that he had been thinking of him for quite a while as he had been when he moichi was young he had deliberately disregarded the encroachment of time and like a child still refused to believe in age advancing at all not for him not for his father he could never bring himself to think of his father as an old man not even now ravaged as he was by time and disease the man had always been far too vital that he was immobile now on the bed attested to the gravity of his condition like a horse his fiercely defiant will would not allow him to go down save under dire circumstances and perhaps for him death was the only one eric v lus ader now moichi leaned over the bed listening to the unquiet susurrus of his fathers labored breathing sounding as if there was fluid in his lungs and he was unaccountably reminded of the nights he would lie awake as a child watching the painfully slow progress of the moon in its arc as it rode like a schooner the vast sea of stars or listening to lesahs gentle shallow breathing from the bunk below as he dreamed of the unknown sea lapping at the shores of alaraat far away his fathers eyes were closed but the veined lids seemed as thin and translucent as tissue there were blue circles around his eyes as if the flesh was somehow being eaten away from within so that now the lethargically pumping blood was closer to the surface bubbling threatening to break through to breach at last the portals of mortality which had kept it safely in check for a lifetime a lifetime as he stood silently over his father he thought here is someone i dont know this person with the old and tired face might as well be a stranger his father died at sunset peacefully without saying a word or opening his eyes the shallow breathing ceasing it seemed to moichi just as the distant sun slid behind the high peaks far to the west their tops so high it was said that even the rock had capitulated and turned to solid ice darkness came for them both the shadows stealing through the window and into the room as if sent as a messenger and he realized that the transition had been so swift or again so subtle that he had missed the actual moment of his fathers passing he turned and went out of the room lesah and his three sisters and their husbands two of them were married filed past him into the room and he left them to it no one said a word to him he went through the long wide hallway and into the kitchen still smouldering since it faced south and west with the last of the reflected light of dusk and though the sun was gone from the sky still gloriously illuminated he opened the back door and went out hearing at once the cicadas shrill singing and the infrequent throaty calls of the grey geese he became aware of a brownandwhite jackrabbit sitting up on its powerful hind legs half within the tangled shadow of a thorn bush staring at him for a long while they were both immobile then the rabbits nose twitched as if it beneath an opal moon were a character out of a childrens storybook his mother used to read to him and he saw the long rodents teeth underneath in a flash the creature was away bounding into the tall grass he heard a sound behind him knew someone had slipped through the door he did not turn around and for a moment was strangely angry that anyone would have the temerity to see what he saw hear what he heard to intrude upon his private world someone took his arm slim strong fingers wrapping themselves around his right elbow it was sanda the youngest of his sisters he watched the sweep of her long dark hair as the wind took it and her enormous black eyes set wide apart and deep within her face she was strikingly beautiful fineboned yet strong of countenance with a start he realised that she looked more like him man any other member of the family its so good to have you home again she said her voice rich and musical youll not go go away again will you her head rested against the crook of his arm she was as short as their father had been she required no answer but said remember when you used to put me on your shoulder and take me riding yes i remember and father would be so cross with you you were much younger then but she had already turned her face into his chest her body wracked with sobs he put his arm around her filled with a great sadness not for his father that dead stranger iying in his parents room inside the house but for sanda this young woman for all the time away from his land and for a little girl whom he loved and whom he had missed terribly you know i always loved you for that she said her words a vibration against his massive body i was so proud that you thought enough of me to stand up to him and to lesah she held him tightly you were the only one who treated me as an individual not as someone who was always the last in line who got the clothes when everyone was finished with them who was always belittled because everyone else already knew the things she was trying to find out she wiped at her eyes do you know you never teased me thats what i loved about you most moichi laughed softly i could never deny you anything remember the time i took you with me into alaraat without i lrlcvi lustbader anyone knowing and you saw that bit of jewelry in a shop window as we passed you wanted it so desperately and i laughed at you and told you you could have it when you became a woman i remember she said her eyes as soft as mist when i started to cry you went back and bought it for me i couldnt bear to hurt you you know how children are they want everything they see and then a day later its iying somewhere forgotten but i knew id hurt you and i couldnt bear that i remember you wore it every day and when father asked you where you got it you told him one of the boys at school had given it to you her eyes flashed i still wear it and her slim fingers plucked at the small sixpointed star hanging around her neck on a thin chain do you not have a man who gives you jewelry now he said mockseverely not yet she put her arms around him and squeezed and anyway ill never take this off no matter what anyone else gives me its a reminder of too many happy days he would never remember the funeral with any degree of clarity it was as if his conscious mind had pulled a misty curtain across that time so that now even in dreams it had a vagueness as if he had never been present at all at the actual ceremony afterward as was the iskamen custom there was an elaborate if solemn banquet for the family and friends of his father which would precipitate the seven days of fasting moichi sat beside sandal to his left was a tall rather elegant woman at a point when sanda was gone he was aware that the woman was staring at him he turned and looked at her for the first time she had black eyes and dark hair wound around and around her head she wore a shimmering bottlegreen gown which covered one shoulder while leaving the other one bare the neckline swooped to the tops of her firm breasts please excuse me for staring she said in a slightly husky voice but you are the other son the one who sails the seas their eyes locked for a brief moment i am elena and when the blank look remained on his face she added justees wife moichi was astounded the death of lustees son in a brawl had been the cause of moichis swift departure from iskamer a long time ago lustees son had picked a fight with jesah and bneatfl an opal moon pulled a knife jesah being unfamiliar with fighting would surely have died if moichi had not taken the other boy on justee whose land bordered moichis fathers own was only slightly younger unfortunately he is ill elena was saying else he would be here with me to honor his closest neighbor and friend when he recovers he will come to the grave of your father and say his prayers for his safe journey and his eternal peace did you know my father well alas no i am only recently married to lustee after his first wife died he took me moichi thought this a peculiar way to put it im so sorry about your father please accept my heartful excuse me moichi interrupted her standing he felt abruptly claustrophobic and went out of the room he went into the kitchen but this time it was crowded with cooks and servers he saw sanda in one corner going through the reserves of wine with a server and he thought they still have her doing the chores he went out into the quiet night searching for his stars the southern cross and the lion constellation but it was overcast and not even the firstmagnitude stars could be seen the moon was but a pale haloed smear etched upon the cloud over there was a wind from the southeast wnging with it the heat and spiced aridity of the great desert he thought again of his father but no emotion surfaced he felt nothing do you not miss this land a voice said behind him he turned to see elena standing behind him framed by the lemon light coming through the open back door she seemed at that moment both coolly aristocratic and terribly vulnerable im sorry if i caused you to leave i wanted to tell you she stopped as if bewildered by him would you mind if i stood beside you for a while there was nothing in her voice save perhaps sadness he nodded mutely and turned back not knowing why he had given his consent he should have sent her back inside the house he heard the movement as her thighs brushed against the fabric of her gown then he smelled the light musk felt the heat of her body close by i always miss iskael he said after a time then why do you leave it there was a rustling in the tall grass to their left and he imagined that the brownandwhite jackrabbit was back eric y lustbader my first love is the sea he said surprised by the softness of his voice but one can have more than a single love yes i see she lifted a hand wiped back a stray strand of hair behind one ear out of the small silence that built itself she said no doubt you wonder why i married lustee he said nothing knowing that any answer he gave would be superfluous and that in any event she would tell him now because that was what she had come out here for he was so very kind to me i came here from the south where the border skirmishes are ceaseless even to this day she meant between the iskamen and their neighbors of aden it was an ancient and bitter dispute for the iskamen it was said had been born in aden that was how my family died my parents my sisters she paused to lick her lips i arrived here with nothing and lustee took me in i was not a beggar but in truth i had nowhere else to go my father had once spoken of him but that had been such a long time ago when i was but a little girl lustee never asked how long i would stay or even if i would ever go at all the stain of the moon waxed for a moment and then the running clouds passed thickly before it blotting out its light his wife was already ill then had been for some time and he would become easily vexed by her constant requests the attention she required there was a need for me and i stayed with her constantly until she died afterward he came and asked me if i would marry him did you do it out of convenience convenience what do you mean for his money she seemed surprised not at all but did not take offence she shrugged perhaps i needed a father then he heard all of the pentup frustration in her voice but not now i dont want to hurt him but i need something else now her cool fingers touched his neck warming as they picked up his body heat her touch was very delicate and she knew where to put her fingers abruptly it did not seem absurd to him or even wrong but merely the most natural thing to do he wanted it too over there he said thickly and led her by the hand into the high grass she sank with him onto the earth im so lonely she said her lips against his so that he felt as well as heard her words beneath an opal moon slowly he stripped off her gown and her skin glowed in the night a beacon lighting the way toward what solace salvation perhaps nothing so complex pleasure only her skin was softer than any he had ever known and so moist that he could believe she was a nocturnal flower covered in dew he spent a long time with her a lifetime it seemed and all the while she whispered to him soft words and endearments cried questions and languorous replies and these soultorn com munications he remembered more clearly than the feel of flesh against flesh the sensual contacts which were in a way incidental though as part of the whole important when it was all over her cheeks were streaked with tears for what he had given her the chasm he had filled what she now possessed it was the intimacy of the listening while they performed the most basic and beautiful of acts as if she allowed less men to hear her than to enter her it was a very special gift he stayed on in the chirruping night after she had returned indoors after she had kissed with her lips and her artful tongue his mouth and cheeks and eyes thinking it had given him great pleasure and a release from a building tension this had been the beginning knowing that he was doing it with her knowing whom he was cuckolding but it was because of her what she was that this notion was soon trivialised into a childish fantasy for there was an honesty about her a genuineness that had touched him transcending circumstance she had approached him without guile made no bones about what she needed can you give this to me she had asked him silently with her fingers and her lips and this and this and in return shall give you more than he could ever have anticipated he became aware of something settling over him and he rose and went out into the grass naked still clothes forgotten as he had when he was a little boy and his father would call to him to put something on and his mother laughing would just shake her head from side to side and let him go until the house was but a black silhouette punctured by smeared yellow light he turned for a moment and the blaze from the kitchen windows seemed quite remote as if on the other side of a vast gulf he felt now as he had always felt in his fathers room a warmth an ancient protectiveness cloaking him and at last eric v lustbader he knew what this feeling was the long violent history of the iskamen as palpable and as potent as living entity truly he belonged to them and they to him he faced outward toward the distant but invisible mountains where the hand of god had fashioned the tallest peak to guide the iskamen to this their home the night beat on around him he was aware of the tall grass brushing his calves the cicadas wail the stands of aromatic cedars and further away the luminescent birch scattered among the grazing land rising like signposts above all the mountains made their presence felt he felt himself brushed by hello he whispered so you have come back the wind brought me it told me of your dying the wind the voice was scoffing it was god god told you the wind god does it matter you speak as a foreigner the tone turned bitter but you did not have to leave home to speak thus your brother would you have me as lesah is he is faithful to iskael he is unhappy he is faithful as am you are faithful to yourself only that is the difference between us i see that as good you do not you turned your back on me a long time ago no never on you only on what you tried to make me into i knew what was best for you no you didnt the sea is where i belong i am happy there you have always defied me i defied only the reins by which you meant to hold me to yourself people are not animals you cannot harness them in order to make them do as you wish this is the message of iskamen history do not blaspheme is that what im really doing listen to what i say for once for once beneath an opal moon a child has a duty hi his father he must respect him obedience is a sign of that respect but you never understood that respect must be earned if you had listened to me heard what i was saying you would have understood that i was a person and not an extension of you the iskamen broke free of their bondage in aden this you can accept cant you see that this is the same i had to be free to choose my own destiny there was silence for a time even the cicadas had fallen still i was always a stubborn man i did not want you to leave my side i never saw that i could never express it someday i will return to iskael again perhaps to stay you will never stay here for long but now i know your heart lust coming back that is enough now my son and he was alone in the night tears distorting his vision thinking gone gone gone hes gone sardonyx or hey gained the far shore of the deathsea at dusk nearing mistral they passed through a vast undulating field of daffodils and buttercups their heavy bells swooshing in the breeze heralding the beginnings of the night in the sudden darkness their lush saffron was chilled in the ruddy moonlight fireflies zoomed and swooped about them when they broke without warning from the lush field they found themselves upon a jutting rock promontory below which was a drop of perhaps six meters to a rushing foamfilled river beyond which mistral stood it was set on the peak of the high ground though beyond it lay land that was higher still as the topography graduated toward the steppes and mountain range in the northwest mistral might easily be mistaken for a crag itself for its foundations were composed of rhyolite a kind of greenish granite that nevertheless was earlier more volatile as volcanic magma at its base the castle was foursided but above the battlements towers and crenellated ramparts branched off into so many angles that it hurt the eye just to stare at it too long the portcullis stood open and as they went through they felt vulnerable indeed inside the courtyard was deserted but they were startled to hear a song playing as if on the very air looking up moichi saw that as the wind passed through the turrets and fenestrated needlelike towers it set up resonances and harmonies with the complexities of the architecture so that it was the castle itself which sang this mournful tune before them the stone doors to the main hall stood open as if awaiting their arrival they dismounted and went up the wide steps above him moichi saw that an enormous atrium towered the height of the beneath an opal moon structure and this he realized was what relieved much of the heaviness of the stone he saw the narrow staircase made all of shiny obsidian arching like the tendril of some mammoth spiders web and he turned to chiisai to tell her you have been expected mistral said he sprinted for the double doors but it seemed a terribly long way now saw them swinging shut even as he thought this clanging home with funereal finality he stopped there were no handholds on their inner side chiisai was gone but how he was certain she had entered with him there is no escape there said the voice nor anywhere unless i grant it he whirled around where are you he cried show yourself here i am he turned indeed the voice had seemed to coalesce and he looked up saw a shape at the first landing on the staircase he crossed the hallway and climbed the stairs he confronted a girl of perhaps ten slender lighteyed with a compassionately beautiful face without a single hard edge it was the face of innocence where is chiisai he demanded of her in another place she said smiling sweetly quite unharmed but also unable to interfere interfere with what the girl ignored this reached out one hand come she said come with me i want to see aufeya i will take you to her her eyes were soft and full of life as she stared at him daring him to take her proffered hand at length he did and she took him up the spiraling staircase fler long hair shone swaying with her motion you shall see your auieya in time but there are other things you must view first after which she shrugged who knows you may not even wish to see her they were at another landing now and the girl led him to a door banded with iron it appeared firmly locked but at a sweep of her thin arm it opened outward silently behold it was a room dimly illuminated by one squat oil lamp sitting high up on a ledge like a giant insect the cubicle was filled eric v ius ader with gems cut and uncut of every description great glowing emeralds and fat bloody rubies flawless diamonds of untold karats and sapphires as blue as the noonday sky interspersed among these were the lesser gemstones enormous dusky topaz smouldering amethysts fiery opals and glowing pearls and in one section the deep translucent green of royal fasui jade the rarest in all the world what say you to this moichi the girl asked what care you for one woman when this wealth is here for you to use as you wish why with this treasure you could buy the city of alaraat alaraat he swung on her what know you of iskael but the girl was gone in her stead was a woman with the head of an ibis her lush body was clothed in a gown of iridescent multicolored feathers her head was as white as snow come she said taking his hand again leading him upward on the next landing was another door behind which he saw his house in iskael it was the rear just outside the kitchen he saw sanda and jesah obviously arguing but he could not hear their words jesah struck her and sanda whirled running off into the night what know you of my home moichi asked how can you conjure such a thing the ibis ducked its head and smiled not an easy gesture for an avian face such images come quite easily after a time youd be surprised im already quite surprised he eyed her i had a dream last night of home yes of home was that your doing how could it be that is quite impossible yet you know of my brother my sister sanda my house i know these things yes how as i said it is not so difficult in time she turned and gestured the door swung to come they went up to the head of the stairs they were close to the top of the atrium and the strange music was louder here differently pitched what he stood next to a tall woman with skin of gold leaf her beneath an opal moon s hair was platinum flex and her eyes were great faceted rubies her nails were translucent sapphires and her halfcovered breasts were opals her robe was clothofplatinum a material no ordinary seamstress could work and her low sandals were crafted from pelts of snowermine she wore a platinum helm high and conical and horned i have been to many places the voice had changed now so that it had a hard almost metallic edge was this her real voice he had no way of knowing they were along the narrow balcony a low stone barrier coining to just above his knees protected them from the sheer drop to the floor of the main hall through a sculpted archway they entered a sort of sitting room the stone floor was strewn with ermine pelts before a large plush sofa and several highbacked chairs behind the sofa was a wall which jutted out three quarters of the way into the room to the left were a series of severely narrow windows the room was dark beyond them and he had no clear idea of what might lie there or even how far back it went upon entering she threw herself down lounging at fulllength upon the long sofa i would offer you something to drink or to eat she said with no trace of regret in her voice but as you can see there is nothing of that nature here why dont you conjure it up his left hand was on the hilt of his sword she smiled disconcertingly her face glittering an amusing notion she put a forefinger to her lips it looked like a slender jewel you are an intriguing fellow i would like to know you better he laughed humorlessly i hardly think that likely he came across the room to her sat on the edge of the sofa and reached out one hand what are you doing is this all real he indicated the room everything about them as real as is anything she answered gravely but a soft smile still played on her lips but you are not she evinced surprise i im as real as you are come touch me if you do not believe me his hand hesitated in midair she threw her head back laughing do you expect deceit then eric v lustbader he glanced around there seems to be nothing here but illusion ah no she said her head against the back of the couch now you do me an injustice he took his hand brought it to her she pressed his fingers against one breast he was surprised to find it warm and resilient she was flesh and blood after all he felt her heart beating now what do you say her voice was almost a whisper slowly she contrived to move his hand around and around he could feel her nipple now he took his hand away and stood from his position her eyes seemed heavyridded as she gazed languidly up at him why are you afraid to show me what you really look like afraid she said i am not afraid of anything youre afraid of the truth sardonyx i like the way you say it my name she rose stood next to him i shall prove to you that i am not afraid of the truth ask me anything where ia aufeya here above us is she alive why of course have you tortured her my dear sir what do you take me for id rather not answer that she smiled wryly yes she said i do like you rather what was your business in iskael why my business as you put it was the same there as it was wherever i journeyed i bartered traded pirated he finished for her she nodded true i am a freebooter a timehonored profession and a sorceress she laughed who told you that i learned it from a friend her face turned hard and there was a brittle edge to her voice now a friend from corruna perhaps perhaps what lies has that bitch told you about me tsuki only wants to be left alone he said evenly she should have thought of that a long time ago my friend too late now far too late theres no need for dont be a fool she snapped it ill becomes you she beneath an opal moon lay back down on the couch yet i am what i am she said seriously her thighs moved slightly and the slit of her gown widened exposing her legs to the hip he turned away crossed to one of the fissurelike windows and peered out but there was nothing really to see he turned back to her she had not altered her position or her state where are you from he said she made a sound like a snort what possible difference could that make i asked therefore im interested i hardly think you would believe me youve given your word sardonyx to tell me the truth even sorceresses must have ethics yes she nodded i am not so different from you as you would believe she took a deep breath and he watched her heavy breasts rise against the platinum material of her gown i was born in the land of aden aden he said wonderingly south of iskael our ancient enemies the two countries border was all she would acknowledge i was born in the mountains however nowhere near the border at a very early age my parents being poor and my mother crippled and unable to work sold me into slavery she shrugged not so very uncommon among those people he noted the lack of her use of my i was sold to a man a merchant so wealthy that he had had no need of work for the rest of his life others saw to mat the vast amounts of free time left him bored and filled with ennui thus he turned to buying women girls to be scrupulously accurate i really think women would have intimidated him too soundly she stretched her arms behind her head this was most distracting for it pushed her already straining breasts even further toward him he enjoyed tying me up then he would beat me for a long time until well i need not go into detail surely you can figure out for yourself what would happen next suffice it to say that it was most un pleasant she smiled at first of course i did not resist as i said slavery is wellknown in that land how well the iskamen know that sardonyx yes of course youre quite right that is the basis of the old enmity between the two people the iskamen rose up and broke their chains of bondage and went out of aden with the aid of god eric lustbader the god of iskamen she gave him a peculiar penetrating look how i envy you that but he did not know whether she meant the freedom or the faith perhaps it was both after a while she continued i found i had far too much respect for myself to allow this to go on and during the days while he played with others of his toys i sought out the things i needed one night after he had had his way and lay snoring contentedly i drew out four lengths of stout hemp which i had scavenged and carefully bound his wrists and ankles to the brass posts of the bed he was a sound sleeper and i knew if i was most careful he would not awaken when that was done to my complete satisfaction i moved the bottom half of his silken pajamas and i bent to my task she paused eyeing him this isnt getting too graphic for you is it go on was all he said he awoke of course just as the pleasure was filling him he opened his eyes and stared down at me go on he said imperiously go on go on i had no idea you had such a taste for it she smiled he didnt know how right he was i used my teeth she flicked an invisible bit of dust from the golden flesh of her thigh i think in the end he drowned in his own blood moichi watched her face as if those faceted ruby eyes could tell him something that her voice did not i fled into the mountains she said they had been my home and i suppose i felt safe there and there moichi said his tone ironic you came upon an old woman living far from civilisation who taught you how to be a sorceress she laughed youve got a sense of humor you know that but thats all part of a childrens story nothing of the sort happened of course they came after me and eventually caught me she shrugged it was a blessing perhaps i was half dead of hunger and exposure when they found me not very much left she sat up hands in her lap as if she were some demure virgin the slit in her gown had somehow disapppeared under her they threw me in a cell and left me there to rot she laughed again which was not i suppose very far away at that point but i couldnt complain too much i got food and water every day and no one bothered me it was all right until i got my strength back then i wanted out and you did get out naturally she said here i am beneath an opai moon how did you escape i bribed my way out she smiled with my body that hardly explains all of it moichi said of course not you surely cant expect a girl to give you all her secrets at least not right away her eyes glittered and weve only just met she rose now excuse me but i must leave you for just a moment she touched the back of his hand now do be a good boy and dont wander away this place can be dangerous she turned away from him and went around the end of the wall to the left disappeared into the darkness for a time he stayed where he was listening to the song of mistral then as if abruptly making up his mind he whirled and followed her he turned the corner there was no light it was as if he had unexpectedly stepped off a shelf of rock in the shallows and plunged to the bottom of the sea he turned around the way he had come but he could see nothing no wall no windows he put his hand out questing nothing he heard laughter from behind him and swiveled to meet it it was hellsturm one hand on his outthrust hip insouciantly glaring at him he lifted his other hand beckoning moichi on what is this moichi thought another illusion or and now he felt a premonitory chill go through him did i do battle with and kill an illusion in the forest he ran at hellsturm and the tall man fled before him his peculiar bestial laughter echoing behind him like a stream of bubbles moichi drew his sword slashed at the figure cutting it in two but when he looked at the corpse it was auleyas and as he stared horrified the thing slithered away like a serpent into the blackness then he understood and sheathing his blade stood quietly waiting after a short time he could discern the slap of her sandals and then felt her hand firm and cool taking his leading him out he was back in the sitting room i told you to wait here what is that place a room it is a room only a room to conjure images dreams perhaps she shrugged hes not alive then eric v lustbader hellsturm she laughed my god i hope not not after what you did to him no hes quite dead she smiled i thank you for that he looked at her sceptically pardon me if i am wrong madam but that devil was in your own employ i believe was i think is the operative word she said evenly he had served his purpose his effectiveness was being destroyed by his growing attachment to that bitch in corruna and he was becoming more trouble than he was worth no he had quite outlived his usefulness and would have died the moment he crossed the threshold at mistral fortuitously he never got that far ill take aufeya now as my reward she laughed and the golden goddess was gone he saw instead a woman with a flat face and high cheekbones she had nightblack hair down to the small of her back and eyes like chips of cobalt her skin was soft and dusky like the women of iskael and aden she wore a mirrored corselet over which was drawn an old leather waist jacket below that she was clad in buttersoft black fawnskin pants tucked into hunting boots reaching up over her knees a narrow black leather belt was slung low on her hips from which hung a long scabbarded hunting knife she was surprisingly small is this the real sardonyx at last if you wish it so you are so full of surprises no more than any other woman can we end this now he said somewhat harshly he stepped closer to her and her eyes turned wary end what impressing the country bumpkin her face darkened for a moment as if he had hit a nerve but when she spoke her voice was very soft that was certainly not what i intended its the impression you gave im sorry about that really i am he said nothing though he suspected she wanted some kind of confirmation from him needed it even but perhaps that was mere fancy on his part why on earth should she care what he thought i want aufeya and me she inquired do you not desire me that would be far too easy is this you beneath an opal moon it doesnt matter she said softly touching his arm i can be anyone you wish sanda she became sandal yes elena she became elena yes tsuki there was a moments hesitation then tsuki stood before him even she its too much he said or too little she returned to the woman with the nightblack hair i was afraid you would say something like that she looked disappointed too rich for your blood perhaps another time another place who can say she smiled go out through the way you came there is only one staircase to the floor above this one aufeya is there the bujun woman also then we are finished here he said his hand upon his swordhilt you will not prevent us from leaving the nightblack hair shivered as she shook her head no not now you may leave any time you wish she had been standing near the windows and now she moved back into the darkness beyond fading farewell moichi annainin of is kael he went out almost immediately there was no point he knew in going after her only she had the key to controlling what lay in the blackness it was a waste of time for him upstairs he saw chiisai first she was bending over a supine figure but she straightened up when she saw him moichi relief flooded her face thank the gods youre safe i had no idea what happened to you as i crossed the threshold i well i found myself stumbling around in utter darkness then just as suddenly i found myself here where ive been with sardonyx he said anticipating her query then youve defeated her she said delightedly then we have no worries about the firemask the firemask moichi frowned i had forgotten all about that how could he have forgotten something so important eric v istbader chiisai grabbed at him moichi where is she what happened to sardonyx he brushed past her kneeling right now im more concerned with aufeyas condition her face looked pale and drawn and dark blue circles under her eyes looked like massive bruises he put one hand under her head lifting it up somewhat auteya he said softly but urgently aufeya chiisai was close beside him moichi where is sardonyx gone he said concentrating on auteya i know not where whats the difference anyway auteya opened her eyes at first they were glazed but they soon focused and she started when she recognised him moichi it was but a fragile breeze im here auieya she told me you were dead she said that hellsturm had had her eyes welled with tears its all right moichi comforted her im here now everythings going to be all right but auteya continued to weep saying no you dont understand its not all right when she came to me now and told me told me you were dead i gave up all hope her eyes looked at him pleading forgiveness moichi i told her told her my half she knows she knows so thats where she went moichi thought now shes got the firemask chiisai said her voice like the tolling of heavy bells and she means to use it the oral e reined in at the foot of the steppes cursing himself for being taken in by sardonyx but oddly he felt no anger toward her she had not deceived him her plan was plain enough and he had ample opportunity to discern it but his brain had been somewhere else beside him chiisai looked upward there was little either of them could do for aufeya at the moment and though moichi had wanted her to stay with the daluzan woman he had respected chiisais request to accompany him look she said pointing upward i was right moichi lifted his eyes as they rode on into the steppes the moon was riding high and full impossible since it had been but a sliver just last night and it no longer appeared flat it was round as a ball fireflashes of silver pink emerald and blue winking down at him he lowered his gaze and stared at chiisai her face was grim as she nodded the legend lives moichi there is little time now only the bleak stars dwarfed by the awful opalescent light to guide them through the hazardous steppes and ever the great mountains loomed before them black as onyx in silhouette against the sea of stars ribboning the heavens once they heard a howling shivering the night and their luma normally fearless animals snorted and reared in terror but it did not come again and they galloped on flying through the steppes until at length they came to the steep shared side of the mountains and gazing upward saw a spark of light illuminating for a moment a sharply defined ledge perhaps forty meters up it came again then went out quickly chiisai said dismounting eric y lushader they found the semblance of a path to their left and made all possible speed ascending the rockstrewn face lust before they reached the ledge moichi stopped them whispered in chiisais ear let me go first she will be expecting me if i can distract her chiisai nodded and they crept on the moment he reached the ledge the spark came again and he called out frightened now that it was already too late if she had gone through there was nothing he or anybody else could do sardonyx he called again his voice echoing off the mountainside hollowly seeming to mock him we have a bargain to complete i have reconsidered he would say anything now to delay her even a moment he came along the ledge and abruptly the flash of light came again and this time he saw her a figure blacker than the night and he came on crossing her sharp shadow calling again and now she heard him too late iskamen regrettably it is too late something odd in her voice and as he came closer she turned and he gasped in spite of himself damping down on the organisms instinctive terror felt his mind screaming get away from here get away now while you still can she wore the firemask it was hideous unholy the depiction of the ultimate monstrosity it was beyond the aspect of a gargoyle beyond any human conception so alien in fact that his brain had a hard time orienting on the information his eyes were relaying back to it the masks surface seemed to be composed of some substance with a mirrorlike finish and it was this which sparked now and then in the moonlight however here she was still on the ledge beyond her he saw the foreboding blank entrance to a cave a great gaping maw down which he felt certain was the eye of time why had she hesitated out here surely she knew that no mortal could follow her inside the cave once she had donned the firemask i had hoped that we would not meet like this she said calmly her voice somewhat distorted by the thing she wore not like this moichi i have no desire to oppose you quite the opposite in fact i wonder why i dont find that in the least flattering he said edging closer to her his sword was already half out of its scabbard still he was reluctant to draw it fully beneath an opal moon now you mock me she said sadly i do not deserve your contempt are you not content with wealth with your gift she laughed harshly what is wealth but the ultimate illusion better than anyone know that as truth what has my wealth brought me but sorrow what could you expect sealed away in mistral there is all the world out there waiting for you the world she scoffed wants nothing to do with me it was people who drove me to my asylum of mistral moichi or didnt you know didnt your friend the bitch of corruna tell you that about me i know nothing of this and now is not the time to tell you she took one step along the ledge toward the caves waiting mouth the whisper of metal in the night as he withdrew his sword do not oppose me moichi please i cannot allow you to enter sardonyx he raised his weapon ah she said softly the final solution you have your way and i have mine how true she said sadly and raised her arms then he did jump back his heart pounding mightily in his chest for before him crouched not sardonyx but a creature out of the fevered nightmare of man it flapped its leathery wings and opened its alltoohuman mouth and he saw the rows of jade teeth as sharp as twoedged swordblades it called out giving off a chilling inhuman cry and he felt cold sweat break out on his face the short hairs at the back of his neck raised he faced the giant manbat out of daluzan mythology and religion from what deep hell had sardonyx called it diablura emperor of the underworld now chiisai was beside him her sword was drawn but she said to him this thing is but an illusion moichi surely it cannot exist he shook his head illusion or no chiisai it is solid enough and i dont believe it she said and launched herself past him along the shelf of shale directly at the diablura wait he cried but she paid him no heed the thing screamed and rose a meter into the air its wings eric v lustbader beating carefully so that it would not hit the projections of the mountainside it was an eerie slithering sound that the pocked rock face picked up echoing and magnifying until it filled the night like a howl of a demon the beast raised its lower extremities two horny fourtoed feet ending in long curved talons it rushed at chiisai claws clicking and the daikatana slashed into the thinly furred lower body it screamed again its jade teeth blanched in the opal moonlight and the talons raked at her she swung the daikatana again but the thing was far too powerful and the talons lashed out in a blur ripped into her left shoulder she tried to roll away but the thing had hooked her flesh and she was impaled still she fought on with one free arm the edge of her blade biting into the furred flesh again and again she saw what she had to do but lacked the position caught as she was and now he saw it too he ran at the flapping thing and lifting his sword high over his head he slashed downward through the dusty cartilage of its right wing it tore like a sail and he was hurled backward against the mountains face as the diablura lost its balance for a moment and screaming flew inward and down he coughed in the dust and swinging again severed the major cartilage along the upper part of the wingframe the diabluras body shuddered as it flailed to regain purchase in the air and chiisai was swung into an outcropping of rock her sword fell from her hand and moichi rushed toward her he threw the sword pointfirst at the thing saw it bounce off the bony chest and clatter to the floor of the ledge stupid but his only concern now was chiisai he grasped her in one arm cradling her while he worked at the embedded talons with the other freeing her he laid her down on the rocks and turned to face the diablura the thing was still flapping its loose and useless appendage trying to fly dipping and rising he timed it well and as the diablura neared him he leapt upon its back drawing out one of his dirks he slit the things throat it wailed and rose upward up and up and up ascending toward the stars a thin stream of dust glittery and dry ribboning the air about it he seemed high enough now to reach up and grab hold of the opal moon bring it spinning downward to the earth then the diablura canted over at an acute angle and began to fall it plummeted out of the sky with appalling swiftness beneath an opal moon it cracked once twice against the mountainside the third time moichi was thrown loose tumbling head over heels he flung himself outward using the length of his body and reached for the lip of the ledge he hung there swinging with heavy momentum back and forth his nails digging in as he began to slip feeling behind him his back crawling with sen sation the night air was reverberating with the frantic death throes of the diablura still moving juddering galvanically spastically fluttering like an impaled butterfly as it careened away down and down the mountainside spiraling lower and lower as if even in death it was reluctant to relinquish its reign over the air he took a deep breath and swung himself upward his right leg lifting to catch the upper edge of rock missed tried it again and made it this time levered himself up onto the ledge stayed there for a long moment gasping until he remembered sardonyx and the firemask he had to roll onto his left side to get up his wounded shoulder aggravated by the enormous strain he saw sardonyx standing before the mouth of the cave why had she not gone in he went toward her there was the sound of hammers clashing onto ten thousand anvils the chittering of a cloud of locusts the resounding of great rams horns the sizzle of flames against bloody meat the dancing of dust motes the trumpeting of elephants the crackle and rumble of an electrical storm echoes upon echoes upon echoes and a heat fiercer than the sun he reeled someone grasped him pulling insistently until he moved his feet like lead and then he was away from the caves mouth gasping for breath his lungs on fire his eyes watering his brain besieged as if by crawling insects sardonyx face covered by the mirrored monstrosity of the firemask held on to him how could you be so stupid she said softly another moment and you would have been killed he stared at her fighting to regain his breath after a time he said i do not understand you she patted his arm whats to understand i told you i liked you i must be going mad that wont solve anything take off that thing tic v lustbader she reached up and unsealed it i might as well i cannot get it to work he saw the woman with the dusky skin and nightblack hair he stood between her and the caves mouth i dont know whats wrong with it she said looking down at the thing turning it over and over on its reverse face he saw it was a matte black deeper than the night it offers no protection now too old perhaps he said all the magics gone he looked at her but if that is all its not all of course she was still trying to find the key the opal moonlight flashed against the masks outward face for an instant turning it into the beacon he had seen from below its supposed to allow its wearer either to open the eye of time or close it forever and he knew it had been right before his eyes from the very beginning the dazzling key he reconsidered in fact he didnt know he suspected and the one he told himself was quite different than the other if this were a tall tale there would be no indecision but this was life his life and he valued that highly he had places to go yet many far lands to see and many people to meet he was not yet prepared to die since its no good at all now he said his voice thick you wont mind if i take a look at it she eyed him suspiciously over my dead body he shrugged began to move away all right im going to look after chiisai what are you up to he stopped and turned my dear sardonyx i know far less about that thing you hold and call the firemask than do you what could i possibly be up to i dont know but he hit her a short chopping blow to the side of her head just under her right ear and she went down without a sound he caught her as she fell murmured now were even he laid her out on the shale ledge took the firemask from her ac quiescent fingers im happy we didnt have to fight sardonyx he said to her sleeping face he turned the mask over grimacing at the hideous formation seeing his own face grotesquely replicated over its mirrored hills and dales as if he were viewing from a great height the topography of the world beneath an opal moon there seemed no way of fastening the thing to his face but still he lifted it up feeling again the pangs of disquiet the organism screaming for selfpreservation but that was its job and the only thing to do now was to ignore it as the firemask drew closer to his flesh he felt a certain sensation as if his face were made of metal and the mask an extremely powerful magnet it drew itself to his face adhering to it like a second skin for a moment he felt that he could not breathe then as if he had found the way it was all right he looked about him nothing had changed naturally the moonlight seemed even stronger now and he took one last deep breath knowing that this was perhaps the last moment when he would be able to reach up and rip the unholy thing off his flesh instead he turned his face upward toward the opal moon as the moonlight struck the firemask full on he felt a tremendous jolt just as if he had been struck by lightning he staggered put an outstretched hand against the rock face behind him to steady himself now he felt a glowing heat upon his face seeping through the firemask into his skin his flesh his bones it spread through his entire body vibrations began and for a brief time he believed that an earthquake had begun then he realized with a start that the sensation was entirely internal the strange opal moonlight had been the key and he knew now that the firemask had been activated but like some sort of alien sponge it continued to soak up the lunar energy charging itself until he thought he would shake apart with power he turned completely around saw the supine form of chiisai and closer to where he stood sardonyx behind him and stared into the caves mouth he knew something of what lay within having experienced the briefest of exposures without any protection he moved to the mouth of the cave it was no longer dark inside the blackness was dissolving irising open to form textures textures in lieu of colon he entered and was immediately inundated with the sounds of the eye of time the clash of burnished insects the flapping of birds wings the swirling of underwater currents the skirting of unhuman instruments he paused for a moment confused he had been certain that with the firemask on he would hear nothing he had been eric v eustbader wrong the sounds were there all of them and more but they no longer sounded like a maddening cacophony bursting concessively on the eardrums and the mind they were filtered now through the firemask and as he moved cautiously forward he came to understand this for there was no light and in the absence of color sound became allimportant for both volume and pitch would guide him to the eye of time there was no solid floor no left no right no up or down his legs moving through brambles now it was hot and he took off his shirt feeling the warm sun drying the sweat the fence was down in this section and he found the spot without difficulty and set about repairing it some large predator had burst through uprooting several stanchions it was hard work but he continued to move forward step by step with the bellowing all about him filling the colorless world with the rushing as of torrents and buzzing as of flies and he was at his desk in the large rural school with its smell of pine tar and beeswax and cherry wood he was too young yet to ride the familys land as his father would one day decree uprooting him from school and substituting a tutor heard the instructors voice droning away as if from a great distance his voice too like the buzzing of drowsy insects all in a mist now like the pearled dawn the silver night the golden noon the amethyst dusk one foot in front of the other hearing the moaning of the tides the gnashing of langoustes claws along the seabed the stiff rustle of dragonfly wings the soft sibilance of a forest breathing standing on a hillock with the sky hanging over him marbled in white and blue and grey streaks turning northeast from his vantage point the highest on his land shading his eyes against the sun searching for the low sprawl of alaraat and beyond the silver splash of the beckoning sea green in the troughs where the sun didnt dance like diamonds off its surface oh my sea my sea walking forward ascending now into the mountains with the fear of god within him his limbs trembling his body shaking his bladder about to burst falling down upon his knees as he beheld a peace filling him at last as the ship set sail from the port of alaraat taking him from iskael the figure of his father as tiny as an insect standing on the pier are you crying father on the sea at last the sea which had sustained him through all the long arduous days and nights not all of them for he thought of the times running triumphant and laughing through the apple orchards beneath an opal moon with sanda on his shoulders rolling upon the soft ground shinnying up the trunks shaking the branches so that the ripe fruit fell upon their heads all about them in a shower or in another season walking with her amidst the trees filled with clouds of white and pale pink blossoms slowly drifting through the air dusting their hair and clothes coating the grass and the earth like a mattress from heaven turning away from the land turning away from sanda and the lush orchards which would never see him now not this year nor the next nor he steps downward and finds himself on solid ground at last a kind of promontory in the mist that is no mist at all echoes still crashing like surf upon his mind the images out of time eddies from he is quite certain now the eye of time lapping at him increasing in intensity as he approaches he sees before him a swirling vortex coalescing dividing reproducing fissioning a great iris neither open nor closed couched waiting the eye of time the portal into endless yesterdays and unlimited tomorrows now he is inescapably drawn toward it volition draining out of him hypnotized by the incipient openings and closings almost but not quite stopping frustratingly short of completion shapes changing forming twisting spiraling sucking lapping churned by a force so elemental that it could have no name for the concept of language that superseded it could only be ex pressed in the complex symbology of the mind directly the sounds change subtly suddenly so that they beat upon his eardrums most painfully even through the protection of the firemask he claps his fists to his ears but there is no change only now the sounds cease to be painful and an ecstasy such as he has never known permeates him a heat a fusion an excitement he can only relate to sexually though even that seems a pitifully inadequate comparison his hands reach out as he closes in on the vortex drugged and exhilarated and as he approaches another sound cuts through the others a tone trembling fingers almost at the tensile barrier about to caress it as a lover might and the eye of time begins to irisopen revealing no from somewhere deep inside him so deep that the sounds of the vortex have not penetrated a voice of reason cries out use it it cries use the firemask eric v lustbader at first he does not comprehend and he is so close to the kinetic framework that perhaps it has become impossible to understand he halts his motion pushed onward by some unseen but heard tide of immeasurable force and it feels to him as if he is attempting to hold back the spin of the world think use it now he concentrates it starts in the brain aflame with the true music of the spheres pushed outward through his eyes and now it comes the stored energy of the opal moonlight directed by him through the skin of the firemask it rumbles and flashes like spot lightning the heat builds just as it did outside on the shale ledge so far away crackleboom of thunder his face is on fire light of a cosmic beacon energy pouring forth and for the first time he sees the truth of the vortex its ultimate sinister nature and like a surgeon he carefully sutures up the rent in time slowly slowly with infinite deliberation sweating with the whole outpouring of sizzling energy concentrated and focused until at length it is done he relaxes and the vibrations begin explosions building and he knows that the moonlight energy has built up too far and threatens to run amok he bears down his entire body trembling with the effort and he damps down on the field slowly ever so slowly the heat recedes from the firemask from his face and stumbling he turns away from the dense intense quietude running running now out of the cave out of the silence and into the star spangled night four ion to dusk idyll he first thing he saw was that she was gone he reached up convulsively to pull the firemask away from his flesh but his fingers came away coated in a dull grey powder all that was left he went quickly along the ledge but there was no trace of sardonyx chiisai sat her back propped up against the mountainside she had managed to shred the lower half of her shirt into strips and wind them around her wounded shoulder she stood up when she saw him smiling as he came wearily toward her its over he said his voice sounding odd to his ears she handed him his sword and they went down off the ledge winding down the mountain he told her briefly and as best he could what had happened did you see sardonyx he asked her chiisai shook her head she must have been gone before i awakened i did not see her the luma were waiting patiently for them at the foot of the mountain contentedly cropping grass they mounted and as they prepared to go he took one look back wondering what seemed to be missing the carcass of the diablura was nowhere to be seen surely he had seen it tumble over the side of the ledge mistral loomed ahead of them and now he was anxious to get aufeya and leave this land far behind him all was quiet as they reined in in the courtyard but as he dismounted they heard a rumble from high above them and peering upward saw a section of the wall of a high turret shatter stone and masonry outing outward hailing down moichi ducked through the falling rubble ran through the eric v iustbader doorway into the main hall he took the spiderweb staircase three steps at a time calling auteya another quake shook the castle and he thought god the whole place is breaking up dust filled the vault of the immense atrium and the walls were trembling he raced upward at last gaining the top and found aufeya where they had left her still pale she looked somewhat recovered from her ordeal he bent and scooped her up sprinting for the stairs just as the chamber next to hers imploded choking dust billowed out with a scream of demons the chill north wind now howled dissonantly through the splintering architecture on the second landing part of the outside wall ballooned outward and the door to the jewel room ripped open the chamber was empty save for the squat lamp into the main hall and he felt the structure itself shudder and he leapt through the doorway outside chiisai had his luma ready he thrust auteya up onto the saddle the entire front wall of mistral began to cave inward stone flashed by them with the buzz of angry bees moichi leapt up behind aufeya and they were off speeding through the shattered portcullis jumping over the strewn rubble behind them mistral rent itself a funeral pyre rising into the night sky obscuring for a time the bloody horned moon on the way south she whispered it all in his ear ridding herself of the terror she had lived with for so long a time i became other people at first they were people i knew or had known then they turned unfamiliar becoming stranger and stranger distant and hostile that was bad enough and foolishly i thought i could endure anything but that but it was worse when it stopped because i became all manner of animals with minds as dull and syrupy as mud i tried to think and could not then reptiles by turns lethargic and energetic like some monstrous manicdepressive for when my reptile mind could function all it thought of was food to fill the vast stomach a killing urge that was impossible to ignore then the insects my brain buzzing with a thousand sights and scents making up for the deficiencies in other senses i tried to think but there was too much interference and then i was a fish placidly swimming with nothing on my mind who was there seemed to be nothing left was i truly a fish or perhaps a bird or another animal or the human me was gone and i beneath an opal moon felt the loss all the more terrifyingly because i could not remember what it was i had been i was not even a serpent dreaming of being human even that small thing was now denied me i screamed then and went on screaming until sardonyx came for me scooping me out of the water that is when i told her what she wanted to know she said against his ear and you know the really odd thing im not sorry i wanted my humanity back whatever the price had been i would have paid it gladly moichi understood her all too well and could not find it in himself to blame her tell me she said what happened beneath the opal moon so he told her all that had transpired she seemed the most fascinated by what had taken place in the cave of time andhe was happy to elaborate feeling that it was taking her out of her own memories for a while he felt her lips open against the soft flesh of his neck as he spoke the licking of her tongue inquisitive and naive as a childs licking the salty sweat and with that all his fear and anxiety for her safety dissipated as if with this simple gesture she had freed him as well as herself from the enslavement of pity he made certain that they took their time on the way back not that he did not have a desire to return to corruha and thence to shaanghsei but they were all three like the walking wounded and he deemed it more prudent that they not expend their last reserves of energy on a hard ride but rather gain strength through a leisurely journey he did not perhaps think consciously of the fact that he wished to be with auteya knowing instinctively that when they arrived in corruna they would have to say goodbye but chiisai knew and during the endless afternoons they traveled only in the still coolness of the morning and the slanting diffuse sunlight of the last of the day while they rested she would wander off under one pretext or another leaving them alone most often she would explore the ruins of past civilisations which dotted the countryside for her part aufeya understood the chemistry relaxed into it grateful that chiisai was so intuitive and understanding and not at all jealous and delighted to be alone with him each day eric v lus ader so that it was ironically only moichi himself who did not clearly understand the vectors of human emotion within which he found himself in dappled sunlight sweeping over them like honey they held hands and spoke of their pasts aufoya recalled her father with great fondness remembering most clearly the times when he had taken her aboard one of his ships there was one day she told him when he took her up the daluzan coast to the town of puerto chicama from whence she later discovered he ran illegal ruuma into the interior why theres nothing wrong with the drink he had told her later only the sanction of the palliate causes it to be outlawed do you think though that this makes it unavailable no only more expensive for more hands must be greased he had winked at her including a number of cures i could name later on she told him she had taken a trip into the interior and there saw that what her father said was true ruuma was drunk almost uni versally with no appreciably harmful effects save for a short doze in the heat of the afternoon and your mother he asked her one day she let off a stream of idiomatic invective that left no room for debate he knew better than to argue with her and quickly changed the subject and indeed this was the only sour note in all the time they spent together the days and nights ribboned together as their flesh and chiisais too mended and healed until only red scars remained and pen came in infrequent remonstrating twitches now and again perhaps at the end of a day more strenuous than most or when they came upon heavy rain clouds rolling darkly on the horizon and the air turned humid and the pressure dropped at night they all slept separately peacefully near one another around the cheerful crackling fire but during the afternoons when chiisai was away on her archaeological sojourns they would make love passionately and then languorously reveling in the hot sunlight on their naked flesh and then if there was one nearby they would splash and paddle about in the rushing streams that became more numerous as they traveled further south making love once more it seemed to moichi that he could never get enough of aufeya but perhaps this was because he understood that their time together was finite certainly he found that all his senses were heightened because there would be an ending bneatli an opal moon chiisai invariably returned just before they were preparing to move out giving them as much time together as possible but one day when they were already packed she still had not returned the sun slipped from the sky and in the rather awkward silence of the waiting he realised unfair they were being to her dusk was already giving grudging way to night when she appeared over a low hillock embroidered with a copse of plane trees over her left shoulder was slung the carcass of a small hairy boar they had not eaten fresh meat of this kind for some time having grown used to foraging for nuts and fruit and when the opportunity presented itself spearing freshwater fish thus it was cause for no lime celebration and they set about searing the skin of hair slicing open its belly and gutting it they let chiisai build up the fire as they went about their bloody and stinking but joyous work they braised the outside crisping the skin then began the roasting the rich scent was so fragrant and delicious that they all wondered if they could wait until it was fully cooked while auteya washed the intestines in the nearby stream and went to find nuts and berries to stuff them with moichi contented himself with watching the stars cold and glittery and remote they were far out of the land of the bloody moon and the one that reigned in the sky these nights he was happy to see was his old friend silver and flat as a coin it was threequarters full across from him chiisai sat near the fire sharpening her daikatana he came and stood next to her watching the quiet expertise of her hands as they went about their work he cleared his throat and she looked up her hands poised over the blade of the sword the firelight flicked off it illuminating its long precisionhoned edges it was indeed a most magmficent instrument im afraid that auleya and i have both been rather selfish whatever makes you say that she wiped the long blade took it off her thighs and sheathed it ive been quite content to explore this land as we go she laughed you would have known if i was unhappy with the arrangement still besides moichi to tell you the truth i needed this time by myself there are a number of important decisions ive got to make when we return to shaanghsei i want to make certain im prepared youre sure eric v lusher she stood up and standing on the tips of her toes gave him a long kiss that night with the moon riding high in the sky they commenced an orgy of eating yet rationed after that the rest of the meat lasted them all the way back to corruna during the last days of the journey they spent more and more time on the move as if the closer they came to the city the stronger the magnetism of its heart became they spoke little during the days but at night under the moon and stars chiisai told them stories of amanomori and the bujun neither moichi nor auteya seemed much inclined to talk and this she put down to the simple fact that quite soon they would be parting perhaps forever and she found herself unknowingly feeling sorry for moichi she knew she loved him but it was in the manner of the bujun and thus was not an easy thing to express to outsiders it was the love of one warrior for another growing together through adventure and peril in which true heroism could later be appreciated and savored in which the two became closer than family or lovers she knew for instance without his telling her that moichi hardly considered himself a hero yet she knew that he was for it was some singular inner vision that powered him moved him onward he was his own morality his own strength his own glory his own world was as much a hero as the daisan she had supposed that she would envy him this heroism but she found that she did not only loved him all the more for it in that sense she was content now for she believed that at last she knew why the daisan had suggested she journey to shaanghsei and to moichi perhaps he had not actually known of this of the firemask or sardonyx or even the eye of time but surely he knew the karma of his friend she was grateful to have been part of this adventure yet again and again she found herself wondering during these long drowsy afternoons amidst the crumbling fabulous ruins on the way to dalucia as she strolled with the darting butterflies felt the weight of the hot slanting sunlight like bars of dusty honey illuminating these markers of an enigmatic past civilisation whether for her this was the end of it beneath an opal moon and then like every bujun before her who had thought much the same thoughts about an uncertain future she shrugged to herself she would accept whatever would befall her karma she thought the orphans hey passed through the western gate of corruna just past midday riding swiftly through the vast warehouse district scattering the cambujo workers as merchants with dark shining faces and thick curling beards shook their fists at them for the interruption their shouts echoing off the flat and featureless warehouse walls the plaza de la pesquisa was placid when they arrived their lumas hooves loud upon the tiles of the square the two old men dressed in their immaculate white daluzan suits were in their accustomed place on the bench in the shade of the olive trees the fountain was hidden from view by the verdant foliage but as they dismounted they could hear the almost musical tones of the water splashing now that they were actually here moichi was troubled by what aufeyas reaction would be to coming home he knew that he had an obligation to return her here and for many days he had fought to keep the consequences of this moment from his mind tsuki he knew wanted her daughter back home but what of aufeya herself he took her by the hand and led her up the winding stairs to the front door this was thrown open before he had a chance to knock and chimmoku loomed at the threshold his face was split by a grin and he said welcome home auteya with such obvious love that moichis mind was put at ease perhaps it would be far less difficult than he had imagined the mind had an uncanny ability at times to throw things out of proportion come in come in all of you chimmoku was saying stepping back we have prayed for your safe return moichi took aufeya down the hall until they stood at the beneath an opal moon foot of the shipsfigurehead staircase he gazed upward tsuki stood immobile at the top one hand clutched at her throat she looked tall and regal as ever but her eyes darted from one to the other aufeya she breathed aufeya said nothing tsukis gaze alighted on moichi and sardonyx gone he said defeated thank you for returning my daughter to me both of you it was nothing madam he made a mockformal bow she lifted her arms fingers outstretched im sorry aufeya for everything welcome home darling go on moichi whispered in aufoyas ear he gave her a small pat on her backside she turned to him gave him a tight smile wait for me she whispered ill be right down then she slowly ascended the stairs one hand sliding along the polished banister tsuki put her arm about her daughters shoulders and together they disappeared down the hall a moment later he could hear the door to tsukis bedroom closing softly there are no adequate means to thank you chimmoku said to them when they were alone in the hall the senhora has been beside herself ever since you left she was guilty for not having gone she abhors the interior you see and she felt she would be more of a hindrance he pulled abstractedly at his long drooping mustache in many ways aufeya takes after the senhor but in this she is exactly like the senhora moichi laughed youve forgotten about the time the senhor took her up the coast to puerto chicama chimmoku looked at him blankly i beg your pardon when he went to sell the ruuma chimmoku pulled himself erect and his voice took on a steely edge senhor milhos seguillas y oriwara would have no more to do with that illegal and highly toxic drug than would i he would not lower himself to do such a thing and certainly not with his beloved daughter moichi felt a sudden tightening of his stomach as if all the air had suddenly gone out of his lungs still he persisted surely you must be mistaken i senhor i assure you that aufeya has never been to puerto chicama with her father perhaps during the time she was away eric at lustbader but moichi had already brushed past him leaping for the stairs he felt chilled thinking when had it happened senhor i do not think that you should disturb chiisai moichi called over his shoulder ignoring the other outside the senhoras bedroom window chiisai turned and ran down the hall opening the front door and disappearing down the steps meanwhile moichi had gained the second floor and was pounding down the upper hallway the door at the head was closed there seemed to be no sound from inside he tried the doorknob but it was locked he stepped back and using one booted foot smashed at the lock it gave somewhat but still held he kicked again putting all his strength into it and the lock shattered the door flying inward he rushed into the room the room was dark the curtains drawn at first it appeared empty then as his eyes adjusted to the low light he saw a form upon the bed he ran to it tsuki lay sprawled on her huge bed blood drooled from one corner of her mouth her dress was ripped and she clutched a pillow to her breast as if she were a child who had just awakened from a nightmare but he knew now that she had awakened to a nightmare the hilt of a sawbladed dagger protruded from a spot on the pillow below which her heart would be but it was her eyes which haunted him and would continue to do so for a long long time they held an immeasurable portion of disbelief he went up onto the bed scooping her up and cradling her body the room he knew was empty and the window was the only other exit he did not even bother to cross to it to make certain let chiisai take care of the murderess for now the first thing he did was carefully close her eyes even before he withdrew the dagger from her chest he was crying now she had not deserved this not this such a terrible way to die thinking you had been murdered by your own daughter and the very worst of it was that it was a lie tsuki had not been killed by aufeya yes it was her body but he was quite certain now sardonyx had been animating it how long he wondered was i making love to her he had failed in the end tsuki was his friends first love he had had an obligation to protect her as he had allowed kossori to be killed so had he allowed tsuki to go to her beneath opal moon death he knew in his innemmost self that he was being far too harsh with himself i did not care he heard as if from far away raised voices recognised among those chiisais calling him he ignored it staring down at tsukis now placid face the fallen moon set at last they stood far apart at graveside moichi and auteya observing this chiisai sighed inwardly composing herself as the coffin smooth as glass was lowered into the newly dug grave beside the headstone of milhos seguillas y oriwara she paid scarce attention to the words of don hispete as he intoned the liturgy of the dead she had had no trouble subduing auteya as she scrambled down from the secondstory window to the garden of the house but by that time it had been too late she was again auteya bewildered at being in corruna let alone outside herown home it was some time before they could tell her what happened she was stoic throughout which was more than chiisai could say for moichi he had walked out midway through the telling and now aufeya knew that there had been something between moichi and the senhora seguillas y oriwara consequently they had not spoken in two days don hispete made the sign of the palliate over the lowered coffin chiisai was grateful that the ceremony was at last over with the swirlling of emotions tension had been at a peak and it seemed as if they had all stood here under the shade of the huge olive tree for half a day though she knew it had been far less she was grateful too that moichi had told her they would embark for shaanghsei this aftemoon directly following the service she had had enough of that dark dispirited house with its gloomy selfflagellatory paintings and its almost relentless aura of doom too her own decision had been made and she was anxious to return to shaanghsei she looked at moichis glum face and smiled secretly to herself his attitude would soon change when he got a look at what was waiting for him in shaanghsei everyone had gone save the three and now chiisai fumed away without looking at either of them she no longer belonged here she heard the sound of someone coming toward her she stopped and fumed it was aufeya are you going back to the house eric v lustbader no im going to the mercadoi want to say goodbye to martyne before we leave you when are you leaving this afternoon almost immediately aufeya shook her head dismayed i didnt know i if you two had been speaking to each other chiisai was abruptly fed up she had done as much talking in the last couple of days as she cared to do excuse me she walked off moichi stayed on alone as the attendant shoveled the dirt into the grave it had a hollow sound as it hit the coffins top but that soon changed as the soil built itself higher then the man was gone and moichi was alone with her the place was very still i am sorry tsuki but as he said the words he knew how inadequate they were his shame was so great that had he been of another folk he would have killed himself there but he was iskamen and that was not his way he would have to live with his shame that would be his atonement he smiled inwardly sadly recognising the voice of his father and his father before him on and on the history of the iskamen inescapable he might just as well stop breathing for it flowed through every molecule of his body through blood and bone through muscles and sinew through brain and heart through his mind then flashed a scene the moment just after he had met chiisai on the dock at shaanghsei what an odd thing to think of at this time then he realized what had jarred the memory the shindai and her prophesy what had it been the sun significator of great change the past this is what aids you it had been a corpse on a bier tsuki from the past now dead everyone this is what crosses you sardonyx and what was he to make of all that he became aware of a presence behind him there is nothing the words caught in her throat and she swallowed convulsively aufeyas mouth was dry because of the fear she recognized this as the most difficult thing she had had to do in her life part of her screamed against it vexed a child railing but she gritted her teeth and plunged onward because deep down she knew that it was her only chance that without this she was doomed chained and bound here forever beneath an opal moon there is nothing she has to forgive you for moichi stared at her watched her face seeing the wild animal in her receding further back with every passing moment and abruptly he understood the depths of his own selfpity i see that i think she glanced down at the new grave then back up at him agaun he stood silently watching her still about the other thing she said softly what other thing he knew very well what she meant he just wanted her to say it about you and mother it wasnt what you imagine aufeya she wasnt that kind of a person dont tell me about it she said thats all i ask i just felt she broke off and her eyes filled with tears she was always so beautiful so very very beautiful he put his arm around her and they walked away from there in the spring the grass would begin to grow over the dark brown earth that no one had bothered to pat down it would not matter to tsuki seguillas y oriwara only to those who would come to visit her and ad the stars to guide me c jhaanghsei eternal shaanghsei moichi thought as they entered the harbor maneuvering around the myriad larger merchant vessels keeping well clear of the bobbing tasstan close to the bund how it swells my heart to see your shoreline once again yet still iskael for me now home again chiisai stood on one side of him unaccountably nervous auteya was on the other side i would come with you to shaanghsei aufeya had said to him but what of the family the house there is no family really not anymore just me the last of the seguillas y oriwara with mother gone chirnmoku no longer wishes to remain and i no longer belong here i will not stay in shaanghsei for long auteya she smiled is that a warning i just want you to know he looked at her seriously what will you do then one decision at a time moichi all right he sent a kubaru runner to notify aerent as soon as they had docked and chiisai went with him it was near to dusk the vast sprawling city lay entangled in its smoky matrix the sky was hazed a deep amethyst punctured by the flickering lights already coming on along the streets high up on the hill the rooftops of the lavish homes of the citys bongs in the walled city were already partially obscured by the mist as if they belonged to some other far more ethereal world along the jumble of the bund they went until moichi hailed beneath an opai moon a passing ricksha and they were immediately engulfed in the maelstrom of shaanghsei they had taken over the long balcony of the restaurant high up in the city yet with a spectacular view of the harbor below them the brown waves washed against the ancient pilings and the bobbing tasstan community was a swarm of light as the kubaru began to clean up after their evening meal aerent sighed expansively and leaned back in his chair he clapped moichi on the shoulder it is good to have you back my friend you were sorely missed i am sure not moichi said wiping his lips oh gods he is right moichi llowan said from across the table and a litter of platters and plates and empty decanters the business is a mess without you moichi laughed now i know you have both gone mad what will you do now chiisai aerent asked return to amanomori there was a gleam in her eye no regent ive not yet had my fill of the continent of man besides ive never really gotten to see shaanghsei very good lady llowan said raising his goblet well said i salute your resolve he laughed heartily and your nerve you may if you wish reside in moichis old quarters now wait a minute moichi said i did tell you that i was bound for alaraat but as you know full well it wont be as easy as all that there still are no ships available oh aerent said smiling well get you off one way or another as long as its a proper ship moichi said iskaels a long way south and i do not propose to paddle all the way well if we are finished chiisai said standing up why dont we go for a walk i havent had a chance to see shaanghsei by night moichi spirited me away far too quickly for that and that was how chiisai came to give moichi his second gift from the daisan it was there as it had been since the morning she arrived the tsubasa she said smiling its your ship mine he could scarcely believe it yes now you can go home eric v lustbader home to iskael he breathed and what about you aufeya she stood close behind him i wish to come with you to iskael what i do not think you have given this much thought it is not the kind of decision you on the contrary she flared i have thought of little else for some time but aufeya then he saw the hurt in her eyes and he knew the mistake he had made all right she exploded youre right it was a childish idea i dont know where i got the notion you would want me to come he reached out for her but she whirled away she wanted only one thing now to hurt him as deeply as he had hurt her say it say it in front of all your friends im sure theyll understand you dont want me you never wanted me it was my mother youre like all the rest of them who came into the house they came in and they saw her it was always my mother why didnt anyone pay attention to me she flung herself away from the group running out onto three kegs pier behind her a heavy silence fell like an opaque carpet of snow damping all sound moichi stared at chiisai for a moment feeling helpless and alone but she was studiously staring at the whorls in the wood grain of the pier plankings he cleared his throat and went after her the world was now a forest of black masts and beyond it the vastness of the rolling sea he came up to her stood beside her without touching her knowing instinctively that she would not tolerate that now the wind coming in off the sea whipped her hair back from her face and at that moment with the moonlight gilding her face she had never looked more beautiful nor more her mothers child im sorry he said softly you took me completely by surprise and i yes and ill always be just my mothers daughter to you she said acidly why dont you just get away from me i want you to come with me she said nothing to their right past the tsubasa on four winds pier a kabaru song started up bittersweet in the night beneath an opal moon he could not see any of them but their voices rose clear and strong in their indomitable hymn your mother loved you very much aufeya more than anyone or anything else in the world so she was fond of telling me she spat words dont mean anything after a while her life had little meaning without you do you expect me to believe that auteya listen to me she was going back with hellsturm in order to ensure your safety he had not wanted to tell her this but what choice did he have now he saw the shock register on her face dihos no she cried she wouldnt have on the contrary it had already been arranged and it would have happened save that sardonyx crossed hellsturm he reached out for her now aufeya there is no one your mother could have hated more than hellsturm yes i learned that at least at mistral she loved you dearly as he said it he became aware that what he was saying about tsuki was just as true for his father and himself they held each other as if for the first time while beside them the crew of the tsubasa made ready to get underway dawn llowan was already dockside having said his farewell aerent took his arm said remember moichi shaanghsei will always be your home then he turned and went down the gangplank in his stiff articulated walk moichi turned to chiisai this is not the end as i once told the daisan no she said aerent and i will surely see you again one day they embraced i wish you good fortune moichi and you in all you do chiisai kissed aufeya and then she too was gone from the ship the gangplank was hauled in and he gave the signal men scrambled to release the lines fore and aft and the anchor was weighed all away pilot came the call from his first mate at midships eric v iustbader aye he called back climbing the aft companionway to the high poop deck as soon as we are clear of the harbor set all sail very good sir he looked at the trio still at the edge of the pier what adventures still awaited them he turned gave a series of sharp barking orders and men scrambled up the ratlines into the shrouds the next moments were spent guiding the tsubasa through the difficult and absorbing maze of shaanghseis harbor aufeya went below to change into her sea clothes presently they were well clear of all ships and he heard the first mates strong command then the bright quick snapping as the men broke out all canvas hes a good one moichi thought as he turned to the helmsman and gave him the course south by southeast aye sir the ship leapt forward her bow waves high her wake thick and creamy the sun was rising in the sky ahead of them turning the deep blue to white near its position not a cloud could be seen in any direction but faroff near the western horizon the pale moon full now could just be discerned over the rooftops of fastdisappearing shaanghsei he left the helmsmans side and leaning against the starboard taffrail luxuriated in the feel of the ship the roll and scent of the sea exulting in his mastery over them both isnt it strange that the moon should be visible at this time of the day the female voice came from behind him rich and melodious and almost half mocking he turned quickly but he saw only aufeya clad in high shining seaboots and sailors loose shirt and pants coming across the poop deck the sun in her eyes smiling at him
