 we had wonderful seats ten rows back from the glass two hundred feet below the oceans surface sunlight flooded down through seaweed forests in a thousand flickering golden beams players swirled in shoals among the forest roots like half a hundred colorcoded fighting fish grandstands had been set against the city dome beyond the glass was the playing domain for ten colormarked teams each team being five humans and a dolphin sixty players down to fifty now the humans using breathers and oversized fins the prey were local lifeforms three flattened turtles armed with hind flippers as wide as wings their painted shells glowed like captured suns red yellow violet the point was to move the prey through the arches paraboloids painted in the same blazing colors a player might pull a prey against his chest to swim with it or hold it at arms length and steer by the strength of his arms while the prey did the work or even leave it swimming toward the sand during a melee hopmg a teammate could get it before it disappeared sharrol was entranced when a swarm of entertainment guild players carried the violet prey through the violet arch she bellowed with the rest i dont understand water war she watched the game i watched her sharrol was dressed shashter style a fancy cloak over a body stocking with windows in it that would serve for swimming she was small even by flatlander standards beginning to bulge with our second child strong jaw pale skin straight black hair the real sharrol on earth shed worn many fantastic images in flatlander style for too long fear had lurked beneath her surface emotions sharrol wasnt made for this world but wed lived beneath fafnirs worldspanning ocean for a year and a half wed conceived and birthed jeena and started a sister for her and wed come to see this place as our own gradually the fear had been etched away i saw no sign of it now sharrol was at home light beams danced down through the water and played over the wonderful landscape of sharrol janss but id missed brunch i nudged her and said im going for provisions she didnt turn good handmeal red yes on veggies popcorn juice any i left my backpurse in the seat i glanced back when i reached the aisle sharrol was lovely in profile and entirely absorbed in the game the stands didnt include food stalls you had to go under the stands and all the way across the strand by elevated slidebridge and into a fairsized food court or you could walk twenty yards along the glass use a transfer booth and save fifteen minutes i flicked in on the secondfloor balcony i looked over the railing at several long lines the longest was a window for handmeals my attention snagged on a face below he caught me looking or not i didnt wait to be sure i stepped to the lone phone booth at the end of the row of transfer booths found a coin and dialed i did not want this call registered on my pocket phone we might have had a whole lifetime i thought wed been promised that but it had been a lie but wed had our year and a half the glass at the back of the booth reflected the top of the slidestair if i held my head right i watched while sharrols phone chimed six times she was looking past her phone watching the game bey what she showed flat in one of the walls her pocket phone wasnt sophisticated enough to give me a hologram i said i saw a face who now she looked at me not her tell me its not her no of course not but its not good he was my ghostwriter bey your what dear one im short of time ander smittarasheed shouldnt be here i think he knew me unlikely i was looking over a balcony he saw just my head and shoulders foreshortened but maybe he doesnt know about you so book a single for me at the pequod as persial january hebert it was a name i hadnt used in a while but she knew it and wed stayed at the pequod once furnish the room a little luggage no but i left my backpurse on my seat leave it in the room nothing else next the man id seen hadnt appeared yet she was taking it all in but muscles were flexing at the corners of her jaw and her eyes were wide and frightened i asked how tough are you her eyes slid away watching the game because someone might be watching her she said again next if you can get jeena go to shasht get outbound enterprises to freeze you for transfer to home sign me in too and pay the extra to ship jeena ill be there when i can her jaw set sharrol was a flat phobe and the continent shasht wasnt just halfway round the world it was the surface i couldnt guess whether she was strong enough to get through this i said if you cant do it leave word when can you join us if im not on the same ship go to carlos ill get to you soonest youd better have one tanj of a good story for me when you do sharrol said and then a head came into view reflected in the glass with my head still turned away i flicked off the phone my back blocking the action and wiggled out my pocket phone it was him square face thin blond hair jaw like a prey turde muscles rippling under the shirt he was puffing a little ander was born of earth and hed kept a flatlanders wild taste in dress and appearance today his drawstring pants were a miracle of wriggling colored lines he wore a tunic in solid colors green and brown with a jagged black line across chest and back classical cartoon characters kept peeking over the black line chattering to each other about what they saw then dropping back he wore a backpurse disappointingly drab he was taking his time looking puzzled but determined coming right at me so i let him see me pocket my unused phone as i turned and stepped out of the booth and right into him i yelped aghh sorry beowulf how youve changed he looked me over visibly shocked blocking me in the booth i shied back wimp intimidated by a street thug a bit offended and a bit afraid sorry man i didnt mean to nudge you he stepped forward and took my hand in both of his despite lack of encouragement and pumped it and hung on he bellowed over the crowd noise ander smittarasheed we made two travelogue vids together beowulf all i can say is you must have a hell of a tale to tell he had no doubts he knew me i said hide hell of a tale to hide ander not anymore i shouted yeah right are you with anyone no on my own come watch the game with me i think theres an empty seat next to mine thered better be he was still staring whatever hed known whatever had brought him here he hadnt expected what he was seeing i hugged that thought to me he was seeing me for the first time in twelve years i dared to hope that ander hadnt prepared for this meeting there was no backup just him as we passed the booths his hand closed on my upper arm he might not think it likely that id dive into a transfer booth and vanish but he wasnt risking it he shouted why a phone booth to use a pocket phone and i showed myself astonished at his stupidity and bellowed noise then the crowd roar drowned out any hope of conversation we moved onto the slidebridge and i had a few moments to think theres only one spaceport on we made it and the ships dont land every day some of us kids used to watch them take off and land im the only one who became a pilot what i noticed about the tourists was muscle i wasnt undermuscled for a local some of the tourists hailed from worlds no more massive than mine but we got jinxians and flatlanders too they walked like they expected us to shy away from their moving mass we tall narrow fragile crashlander men and women did as they expected and resented it a little nakamura lines ran their ships at one earth gravity i had to train hard just to walk around on my own ship thus trained i was a superbly muscled athlete by we made it standards it was still true that too many passengers looked at my albino pallor and tall skeletal frame and saw a sickly ghoul id gotten used to that maybe it had left me touchy visceral memory had come flooding back when anders hand closed on my arm like a predators jaws i hadnt known ander well id seen him twice in fourteen years for periods of intense activity of a few weeks each now i needed a story to tell to ander smittarasheed but what i remembered best was that id disliked him on sight sharrols seat was empty ander settled into it you really like these water wars what guild do you favor no ander its not like that youve seen my homeworld theres only one ocean on we made it and its all one storm nobody swims so what are we doing here i had come here following a womans whim but ander shouldnt know that i dont care who wins i just get a kick out of watching how good they are but id listened to enough of sharrols prattling water war derived from a game the kzinti played on the continent on land in both forms the game is local to fafnir no offworld tourist would know of it i need only open my mouth and let sharrol speak they all swim like dolphins dont they but the dolphins cant grab the prey they can only push the other players around except that the structure team dolphin has hands its an option but the rig is slowing her down can you tell do you know anything about strategy theyre down to seven teams looks like i saw that he was only waiting for me to stop talking ander what are you doing on fafnir looking for you yeah i always thought so youre with the united nations police i need not pretend to like it ander frowned not exactly im not an arm im with sigmund ausfaller and sigmund is an arm but he has his own agenda by which i mean to say im not here to bring you back beowulf thats good i dont want to go back i didnt have my story yet but it would not include wanting to return to earth why then can you tell me what happened to feather filip its long and ugly no problem ill take you to dinner thanks it might help me now or later if ander thought i was short of money better yet theres an item of great value involved ander one i cant touch myself that and feather and the way i look theyre all linked yes good he said absently and though he never said so to me sigmund may have wanted you to know that if you outsmarted the arm you did not outsmart sigmund i expect he did anything else oh yes i got into this because we were talking about piersons puppeteers sigmund and i decided that you beowulf shaeffer know as much about these aliens as any arm hah were you sober and then we worked out where you must be no not sober then but we talked the next morning and didnt change our minds beowulf how did you first learn of the puppeteers school and the holo cube we watched a lot of travelogues when we were kids and we hung around the spaceport so i knew they make the general products ships and your first contact we wrote that up together oh tanj ander youre recording arent you he said yes giving me an instant to object daring me who was he recording for who was involved in hunting beowulf shaeffer if it was sigmund ausfaller id never outguessed sigmund yet ander said well pay you a consultants fee ten per hour beowulf will you accept how many hours do you need it was generous but my yes would be a verbal contract id be his prisoner he waved it off until midnight then we can renegotiate i need the recording for sigmund ouch until midnight i said present time being ten to noon local your first contact with piersons puppeteers fifteen years flying passengers between the worlds then nakamura lines collapsed and i was on the street on we made it because the bankruptcy courts allowed us transport home two years later i was ready to accept an offer from anyone anyone neutron star the skydiver dropped out of hyperspace an even million miles above the neutron star i needed a minute to place myself against the stellar background and another to find the distortion sonya laskin had mentioned before she died it was to my left an area the apparent size of the earths moon i swung the ship around to face it curdled stars muddled stars stars that had been stirred with a spoon the neutron star was in the center of course though i couldnt see it and hadnt expected to it was only eleven miles across and cool a billion years had passed since bvs had burned by fusion fire millions of years at least since the cataclysmic two weeks during which bvs was an xray star burning at a temperature of five billion degrees kelvin now it showed only by its mass the ship began to turn by itself i felt the pressure of the fusion drive without help from me my faithful metal watchdog was putting me in a hyperbolic orbit that would take me within one mile of the neutron stars surface twentyfour hours to fall twentyfour hours to rise and during that time something would try to kill me as something had killed the laskins the same type of autopilot with the same program had chosen the laskins orbit it had not caused their ship to collide with the star i could trust the autopilot i could even change its program i really ought to how did i get myself into this hole the drive went off after ten minutes of maneuvering my orbit was established in more ways than one i knew what would happen if i tried to back out now all id done was walk into a drugstore to get a new battery for my lighter right in the middle of the store surrounded by three floors of sales counters was the new sinclair intrasystem yacht id come for a battery but i stayed to admire it was a beautiful job small and sleek and streamlined and blatantly different from anything thatd ever been built i wouldnt have flown it for anything but i had to admit it was pretty i ducked my head through the door to look at the control panel you never saw so many dials when i pulled my head out all the customers were looking in the same direction the place had gone startlingly quiet i cant blame them for staring a number of aliens were in the store mainly shopping for souvenirs but they were staring too a puppeteer is unique imagine a headless threelegged centaur wearing two cecil the seasick sea serpent puppets on its arms and youll have something like the right picture but the arms are weaving necks and the puppets are real heads flat and brainless with wide flexible lips the brain is under a bony hump set between the bases of the necks this puppeteer wore only its own coat of brown hair with a mane that extended all the way up its spine to form a thick mat over the brain im told that the way they wear the mane indicates their status in society but to me it could have been anything from a dockworker to a jeweler to the president of general products i watched with the rest as it came across the floor not because id never seen a puppeteer but because there is something beautiful about the dainty way they move on those slender legs and tiny hooves i watched it come straight toward me closer and closer it stopped a foot away looked me over and said you are beowulf shaeffer former chief pilot for nakamura lines its voice was a beautiful contralto with not a trace of accent a puppeteers months are not only the most flexible speech organs around but also the most sensitive hands the tongues are forked and pointed the wide thick lips have little fingerlike knobs along the rims imagine a watchmaker with a sense of taste in his fingertips i cleared my throat thats right it considered me from two directions you would be interested in a highpaying job id be fascinated by a highpaying job i am our equivalent of the regional president of general products please come with me and we will discuss this elsewhere i followed it into a displacement booth eyes followed me all the way it was embarrassing being accosted in a public drugstore by a twoheaded monster maybe the puppeteer knew it maybe it was testing me to see how badly i needed money my need was great eight months had passed since nakamura lines had folded for some time before that i had been living very high on the hog knowing that my back pay would cover my debts i never saw that back pay it was quite a crash nakamura lines respectable middleaged businessmen took to leaving their hotel windows without their lift belts me i kept spending if id started living frugally my creditors would have done some checking and id have ended in debtors prison the puppeteer dialed thirteen fast digits with its tongue a moment later we were elsewhere air puffed out when i opened the booth door and i swallowed to pop my ears we are on the roof of the general products building the rich contralto voice thrilled along my nerves and i had to remind myself that it was an alien speaking not a lovely woman you must examine this spacecraft while we discuss your assignment i stepped outside a little cautiously but it wasnt the windy season the roof was at ground level thats the way we build on we made it maybe it has something to do with the fifteenhundredmileanhour winds we get in summer and winter when the planets axis of rotation runs through its primary procyon the winds are our planets only tourist attraction and it would be a shame to slow them down by planting skyscrapers in their path the bare square concrete roof was surrounded by endless square miles of desert not like the deserts of other inhabited worlds but an utterly lifeless expanse of fine sand just crying to be planted with ornamental cactus weve tried that the wind blows the plants away the ship lay on the sand beyond the roof it was a no general products hull a cylinder three hundred feet long and twenty feet through pointed at both ends and with a slight waspwaist constriction near the tail for some reason it was lying on its side with the landing shocks still folded in at the tail ever notice how all ships have begun to look the same a good ninetyfive percent of todays spacecraft are built around one of the four general products hulls its easier and safer to build that way but somehow all ships end as they began massproduced lookalikes the hulls are delivered fully transparent and you use paint where you feel like it most of this particular hull had been left transparent only the nose had been painted around the lifesystem there was no major reaction drive a series of retractable attitude jets had been mounted in the sides and the hull was pierced with smaller holes square and round for observational instruments i could see them gleaming through the hull the puppeteer was moving toward the nose but something made me turn toward the stern for a closer look at the landing shocks they were bent behind the curved transparent hull panels some tremendous pressure had forced the metal to flow like warm wax back and into the pointed stem what did this i asked we do not know we wish strenuously to find out what do you mean have you heard of the neutron star bvs i had to think a moment first neutron star ever found and so far the only someone located it two years ago by stellar displacement bvs was found by the institute of knowledge on jinx we learned through a gobetween that the institute wished to explore the star they needed a ship to do it they had not yet sufficient money we offered to supply them with a ships hull with the usual guarantees if they would turn over to us all data they acquired through using our ship sounds fair enough i didnt ask why they hadnt done their own exploring like most sentient vegetarians puppeteers find discretion to be the only part of valor two humans named peter laskin and sonya laskin wished to use the ship they intended to come within one mile of the surface in a hyperbolic orbit at some point during their trip an unknown force apparently reached through the hull to do this to the landing shocks the unknown force also seems to have killed the pilots but thats impossible isnt it you see the point come with me the puppeteer trotted toward the bow i saw the point all right nothing but nothing can get through a general products hull no kind of electromagnetic energy except visible light no kind of matter from the smallest subatomic particle to the fastest meteor thats what the companys advertisements claim and the guarantee backs them up ive never doubted it and ive never heard of a general products hull being damaged by a weapon or by anything else on the other hand a general products hull is as ugly as it is functional the puppeteerowned company could be badly hurt if it got around that something could get through a company hull but i didnt see where i came in we rode an escalladder into the nose the lifesystem was in two compartments here the laskins had used heatreflective paint in the conical control cabin the hull had been divided into windows the relaxation room behind it was a windowless reflective silver from the back wall of the relaxation room an access tube ran aft opening on various instruments and the hyperdrive motors there were two acceleration couches in the control cabin both had been torn loose from their mountings and wadded into the nose like so much tissue paper crushing the instrument panel the backs of the crumpled couches were splashed with rust brown flecks of the same color were all over everything the walls the windows the viewscreens it was as if something had hit the couches from behind something like a dozen paintfilled toy balloons striking with tremendous force thats blood i said that is correct human circulatory fluid twentyfour hours to fall i spent most of the first twelve hours in the relaxation room trying to read nothing significant was happening except that a few times i saw the phenomenon sonya laskin had mentioned in her last report when a star went directly behind the invisible bvs a halo formed bvs was heavy enough to bend light around it displacing most stars to the sides but when a star went directly behind the neutron star its light was displaced to all sides at once result a tiny circle which flashed once and was gone almost before the eye could catch it id known next to nothing about neutron stars the day the puppeteer picked me up now i was an expert and i still had no idea what was waiting for me when i got down there all the matter youre ever likely to meet will be normal matter composed of a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons in quantum energy states in the heart of any star there is a second kind of matter for there the tremendous pressure is enough to smash the electron shells the result is degenerate matter nuclei forced together by pressure and gravity but held apart by the mutual repulsion of the more or less continuous electron gas around them the tight circumstances may create a third type of matter given a burnedout white dwarf with a mass greater than times the mass of the sun chandrasekhars limit named for an indianamerican astronomer of the s in such a mass the electron pressure alone would not be able to hold the electrons back from the nuclei electrons would be forced against protons to make neutrons in one blazing explosion most of the star would change from a compressed mass of degenerate matter to a closely packed lump of neutrons neutronium theoretically the densest matter possible in this universe most of the remaining normal and degenerate matter would be blown away by the liberated heat for two weeks the star would give off x rays as its core temperature dropped from five billion degrees kelvin to five hundred million after that it would be a lightemitting body perhaps ten to twelve miles across the next best thing to invisible it was not strange that bvs was the first neutron star ever found neither is it strange that the institute of knowledge on jinx would have spent a good deal of time and trouble looking until bvs was found neutronium and neutron stars were only theories the examination of an actual neutron star could be of tremendous importance neutron stars might give us the key to true gravity control mass of bvs times the mass of sol approx diameter of bvs eleven miles of neutronium covered by half a mile of degenerate matter covered by maybe twelve feet of ordinary matter nothing else was known of the tiny hidden star until the laskins went in to look now the institute knew one thing more the stars spin a mass that large can distort space by its rotation said the puppeteer the laskins projected hyperbola was twisted across itself in such a way that we can deduce the stars period of rotation to be two minutes twentyseven seconds the bar was somewhere in the general products building i dont know just where and with the transfer booths it doesnt matter i kept staring at the puppeteer bartender naturally only a puppeteer would be served by a puppeteer bartender since any biped lifeform would resent knowing that his drink had been made with somebodys mouth i had already decided to get dinner somewhere else i see your problem i said your sales will suffer if it gets out that something can reach through one of your hulls and smash a crew to bloody smears but where do i come in we want to repeat the experiment of sonya laskin and peter laskin we must find with me yes we must find out what it is that our hulls cannot stop naturally you may but i wont we are prepared to offer one million stars i was tempted but only for a moment forget it naturally you will be allowed to build your own ship starting with a no general products hull thanks but id like to go on living you would dislike being confined i find that we made it has reestablished the debtors prison if general products made public your accounts now just a you owe money on the close order of five hundred thousand stars we will pay your creditors before you leave if you return i had to admire the creatures honesty in not saying when we will pay you the residue you may be asked to speak to news commentators concerning the voyage in which case there will be more stars you say i can build my own ship naturally this is not a voyage of exploration we want you to return safely its a deal i said after all the puppeteer had tried to blackmail me what happened next would be its own fault they built my ship in two weeks flat they started with a no general products hull just like the one around the institute of knowledge ship and the lifesystem was practically a duplicate of the laskins but there the resemblance ended there were no instruments to observe neutron stars instead there was a fusion motor big enough for a jinx warliner in my ship which i now called skydiver the drive would produce thirty gees at the safety limit there was a laser cannon big enough to punch a hole through we made its moon the puppeteer wanted me to feel safe and now i did for i could fight and i could run especially i could run i heard the laskins last broadcast through half a dozen times their unnamed ship had dropped out of hyperspace a million miles above bvs gravity warp would have prevented their getting closer in hyperspace while her husband was crawling through the access tube for an instrument check sonya laskin had called the institute of knowledge we cant see it yet not by naked eye but we can see where it is every time some star or other goes behind it theres a little ring of light just a minute peters ready to use the telescope then the stars mass had cut the hyperspatial link it was expected and nobody had worried then later the same effect must have stopped them from escaping from whatever attacked them into hyperspace when wouldbe rescuers found the ship only the radar and the cameras were still running they didnt tell us much there had been no camera in the cabin but the forward camera gave us for one instant a speedblurred view of the neutron star it was a featureless disk the orange color of perfect barbecue coals if you know someone who can afford to burn wood this object had been a neutron star a long time therell be no need to paint the ship i told the president you should not make such a trip with the walls transparent you would go insane im no flatlander the mindwrenching sight of naked space fills me with mild but waning interest i want to know nothings sneaking up behind me the day before i left i sat alone in the general products bar letting the puppeteer bartender make me drinks with his mouth he did it well puppeteers were scattered around the bar in twos and threes with a couple of men for variety but the drinking hour had not yet arrived the place felt empty i was pleased with myself my debts were all paid not that that would matter where i was going i would leave with not a minicredit to my name with nothing but the ship all told i was well out of a sticky situation i hoped id like being a rich exile i jumped when the newcomer sat down across from me he was a foreigner a middleaged man wearing an expensive nightblack business suit and a snowwhite asymmetrical beard i let my face freeze and started to get up sit down mr shaeffer why he told me by showing me a blue disk an earth government ident i looked it over to show i was alert not because id know an ersatz from the real thing my name is sigmund ausfaller said the government man i wish to say a few words concerning your assignment on behalf of general products i nodded not saying anything a record of your verbal contract was sent to us as a matter of course i noticed some peculiar things about it mr shaeffer will you really take such a risk for only five hundred thousand stars im getting twice that but you only keep half of it the rest goes to pay debts then there are taxes but never mind what occurred to me was that a spaceship is a spaceship and yours is very well armed and has powerful legs an admirable fighting ship if you were moved to sell it but it isnt mine there are those who would not ask on canyon for example or the isolationist party of wunderland i said nothing or you might be planning a career of piracy a risky business piracy and i dont take the notion seriously i hadnt even thought about piracy but id have to give up on wunderland what i would like to say is this mr shaeffer a single entrepreneur if he were sufficiently dishonest could do terrible damage to the reputation of all human beings everywhere most species find it necessary to police the ethics of their own members and we are no exception it occurred to me that you might not take your ship to the neutron star at all that you would take it elsewhere and sell it the puppeteers do not make invulnerable war vessels they are pacifists your skydiver is unique hence i have asked general products to allow me to install a remotecontrol bomb in the skydiver since it is inside the hull the hull cannot protect you i had it installed this afternoon now notice if you have not reported within a week i will set off the bomb there are several worlds within a weeks hyperspace flight of here but all recognize the dominion of earth if you flee you must leave your ship within a week so i hardly think you will land on a nonhabitable world clear clear if i am wrong you may take a liedetector test and prove it then you may punch me in the nose and i will apologize handsomely i shook my head he stood up bowed and left me sitting there cold sober four films had been taken from the laskins cameras in the time left to me i ran through them several times without seeing anything out of the way if the ship had run through a gas cloud the impact could have killed the laskins at perihelion they were moving at better than half the speed of light but there would have been friction and i saw no sign of heating in the films if something alive had attacked them the beast was invisible to radar and to an enormous range of light frequencies if the attitude jets had fired accidentally i was clutching at straws the light showed on none of the films there would be savage magnetic forces near bvs but that couldnt have done any damage no such force could penetrate a general products hull neither could heat except in special bands of radiated light bands visible to at least one of the puppeteers alien customers i hold adverse opinions on the general products hull but they all concern the dull anonymity of the design or maybe i resent the fact that general products holds a near monopoly on spacecraft hulls and isnt owned by human beings but if id had to trust my life to say the sinclair yacht id seen in the drugstore id have chosen jail jail was one of my three choices but id be there for life ausfaller would see to that or i could run for it in the skydiver but no world within reach would have me if i could find an undiscovered earthlike world within a week of we made it fat chance i preferred bvs i thought that flashing circle of light was getting bigger but it flashed so seldom i couldnt be sure bvs wouldnt show even in my telescope i gave that up and settled for just waiting waiting i remembered a longago summer spent on jinx there were days when unable to go outside because a dearth of clouds had spread the land with raw bluewhite sunlight we amused ourselves by filling party balloons with tap water and dropping them on the sidewalk from three stories up they made lovely splash patterns which dried out too fast so we put a little ink in each balloon before filling it then the patterns stayed sonya laskin had been in her chair when the chairs had collapsed blood samples showed that it was peter who had struck them from behind like a water balloon dropped from a great height what could get through a general products hull ten hours to fall i unfastened the safety net and went for an inspection tour the access tunnel was three feet wide just right to push through in freefall below me was the length of the fusion tube to the left the laser cannon to the right a set of curved side tubes leading to inspection points for the gyros the batteries and generator the air plant the hyperspace shunt motors all was in order except me i was clumsy my jumps were always too short or too long there was no room to turn at the stern end so i had to back fifty feet to a side tube six hours to go and still i couldnt find the neutron star probably i would see it only for an instant passing at better than half the speed of light already my speed must enormous were the stars turning blue two hours to go and i was sure they were turning blue was my speed that high then the stars behind should be red machinery blocked the view behind me so i used the gyros the ship turned with peculiar sluggishness and the stars behind were blue not red all around me were bluewhite stars imagine light falling into a savagely steep gravitational well it wont accelerate light cant move faster than light but it can gain in energy in frequency the light was falling on me harder and harder as i dropped i told the dictaphone about it that dictaphone was probably the bestprotected item on the ship i had already decided to earn my money by using it just as if i expected to collect privately i wondered just how intense the light would get skydiver had drifted back to vertical with its axis through the neutron star but now it faced outward id thought i had the ship stopped horizontally more clumsiness i used the gyros again the ship moved mushily until it was halfway through the swing then it seemed to fall automatically into place it was as if the skydiver preferred to have its axis through the neutron star i didnt like that i tried the maneuver again and again the skydiver fought back but this time there was something else something was pulling at me so i unfastened my safety net and fell headfirst into the nose the pull was light about a tenth of a gee it felt more like sinking through honey than falling i climbed back into my chair tied myself in with the net now hanging facedown and turned on the dictaphone i told my story in such nitpicking detail that my hypothetical listeners could not but doubt my hypothetical sanity i think this is what happened to the laskins i finished if the pull increases ill call back think i never doubted it this strange gentle pull was inexplicable something inexplicable had killed peter and sonya laskin qed around the point where the neutron star must be the stars were like smeared dots of oil paint smeared radially they glared with an angry painful light i hung facedown in the net and tried to think it was an hour before i was sure the pull was increasing and i still had an hour to fall something was pulling on me but not on the ship no that was nonsense what could reach out to me through a general products hull it must be the other way around something was pushing on the ship pushing it off course if it got worse i could use the drive to compensate meanwhile the ship was being pushed away from bvs which was fine by me but if i was wrong if the ship was not somehow being pushed away from bvs the rocket motor would send the skydiver crashing mito eleven miles of neutronium and why wasnt the rocket already firing if the ship was being pushed off course the autopilot should be fighting back the accelerometer was in good order it had looked fine when i had made my inspection tour down the access tube could something be pushing on the ship and on the accelerometer but not on me it came down to the same impossibility something that could reach through a general products hull to hell with theory said i to myself said i im getting out of here to the dictaphone i said the pull has increased dangerously im going to try to alter my orbit of course once i turned the ship outward and used the rocket id be adding my own acceleration to the xforce it would be a strain but i could stand it for a while if i came within a mile of bvs id end like sonya laskin she must have waited facedown in a net like mine waited without a drive unit waited while the pressure rose and the net cut into her flesh waited until the net snapped and dropped her into the nose to lie crushed and broken until the xforce tore the very chairs loose and dropped them on her i hit the gyros the gyros werent strong enough to turn me i tried it three times each time the ship rotated about fifty degrees and hung there motionless while the whine of the gyros went up and up released the ship immediately swung back to position i was nose down to the neutron star and i was going to stay that way half an hour to fall and the xforce was over a gee my sinuses were in agony my eyes were ripe and ready to fall out i dont know if i could have stood a cigarette but i didnt get the chance my pack of fortunados had fallen out of my pocket when i had dropped into the nose there it was four feet beyond my fingers proof that the xforce acted on other objects besides me fascinating i couldnt take any more if it dropped me shrieking into the neutron star i had to use the drive and i did i ran the thrust up until i was approximately in freefall the blood which had pooled in my extremities went back where it belonged the gee dial registered one point two gee i cursed it for a lying robot the soft pack was bobbing around in the nose and it occurred to me that a little extra nudge on the throttle would bring it to me i tried it the pack drifted toward me and i reached and like a sentient thing it speeded up to avoid my clutching hand i snatched at it again as it went past my ear and again it was moving too fast that pack was going at a hell of a clip considering that here i was practically in freefall it dropped through the door to the relaxation room still picking up speed blurred and vanished as it entered the access tube seconds later i heard a solid thump but that was crazy already the xforce was pulling blood into my face i pulled my lighter out held it at arms length and let go it fell gently into the nose but the pack of fortunados had hit like id dropped it from a building well i nudged the throttle again the mutter of fusing hydrogen reminded me that if i tried to keep this up all the way i might well put the general products hull to its toughest test yet smashing it into a neutron star at half lightspeed i could see it now a transparent hull containing only a few cubic inches of dwarfstar matter wedged into the tip of the nose at one point four gee according to that lying gee dial the lighter came loose and drifted toward me i let it go it was clearly falling when it reached the doorway i pulled the throttle back the loss of powerjerked me violently forward but i kept my face turned the lighter slowed and hesitated at the entrance to the access tube decided to go through i cocked my ears for the sound then jumped as the whole ship rang like a gong and the accelerometer was right at the ships center of mass otherwise the ships mass would have thrown the needle off the puppeteers were fiends for tendecimalpoint accuracy i favored the dictaphone with a few fast comments then got to work reprogramming the autopilot luckily what i wanted was simple the xforce was but an xforce to me but now i knew how it behaved i might actually live through this the stars were fiercely blue warped to streaked lines near that special point i thought i could see it now very small and dim and red but it might have been imagination in twenty minutes id be rounding the neutron star the drive grumbled behind me in effective freefall i unfastened the safety net and pushed myself out of the chair a gentle push aft and ghostly hands grasped my legs ten pounds of weight hung by my fingers from the back of the chair the pressure should drop fast id programmed the autopilot to reduce the thrust from two gees to zero during the next two minutes all i had to do was be at the center of mass in the access tube when the thrust went to zero something gripped the ship through a general products hull a psychokinetic lifeform stranded on a sun twelve miles in diameter but how could anything alive stand such gravity something might be stranded in orbit there is life in space outsiders and sailseeds and maybe others we havent found yet for all i knew or cared bvs itself might be alive it didnt matter i knew what the xforce was trying to do it was trying to pull the ship apart there was no pull on my fingers i pushed aft and landed on the back wall on bent legs i knelt over the door looking aft down when freefall came i pulled myself through and was in the relaxation room looking down forward into the nose gravity was changing faster than i liked the xforce was growing as zero hour approached while the compensating rocket thrust dropped the xforce tended to pull the ship apart it was two gees forward at the nose two gees backward at the tail and diminished to zero at the center of mass or so i hoped the pack and lighter had behaved as if the force pulling them had increased for every inch they had moved sternward the back wall was fifteen feet away i had to jump it with gravity changing in midair i hit on my hands bounced away id jumped too late the region of freefall was moving through the ship like a wave as the thrust dropped it had left me behind now the back wall was up to me and so was the access tube under something less than half a gee i jumped for the access tube for one long moment i stared into the threefoot tunnel stopped in midair and already beginning to fall back as i realized that there was nothing to hang on to then i stuck my hands in the tube and spread them against the sides it was all i needed i levered myself up and started to crawl the dictaphone was fifty feet below utterly unreachable if i had anything more to say to general products id have to say it in person maybe id get the chance because i knew what force was trying to tear the ship apart it was the tide the motor was off and i was at the ships midpoint my spreadeagled position was getting uncomfortable it was four minutes to perihelion something creaked in the cabin below me i couldnt see what it was but i could clearly see a red point glaring among blue radial lines like a lantern at the bottom of a well to the sides between the fusion tube and the tanks and other equipment the blue stars glared at me with a light that was almost violet i was aftaid to look too long i actually thought they might blind me there must have been hundreds of gravities in the cabin i could even feel the pressure change the air was thin at this height one hundred fifty feet above the control room and now almost suddenly the red dot was more than a dot my time was up a red disk leapt up at me the ship swung around me i gasped and shut my eyes tight giants hands gripped my arms and legs and head gently but with great firmness and tried to pull me in two in that moment it came to me that peter laskin had died like this hed made the same guesses i had and hed tried to hide in the access tube but hed slipped as i was slipping from the control room came a multiple shriek of tearing metal i tried to dig my feet into the hard tube walls somehow they held when i got my eyes open the red dot was shrinking into nothing the puppeteer president insisted that i be put in a hospital for observation i didnt fight the idea my face and hands were flaming red with blisters rising and i ached as though id been beaten rest and tender loving care that was what i wanted i was floating between a pair of sleeping plates hideously uncomfortable when the nurse came to announce a visitor i knew who it was from her peculiar expression what can get through a general products bull i asked it i hoped you would tell me the president rested on its single back leg holding a stick thatg gave off green incensesmelling smoke and so i will gravity do not play with me beowulf shaeffer this matter is vital im not playing does your world have a moon that information is classified the puppeteers are cowards nobody knows where they come from and nobody is likely to find out do you know what happens when a moon gets too close to its primary it falls apart why i do not know tides what is a tide oho said i to myself said i im going to try to tell you the earths moon is almost two thousand miles in diameter and does not rotate with respect to earth i want you to pick two rocks on the moon one at the point nearest the earth one at the point farthest away very well now isnt it obvious that if those rocks were left to themselves theyd fall away from each other theyre in two different orbits mind you concentric orbits one almost two thousand miles outside the other yet those rocks are forced to move at the same orbital speed the one outside is moving faster good point so there is a force trying to pull the moon apart gravity holds it together bring the moon close enough to earth and those two rocks would simply float away i see then this tide tried to pull your ship apart it was powerful enough in the lifesystem of the institute ship to pull the acceleration chairs out of their mounts and to crush a human being picture it the ships nose was just seven miles from the center of bvs the tail was three hundred feet farther out left to themselves theyd have gone in completely different orbits my head and feet tried to do the same thing when i got close enough i see are you molting what i notice you are losing your outer integument in spots oh that i got a bad sunburn from exposure to starlight its not important two heads stared at each other for an eyeblink a shrug the puppeteer said we have deposited the residue of your pay with the bank of we made it one sigmund ausfaller human has frozen the account until your taxes are computed figures if you will talk to reporters now explaining what happened to the institute ship we will pay you ten thousand stars we will pay cash so that you may use it immediately it is urgent there have been rumors bring em in as an afterthought i added i can also tell them that your world is moonless that should be good for a footnote somewhere i do not understand but two long necks had drawn back and the puppeteer was watching me like a pair of pythons youd know what a tide was if you had a moon you couldnt avoid it would you be interested in a million stars id be fascinated ill even sign a contract if it states what were hiding how do you like being blackmailed for a change ghost two i tried to script the story myself of course there was a computer program that would do it as an interview i made lots of notes too many notes because any time i tried to write text for myself i blocked so i advertised for a ghost ander smittarasheed answered his type was familiar enough he was a gaudy flatlander athlete too aware of the limps and lames around him very aware that any woman was his for the asking it all showed in his words and body language maybe i wouldnt even have hired him but he just pushed into the situation without giving me a chance to react before my caution caught up i was telling him everything nearly everything he turned it into a oneact play between me and the interview program all in one afternoon we spent two days polishing before we filmed it the recording sold instantly to the nets he could write that in itself was amazing i said i couldnt tell you about the blackmail aspect we werent shouting now the undersea dome isnt really glass its something that absorbs shock waves including sound not to mention tsunamis ander smittarasheed grinned at me patronizingly did you think you were putting something over on general products at the time i still dont know for sure maybe i was crazy to think that a spacegoing species wouldnt understand tides maybe but why would they send a human pilot to learn what they already knew mmm ander look at it this way a university team sets out to investigate a cold neutron star they make a mistake probably without informing general products but theyre using a gp hull the ship comes back with the pilots dead in vividly gory fashion general products works out how it happened but theyd rather not be seen as making excuses why not let someone of the same species solve the problem and then talk for them they seem to have had a good deal of faith in you i laughed as if i hadnt a care in the world oh ander i wonder how many times they tried it he thought it over no they showed sigmund your contract they would have had to do that several times yeah beowulf sigmund would not have participated while they killed one pilot after another i said mad bomber sigmund ander i never had any intention of stealing that ship i saw his look but i went on now that could imply that sigmund is a bad judge of character or it could mean that he braced oh a dozen pilots each in turn the odds of one of us stealing a ship get pretty good remember if each of us does our job the hull comes back at the end of the orbit those things cost anders jaw set he said no all right no id try again later beowulf shaeffer is a misunderstood innocent sigmund ausfaller isnt quite trustworthy change the subject or do you mean they trusted me to write my own script i tried that ander you really needed help first neutron star ever discovered he quoted first old cold neutron star good thing hed spotted that embarrassment i said you couldnt dive that close to a pulsar even a gp hull couldnt bash through the accretion disk ive gotten better at explaining things ander i was scampering about inside my head seeking any hole that might offer an escape monitoring a citizen can be easy or cheap or foolproof take your choice ausfaller was backing ander with un money the united nations didnt have authority outside sol system but ander could be using arm funds or equipment but hed seen me on the balcony for the very first time hed sprinted up the slidestairs to intercept me without pausing a moment to call for backup id stake our freedom on that their freedom the un had no claim on me but they might well extradite carlos or sharrol or the children so i was shaping a bribe to offer ander and telling myself that he wasnt too big to be killed if things broke right and hoping that none of that showed at all while i played for time i asked whats your concern with puppeteers theyre harmless theyre cowards are cowards harmless and theyre gone ander smiled at me and you were the one who sent them beowulf why would they deal with you a second time you blackmailed them they dont mind blackmail they use it themselves and what i thought i knew might not be true i caught that smirk again and snapped all right what tides ander said weve been watching their ah retreat the piersons puppeteers understand tides very well beowulf whether or not they ever had a moon all right i believed him and wasnt surprised by the way that information is absolutely proprietary man with a secret hah even so i think they were taking a shot at me when they hired me the second time at the core i i couldnt decide whether to call it a painting a relief mural a sculpture or a hash but it was the prize exhibit in the art section of the institute of knowledge on jinx the kdatlyno must have strange eyes i thought my own were watering the longer i looked at ftlspace the more blurred it got id tentatively decided that it was supposed to look blurred when a set of toothy jaws clamped gently on my arm i jumped a foot in the air a soft thrilling contralto voice said beowulf shaeffer you are a spendthrift that voice would have made a singers fortune and i thought i recognized it but it couldnt be that one was on we made it lightyears distant i turned the puppeteer had released my arm it went on and what do you think of hrodenu hes ruining my eyes naturally the kdatlyno are blind to all but radar ftlspace is not meant to be seen but to be touched run your tongue over it my tongue no thanks i tried running my hand over it if you want to know what it felt like hop a ship for jinx the things still there i flatly refuse to describe the sensation the puppeteer cocked its head dubiously im sure your tongue is more sensitive no guards are nearby forget it you know you sound just like the regional president of general products on we made it it was he who sent me your dossier beowulf shaeffer no doubt we had the same english teacher i am the regional president on jinx as you no doubt recognized from my mane well not quite the auburn mop over the brain case between the two necks is supposed to show caste once you learn to discount variations of mere style to do that you have to be a puppeteer instead of admitting my ignorance i asked did that dossier say i was a spendthrift you have spent more than a million stars in the past four years and loved it yes you will shortly be in debt again have you thought of doing more writing i admired your article on the neutron star bvs the pointy bottom of a gravity well blue starlight fell on me like intangible sleet lovely thanks it paid well too but im mainly a spaceship pilot it is fortunate our meeting here i had thought of having you found do you wish a job that was a loaded question the last and only time i took a job from a puppeteer the puppeteer blackmailed me into it knowing it would probably kill me it almost did i didnt hold that against the regional president of we made it but to let them have another crack at me ill give you a conditional maybe do you have the idea im a professional suicide pilot not at all if i show details do you agree that the information shall be confidential i do i said formally knowing it would commit me a verbal contract is as binding as the tape its recorded on good come he pranced toward a transfer booth the transfer booth let us out somewhere in jinxs vacuum regions it was night high in the sky sirius b was a painfully bright pinpoint casting vivid blue moonlight on a ragged lunar landscape i looked up and didnt see binary jinxs bloated orange companion planet so we must have been in the farside end but there was something hanging over us a no general products hull is a transparent sphere a thousandodd feet in diameter no bigger ship has been built anywhere in the known galaxy it takes a government to buy one and they are used for colonization projects only but this one could never have been so used it was all machinery our transfer booth stood between two of the landing legs so that the swelling flank of the ship looked down on us as an owl looks down at a mouse an access tube ran through vacuum from the booth to the air lock i said does general products build complete spacecraft nowadays we are thinking of branching out but there are problems from the viewpoint of the puppeteerowned company it must have seemed high time general products makes the hulls for ninetyfive percent of all ships in space mainly because nobody else knows how to build an indestructible hull but theyd made a bad start with this ship the only room i could see for crew cargo or passengers was a few cubic yards of empty space right at the bottom just above the air lock and just big enough for a pilot youd have a hard time selling that i said true do you notice anything else well the hardware that filled the transparent hull was very tightly packed the effect was as if a race of tenmiletall giants had striven to achieve miniaturization i saw no sign of access tubes hence there could be no inspace repairs four reaction motors poked their appropriately huge nostrils through the hull angled outward from the bottom no small attitude jets hence oversized gyros inside otherwise most of it looks like hyperdrive motors but thats silly unless youve thought of a good reason for moving moons around at one time you were a commercial pilot for nakamura lines how long was the run from jinx to we made it twelve days if nothing broke down just long enough to get to know the prettiest passenger aboard while the autopilot did everything for me but wear my uniform sirius to procyon is a distance of four lightyears our ship would make the trip in five minutes youve lost your mind no but that was almost a lightyear per minute i couldnt visualize it then suddenly i did visualize it and my mouth fell open for what i saw was the galaxy opening before me we know so little beyond our own small neighborhood of the galaxy but with a ship like that thats goddamn fast as you say but the equipment is bulky as you note it cost seven billion stars to build that ship discounting centuries of research but it will move only one man as is the ship is a failure shall we go inside ii the lifesystem was two circular rooms one above the other with a small air lock to one side the lower room was the control room with banks of switches and dials and blinking lights dominated by a huge spherical mass pointer the upper room was bare walls transparent through which i could see air and foodproducing equipment this will be the relaxroom said the puppeteer we decided to let the pilot decorate it himself why me let me further explain the problem the puppeteer began to pace the floor i hunkered down against the wall and watched watching a puppeteer move is a pleasure even in jinxs gravity the deerlike body seemed weightless the tiny hooves tapping the floor at random the human sphere of colonization is some thirty lightyears across is it not maximum its not exactly a sphere the puppeteer region is much smaller the kdatlyno sphere is half the size of yours and the kzinti is fractionally larger these are the important spacetraveling species we must discount the outsiders since they do not use ships some spheres coincide naturally travel from one sphere to another is nearly nil except for ourselves since our sphere of influence extends to all who buy our hulls but add all these regions and you have a region sixty lightyears across this ship could cross it in seventyfive minutes allow six hours for takeoff and six for landing assuming no traffic snarls near the world of destination and we have a ship which can go anywhere in thirteen hours but nowhere in less than twelve carrying one pilot and no cargo costing seven billion stars how about exploration we puppeteers have no taste for abstract knowledge and how should we explore meaning that whatever race flew the ship would gain the advantages thereby a puppeteer wouldnt risk his necks by flying it himself what we need is a great deal of money and a gathering of intelligences to design something which may go slower but must be less bulky general products does not wish to spend so much on something that may fail we will require the best minds of each sentient species and the richest investors beowulf shaeffer we need to attract attention a publicity stunt yes we wish to send a pilot to the center of the galaxy and back ye gods will it go that fast it would require some twentyfive days to reach the center and an equal time to return you can see the reasoning behind its perfect you dont need to spell it out why me we wish you to make the trip and then write of it i have a list of pilots who write those i have approached have been reluctant they say that writing on the ground is safer than testing unknown ships i follow their reasoning me too will you go what am i offered one hundred thousand stars for the trip fifty thousand to write the story in addition to what you sell it for sold from then on my only worry was that my new boss would find out that someone had ghostwritten that neutron star article oh i wondered at first why general products was willing to trust me the first time i worked for them i tried to steal their ship for reasons which seemed good at the time but the ship i now called long shot really wasnt worth stealing any potential buyer would know it was hot and what good would it be to him long shot could have explored a globular cluster but her only other use was publicity sending her to the core was a masterpiece of promotion look it was twelve days from we made it to jinx by conventional craft and twelve hours by long shot whats the difference you spent twelve years saving for the trip but the core ignoring refueling and reprovisioning problems my old ship could have reached the galaxys core in three hundred years no known species had ever seen the core it hid behind layer on layer of tenuous gas and dust clouds you can find libraries of literature on those central stars but they all consist of generalities and educated guesses based on observation of other galaxies like andromeda three centuries dropped to less than a month theres something anyone can grasp and with pictures the lifesystem was finished in a couple of weeks i had them leave the controlroom walls transparent and paint the relaxroom solid blue no windows when they finished i had entertainment tapes and everything it takes to keep a man sane for seven weeks in a room the size of a large closet on the last day the puppeteer and i spoke the final version of my contract i had four months to reach the galaxys center and return the outside cameras would run constantly i was not to interfere with them if the ship suffered a mechanical failure i could return before reaching the center otherwise no there were penalties i took a copy of the tape to leave with a lawyer there is a thing you should know the puppeteer said afterward the direction of thrust opposes the direction of hyperdrive i dont get it the puppeteer groped for words if you turned on the reaction motors and the hyperdrive together the flames would precede your ship through hyperspace i got the picture then ass backward into the unknown with the control room at the ships bottom it made sense to a puppeteer it made sense iii and i was off i went up under two standard gees because i like my comfort for twelve hours i used only the reaction motors it wouldnt do to be too deep in a gravity well when i used a hyperdrive especially an experimental one pilots who do that never leave hyperspace the relaxroom kept me entertained until the bell rang i slipped down to the control room netted myself down against freefall turned off the motors rubbed my hands briskly together and turned the hyperdrive it wasnt quite as id expected i couldnt see out of course when the hyperdrive goes on its like your blind spot expanding to take in all the windows its not just that you dont see anything you forget that theres anything to see if theres a window between the kitchen control bank and your print of dalis spain your eye and mind will put the picture right next to the kitchen bank obliterating the space between it takes getting used to in fact it has driven people insane but that wasnt what bothered me ive spent thousands of manhours in hyperspace i kept my eye on the mass pointer the mass pointer is a big transparent sphere with a number of blue lines radiating from the center the direction of the line is the direction of a star its length shows the stars mass we wouldnt need pilots if the mass pointer could be hooked into an autopilot but it cant dependable as it is accurate as it is the mass pointer is a psionic device it needs a mind to work it id been using mass pointers for so long that those lines were like real stars a star came toward me and i dodged around it i thought that another line that didnt point quite straight ahead was long enough to show dangerous mass so i dodged that put a blue dwarf right in front of me i shifted fast and looked for a throttle i wanted to slow down repeat i wanted to slow down of course there was no throttle part of the puppeteer research project would be designing a throttle a long fuzzy line reached for me a protosun put it this way imagine one of earths freeways you must have seen pictures of them from space a tangle of twisting concrete ribbons empty and abandoned but never torn down some lie broken others are covered with houses people use the later rubberized ones for horseback riding imagine the way one of these must have looked about six oclock on a week night in say groundcars from end to end now lets take all those cars and remove the brakes further lets put governors on the accelerators so that the maximum speeds are between sixty and seventy miles per hour not all the same let something go wrong with all the governors at once so that the maximum speed also becomes the minimum youll begin to see signs of panic ready okay get a radar installed in your car paint your windshield and windows jet black and get out on that freeway it was like that it didnt seem so bad at first the stars kept coming at me and i kept dodging and after a while it settled down to a kind of routine from experience i could tell at a glance whether a star was heavy enough and close enough to wreck me but in nakamura lines id only had to take that glance every six hours or so here i didnt dare look away as i grew fired the near misses came closer and closer after three hours of it i had to drop out the stars had a subtly unfamiliar look with a sudden jar i realized that i was entirely out of known space sirius antares id never recognize them from here i wasnt even sure they were visible i shook it off and called home long shot calling general products long shot calling beowulf shaeffer have i ever told you what a lovely sexy voice you have no is everything going weli im afraid not in fact im not going to make it a pause why not i cant keep dodging these stars forever one of thems going to get me if i keep on much longer the ships just too goddamn fast yes we must design a slower ship i hate to give up that good pay but my eyes feel like peeled onions i ache all over im turning back shall i play your contract for you no why your only legal reason for returning is a mechanical failure otherwise you forfeit twice your pay i said mechanical failure there was a toolbox somewhere in the ship with a harnmer in it i did not mention it before since it did not seem polite but two of the cameras are in the lifesystem we had thought to use films of you for purposes of publicity but i see tell me one thing just one thing when the regional president of we made it sent you my name did he mention that id discovered your planet has no moon yes he did mention that matter you accepted one million stars for your silence he naturally has a recording of the bargain i see so thats why theyd picked beowulf shaeffer wellknown author the tripll take longer than i thought you must pay a penalty for every extra day over four months two thousand stars per day late your voice has acquired an unpleasant grating sound goodbye i went on in every hour i shifted to normal space for a tenminute coffee break i dropped out for meals and i dropped out for sleep twelve hours per ships day i spent traveling and twelve trying to recover it was a losing battle by the end of day two i knew i wasnt going to make the fourmonth limit i might do it in six months forfeiting one hundred and twenty thousand stars leaving me almost where i started serve me right for trusting a puppeteer stars were all around me shining through the floor and between the banked instruments i sucked coffee trying not to think the milky way shone ghostly pale between my feet the stars were thick now theyd get thicker as i approached the core until finally one got me an idea and about time too the golden voice answered immediately beowulf shaeffer theres nobody else here honey look ive thought of something would you send is one of your instruments malfunctioning beowulf shaeffer no they all work fine as far as they go look then what could you possibly have to say that would require my attention honey now is the time to decide do you want revenge or do you want your ship back a small silence then you may speak i can reach the core much faster if i first get into one of the spaces between the arms do we know enough about the galaxy to know where our arm ends i will send to the institute of knowledge to find out good four hours later i was dragged from a deathlike sleep by the ringing of the hyperphone it was not the president but some flunky i remembered calling the puppeteer honey last night tricked by my own exhaustion and that seductive voice and wondered if id hurt his puppeteer feelings he might be a male a puppeteers sex is one of his little secrets the flunky gave me a bearing and distance for the nearest gap between stars it took me another day to get there when the stars began to thin out i could hardly believe it i turned off the hyperdrive and it was true the stars were tens and hundreds of lightyears apart i could see part of the core peeking in a bright rim above the dim flat cloud of mixed dust and stars iv from then on it was better i was safe if i glanced at the mass pointer every ten minutes or so i could forget the rest breaks eat meals and do isometrics while watching the pointers for eight hours a day i slept but during the other sixteen i moved the gap swept toward the core in a narrowing curve and i followed it as a voyage of exploration the trip would have been a fiasco i saw nothing i stayed well away from anything worth seeing stars and dust anomalous wispy clusters shining in the dark of the gap invisible indications that might have been stars my cameras picked them up from a nice safe distance showing tiny blobs of light in three weeks i moved almost seventeen thousand lightyears toward the core the end of those three weeks was the end of the gap before me was an uninteresting wash of stars backed by a wall of opaque dust clouds i still had thirteen thousand lightyears to go before i reached the center of the galaxyi took some pictures and moved in tenminute breaks mealtimes that grew longer and longer for the rest they gave sleep periods that left my eyes red and burning the stars were thick and the dust was thicker so that the mass pointer showed a blur of blue broken by sharp blue lines the lines began to get less sharp i took breaks every half hour three days of that it was getting near lunchtime on the fourth day i sat watching the mass pointer noting the fluctuations in the blue blur which showed the changing density of the dust around me suddenly it faded out completely great wouldnt it be nice if the mass pointer went out on me but the sharp starlines were still there ten or twenty of them pointing in all directions i went back to steering the clock chimed to indicate a rest period i sighed happily and dropped into normal space the clock showed that i had half an hour to wait for lunch i thought about eating anyway decided against it the routine was all that kept me going i wondered what the sky looked like reflexively looked up so i wouldnt have to look down at the transparent floor that big an expanse of hyperspace is hard even on trained eyes i remembered i wasnt in hyperspace and looked down for a time i just stared then without taking my eyes off the floor i reached for the hyperphone beowulf shaeffer no this is albert einstein i stowed away when the long shot took off and ive decided to turn myself in for the reward giving misinformation is an implicit violation of contract why have you called i can see the core that is not a reason to call it was implicit in your contract that you would see the core damn it dont you care dont you want to know what it looks like if you wish to describe it now as a precaution against accident i will switch you to a dictaphone however if your mission is not totally successful we cannot use your recording i was thinking up a really searing answer when i heard the click great my boss had hooked me into a dictaphone i said one short sentence and hung up the core gone were the obscuring masses of dust and gas a billion years ago they must have been swept up for fuel by the hungry crowded stars the core lay before me like a great jeweled sphere id expected it to be a gradual thing a thick mass of stars thinning out into the arms there was nothing gradual about it a clear ball of multicolored light five or six thousand lightyears across nestled in the heart of the galaxy sharply bounded by the last of the dust clouds i was lightyears from the center the red stars were the biggest and brightest i could actually pick some of them out as individuals the rest was a finger painting in fluorescent green and blue but those red stars they would have sent aldebaran back to kindergarten it was all so bright i needed the telescope to see black between the stars ill show you how bright it was is it night where you are step outside and look at the stars what color are they antares may show red if youre near enough in the system so will mars sirius may show bluish but all the rest are white pinpoints why because its dark your day vision is in color but at night you see black and white like a dog the core suns were bright enough for color vision id pick a planet here not in the core itself but right out here with the core on one side and on the other the dimly starred dust clouds forming their strange convoluted curtain man what a view imagine that flaming jeweled sphere rising in the east hundreds of times as big as binary shows on jinx but without the constant feeling binary gives you the fear that the orange world will fall on you for the vast twinkling core is only starlight lovely and harmless id pick my world now and stake a claim when the puppeteers got their drive fixed up id have the finest piece of real estate in the known universe if i could only find a habitable planet if only i could find it twice hell id be lucky to find my way home from here i shifted into hyperspace and went back to work v an hour and fifty minutes one lunch break and two rest breaks and fifty lightyears later i noticed something peculiar in the core it was even clearer then if not much bigger id passed through the almost transparent wisps of the last dust cloud not too near the center of the sphere was a patch of white bright enough to make the green and blue and red look dull around it i looked for it again at the next break and it was a little brighter it was brighter again at the next break beowulf shaeffer yeah why did you use the dictaphone to call me a cowardly twoheaded monster you were off the line i had to use the dictaphone that is sensible yes we puppeteers have never understood your attitude toward a natural caution my boss was peeved though you couldnt tell from his voice ill go into that if you like but its not why i called explain please im all for caution discretion is the better part of valor and like that you can even be good businessmen because its easier to survive with lots of money but youre so damn concerned with various kinds of survival that you arent even interested in something that isnt a threat nobody but a puppeteer would have turned down my offer to describe the core you forget the kzinti oh the kzinti who expects rational behavior from kzinti you whip them when they attack you reluctantly decide not to exterminate them you wait till they build up their strength and when they attack you whip em again meanwhile you sell them foodstuffs and buy their metals and employ them where you need good games theorists its not as if they were a real threat theyll always attack before theyre ready the kzinti are carnivores where we are interested in survival carnivores are interested in meat alone they conquer because subject peoples can supply them with food they cannot do menial work animal husbandry is alien to them they must have slaves or be barbarians roaming the forests for meat why should they be interested in what you call abstract knowledge why should any thinking being if the knowledge has no chance of showing a profit in practice your description of the core would attract only an omnivore youd make a good case if it were not for the fact that most sentient races are omnivores we have thought long and hard on that ye cats i was going to have to think long and hard on that why did you call beowulf shaeffer oh yeah look i know you dont want to know what the core looks like but i see something that might represent personal danger you have access to information i dont may i proceed you may hah i was learning to think like a puppeteer was that good i told my boss about the blazing strangely shaped white patch in the core when i turned the telescope on it it nearly blinded me grade two sunglasses dont give any details at all its just a shapeless white patch but so bright that the stars in front look like black dots with colored rims id like to know whats causing it it sounds very unusual pause is the white color uniform is the brightness uniform just a sec i used the scope again the color is but the brightness isnt i see dimmer areas inside the patch i think the center is fading out use the telescope to find a nova star there ought to be several in such a large mass of stars i tried it presently i found something a blazing disk of a peculiar bluewhite color with a dimmer somewhat smaller red disk half in front of it that had to be a nova in the core of andromeda galaxy and in what id seen of our own core the red stars were the biggest and brightest ive found one comment a moment more and i saw what he meant its the same color as the patch something like the same brightness too but what could make a patch of supernovas go off all at once you have studied the core the stars of the core are an average of half a lightyear apart they are even closer near the center and no dust clouds dim their brightness when stars are that close they shed enough light on each other to increase materially each others temperature stars burn faster and age faster in the core i see that since the core stars age faster a much greater portion are near the supernova stage than in the arms also all are hotter considering their respective ages if a star were a few millennia from the supemova stage and a supernova exploded half a lightyear away estimate the probabilities they might both blow then the two could set off a third and the three might take a couple more yes since a supernova lasts on the order of one human standard year the chain reaction would soon die out your patch of light must have occurred in this way thats a relief knowing what did it i mean ill take pictures going in as you say click the patch kept expanding as i went in still with no more shape than a veil nebula getting brighter and bigger it hardly seemed fair what i was doing the light which the patch novas had taken fifty years to put out i covered in an hour moving down the beam at a speed which made the universe itself seem unreal at the fourth rest period i dropped out of hyperspace looked down through the floor while the cameras took their pictures glanced away from the patch for a moment and found myself blinded by tangerine afterimages i had to put on a pair of grade one sunglasses out of the packet of twenty which every pilot carries for working near suns during takeoff and landing it made me shiver to think that the patch was still nearly ten thousand lightyears away already the radiation must have killed all life in the core if there ever had been life there my instruments on the hull showed radiation like a solar flare at the next stop i needed grade two sunglasses somewhat later grade three then four the patch became a great bright amoeba reaching twisting tentacles of fusion fire deep into the vitals of the core in hyperspace the sky was jammed bumper to bumper so to speak but i never thought of stopping as the core came closer the patch grew like something alive something needing ever more food i think i knew even then night came the control room was a blaze of light i slept in the relaxroom to the tune of the laboring temperature control morning and i was off again the radiation meter snarled its death song louder during each rest break if id been planning to go outside i would have dropped that plan radiation couldnt get through a general products hull nothing else can either except visible light i spent a bad half hour trying to remember whether one of the puppeteers customers saw xrays i was afraid to call up and ask the mass pointer began to show a faint blue blur gases thrown outward from the patch i had to keep changing sunglasses sometime during the morning of the next day i stopped there was no point in going farther beowulf shaeffer have you become attached to the sound of my voice i have other work than supervising your progress i would like to deliver a lecture on abstract knowledge surely it can wait until your return the galaxy is exploding there was a strange noise then repeat please have i got your attention yes good i think i know the reason so many sentient races are omnivores interest in abstract knowledge is a symptom of pure curiosity curiosity must be a survival trait must we discuss this very well you may well be right others have made the same suggestion including puppeteers but how has our species survived at all you must have some substitute for curiosity increased intelligence maybe youve been around long enough to develop it our hands cant compare with your mouths for tool building if a watchmaker had taste and smell in his hands he still wouldnt have the strength of your jaws or the delicacy of those knobs around your lips when i want to know how old a sentient race is i watch what he uses for hands and feet yes human feet are still adapting to their task of keeping you erect you propose then that our intelligence has grown sufficiently to ensure our survival without depending on your hitormiss method of learning everything you can for the sheer pleasure of learning not quite our method is better if you hadnt sent me to the core for publicity youd never have known about this you say the galaxy is exploding rather it finished exploding some nine thousand years ago im wearing grade twenty sunglasses and its still too bright a third of the core is gone already the patch is spreading at nearly the speed of light i dont see that anything can stop it until it hits the gas clouds beyond the core there was no comment i went on a lot of the inside of the patch has gone out but all of the surface is new novas and remember the light im seeing is nine thousand years old now im going to read you a few instruments radiation two hundred and ten cabin temperature normal but you can hear the whine of the temperature control the mass indicator shows nothing but a blur ahead im turning back radiation two hundred and ten how far are you from the edge of the core about four thousand lightyears i think i can see plumes of incandescent gas starting to form in the near side of the patch moving toward galactic north and south it reminds me of something arent there pictures of exploding galaxies in the institute many yes it has happened before beowulf shaeffer this is bad news when the radiation from the core reaches our worlds it will sterilize them we puppeteers will soon need considerable amounts of money shall i release you from your contract paying you nothing i laughed i was too surprised even to get mad no surely you do not intend to enter the core no look why do you then by the conditions of our contract you forfeit wrong again ill take pictures of these instruments when a court sees the readings on the radiation meter and the blue blur in the mass indicator theyll know somethings wrong with them nonsense under evidence drugs you will explain the readings sure and the court will know you tried to get me to go right to the center of that holocaust you know what theyll say to that but how can a court of law find against a recorded contract me point is theyll want to maybe theyll decide that were both lying and the instruments really did go haywire maybe theyll find a way to say the contract was illegal but theyll find against you want to make a side bet no you have won come back vi the core was a lovely multicolored jewel when it disappeared below the lens of the galaxy id have liked to visit it someday but there arent any time machines id penetrated nearly to the core in something like a month i took my time coming home going straight up along galactic north and flying above the lens where there were no stars to bother me and still made it in two all the way i wondered why the puppeteer had tried to cheat me at the last long shots publicity would have been better than ever yet the regional president had been willing to throw it away just to leave me broke i couldnt ask why because nobody was answering my hyperphone nothing i knew about puppeteers could tell me i felt persecuted my comehither brought me down at the base in the farside end nobody was there i took the transfer booth back to sirius mater jinxs biggest city figuring to contact general products turn over the ship and pick up my pay more surprises awaited me general products had paid stars into my account in the bank of jinx a personal note stated that whether i wrote my article was solely up to me general products has disappeared they are selling no more spacecraft hulls companies with contracts have had their penalty clauses paid off it all happened two months ago simultaneously on all known worlds the bar im in is on the roof of the tallest building in sirius mater more than a mile above the streets even from here i can hear the stock market crashing it started with the collapse of spacecraft companies with no hulls to build ships hundreds of others have followed it takes a long time for an interstellar market to come apart at the seams but as with the core novas i dont see anything that can stop the chain reaction the secret of the indestructible general products hull is being advertised for sale general productss human representatives will collect bids for one year no bid to be less than one trillion stars get in on the ground floor folks nobody knows anything thats whats causing most of the panic its been a month since a puppeteer was seen on any known world why did they drop so suddenly out of interstellar affairs i know in twenty thousand years a flood of radiation will wash over this region of space thirty thousand lightyears may seem a long safe distance but it isnt not with this big an explosion ive asked the core explosion will make this galaxy uninhabitable to any known form of life twenty thousand years is a long time its four times as long as human written history well all be less than dust before things get dangerous and i for one am not going to worry about it but the puppeteers are different theyre scared theyre getting out right now paying off their penalty clauses and buying motors and other equipment to put in their indestructible hulls will take so much money that even confiscating my puny salary would have been a step to the good interstellar business can go to hell from now on the puppeteers will have no time for anything but running where will they go well the galaxy is surrounded by a halo of small globular clusters the ones near the rim might be safe or the puppeteers may even go as far as andromeda they have the long shot for exploring if they come back for it and they can build more outside the galaxy is space empty enough even for a puppeteer pilot if he thinks his species is threatened its a pity this galaxy will be dull without puppeteers those twoheaded monsters were not only the most dependable faction in interstellar business they were like water in a wasteland of more or less humanoids its too bad they arent brave like us but is it i never heard of a puppeteer refusing to face a problem he may merely be deciding how fast to run but hell never pretend the problem isnt there sometime within the next twenty millennia we humans will have to move a population that already numbers fortythree billion how to where when should we start thinking about this when the glow of the core begins to shine through the dust clouds maybe men are the cowards at the core ghost three i said and there you were in sirius mater all ready to write my story for me i guessed then that ausfaller must have sent you both times so why did you hire me i didnt care much the big question was how do i tell the human race about the core explosion how do i make them believe i hoped you were an arm maybe you could do something ander said i should have asked you then theres supposed to be a huge black hole in there millions of solar masses did you see it i shook my head maybe the shell of novas hid it if its there at all maybe it even caused the chain reaction sucking gas and dust and stars for fifteen billion years maybe its mass passed some kind of threshold and boom maybe youd even find it if you processed the recordings i took theyre proprietary ander get them from general products well but theyre gone but he had that smirk again where did you go after that earth after the galactic core what else could measure up ander laughed five teams were fighting over two prey turtles that glowed intermittently among thrashing bodies the crowd was standing yelling their heads off and ander pulled a flat portable out of his backpurse ten inches by ten inches by a quarter inch thick and opened it in my lap he tapped rapidly a picture stood above my lap five bluewhite points rotated against a black background they pulled apart growing slowly brighter coming toward me suddenly they blossomed into blue and white globes the starscape wheeled the spheres went murky red and began to recede ander tapped and the picture froze tiny suns circled four of the globes the fifth glowed of itself as if the continents of a world had caught fire flying planets and nobody around us was looking at anything but the miniature war beyond the glass ander said the puppeteers are still in known space receding at relativistic speeds and they took their planets with them he snapped his portable shut five worlds all about the same size orbiting in a pentagon around each other do the math yourself youll find that you can put a sun at the center or not and the orbits are stable either way they understand tides just fine beowulf thats what they hid from you my mind lurched cowards or not peaceable or not i could see how the traditionally paranoid arm might react to so much sheer brute power what are they like oxygen worlds natural or terraformed how sigmund says weve dropped cameras in their path not too close the system goes flying by at point eight lights we havent learned much free oxygen liquid water fusion light sources redder than sol and we dont know why the odd one looks so odd theres nothing else in the system no asteroids no cometary halo just chains of spacecraft moving between the five worlds where are they going straight north along the galactic axis thats what i did coming back from the core get clear of occupied space and then turn turning five planets could be a bitch well theres nothing but empty space where theyre going maybe thats what they want ander mulled it possible meanwhile weve got to guard them and keep their secret they wont pass all that close to the patriarchy but thats too close its not that they cant defend themselves its that theyre cowards i began to see what he meant free enterprise no species can control all its members if some futzer published their location you could see pirates of every shape and size yes and reporters and news anchors likewise any entrepreneur with a moneymaking offer any undertrained arm out to make a name whole fleets lying in wait for the puppeteer worlds to pass any kind of fool might cause the puppeteer government to defend themselves in some drastic fashion with power like that ander said so we have to stop any passing ships from interfering with the fleet and guard their secret too meanwhile they havent all left there are business matters loose ends being wrapped up i know i had dealings with one of their agents myself he perked up how did that come about i had a complaint about a general products hull again flatlander the most beautiful girl dboard turned out to have a husband with habits so solitary that i didnt know about him until the second week he was about five feet four and middleaged but he wore a hellflare tattoo on his shoulder which meant hed been on kzin during the war thirty years back which meant hed been trained to kill adult kzinti with his bare hands feet elbows knees and whatnot when we found out about each other he very decently gave me a first warning and broke my arm to prove he meant it the arm still ached a day later and every other woman on the lensman was over two hundred years old i drank alone i stared glumly into the mirror behind the curving bar the mirror stared glumly back hey you from we made it what am i he was two chairs down and he was glaring without the beard he would have had a round almost petulant face i think the beard short and black and carefully shaped made him look like a cross between zeus and an angry bulldog the glare went with the beard his square fingers wrapped a large drinking bulb in a death grip a broad belly matched broad shoulders to make him look massive rather than fat obviously he was talking to me i asked what do you mean what are you where am i from earth it was obvious the accent said earth so did the conservatively symmetrical beard his breathing was unconsciously natural in the ships standard atmosphere and his build had been forged at one point zero gee then what am i a flatlander the glare heat increased hed obviously reached the bar way ahead of me a flatlander damn it everywhere i go im flatlander do you know how many hours ive spent in space no long enough to know how to use a drinking bulb funny very funny everywhere in human space a flatlander is a schnook who never gets above the atmosphere everywhere but earth if youre from earth youre a flatlander all your life for the last fifty years ive been running about in human space and what am i a flatlander why earthian is a clumsy term what is wemadeitian he demanded im a crashlander i wasnt born within fifty miles of crashlanding city but im a crashlander anyway that got a grin i think it was hard to tell with the beard lucky youre not a pilot i am was youre kidding they let a crashlander pilot a ship if hes good at it i didnt mean to pique your ire sir may i introduce myself my names elephant beowulf shaeffer he bought me a drink i bought him a drink it turned out we both played gin so we took fresh drinks to a card table when i was a kid i used to stand out at the edge of crashlanding port watching the ships come in id watch the mob of passengers leave the lock and move in a great clump toward customs and id wonder why they seemed to have trouble navigating a majority of the starborn would always walk in weaving lines swaying and blinking teary eyes against the sun i used to think it was because they came from different worlds with different gravities and different atmospheres beneath differently colored suns later i learned different there are no windows in a passenger spacecraft if there were half the passengers would go insane it takes an unusual mentality to watch the blindspot appearance of hyperspace and still keep ones marbles for passengers there is nothing to watch and nothing to do and if you dont like reading sixteen hours a day then you drink its best to drink in company you get less lushed knowing you have to keep up your side of a conversation the ships doc has cured more hangovers than every other operation combined right down to manicures and haircuts the ship grounded at los angeles two days after i met elephant hed made a good drinking partner wed been fairly matched at cards he with his sharp card sense i with my usual luck from the talking wed done we knew almost as much about each other as anyone knows about anyone in a way i was sorry to see him leave youve got my number yeah but like i said i dont know just what ill be doing i was telling the truth when i explore a civilized world i like to make my own discoveries well call me if you get a chance i wish youd change your mind id like to show you earth i decline with thanks goodbye elephant its been fun elephant waved and turned through the natives door i went on to face the smuggler baiters the last drink was still with me but i could cure that at the hotel i never expected to see elephant again nine days ago id been on jinx id been rich and id been depressed the money and the depression had stemmed from the same source the puppeteers those threelegged twoheaded professional cowards and businessmen had lured me into taking a new type of ship all the way to the galactic core thirty thousand light years away the trip was for publicity purposes to get research money to iron out the imperfections in the very ship i was riding i suppose i should have had more sense but i never do and the money was good the trouble was that the core had exploded by the time i got there the core stars had gone off in a chain reaction of novas ten thousand years ago and a wave of radiation was even then sweeping toward known space in just over twenty thousand years well all be in deadly danger youre not worried it didnt bother me much either but every puppeteer in known space vanished overnight heading for finagle knows what other galaxy i was depressed i missed the puppeteers and hated knowing i was responsible for their going i had time and money and a black melancholia to work off and id always wanted to see earth earth smelled good there was a used flavor to it a breathed flavor unlike anything ive ever known it was the difference between spring water and distilled water somewhere in each breath i took were molecules breathed by dante aristotle shakespeare heinlein carter and my own ancestors traces of past industries lingered in the air sensed if not smelled gasoline coal fumes tobacco and burnt cigarette filters diesel fumes ale breweries i left the customs house with inflated lungs and a questing look i could have taken a transfer booth straight to the hotel i decided to walk a little first everyone on earth had made the same decision the pedwalk held a crowd such as i had never imagined they were all shapes and all colors and they dressed in strange and eldritch ways shifting colors assaulted the eye and sent one reeling on any world in human space any world but one you know immediately who the natives are wunderland asymmetrical beards mark the nobility and the common people are the ones who quickly step out of their way we made it the pallor of our skins in summer and winter in spring and fall the fact that we all race upstairs above the buried cities and onto the blooming desert eager to taste sunlight while the murderous winds are at rest jinx the natives are short wide and strong a sweet little old ladys handshake can crush steel even in the belt within the solar system a belter strip haircut adorns both men and women but earth no two looked alike there were reds and blues and greens yellows and oranges plaids and stripes im talking about hair you understand and skin all my life ive used tanninsecretion pills for protection against ultraviolet so that my skin color has varied from its normal pinkishwhite to tuxedo black but id never known that other skindye pills existed i stood rooted to the pedwalk letting it carry me where it would watching the incredible crowd swarm around me they were all knees and elbows tomorrow id have bruises hey the girl was four or five heads away and short id never have seen her if everyone else hadnt been short too fladanders rarely top six feet and there was this girl her hair a topological explosion in swirling orange and silver her face a faint subtle green with spaceblack eyebrows and lipstick waving something and shouting at me waving my wallet i forced my way to her until we were close enough to touch until i could hear what she was saying above the crowd noise stupid wheres your address you dont even have a place for a stamp what she looked startled oh youre an offworlder yeah my voice would give out fast at this noise level well look she shoved her way closer to me look you cant go around town with an offworlders wallet next time someone picks your pocket he may not notice till youre gone you picked my pocket sure think i found it would i risk my precious hand under all those spike heels how if i call a cop cop oh a stoneface she laughed merrily learn or go under man theres no law against picking pockets look around you i looked around me then looked back fast afraid shed disappear not only my cash but my bank of jinx draft for forty thousand stars was in that wallet everything i owned see them all sixtyfour million people in los angeles alone eighteen billion in the whole world suppose there was a law against picking pockets how would you enforce it she deftly extracted the cash from my wallet and handed the wallet back get yourself a new wallet and fast itll have a place for your address and a window for a tenthstar stamp put your address in right away and a stamp too then the next guy who takes it can pull out the money and drop your wallet in the nearest mailbox no sweat otherwise you lose your credit cards your ident everything she stuffed two hundredodd stars in cash between her breasts flashing me a parting smile as she turned thanks i called yes i did i was still bewildered but shed obviously stayed to help me she could just as easily have kept wallet and all no charge she called back and was gone i stopped off at the first transfer booth i saw dropped a half star in the coin slot and dialed elephant the vestibule was intimidating id expected a vestibule why put a transfer booth inside your own home where any burglar can get in just by dialing your number anyone who can afford the lease on a private transfer booth can also afford a vestibule with a locked door and an intercom switch there was a vestibule but it was the size of a living room furnished with massage chairs and an autovendor there was an intercom but it was a flat vidphone three hundred years old restored at perhaps a hundred times its original cost there was a locked door it was a double door of what looked like polished brass with two enormous curved handles and it stood fifteen feet high id suspected elephant was well off but this was too much it occurred to me that id never seen him completely sober that i had in fact turned down his offer of guidance that a sunple morningafter treatment might have wiped me from his memory shouldnt i just go away i had wanted to explore earth on my own but i didnt know the rules i stepped out of the booth and glimpsed the back wall it was all picture window with nothing outside just fleecy blue sky how peculiar i thought and stepped closer and closer elephant lived halfway up a cliff a sheer milehigh cliff the phone rang on the third earjarring ring i answered mainly to stop the noise a supercilious voice asked is somebody out there im afraid not i said does someone named elephant live here ill see sir said the voice the screen had not lit but i had the feeling someone had seen me quite clearly seconds crawled by i was half minded to jump back in the transfer booth and dial at random but only half that was the trouble then the screen lit and it was elephant bey you changed your mind yeah you didnt tell me you were rich you didnt ask well no of course not how do you expect to learn things if you dont ask dont answer that hang on ill be right down you did change your mind youll let me show you earth yes i will im scared to go out there alone why dont answer tell me in person he hung up seconds later the big bronze doors swung back with a boneshaking boom they just barely got out of elephants way he pulled me inside giving me no time to gape shoved a drink in my hand and asked why i was afraid to go outside i told him about the pickpocket and he laughed he told me about the time he tried to go outside during a we made it summer and i laughed though ive heard of outworlders being blown away and to hades doing the same thing amazingly we were off again it was just like it had been on the ship even to the end of elephants anecdote they called me a silly flatlander of course ive been thinking about that i said about what you said youd give a lot to do somediing completely original so the next time someone called you a flatlander you could back him into a corner and force him to listen to your story you said it several times i didnt say just that but i would like to have some story to tell something like your neutron star episode if only to tell myself the silly offworlder wouldnt know but id know i nodded id talked about the neutron star episode over gin cards a habit ive developed for distracting my opponent and elephant had been suitably impressed ive thought of a couple of things you could do i said spill one visit the puppeteer homeworld nobodys been there but everyone knows there is one and everyone knows how difficult it is to find you could be the first great he mused a moment great and the puppeteers wouldnt stop me because theyre gone where is the puppeteer homeworld i dont know whats your second idea ask the outsiders huh theres not a system in the galaxy that the outsiders dont know all about we dont know how far the puppeteer empire extended though it was way beyond known space but we do know about the outsiders they know the galaxy like the palm of their uh and they trade for information its just about the only business they do ask them whats the most unusual world they know of within reach elephant was nodding gently there was a glazed look in his eyes i had not been sure he was serious about seeking some unique achievement he was the problem is i said that an outsiders idea of what is unique may not i stopped because elephant was up and half running to a tridphone i wasnt sorry it gave me an opportunity to gape in private ive been in bigger homes than elephants much bigger i grew up in one but ive never seen a room that soothed the eye as elephants living room did it was more than a living room it was an optical illusion the opposite of those jittering blackandwhite images they show in lectures on how we see these clinical children of op art give the illusion of motion but elephants living room gave the illusion of stillness a physicist would have loved the soundproofing some interior decorator had become famous for his work here if he hadnt been famous already in which case he had become rich how could tall thin beowulf shaeffer fit into a chair designed to the measure of short wide elephant yet i was bonelessly limp blissfully relaxed using only the muscles that held a doublewalled glass of an oddtasting strangely refreshing soft drink called tzlotz beer a glass which would not empty somewhere in the crystal was a tiny transfer motor connected to the bar but the bent light in the crystal hid it another optical illusion and one that must have tricked good men into acute alcoholism id have to watch that elephant returned he walked as if he massed tons as if any kzinti foolish enough to stand in his path would have a short wide hole in him all done he said don cramerll find the nearest outsider ship and make my pitch for me we should hear in a couple of days okay said i and asked him about the cliff it turned out that we were in the rocky mountains and that he owned every square inch of the nearly vertical cliff face why i remembered earths eighteen billion and wondered if theyd otherwise have surrounded him up down and sideways suddenly elephant remembered that someone named dianna must be home by now i followed him into the transfer booth watched him dial eleven digits and waited in a much smaller vestibule while elephant used the more conventional intercom dianna seemed dubious about letting him in until he roared that he had a guest and she should stop fooling around dianna was a small pretty woman with skin the deep uniform red of a martian sky and hair like flowing quicksilver her irises had the same polishedsilver luster she hadnt wanted to let us in because we were both wearing our own skins but she never mentioned it again once we were inside elephant introduced me to dianna and instantly told her hed acted to contact the outsiders whats an outsider she asked elephant gestured with both hands looked confused turned helplessly toward me theyre hard to describe i said think of a catoninetails with a big thick handle they live on cold worlds said elephant small cold airless worlds like nereid they pay rent to use nereid as a base dont they elephant and they travel over most of the galaxy in big unpressurized ships with fusion drives and no hyperdrives they sell information they can tell me about the world i want to find the most unusual planet in known space they spend most of their time tracking starseeds dianna broke in why elephant looked at me i looked at elephant say elephant exclaimed why dont we get a fourth for bridge dianna looked thoughtful then she focused her silver eyes on me examined me from head to foot and nodded gently to herself sharrol janss ill call her while she was phoning elephant told me thats a good thought sharrols got a tendency toward hero worship shes a computer analyst at donovans brains inc youll like her good i said wondering if we were still talking about a bridge game it struck me that i was building up a debt to elephant elephant when you contact the outsiders id like to come along oh why youll need a pilot and ive dealt with outsiders before okay its a deal the intercom rang from the vestibule dianna went to the door and came back with our fourth for bridge sharrol you know elephant this is beowulf shaeffer from we made it bey this is you i said you she said it was the pickpocket my vacation lasted just four days i hadnt known how long it would last though i did know how it would end consequently i threw myself into it body and soul if there was a dull moment anywhere in those four days i slept through it and at that i didnt get enough sleep elephant seemed to feel the same way he was living life to the hilt he must have suspected as i did that the outsiders would not consider danger a factor in choosing his planet by their own ethics they were bound not to the days of elephants life might be running short buried in those four days were incidents that made me wonder why elephant was looking for a weird world surely earth was the weirdest of all i remember when we threw in the bridge hands and decided to go out for dinner this was more complicated than it sounds elephant hadnt had a chance to change to flatlander styles and neither of us was fit to be seen in public dianna had cosmetics for us i succumbed to an odd impulse i dressed as an albino they were body paints not pills when i finished applying them there in the fulllength mirror was my younger self bloodred irises snowwhite hair white skin with a tinge of pink the teenager who had disappeared ages ago when i was old enough to use tannin pills i found my mind wandering far back across the decades to the days when i was a flatlander myself my feet firmly beneath the ground my head never higher than seven feet above the desert sands they found me there before the mirror and pronounced me fit to be seen in public i remember that evening when dianna told me she had known elephant forever i was the one who named him elephant she bragged its a nickname sure said sharrol his real name is gregory pelton oooh suddenly all came clear gregory pelton is known among the stars it is rumored that he owns the thirtylightyearwide rough sphere called human space that he earns his income by renting it out it is rumored that general products the allembracing puppeteer company now defunct for lack of puppeteers is a front for gregory pelton its a fact that his greattodieeighthgrandmother invented the transfer booth and that he is rich rich rich i asked why elephant why that particular nickname dianna and sharrol looked demurely at the tablecloth elephant said use your imagination bey on what whats an elephant some kind of animal three faces registered annoyance id missed a joke tomorrow said elephant well show you the zoo there are seven transfer booths in the zoo of earth thatll tell you how big it is but youre wrong youve forgotten the two hundred taxis on permanent duty theyre there because the booths are too far apart for walking we stared down at dusty compact animals smaller than starseeds or bandersnatchi but bigger than anything else id ever seen elephant said see yeah i said because the animals showed a compactness and a plodding invulnerability very like elephants and then i found myself watching one of the animals in a muddy pool it was using a hollow tentacle over its mouth to spray water on its back i stared at that tentacle and stared hey look sharrol called pointing beys ears are turning red i didnt forgive her till two that morning and i remember reaching over sharrol to get a tabac stick and seeing her purse lying on her other things i said how if i picked your pocket now orange and silver lips parted in a lazy smile im not wearing a pocket would it be in good taste to sneak the money out of your purse only if you could hide it on you i found a small flat purse with four hundred stars in it and stuck it in my mouth she made me go through with it ever make love to a woman with a purse in your mouth unforgettable dont try it if youve got asthma i remember sharrol i remember smooth warm blue skin silver eyes with a wealth of expression orange and silver hair in a swirling abstract pattern that nothing could mess up it always sprang back her laugh was silver too when i gently extracted two handfuls of hair and tied them in a hard double knot and when i gibbered and jumped up and down at the sight of her hair slowly untying itself like medusas locks and her voice was a silver croon i remember the freeways they were the first thing that showed coming in on earth if wed landed at night it would have been the lighted cities but of course we came in on the day side why else would a world have three spaceports there were the freeways and autostradas and autobahns strung in an allenclosing net across the faces of the continents from a few miles up you still cant see the breaks but theyre there where girders and pavement have collapsed only two superhighways are still kept in good repair they are both on the same continent the pennsylvania turnpike and the santa monica freeway the rest of the network is broken chaos it seems there are people who collect old groundcars and race them some are actually renovated machines fifty to ninety percent replaced others are handmade reproductions on a perfectly flat surface theyll do fifty to ninety miles per hour i laughed when elephant told me about them but actually seeing them was different the rodders began to appear about dawn they gathered around one end of the santa monica freeway the end that used to join the san diego freeway this end is a maze of fallen spaghetti great curving loops of prestressed concrete that have lost their strength over the years and sagged to the ground but you can still use the top loop to reach the starting line we watched from above hovering in a cab as the groundcars moved into line their dues cost more than the cars said elephant i used to drive one myself youd turn white as snow if i told you how much it costs to keep this stretch of freeway in repair how much he told me i turned white as snow they were off i was still wondering what kick they got driving an obsolete machine on flat concrete when they could be up here with us they were off weaving slightly weaving more than slightly foolishly moving at different speeds coming perilously close to each other before sheering off and i began to realize things those automobiles had no radar they were being steered with a cabin wheel geared directly to four ground wheels a mistake in steering and theyd crash into each other or into the concrete curbs they were steered and stopped by muscle power but whether they could turn or stop depended on how hard four rubber balloons could grip smooth concrete if the tires lost their grip newtons first law would take over the fragile metal mass would continue moving in a straight line until stopped by a concrete curb or another groundcar a man could get killed in one of those not to worry said elephant nobody does usually usually the race ended twenty minutes later at another tangle of fallen concrete i was wet through we landed and met some of the racers one of them a thin guy with tangled glossy green hair and a bony white face with a widely grinning scarlet mouth offered me a ride i declined with thanks backing slowly away and wishing for a weapon this joker was obviously dangerously insane i remember flatlander food the best in known space and an odd mildly alcoholic drink called taittinger comtes de champagne i remember invading an outworlder bar where the four of us talked shop with a girl rock miner whose inchwide auburn crest of hair fell clear to the small of her back i remember flying crosscountry with a lift belt and seeing nothing but city enclosing widely separated patches of foodgrowing land i remember a submerged hotel off the grand banks of newfoundland and a dolphin embassy off italy where a mixed group of dolphins and flatlanders seemed to be solving the general problem of sentient beings without hands it seemed more a coffeebreak discussion than true business we were about to break up for bed on the evening of the fourth day when the tridphone rang don cramer had found an outsider i said disbelieving youre leaving right now sure said elephant here take one of these pills you wont feel sleepy till were on our way a deal is a deal and i owed elephant plenty i took the pill we kissed sharrol and dianna goodbye dianna standing on a chair to reach me sharrol climbing me like a beanpole and wrapping her legs around my waist i was a foot and a half taller than either of them calcutta base was in daylight elephant and i took the transfer booth there to find that the st had been shipped ahead of us her full name was slower than infinity she had been built into a general products no hull a threehundredfoot spindle with a waspwaist constriction near the tail i was relieved i had been afraid elephant might own a flashy vulnerable dudes yacht the twoman control room looked pretty small for a lifesystem until i noticed the bubble extension folded into the nose the rest of the hull held a onegee fusion drive and fuel tank a hyperspace motor a gravity drag and bellylanding gear all clearly visible through the hull which had been left transparent she held fuel food and air she must have been ready for days we took off twenty minutes after arriving using the fusion drive in earths atmosphere would have gotten us into the organ banks in pieces flatlander laws are strict about air pollution a robot rocket with huge wings lifted us to orbit using air compressed nearly to degenerate matter as a propellant we took off from there now there was plenty of time for sleep it took us a week at one gee just to get far enough out of the solar systems gravity well to use the hyperdrive somewhere in that time i removed my false coloring and elephant turned his skin back to light tan and his beard and hair back to black for four days hed been zeus with marble skin a metalgold beard and glowing moltengold eyes it had fitted him so perfectly that i hardly noticed the change hyperdrive and a long slow three weeks we took turns hovering over the mass indicator though at firstquantum hyperdrive speeds wed have seen a mass at least twelve hours before it became dangerous i think i was the only man who knew there was a second quantum a puppeteer secret the outsider ship was near the edge of known space well beyond tau ceti it was the only one around elephant had said number fourteen fourteen thats the same ship i dealt with before oh good that should help days later he asked howd it happen the usual way number fourteen was on the other side of known space then and she sent out an offer of information exchange i was almost to wunderland and i caught the offer when i dropped my passengers i went back did they have anything worthwhile yah theyd found the lazy eight ii the lazy eight ii had been one of the old slowboats a circularflying wing taking colonists to jinx something had gone wrong before turnover and the ship had continued on carrying fifty passengers in suspended animation and a crew of four presumed dead with a ramscoop to feed hydrogen to her fusion drive she could accelerate forever she was five hundred years on her way i remember said elephant they couldnt reach her no but well know where to find her when the state of the art gets that good which wouldnt be soon i thought a hyperdrive ship not only would have to reach her but would have to carry fuel to match her speed her speed was barely less than a photons and she was more than five hundred lightyears away seventeen times the diameter of known space did you have any problems their translator is pretty good but well have to be careful elephant the thing about buying information is that you dont know what youre getting until youve got it they couldnt just offer to sell me the present position of the lazy eight ii wed have tracked their course by telescope until we saw the light of a fusion drive and gotten the information free the time came when only a small green dot glowed in the center of the mass indicator a star would have shown as a line no star would have shown no dot i dropped out of hyperspace and set the deep radar to hunt out the outsider the outsider found us first somewhere in the cylindrical metal pod near her center of mass perhaps occupying it completely was the reactionless drive it was common knowledge that that drive was for sale and that the cost was a full trillion stars though nobody and no nation now extant could afford to pay it the price was not exorbitant in two or three minutes while we were still searching that drive had dropped the outsider ship from above point nine lights to zero relative and pulled it alongside the st one moment nothing but stars the next the outsider ship was alongside she was mostly empty space i knew her population was the size of a small city but she was much bigger because more strung out there was the minusculeseeming drive capsule and there on a pole two and a half miles long was a light source the rest of the ship was metal ribbons winding in and out swooping giddily around themselves and each other until the ends of each tangled ribbon stopped meandering and joined the drive capsule there were around a thousand such ribbons and each was the width of a wide city pedwalk like a christmas tree decoration said elephant what now bey theyll use the ship radio a few minutes of waiting and here came a bunch of outsiders they looked like black catoninetails with grossly swollen handles in the handles were their brains and invisible sense organs in the whip ends the clusters of motile root tentacles were gas pistols six of them braked to a stop outside the air lock the radio spoke welcome to ship fourteen please step outside for conveyance to our office take nothing on the outsides of your pressure suits elephant asked do we i said sure the outsiders are nothing if not honorable we went out the six outsiders offered us a tentacle each and away we went across open space not fast the thrust from the gas pistols was very low irritatingly weak but the outsiders themselves were weak an hour in the gravity of earths moon would have killed them they maneuvered us through the tangled clutter of silver ribbons landing us on a ramp next to the looming convex wall of the drive capsule it wasnt quite like being lost in a giant bowl of noodles the rigid ribbons were too far apart for that far above us was the light source about as small and intense and yellowishwhite as earths sun seen from a moon of neptune shining down through the interstellar vacuum it cast a network of sharp black shadows across all the thousand looping strands that made up the city along every lightshadow borderline were the outsiders just as their plantlike ancestors had done billions of years ago on some unknown world near the galactic core the outsiders were absorbing life energy their branched tails lay in shadow their heads in sunlight while thermoelectricity charged their biochemical batteries some had root tentacles dipped in shallow food dishes the trace elements which kept them alive and growing were in suspension in liquid helium we stepped carefully around them using our headlamps at lowest intensity following one of the outsiders toward a door in the wall ahead the enclosure was dark until the door closed behind us then the light came on it was sourceless the color of normal sunlight and it illuminated a cubicle that was bare and square the only furnishing was a transparent hemisphere with an outsider resting inside presumably the hemisphere filtered out excess light going in welcome said the room whatever the outsider had said was not sonic in nature the air is breathable take off your helmets suits shoes girdles and whatnot it was an excellent translator with a good grasp of idiom and a pleasant baritone voice thanks said elephant and we did which of you is gregory pelton gronk the wall was not confused according to your agent you want to know how to reach that planet which is most unusual inside or within five miles of the sixtylightyear wide region you call known space is this correct yes we must know if you plan to go there or to send agents there also do you plan a landing a near orbit or a distant orbit landing are we to guard against danger to your life no elephants voice was a little dry the outsider ship was an intimidating place what kind of ship would you use the one outside do you plan colonization mining growth of food plants i plan only one visit we have selected a world for you the price will be one million stars thats high said elephant i whistled under my breath it was and it wouldnt get lower the outsiders never dickered sold said elephant the translator gave us a triplet set of coordinates some twentyfour lightyears from earth along galactic north the star you are looking for is a protosun with one planet a billion and a half miles distant the system is moving at a point eight lights toward he gave a vector direction it seemed the protosun was drawing a shallow chord through known space it would never approach human space no good said elephant no hyperdrive ship can go that fast in real space you could hitch a ride said the translator with us moor your ship to our drive capsule thatll work said elephant he was getting more and more uneasy his eyes seemed to be searching the walls for the source of the voice he would not look at the outsider business agent in the vacuum chamber our ferry fee will be one million stars elephant sputtered just a sec i said i may have information to sell you there was a long pause elephant looked at me in surprise you are beowulf shaeffer yeah you remember me we find you in our records beowulf shaeffer we have information for you already paid the former regional president of general products on jinx wishes you to contact him i have a transferbooth number thats late news i said the puppeteers are gone anyway why would that twoheaded sharpie want to see me i do not have that information i do know that not all puppeteers have left this region will you accept the transferbooth number sure i wrote down the eight digits as they came a moment later elephant was yelling just as if he were a tridee set turned on in the middle of a program hell is going on here sorry about that said the translator what happened i asked i couldnt hear anything did that mon did the outsider have private business with you sort of ill tell you later the translator said beowulf shaeffer we do not buy information we sell information and use the proceeds to buy territory and food soil you may need this information i argued im the only man within reach who knows it what of other races the puppeteers might have told them but it was worth taking a chance youre about to leave known space if you dont deal with me you may not get this information in time what price do you set on this item you set the price youve got more experience at putting values on inforrnation and youre honorable we may not be able to afford an honest price tbe price may not exceed our ferry fee done speak i told him of the core explosion and how id come find out about it he made me go into detail on what id seen the bright patch of supernovas spreading out as my ship caught up with ancient light waves until all the bright multicolored ball of the core was ablaze with supernovas you wouldnt have known this until you got there and then it would have been too late you dont use fasterthanlight drives we knew from the puppeteers that the core had exploded they were not able to go into detail because they had not seen it for themselves oh ah well i think the explosion must have started at the back side of the core from here otherwise it would have seemed to go much more slowly many thanks we will waive your ferry fee now there is one more item gregory pelton for an additional two hundred thousand stars we will tell you exactly what is peculiar about the planet you intend to visit can i find out for myself it is likely then i will silence followed the outsider hadnt expected that i said im curious your galaxy is rapidly becoming a death trap what will you do now that information will cost you forget it outside elephant said thanks forget it i wonder what they will do maybe they can shield themselves against the radiation maybe but they wont have any starseeds to follow do they need them finagle only knew the starseeds followed a highly rigid migratory mating pattern out from the core of the galaxy and into the arms almost to the rim before turning back down to the core they were doomed as they returned to the core the expanding wave of radiation from the multiple novas would snuff out the species one by one what would the outsiders do without diem what the hell did they do with diem why did they follow them did they need starseeds did starseeds need outsiders the outsiders would answer these and related questions for one trillion stars apiece personal questions cost high with the outsiders a crew was already bringing the st into dock we watched from the ramp with crewmen sunbathing about our feet we werent worried the way the outsiders handled it our invulnerable hull might have been made of spun sugar and sunbeams when a spiderweb of thin strands fastened the st to the wall of the drive capsule the voice of the translator spoke in our ears and invited us to step aboard we jumped a few hundred feet upward through the trace of artificial gravity climbed into the air lock and got out of our suits thanks again said elephant forget it again i said magnanimously i owe you plenty youve been putting me up as a houseguest on the most expensive world in known space acting as my guide where the cost of labor is okay okay okay but you saved me a million stars and dont you forget it he whopped me on the shoulder and hurried into the control room to set up a millionstar credit base for the next outsider ship that came by i wont i called at his retreating back and wondered what the hell i meant by that much later i wondered about something else had elephant planned to take me to his world or did he think to go it alone to be the first to see it and not one of the first two after the outsider episode it was already too late he couldnt throw me off the ship then i wished id thought of it in time i never wanted to be a batman my stake in this was to gently tactfully keep elephant from killing himself if it became necessary for all his vast selfconfidence vast riches vast generosity and vast bulk he was still only a flatlander and thus a little bit helpless we were in the expansion bubble when it happened the bubble had inflatable seats and an inflatable table and was there for exercising and killing time but it also supplied a fine view the surface was perfectly transparent otherwise we would have missed it there was no pressure against the seat of the pants no crawling sensation in the pit of the stomach no feel of motion but elephant who was talking about a jinxian frail hed picked up in a chicago bar stopped just as she was getting ready to tear the place apart because some suicidal idiot had insulted her somebody heavy was sitting down on the universe he came down slowly like a fat man cautiously letting his weight down on a beach ball from inside the bubble it looked like all the stars and nebulas around us were squeezing themselves together the outsiders on the ribbons outside never moved but elephant said something profane and i steeled myself to look up the stars overhead were bluewhite and blazing around us they were squashed together below they were turning red and winking out one by one it had taken us a week to get out of the solar system but the outsider ship could have done it in five hours the radio spoke sirs our crewmen will remove your ship from ours after which you will be on your own it has been a pleasure to do business with you a swarm of outsider crewmen hauled us through the maze of basking ramps and left us presently the outsider ship vanished like a pricked soap bubble gone off on its own business in the strange starlight elephant let out a long shaky sigh some people cant take aliens they dont find puppeteers graceful and beautiful they find them horrifying wrong they see kzinti as slavering carnivores whose only love is fighting which is the truth but they dont see the rigid code of honor or the selfcontrol which allows a kzinti ambassador to ride a humancity pedwalk without slashing out with his claws at the impertinent stabbing knees and elbows elephant was one of those people he said okay in amazed relief they were actually gone ill take the first watch bey he did not say those bastards would take your heart as collateral on a tenthstar loan he didnt see them as that close to human fine i said and went into the control bubble the fast protosun was a week away id been in a suit for hours and there was a shower in the extension bubble if elephants weakness was aliens mine was relativity the trip through hyperspace was routine i could take the sight of the two small windows turning into blind spots becoming areas of nothing which seemed to draw together the objects around them so could elephant hed done some flying though he preferred the comfort of a luxury liner but even the best pilot occasionally has to drop back into the normal universe to get his bearings and to assure his subconscious that the stars are still there and each time it was changed squashed flat the crowded blue stars were all ahead the sparse dim red stars were all behind four hundred years ago men and women had lived for years with such a view of the universe but it hadnt happened since the invention of hyperdrive id never seen the universe look like this it bothered me no it doesnt bug me said elephant when i mentioned it we were a day out from our destination to me stars are stars but i have been worried about something bey you said the outsiders are honorable they are theyve got to be they have to be so far above suspicion that any species they deal with will remember their unimpeachable ethics a century later you can see that cant you outsiders dont show up more often than that um okay why did they try to screw that extra two hundred kilostars out of me uh see the goddamn problem is what if it was a fair price what if we need to know whats funny about the fast protosun youre right knowing the outsiders its probably information we can use all right well nose around a little before we land wed have done that anyway but now well do it better what was peculiar about the fast protosun around lunchtime on the seventh ships day a short green line in the sphere of the mass indicator began to extend itself it was wide and fuzzy just what youd expect of a protosun i let it reach almost to the surface of the sphere before i dropped us into normal space the squashed universe looked in the windows but ahead of us was a circular darkening and blurring of the vivid bluewhite stars in the center of the circle was a dull red glow lets go into the extension bubble said elephant lets not well get a better view in there he turned the dial that would make the bubble transparent naturally we kept it opaque in hyperspace repeat lets not think about it elephant what sense does it make to use an impermeable hull then spend most of our time outside it until we know whats here we ought to retract the bubble he nodded his shaggy head and touched the board again chugging noises announced that air and water were being pulled out of the bubble elephant moved to a window ever see a protosun no i said i dont think there are any in human space that could be the peculiarity it could one thing it isnt is the speed of the thing outsiders spend all their time moving faster than this but planets dont neither do stars bey maybe this thing came from outside the galaxy that would make it unusual it was time we made a list i found a pad and solemnly noted speed of star nature of star and possible extragalactic origin of star ive found our planet said elephant whereabouts almost on the other side of the protosun we can get there faster in hyperspace the planet was still invisibly small where elephant brought us out the protosun looked about the same a protosun is the fetus of a star a thin mass of gas and dust brought together by slow eddies in interstellar magnetic fields or by the presence of a trojan point in some loose cluster of stars which is collapsing and contracting due to gravity id found material on protosuns in the ships library but it was all astronomical data nobody had ever been near one for a close look in theory the fast protosun must be fairly well along in its evolution since it was glowing at the center there it is said elephant two days away at one gee good we can do our instrument checks on the way strap down with the fusion motor pushing us smoothly along elephant went back to the scope and i started checking the other instruments one thing stood out like a beacon elephant have you noticed in me a tendency to use profanity for emphasis not really why its goddamn radioactive out there could you be a little more specific sir our suit shields would break down in three days the extension bubble would go in twenty hours okay add it to your list any idea whats causing it not one i made a note on my list then went back to work we were in no danger the gp hull would protect us from anything but impact with something big no asteroid belts said elephant meteor density zero as far as i can tell no other planets the interstellar gas may clean away anything small at these speeds one things for sure bey ive got my moneys worth this is a damn funny system yeah well we missed lunch shall we get dinner philistine elephant ate fast he was back at the telescope before i was ready for coffee watching him move i was again reminded of a juggernaut but hed never shown as much determination when i knew him on earth if a hungry kzinti had been standing between him and the telescope hed have left footprints in fur but the only thing that could get in his way out here was me cant get a close look at the planet said elephant but it looks polished like a billiard ball just that i dont see any sign of an atmosphere how about blast craters nothing they should be there this systems pretty clean of meteors but the space around us shouldnt be and at these speeds uh huh that better go on your list i wrote it down we slept on the disaster couches in front of me were the yellow lights of the control panel the stars glowed red through one side window blue through the other i stayed awake for a long time staring through the forward window into the red darkness of the protosun the window was opaque but i saw the dark red blur clearly in my imagination the radiation held steady all through the next day i did some more thorough checking using temperature readings and deep radar on both sun and planet everywhere i looked was a new anomaly this star definitely shouldnt be glowing yet its too spread out the gas should be too thin for fusion is it hot enough to glow sure but it shouldnt be maybe the theories on protosuns are wrong then theyre way wrong put it on your list and an hour later elephant another peculiarity yeah from under shaggy brows elephants eyes plainly told me he was getting sick of peculiarities according to the deepradar shadow this planet doesnt have any lithosphere its worn right down to what ought to be the magma but isnt because its so cold out here write it down how many entries have you got nine is any one of them worth paying two hundred kilostars to know about beforehand the radiation maybe if we didnt have a gp hull but said elephant glaring out at the huge dark disk they knew we had a gp hull bey can anything get through a general products hull light like a laser beam gravity like tides crushing you into the nose of a ship when you get too close to a neutron star impact wont harm the hull but itll kill whats inside maybe the planets inhabited the more i think about it the more sure i am it came from outside nothing in the galaxy could have given it this velocity its diving through the plane of the galaxy it wouldnt have to push in from the rim okay what do we do if someone shoots a laser at us we perish i think i had reflective paint spread around the cabin except for the windows but the rest of the hull is transparent we can still get into hyperspace from here and for the next twenty hours afterward well be too close to the planet i went right to sleep that night being pretty tired despite the lack of exercise hours later i slowly realized that i was being examined i could see it through my closed eyelids i could feel the heat of the vast red glare the size of the angry eye the awful power of the mind behind it i tried to struggle away smacked my hand on something and woke with a shock i lay there in the red darkness the edge of the protosun peeked through a window i could feel its hostile glare i said elephant mngl nothing morning would be soon enough morning elephant would you do me a favor sure you want dianna my right arm shave off my beard ill keep sharrol thanks put on your suit will you sure that makes sense we arent nearly uncomfortable enough just because we closed off the bubble right and because im a dedicated masochist im going to put my suit on this instant now i hate to enjoy myself alone you got the wind up a little just enough anything for a friend you go first there was just room to get our suits on one at a time if the inner air lock door hadnt been open there wouldnt have been that we tried leaving our helmets thrown back but they got in our way against the crash couches so we taped them to the window in front of us i felt better that way but elephant clearly thought id flipped you sure you wouldnt rather eat with your helmet on i hate suit food syrup we can reach our helmets if we get a puncture what puncture were in a general products hull i keep remembering that the outsiders knew that weve been through that lets go through it again assume they thought we might be killed anyway if we werent prepared then what gronk either they expected us to go out in suits and get killed or they know of something that can reach through a general products hull or both in which case the suits do us no good at all bey do you know how long its been since a general products hull failed ive never heard of it happening at all it never has the puppeteers offer an enormous guarantee in case one does something in the tens of millions if someone dies as a result youre dead right ive been stupid go ahead and take off your suit elephant turned to look at me and you ill keep mine on do you believe in hunches no neither do i except just this once elephant shrugged his shaggy eyebrows and went back to his telescope by then we were six hours out from the nameless planet and decelerating i think ive found an asteroid crater he said presently lets see i had a look yeah i think youre right but its damn near disappeared he took the telescope back its round enough almost has to be a crater bey why should it be so eroded it must be the interstellar dust if it is then thats why theres no atmosphere or lithosphere but i cant see the dust being that thick even at these speeds put it yeah i reached for my list if we find one more anomaly ill scream half an hour later we found life by then we were close enough to use the gravity drag to slow us the beautiful thing about a gravity drag is that it uses very little power it converts a ships momentum relative to the nearest powerful mass into heat and all you have to do is get rid of the heat since the sts hull would pass only various ranges of radiation corresponding to what the puppeteers varied customers considered visible light the shipbuilders had run a great big radiator fin out from the gravity drag it glowed dull red behind us and the fusion drive was off there was no white fusion flame to hurt visibility elephant had the scope at highest magnification at first as i peered into the eyepiece i couldnt see what he was talking about there was a dull white plain all the same color except for a few blobs of blue the blobs wouldnt have stood out except for the uniformity of the surface around them then one of them moved very slowly but it was moving right i said let me run a temperature check the surface temperature in that region was about right for helium ii and on the rest of the planet as well the protosun wasnt putting out much energy though it was very gung ho on radiation i dont think they match any species i know i cant tell said elephant he had the telescope and the library screen going at the same time with a sirius viii blob on the library screen there are twenty different species of helium life in this book and they all look exactly alike not quite they must have a vacuumproof integument and youll notice those granules in the i treasure my ignorance on this subject bey anyway we arent going to find any species we know on this world even a stagetree seed would explode the moment it hit i let the subject die once again elephant ran the scope over his planet this time looking for the blobby lifeforms they were fairly big for helium ii life but not abnormally so lots of cold worlds develop life using the peculiar properties of helium ii but because it hasnt much use for complexity it usually stays in the amoeba stage there was one peculiarity which i duly noted every animal was on the back side of the planet with relation to the planets course through the galaxy they werent afraid of protosun sunlight but they seemed to fear interstellar dust you promised to scream its not odd enough ill wait two hours passed the red glow of the radiator fin became more pronounced so did the dull uniformity of the planetary surface the planet was a disk now beyond the front window if you watched it for a while you could see it grow turning ship to face the planet had made no difference to the gravity drag cue ball said elephant no good its been used beta lyrae i cannonball express then elephant what are you doing here he turned startled what do you mean look you know by now im with you all the way but i do wonder you spent a million stars getting here and youd have spent two if you had to you could be home in the rockies with dianna or hovering near beta lyrae which is unusual enough and better scenery than this snowball you could be sampling oddball drugs in crashlanding or looking for mist demons on plateau why here because it is there what the blazes is that supposed to mean bey once upon a time there was a guy named miller six years ago he took a ramscoopfusion drive ship and put a hyperdrive in it and set out for the edge of the universe figuring he could get his hydrogen from space and use the fusion plant to power his hyperdrive hes probably still going hell be going forever unless he hits something why a psychiatrist im not he wants to be remembered when youre dead a hundred years what will you be remembered for ill be the idiot who rode with gregory pelton who spent two months and more than a million stars to set his ship down on a totally worthless planet gronk all right what about abstract knowledge this star will be out of known space in ten years our only chance to explore it is right now what there was an almost silent breeze of air and a strangling pressure in my larynx and a stabbing pain in my ears simultaneously i heard the bare beginning of an alarm but i was already reaching for my helmet i clamped it down hard spun the collar and gave vent to an enormous belch at the same time that the wind went shrieking from my lungs there was no way to realize what was happening and no time but vacuum was around us and air was spraying into my suit frigid air iron spikes were being driven through my ears but i was going to live my lungs held a ghastly emptiness but i would live i turned to elephant the fear of death was naked in his face he had his helmet down but he was having trouble with the collar i had to force his hands away to get it fastened right his helmet misted over then cleared he was getting air had it come in time to save his life i was alive the pain was leaving my ears and i was breathing inhale pause inhale as the pressure rose to normal id seen what had happened now i had time to think it through to remember it to play it back what had happened was insane the hull had turned to dust just that all at once and nothing first the ships outside had disintegrated and blown away on a whispering breath of breathing air id seen it and sure enough the hull was gone only the innards of the ship remained before me the lighted control board a little below that the manhole to the packed bubble and the bubble package itself above the board the half disk of the mystery planet and stars to the left stars to the right elephant looking dazed and scared and beyond him stars behind me the air lock the kitchen storage block and dial board a glimpse of the landing legs and glowing radiator fin and stars the st was a skeleton elephant shook his head then turned on his suit radio i heard the magnified click in my helmet we looked at each other waiting but there was nothing to say except elephant look we dont have a hull no more isnt that remarkable i sighed turned to the control board and began nursing the fusion drive to life from what i could see of the ship nothing seemed to be floating away whatever had been fixed to the hull must also have been fixed to other things what are you doing bey getting us out of here uh you can scream now why i mean why leave hed flipped flatlanders are basically unstable i got the drive pushing us at low power turned off the gravity drag and turned to face him look elephant no hull i swept an arm around me none but whats left of the ship is still mine uh yeah sure i want to land can you talk me out of it he was serious completely so the landing legs are intact he went on our suits can keep out the radiation for three days we could land and take off in twelve hours we probably could and we spent going on two months getting here right id feel like an idiot getting this close and then turning for home wouldnt you i would except for one thing and that one thing says youre landing this ship over my unconscious body all right the hull turned to dust and blew away what does that mean it means weve got a faulty hull and im going to sue the hind legs off general products when we get back but do you know what caused it no so why do you assume its some kind of threat tell you what ill do i said i turned the ship until it was tail down to cannonball express now well be there in three hours if you insist on landing its your ship just as you say but im going to try to talk you out of it thats fair have you had spacepilot training naturally did it include a history of errors course i dont think so we got a little history of the state of the art thats something you remember that they started out with chemical fuels and that the first ship to the asteroids was built in orbit around earths moon uh huh this you may not have heard there were three men in that ship and when they were launched it was in an orbit that took them just slightly inside the moons orbit then out again and away about thirty hours after launching the men noticed that all their ports were turning opaque a concentration of dust in their path was putting little meteor pits all through the quartz two of the men wanted to continue on using instruments to finish their mission but the third man was in command they used their rockets and stopped themselves dead remember materials werent as durable in those days and nothing they were using had been well tested the men stopped their ship in the orbit of the moon which by then was miles behind them and called base to say theyd aborted the mission you remember this pretty well how come they drilled these stories into us again and again everything they tried to teach us was illustrated with something from history it stuck go on they called base and told them about their windows fogging up somebody decided it was dust and someone else suddenly realized theyd launched the ship through one of the moons trojan points elephant laughed then coughed wish i hadnt breathed so much vacuum i gather youre leading up to something if the ship hadnt stopped it would have been wrecked the dust would have torn it apart the moral of this story is anything you dont understand is dangerous until you do understand it sounds paranoid maybe it does to a flatlander you come from a planet so kind to you so seemingly adapted to you that you think the whole universe is your oyster you might remember my neutron star story id have been killed if i hadnt understood that tidal effect in time so you would so you think flatlanders are all fools no elephant just not paranoid enough and i refuse to apologize who asked you ill land with you if you can tell me what made our hull turn tp dust elephant crossed his arms and glared forward i shut up and waited by and by he said can we get home i dont know the hyperdrive motor will work and we can use the gravity drag to slow us down to something like normal physically we should be able to do it okay lets go but ill tell you this bey if i were alone id go down and damn the hull so we turned tail and ran under protest from elephant in four hours we were far enough from cannonball expresss gravity well to enter hyperspace i turned on the hyperdrive gasped and turned it off just as fast as i could we sat there shaking and elephant said we can inflate the bubble but can we get in it doesnt have an air lock we worked it though there was a pressurecontrol dial in the cabin and we set it for zero the electromagnetic field that folded the bubble would now inflate it without pressure we went inside pressurized it and took off our helmets were out of the radiation field said elephant i looked good you can go pretty far in even a couple of seconds of hyperdrive now theres one thing ive got to know can you take that again elephant shuddered can you i think so i can do all the navigating if i have to anything you can take i can take can you take it and stay sane yes then we can trade off but if you change your mind let me know that instant a lot of good men have left their marbles in the blind spot and all they had were a couple of windows i believe you indeed i do sir how do we work it well have to chart a course through the least dense part of space the nearest inhabited world is kzin i hate to risk asking help from the kzinti but we may have to tell you what bey lets at least try to reach jinx i want to use that number of yours to give the puppeteers hell sure we can always turn off to something closer i spent an hour or so working out a course when id finished i was pretty sure we could navigate it without either of us having to leave the bubble more than once every twentyfour hours to look at the mass indicator we threw fingers for who got the first watch and i lost we put on our suits and depressurized the bubble as i crawled through the manhole i saw elephant opaqueing the bubble wall i squeezed into the crash couch all alone among the stars they were blue ahead and red behind when i finished turning the ship i couldnt find the protosun more than half the view was empty space i found myself looking thoughtfully at the air lock it was behind and to the left a metal oblong standing alone at the edge of the deck with both doors tightly closed the inner door had slammed when the pressure dropped and now the air lock mechanisms guarded the pressure inside against the vacuum outside in both directions nobody inside to use the air but how do you explain that to a pressure sensor i was procrastinating the ship was aimed i clenched my teeth and sent the ship into hyperspace the blind spot they call it it fits there are ways to find the blind spot in your eye close one eye put two dots on a piece of paper and bring the paper toward you focusing on one of the dots if you hold the paper just right the other dot will suddenly vanish let a ship enter hyperspace with the windows transparent and the windows will seem to vanish so will the space enclosing them objects on either side stretch and draw closer together to fill the missing space if you look long enough the blind spot starts to spread the walls and the things against the walls draw even closer to the missing space until they are engulfed its all in your mind they tell me so i turned the key and half my view was blind spot the control board stretched and flowed the massindicator sphere tried to wrap itself around me i reached for it and my hands were distorted too with considerable effort i put them back at my sides and got a grip on myself there was one fuzzy green line in the plastic distortion that had been a mass indicator it was behind and to the side the ship could fly itself until elephants turn came i fumbled my way to the manhole and crawled through hyperspace was only half the problem it was a big problem every twentyfour hours one of us had to go out there see if there were any dangerous masses around drop back to normal space to take a fix and adjust course i found myself getting unbearably tense during the few hours before each turn so did elephant at these times we didnt dare talk to each other on my third trip i had the bad sense to look up and went more than blind looking up there was nothing at all in my field of vision nothing but the blind spot it was more than blindness a blind man a man whose eyes have lost their function at least remembers what things looked like a man whose optic brain center has been damaged doesnt i could remember what id come out here for to find out if there were masses near enough to harm us but i couldnt remember how to do it i touched a curved glass surface and knew that this was the machine that would tell me if only i knew its secret eventually my neck got sore so i moved my head that brought my eyes back into existence when we got the bubble pressurized elephant said where were you youve been gone half an hour and lucky at that when you go out there dont look up oh that was the other half of the problem elephant and i had stopped communicating he was not interested in saying anything and he was not interested in anything i had to say it took me a good week to figure out why then i braced him with it elephant theres a word missing from our language he looked up from the reading screen if there hadnt been a reading screen in the bubble i dont think wed have made it more than one word he said things have been pretty silent one word youre so afraid of using that word youre afraid to talk at all so tell me coward elephant wrinkled his brows then snapped off the screen all right bey well talk about it first of all you said it i didnt right right have you been thinking it no ive been thinking euphemisms like overcautious and reluctance to risk bodily harm but since were on the subject why were you so eager to turn back i was scared i let that word soak into him then went on the people who trained me made certain that id be scared in certain situations with all due respect elephant ive had more training for space than you have i think your wanting to land was the result of ignorance elephant sighed i think it would have been safe to land you dont were not going to get anywhere arguing about it are we we werent one of us was right one wrong and if i was wrong then a pretty good friendship had gone out the air lock it was a silent trip we came out of hyperspace near the two sirius suns but that wasnt the end of it because we still faced a universe squashed by relativity it took us almost two weeks to brake ourselves the gravity drags radiator fin glowed orangewhite for most of that time i have no idea how many times we circled around through hyperspace for another run through the system finally we were moving in on jinx with the fusion drive i broke a silence of hours now what elephant as soon as we get in range im going to call that number of yours then drop you off at sirius mater with enough money to get you home id take it kindly if youd use my house as your own until i come back from cannonball express ill buy a ship here and go back you dont want me along with all due respect bey i dont im going to land wouldnt you feel like a damn fool if you died then ive spent about three months in a small extension bubble because of that silly planet if you conquered it alone i would feel like a damn fool elephant looked excruciatingly unhappy he started to speak caught his breath if ever i picked the right time to shut a man up that was it hold it lets call the puppeteers first plenty of time to decide elephant nodded in a moment hed have told me he didnt want me along because i was overcautious instead he picked up the ship phone jinx was a banded easter egg ahead of us to the side was binary the primary to which jinx is a moon we should be close enough to talk and the puppeteers transferbooth number would also be their phone number elephant dialed a sweet contralto voice answered there was no picture but i could tell no womans voice is quite that good the puppeteer said eight eight three two six seven seven oh my general products hull just failed elephant was wasting no time at all i beg your pardon my name is gregory pelton twelve years ago i bought a no hull from general products a month and a half ago it failed weve spent the intervening time limping home may i speak to a puppeteer the screen came on two flat brainless heads looked out at us this is quite serious said the puppeteer naturally we will pay the indemnity in full would you mind detailing the circumstances elephant didnt mind at all he was quite vehement it was a pleasure to listen to him the puppeteers silly expressions never wavered but he was blinking rapidly when elephant finished i see he said our apologies are insufficient of course but you will understand that it was a natural mistake we did not think that antimatter was available anywhere in the galaxy especially in such quantity it was as if hed screamed i could hear that word echoing from side to side in my skull elephants booming voice was curiously soft antimatter of course we have no excuse of course but you should have realized it at once interstellar gas of normal matter had polished the planets surface with minuscule explosions had raised the temperature of the protosun beyond any rational estimate and was causing a truly incredible radiation hazard did you not even wonder about these things you knew that the system was from beyond the galaxy humans are supposed to be highly curious are they not the hull said elephant a general products hull is an artificially generated molecule with interatomic bonds artificially strengthened by a small power plant the strengthened molecular bonds are proof against any kind of impact and heat into the hundreds of thousands of degrees but when enough of the atoms had been obliterated by antimatter explosions the molecule naturally fell apart elephant nodded i wondered if his voice was gone for good when may we expect you to collect your indemnity i gather no human was killed this is fortunate since our funds are low elephant turned off the phone he gulped once or twice then turned to look me in the eye i think it took all his strength and if id waited for him to speak i dont know what he would have said i gloat i said i gloat i was right you were wrong if wed landed on your forsaken planet wed have gone up in pure light at this time it gives me great pleasure to say i told you so he smiled weakly you told me so oh i did i did time after time i said dont go near that haunted planet its worth your life and your soul i said there have been signs in the heavens i said to warn us from this place all right dont overdo it you bastard you were dead right all the way lets leave it at that okay but theres one thing i want you to remember if you dont understand it its dangerous thats the one thing i want you to remember besides i told you so and that should have ended it but it doesnt elephants going back hes got a little flag with a un insignia about two feet by two feet with spring wires to make it look like its flapping in the breeze and a solid rocket in the handle so itll go straight when the flag is furled hes going to drop it on the antimatter planet from a great height as great as i can talk him into it should make quite a bang and im going along ive got a solidly mounted tridee camera and a contract with the biggest broadcasting company in known space this time ive got a reason for going ghost four but he never went back i said it happens i know why ander said and then the crowd drowned us out administration and structure swirled together entertainment saw a chance and arrowed into the dance behind its dolphin the depleted fourth team police hung back in a nervous arc all the teams looked to be milling without purpose and from listening to sharrol i could guess why so i said prey submerged the last of the prey turtles must have escaped into the sand for the next few minutes i watched the game with a concentration that would have surprised sharrol this was the story i was telling ander if i hadnt been led here by a woman why was i here i must love the game there yellow prey i shouted as sand stirred an instant later the glowing mock turtle emerged outside the melee and flapped clownishly toward safety a police swimmer dove to capture it his dolphin keeping station to block for him and everyone converged too late he was swimming like mad and so was the prey he was through the yellow arch at the point of a great angry cloud and that was the end i bellowed over the crowds roar dinner oh i missed brunch im starving i didnt want to fight the crowds trying to leave we crossed the slidebridge instead this time in comparative quiet the booths lined below us were whirlpools in a surging sea of escapees anders hand was above my elbow companionably i was a prisoner and that was hard to ignore make conversation i asked did you know theres an ice age going on earth sure well i never even wondered i did wonder why cuba wasnt much hotter than nome ander said the whole planets a web of superconductor cable we had to restart the gulf stream five hundred years ago and it just went from there nome imports heat cuba imports cold even so earth would be pretty cold if we werent getting so much power from the orbiting satellites uh huh what are you going to do when the ice age turns off move ander grinned where did you go after the antimatter system i moved in with sharrol in nome he looked at me you settled down like a grog on a rock maybe he had the right to sneer ander and i had toured singles nodes together on two worlds blowing off steam after marathon work sessions i held my temper and said you can spend a lifetime seeing earth where do you want to eat i said the pequod grill is good good and expensive and an offworlder would have heard of it just the place a destitute b shaeffer might pick if someone else was paying and nobody would ask me where sharrol was we had almost reached the transfer booths just to pull anders chain i turned suddenly into the phone booth to see if i could break his grip he pulled me back effortlessly what i thought id phone and see if the grills full up i said and remembered i couldnt use my pocket phone it was in the wrong name ill do it he used a card it took him ten seconds to get a reservation there are mistakes you dont pay for we pushed into a transfer booth he said so there you were nesting i said it was love stet we werent lockstepped well we were a little i didnt know any women on earth sharrol had some playmates but a lot of the men she knew were moaning and clutching themselves i grinned remembering rasheed lockstepped sure but you cant mean me with a great dramatic wave of his arms like he could have been joking there were some couples we played with but not so much of that either after a while we talked about having children then we looked into it ander said you i wasnt sure how to read his expression a little disgust a little pity i dialed the pequod we flicked in on the roof under a rolling curve of greenblack water the daylight was fading ander led off toward the restaurant twelve floors down he seemed to be familiar with the pequod might even be registered here test that i need to visit a cycler ander long day me too he said this way in the cycler he maneuvered himself between me and the door and i let him amusing scenarios came to mind if i needed a booth he could watch the door but what if he needed a booth not that it mattered i didnt want to escape not until i could know i was loose i wanted to speak of lost treasure but i needed to know how much he already knew why was i here who had come with me how how was i surviving i waited in the hope that he might speak of those things and of carlos wus autodoc too so we didnt talk much until we were settled at a table with drinks ander wasnt interested in local cuisine he ordered beef no imagination i found crew snapper on the menu billed as an order for two heh heh i asked what happened to greg peltons expedition ander said antimatter planet the more he thought about it the more he needed to know he kept expanding his plans until some government gnome took notice after that it just inflated government projects can do that everyone wants in they always think theres infinite money and suddenly its gone from science fiction to fantasy i dont even know if peltons still involved the un has probes in the system meanwhile the current plan calls for a base on the planet i laughed oh sure he grinned at me set on a metal dish in stasis inside a roller sphere also in stasis it is antimatter after all he wasnt making it up he was too amused civil servants love making plans you cant get caught in a mistake if youre only making plans and it can pay your salary for life and i shouldnt have heard that much beowulf nor should you if a terrorist knew where to find infinite masses of antimatter things could get sticky and that is why you werent asked to ghostwrite the tour guide i surmised ander smiled he said back to work youve met outsiders would you consider them a threat no he waited i said theyre fragile superfluid helium metabolism and no real skeleton i think any place we consider interesting they die but never mind that ander theyve got the technology to take accelerations that would reduce you or me to a film of neutrons not the point can you tell me why they honor contracts theyve got ships to run away from any obligation i think it must be built into their brains ander they honor contracts and they keep their promises theyre trustworthy he nodded in no way dissatisfied grogs are they dangerous tanj straight theyre dangerous he laughed well finally kzinti sure puppeteers where are they going anywhere they wast to he kept looking so i said clouds of magellan thats not the interesting question the outsiders can boost a ship or a planet to near lightspeed can the puppeteers do that too or will they have to summon outsiders to change their course and stop yeah id say they have the outsider drive they bought it or they built it or theyve got a research project thatll get it for them i futz hire outsiders to push five planets up to fourfifths of lightspeed then try to figure out how to slow them down was that as risky as it sounded i began to believe it wasnt there was nothing dangerous in the path of the puppeteer fleet they had thousands of years to solve the puzzle ander asked again are the puppeteers a threat he had generated in me a mulish urge to defend them mey honor their contracts theyre manipulative bastards beowulf you know that so are the arms your people have been in my face since i reached earth do you know what sharrol and i had to go through to have children the fertility board turned you down of course yeah what did you do sharrol used to play with a carlos wu carlos had an open birthright so we worked something out then i went traveling he was from the look of him learning far more about beowulf shaeffer than he had ever wanted to he tried to stick to what he knew traveling any contact at all with piersons puppeteers during that period no other aliens aliens the puppeteers dealt with that made me smile im a celebrity among the kdatlyno grendel there were the sounds of a passenger starship you learn those sounds and you dont forget even after four years they are never loud enough to distract except during takeoff and most are too low to hear anyway but you dont forget and you wake knowing where you are there were the sensations of being alone a sleeper field is not a straight nogee field theres an imbalance that keeps you more or less centered so you dont float out the edge and fall to the floor when your field holds two you set two imbalances for the distance you want and somehow you feel that in your muscles you touch from time to time you and your love twisting in sleep there are rustlings and the sounds of breathing nobody had touched me this night nothing breathed here but me i was dead center in the sleeping field i woke knowing i was alone in a tiny sleeping cabin of the argos bound from down to gummidgy and where was sharrol sharrol was on earth she couldnt travel some people cant take space that was half our problem but it did narrow it down and if i wanted her i need only go to earth and hunt her up in a transferbooth directory i didnt want to find her not now our bargain had been clear and also inevitable and there are advantages to sleeping alone ill think of them in a moment i found the field control switch the sleeper field collapsed letting me down easy i climbed into a navyblue falling jumper moving carefully in the narrow sleeping cabin started my hair and went out margo hailed me in the hall looking refreshingly trim and lovely in a clinging pilots uniform her long dark hair streamed behind her rippling as if underwater or in freefall youre just in time i was about to wake everyone up its only ninethirty you want to get lynched she laughed ill tell them it was your idea no im serious bey a month ago a starseed went through the gummidgy system im going to drop the ship out a lightmonth away and let everybody watch oh thatll be nice i said trying for enthusiasm ive never seen a starseed set sail ill give you time to grab a good seat right thanks i waved and went on marveling at myself since when have i had to work up enthusiasm for anything margo was captain m tellefsen in charge of getting the argos to gummidgy sometime this evening wed spent many of her offduty hours talking shop since the argos resembled the liners i used to fly seven years ago before my boss nakamura lines collapsed margo was a bright girl as good a spacer as id been once her salary must have been good too that freefall effect is the most difficult trick a hairdresser can attempt no machine can imitate it expensive tastes i wondered why shed left earth by flatlander standards she was lovely enough to make a fast fortune on tridee maybe she just liked space many do their eyes hold a dreamy distant look a look id caught once in margos green eyes this early the lounge held only six passengers out of the twentyeight one was a big biped alien a kdatlyno touch sculptor named lloobee the chairs were too short for him he sat on a table with his great flat feet brushing the floor his huge arms resting on horncapped knees the other nonhumans aboard would have to stay in their rooms rooms were joined and halffull of water occupied by a dolphin his name was pszzzz or braaack or some such unpolite sound human ears couldnt catch the ultrasonic overtones of that name nor could a human throat pronounce it so he answered to moby dick he was on his way to wunderland the argoss next stop then there were two sessile grogs in and a flock of jumpin jeepers in with the connecting door open so the grogs could get at the jumpin jeepers which were their food supply lloobee the kdatlyno touch sculptor had room i found emil at the bar he raised a thumb in greeting dialed me a bloody marriage and waited in silence for my first sip the drink tasted good though id been thinking in terms of tuna and eggs the other four passengers eating breakfast at a nearby table all wore the false glow of health one carries out of an autodoc tank probably theyd been curing hangovers but emil always looked healthy and he couldnt get drunk no matter how hard he tried he was a jinxian short and wide and bullstrong a topflight computer programmer with an intuitive knack for asking the right questions when everyone else has been asking the wrong ones and blowing expensive circuits in their iron idiots so he said so i responded ill do you a favor lets go sit by the window he looked puzzled but went the argos lounge had one picture window it was turned off in hyperspace so that it looked like part of the wall but we found it from memory and sat down emil asked whats the favor this is it now weve got the best seats in the house in a few minutes everyone will be fighting for a view because margos stopping the ship to show us a starseed setting sail oh okay i owe you one were even you bought me a drink emil looked puzzled and i realized id put an edge in my voice as if i didnt want anyone owing me favors which i didnt but it was no excuse for being a boor i dialed a breakfast to go with the drink tuna fillet eggs florentine and doublestrength tea the kitchen had finished delivering it when margo spoke over the intercom as follows ladies and gentlemen and other guests we are dropping out some distance from cy aquarii so that you may watch a starseed which set sail in the system of gummidgy last month i will raise the lounge screen in ten minutes click in moments we were surrounded the kdadyno sculptor squeezed in next to me spiked knees hunched up against the lack of room the silver tip of the horn on his elbow imperiling my eggs emil smiled with one side of his mouth and i made a face but it was justice id chosen the seats myself the window went on silence fell everyone who could move was crowded around the lounge window the kdadynos horned elbow pinned a fold of my sleeve to the table i let it lie i wasnt planning to move and kdatlyno are supposed to be touchy there were stars brighter than stars seen through atmosphere but you get used to that i looked for cy aquarii and found a glaring white eye we watched it grow margo was giving us a slow telescopic expansion the bright dot grew to a disk bright enough to make your eyes water and then no brighter the eyes on a ships hull wont transmit more than a certain amount of light the disk swelled to fill the window and now dark areas showed beneath the surface splitting and disappearing and changing shape and size growing darker and clearer as they rode the shock wave toward space the core of cy aquarii exploded every eightynine minutes each time the star grew whiter and brighter while shock waves rode the explosion to the surface men and instruments watched to learn about stars the view swung a curved edge of space showed with curling hydrogen flames tracing arcs bigger than some suns the star slid out of sight and a dully glowing dot came into view still the view expanded until we saw an eggshaped object in dead center of the window the starseed said margo via intercom there was cool authority in her publicspeaking voice this one appears to be returning to the galactic core having presumably left its fertilized egg near the tip of this galactic arm when the egg hatches the infant starseed will make its own way home across fifty thousand lightyears of space the starseed was moving fast straight at the sensing eye with an immediacy that jarred strangely against margos dry lecture voice suddenly i knew what shed done shed placed us directly in the path of the starseed if this one was typical of its brethren it would be moving at about point eight lights the starseeds light image was moving only onefifth faster than the starseed itself and both were coming toward us margo had set it up so that we watched it five times as fast as it actually happened quite a showman margo believe that at least some eggs are launched straight outward toward the clouds of magellan or toward the globular clusters or toward andromeda thus the starseeds could colonize other galaxies and could also prevent a population explosion in this galaxy there were pinpoints of blue light around the starseed now newsmen from down come to gummidgy to cover the event darting about in fusion ships this specimen is over a mile in thickness and about a mile and a half in length suddenly it hit me whatinhell was the kdatlyno watching with nothing resembling eyes with only his radar sense to give form to his surroundings he was seeing nothing but a blank wall i turned lloobee was watching me naturally lloobee was an artist subsidized by his own world government selling his touch sculptures to humans and kzinti so that his species would acquire interstellar money finagle knew they didnt have much else to sell yet theyd been propertyless slaves before we took their world from the kzinti but now they were building industries he didnt look like an artist he looked like a monster that brown dragon skin would have stopped a knife curved silvertipped horns marked his knees and elbows and his huge hands human in design nonetheless showed eight retractile claws at the knuckles no silver there they were filed sharp and then buffed to a polished glow the hands were stranglers hands not sculptors hands his arms were huge even in proportion to his tenfoot height they brushed his knees when he stood up but his face gave the true nightmare touch eyeless noseless marked only by a gash of a mouth and by a goggleshaped region above it where the skin was stretched drumhead taut that tympanum was turned toward me lloobee was memorizing my face i turned back as the starseed began to unfold it seemed to take forever the big egg fluttered its surface grew dull and crinkly and began to expand it was rounding the sun now lighted on one side black on the other it grew still bigger became lopsided and slowly slowly the sail came free it streamed away like a comets tail and then it filled a silver parachute with four threadlike shrouds pointing at the sun where the shrouds met was a tiny knob this is how they travel a starseed spends most of its time folded into a compact egg shape falling through the galaxy on its own momentum but inevitably there come times when it must change course then the sail unfolds a silver mirror thinner than the paint on a cheap car but thousands of miles across a crossshaped thickening in the material of the sail is the living body of the starseed itself in the knob that hangs from the shrouds is more living matter there are the muscles to control the shrouds and set the attitude of the sail and there is the egg fertilized at the core launched near the galactic rim the sail came free and nobody breathed the sail expanded filled the screen and swung toward us a bluewhite point crossed in front of it a newsmans shit a candle so tiny as to be barely visible now the sail was fully inflated by the light from behind belling outward crimped along one side for attitude control the intercom said and thats it ladies and gentlemen and other guests we will make one short hyperspace hop into the system of gummidgy and will proceed from there in normal space we will be landing in sixteen hours there was a collective sigh the kdatlyno sculptor took his horn out of my sleeve and stood up improbably erect and what would his next work be like i thought of human faces set in expressions of sheer wonder and grinning incredulity muscles bunched and backs arched forward for a better view of a flat wall had lloobee known of the starseed in advance i thought he had most of the spectators were drifting away though the starseed still showed my tea was icy wed been watching for nearly an hour though it felt like ten minutes emil said how are you doing with captain tellefsen i looked blank you called her margo a while back oh that im not really trying emil what would she see in a crashlander that girl must have hurt you pretty bad what girl it shows through your skull bey none of my business though he looked me up and down and i had the uncomfortable feeling that my skull really was transparent what would she see shed see a crashlander yes height seven feet weight one sixty pounds close enough white hair eyes bloodred skin darkened with tannin pills just like the rest of us but you must take more tannin pills than anybody i do not as you said that its any of your business was it a secret i had to grin at that how do you hide the fact that youre an albino no but its half my problem do you know that the fertility board of earth wont accept albinos as potential fathers earth is hardly the place to raise children anyway once a flatlander always a flatlander i fell in love with a flatlander sorry she loved me too still does i hope but she couldnt leave earth a lot of fladanders cant stand space some of them never know it did you want children yeah in silent sympathy emil dialed two bloody marriages in silent thanks i raised the bulb in toast and drank it was as neat a cleft stick as had ever caught man and woman sharrol couldnt leave earth on earth she was born on earth she would die and on earth she would have her children but earth wouldnt let me have children no matter that forty percent of we made it is albino no matter that albinism can be cured by a simple supply of tannin pills which anyone but a fullblooded maori has to take anyway if hes visiting a world with a brighter than average star earth has to restrict its population to keep it down to a comfortable eighteen billion to a flatlander thats comfortable so prevent the useless ones from having children the liabilities such as paranoia prones mental deficients criminals uglies and beowulf shaeffer emil said shouldnt we be in hyperspace by now up to the captain i told him most of the passengers who had watched the starseed were now at tables sleeping cubicles induce claustrophobia bridge games were forming reading screens were being folded out of the walls drinks were being served i reached for my bloody marriage and found to my amazement that it was too heavy to pick up then i fainted i woke up thinking it wasnt that strong and everyone else was waking too something had knocked us all out at once which might mean the ship had an unconscious captain i left the lounge at full speed which was a wobbly walk the controlroom door was open which is bad practice i reached to close it and changed my mind because the lock and doorknob were gone replaced by a smooth hole nine inches across margo drooped in her chair i patted her cheeks until she stirred what happened she wanted to know we all went to sleep together my guess is gas stun guns dont work across a vacuum oh it was a gasp of outrage shed spotted the gaping hole in her control board as smooth and rounded as the hole in the door the gap where the hyperwave radio ought to be right i said weve been boarded and we cant tell anyone about it now what that hole she touched the rounded metal with her fingertips slaver disintegrator i think a digging tool it projects a beam that suppresses the charge on the electron so that matter tears itself apart if thats what it was well find the dust in the air filters there was a ship said margo a big one i noticed it just after i ended the ghow by then it was inside the mass limit i couldnt go into hyperspace until it left i wonder how they found us i thought of some other good questions but let them pass one i let out whats missing wed better check thats what i dont understand we arent carrying anything salable valuable yes instruments for the base but hardly blackmarket stuff she stood up ill have to go through the cargo hold waste of time wheres the cargo mass meter on this hulk oh of course she found it somewhere among the dials no change nothing missing there unless they replaced whatever they took with equivalent masses why so we wouldnt know they were here nuts then they didnt take anything or they took personal luggage the lifesystem mass meter wont tell us passengers move around so youd think theyd have the courtesy to stay put just in case some pirates should ung what i tasted the idea and found it reasonable more ten to one lloobees missing who our famous valuable kdatlyno sculptor the third kdatlyno in history to leave his home planet one of the et passengers oh brother i left running because lloobee was the perfect theft as a wellknown alien artist who had been under the protection of earth the ransom he could command was huge as a hostage his value would be equal no special equipment would be needed lloobee could breathe earthnormal air his body could even use certain human food proteins and certain gaseous human anesthetics lloobee wasnt in the lounge and his cabin was empty with lloobee missing and with the hyperwave smashed the argos proceeded to gummidgy at normal speed normal speed was top speed there are few good reasons to dawdle in space it took us six hours in hyperdrive to reach the edge of cy aquariis gravity well from there we had to proceed on reaction drive and gravity drag margo called gummidgy with a com laser as soon as we were out of hyperspace by the time we landed the news would be ten hours old we would land at three in the morning ships time and at roughly noon gummidgy time most of us including me went to our cabins to get some sleep an hour before planetfall i was back in the lounge watching us come in emil didnt want to watch he wanted to talk have you heard the kidnappers called the base a couple of hours ago whatd they have to say they want ten million stars and a contract before they turn the kdatlyno loose they also emil was outraged at their effrontery reminded the base that kdatlyno dont eat what humans eat and they dont have any kdat foodstuffs they must be crazy where would the base get ten million stars in time oh thats not the problem if the base doesnt have funds they can borrow money from the hunting parties im sure theres a group down there with their own private yacht its the contract that bothers me gummidgy was blue on blue under a broken layer of white with a diminutive moon showing behind an arc of horizon very earthlike but with none of the signs that mark earth no yellow glow of sprawling cities on the dark side no tracery of broken freeways across the day a nicelooking world from up here unspoiled no transfer booths no good nightclubs no tridee except old tapes and those only on one channel unspoiled with only half my mind working on conversation i said be glad weve got contracts otherwise we might get him back dead obviously you dont know much about kdatlyno obviously i was nettled theyll do it you know theyll pay the kidnappers ten million stars to give lloobee back and theyll tape an immunity contract too total immunity for the kidnappers no reprisals no publicity do you know what the kdatlyno will think about that theyll be glad to have their secondbest sculptor back best hrodenu is the best it doesnt matter what theyll think is theyll wonder why we havent taken revenge for the insult to lloobee theyll wonder what were doing about getting revenge and when they finally realize we arent doing anything at all go on theyll blame the whole human race you know what the kzinti will think who cares what the kzinti think he snorted great now he had me pegged as a chauvinist why dont you drop it i suggested we cant do anything about it its up to the base mps its up to nobody the base mps dont have ships right about then i should have accidentally bitten my tongue off i didnt have that much sense i never do instead i said they dont need ships whoever took lloobee has to land somewhere the message came in on hyperwave whoever sent it is circling outside the systems gravity well whoever sent it may well be i was showing off but whoever took lloobee landed a kdatlyno needs lots of room room he can feel he sends out a supersonic whistle one tone all his life and when the echoes hit the tympanum above his mouth he knows whats around him on a liner he can feel corridors leading all around the ship he can sense the access tubes behind walls and the rooms and closets behind doors nothing smaller than a liner is big enough for him you dont seriously suggest that the kidnappers borrowed a liner for the job do you i apologize you do seem to know something about kdatlyno i accept your apology now the kidnappers have definitely landed where have to be some rock gummidgys the only planetsized body in the system look down there i looked out the window one of gummidgys oceans was passing beneath us the biggest ocean gummidgy had it covered a third of the planet circle sea round as a tenstar piece a whale of a big asteroid must have hit there when gummidgy was passing through the system stopped it cold or almost all the other rocks in the system are close enough to the star to be halfmolten okay could they have built their own space station or borrowed one doubtful so they must have landed on gummidgy i concluded happily and waited for the applause emil was slowly nodding his head up down up down suddenly he stood up lets ask captain tellefsen hold it ask her what ask her how big the ship was she saw it didnt she shell know whether it was a liner sit down lets wait till were aground then tell the mps let them ask margo what for belatedly i was getting cautious just take my word for it will you assume im a genius he gave me a peculiar look but he did sit down later after we landed we favored the police with our suggestions theyd already asked margo about the ship it was a hell of a lot smaller than the argos about the size of a big yacht they arent trying emil said as we emerged from city hall you cant blame them i told him suppose we knew exactly where lloobee was suppose that then what should we charge in with lasers blazing and risk lloobee catching a stray beam yes we should thats the way kdatlyno think i know but its not the way i think i couldnt see emils face which was bent in thought two feet below eye level but his words came slowly as if he had picked them with care we could find the ship that brought him down you cant hide a spaceship landing the gravity drag makes waves on a spaceport indicator granted he could be right here in the base so many ships go in and out most of the base ships dont have hyperdrive good then we can find them wherever they landed he looked up what are we waiting for lets go look at the spaceport records it was a waste of time but there was no talking him out of it i tagged along the timing was a problem from where the kidnapping took place any ship in known space would take six hours to reach the breakout point if it tried to go farther in hyperspace cy aquariis gee well would drop it permanently into the blind spot from breakout it had taken us ten hours to reach gummidgy that was at fivegee acceleration fusion drive and gravity drag with four gees compensated by the internal gee field cy aquarii was a hot star and if gummidgy hadnt been near the edge of the system it would have been boiling rock now the fastest ship id ever heard of could make twenty gees which would take it here in five hours said emil total of eleven a onegee ship would would take too long lloobee would go crazy they must know something about kdatlyno in fact ill bet theyre lying about not having kdatlyno food maybe okay assume theyre at least as fast as the argos that gives us five hours to play in hmmm nineteen ships on the timetable they were listed according to class i crossed out fifteen that didnt have hyperdrive crossed out the argos itself to leave three crossed out the pregnant banana because it was a cargo job flown by computer ten gee with no internal compensating fields crossed out the golden voyage a passenger ship smaller than the argos with a onegee drive thats nice said emil drunkards walk say remember the hunting party i told you about with their own yacht yeah i know that name well thats the yacht drunkards walk what did you say tbe owner of the yacht larchmont bellamy i met him once at elephants house go on by then it was too late to bite my tongue though i didnt know it yet not much to tell elephants a friend of mine a flatlander hes got friends all over known space i walked in at lush hour one afternoon and bellamy was there with a woman named here she is tanya wilson shes in the same hunting party shes bellamys age whats bellamy like hes three hundred years old no kidding he was wearing a checkerboard skindye job and a shockingpink belter crest he talked well old jokes but he told them well and he had some new ones too would he kidnap a kdatlyno i had to think about that he might hes no xenophobe aliens dont make him nervous but he doesnt like them i remember him telling us that we ought to wipe out the kzinti for good and all he doesnt need money though would he do it for kicks bellamy pink bushy eyebrows over deep eyes a mimics voice a deadpan way of telling a story deadpan delivery of a punch line id wondered at the time if that was a puton in three hundred years you hear the same joke so many times tell the same story so many ways change your politics again and again to match a changing universe was he deadpan because he didnt care anymore how much boredom can you meet in three hundred years how many times can you change your morals without losing them all bellamy was born before a certain jinxian biological laboratory produced boosterspice he reached maturity when the organ banks were the only key to long life when a criminals life wasnt worth a paper star he was at draft age when the kzinti were the only known extrasolar civilization and a fearful alien threat now civilization included human and nine known alien lifeforms and criminal rehabilitation accounted for half of all published work in biochemistry and psychotherapy what would bellamys morals say about lloobee if he wouldnt kidnap a kdatlyno would he steal one you make your own guess there i dont know bellamy that well well its worth checking jilson bent over the timetables mist demons he landed a third of the way around the planet oh well lets go rent a car huh well need a car he saw hed left me behind to get to their camp to find out if they rescued lloobee you know the kdadyno touch sculptor who i get the picture goodbye and good luck if they ask who sent you for finagles sake dont mention me that wont work emil said firmly bellamy wont talk to me he doesnt know me apparently i didnt make it clear ill try again if we knew who the kidnappers were which we dont we still couldnt charge in with lasers blazing but he was shaking his head left right left right its different now these men have reputations to protect dont they what would happen to those reputations if all human space knew theyd kidnapped a kdadyno youre not thinking even if everyone on gummidgy knew the truth the pirates would simply change the contract a secrecy clause enforced by monetary penalty emil slapped the table and the walls echoed are we just going to sit here while they rob us youre a hell of a man to wear a heros name look youre taking this too personally huh a heros name beowulf he must be turning over in his barrow about now whos beowulf emil stood up putting us eye to eye so that i could see his utter disgust beowulf was the first epic hero in english literature he killed monsters barehanded and he did it to help people who didnt even belong to his own country and you he turned away im going after bellamy i sat there for what seemed a long time any time seems long when you need to make a decision but cant it probably wasnt more than a minute but emil wasnt in sight when i ran outside i shouted at the man whod loaned us the timetables hey where do you go to rent a car public rentals dial fourteen in the transfer booth then walk a block east so the base did have transfer booths i found one paid my coin and dialed getting to public rentals gave me my first chance to look at the base there wasnt much to see buildings half of them semipermanent the base was only four years old apartment buildings laboratories a nursery school overhead the actinic pinpoint of cy aquarii hit the weather dome and was diffused into a wide soft white glow there were few people about and all of them were same shade of black for protection against the savage invisible ultraviolet outside most of them had goggles hung around their necks that much i saw while running a block at top speed he was getting into a car when i came panting up he said change your mind no but hoo youre going to change yours whew the mood youre in youll fly straight into bellamys camp and tell him hes a lousy pirate hyooph then if youre wrong hell punch you in the nose and if youre right hell either laugh at you or have you killed emil climbed into the car if youre going to argue get in and argue there i got in i had some of my breath back will you get it through your thick head youve got your life to lose and nothing to gain i told you why ive got to try dont i fasten your crash web i fastened my crash web its strands were thin as coarse thread and not much stronger but they had saved lives any sharp pull on the crash web would activate the crash field which would enfold the pilot and protect him from impact if youve still got to look for the kidnappers i said why not do it here theres a good chance lloobees somewhere on the base nuts said emil he turned on the lift units and we took off bellamys yacht is the only ship that fits theres another ship that fits the argos put your goggles on were about to go through the weather dome what about the argos think it through there had to be someone aboard in the first place to plant the gas bomb that knocked us out why shouldnt that same person have hidden lloobee somewhere gagged or unconscious until the argos could land finagles gonads he could still be on the argos no he couldnt they searched the argos emil glared at nothing at that moment we went through the weather dome cy aquarii which had been a soft white patch became for an instant a tiny bright point of agony then a spot on each lens of my goggles turned black and covered the sun well have to check it out later said emil but we can call city hall now and tell them one of the kidnappers was on the argos but we couldnt where the car radio should have been was a square hole emil smote his forehead with his jinxian strength its a wonder he survived i forgot car radios wont work on gummidgy you have to use a ships com laser and bounce the beam off one of the orbital stations do we have a com laser do you see one maybe in ten years someonell think of putting com lasers in cars well well have to do it later thats silly lets do it now first we check on bellamy im not going emil just grinned he was right it had been a futile comment i had three choices fighting a anxian getting out and walking home but we must have gone a mile up already and the base was far behind visiting bellamy who was an old friend and looking around unobtrusively while we were there actually it would have been rude not to go actually it would have been silly not to at least drop by and say hello while we were on the same planet actually i rationalize a lot do one thing for me i said let me do all the talking you can be the strong silent type who smiles a lot okay what are you going to tell him the truth not the whole truth but some of it the fourhour trip passed quickly we found cards and a score pad in a glove compartment the car blasted quietly and smoothly through a mach four wall of air rising once to clear a magnificent range of young mountains can you fly a car i looked up from my cards of course most people can every world has its wilderness areas and its not worthwhile to spread transfer booths all through a forest especially one that doesnt see twenty tourists in a year when youre tired of civilization the only way to travel is to transfer to the edge of a planetary park and then rent a car thats good said emil in case i get put out of action now its your turn to cheer me up emil cocked his head at me if its any help i think i know how bellamys group found the argos go on it was the starseed a lot of people must have known about it including margo maybe she told someone that she was stopping the ship so the passengers could get a look not much help she had a lot of space to stop in did she think about it first bellamyd have no trouble at all figuring when shed reach the gummidgy system right theres only one speed in hyperdrive that means margo would have to stop on a certain spherical surface to catch the light image of the starseed setting sail furthermore in order to watch it happen in an hour she had to be right in front of the starseed that pinpoints her exactly thered be a margin of error emil shrugged half a lighthour on a side all bellamy had to do was wait in the right place he had an hour to maneuver bravo i said there were things i didnt want him to know yet he could have done it that way all right id like to mention just one thing go ahead you keep saying bellamy did this and bellamy did that we dont know hes guilty yet and ill thank you to remember it remember that hes a friend of a friend and dont start treating him like a criminal until you know he is one all right emil said but he didnt like it he knew bellamy was a kidnapper he was going to get us both killed if he didnt watch his mouth at the last minute i got a break it was only a bit of misinterpretation on emils part but one does not refuse a gift from the gods wed crossed six or seven hundred kilometers of veldt bluegreen grass with herds grazing at wide intervals the herds left a clear path for the grass changed color when cropped now we were coming up on a forest but not the gloomy green type of forest native to human space it was a riot of color patches of scarlet green magenta yellow the yellow patches were polkadotted with deep purple just this side of the forest was the hunting camp like a nudist at a tailors convention it leapt to the eye flagrantly alien against the bluegreen veldt a bulbous plastic camp tent the size of a mansion dorninated the scene creases marring its translucent surface to show where it was partitioned into rooms a diminutive figure sat outside the door its head turning to follow our sonic boom the yacht was some distance away the yacht was a gaily decorated playboys space boat with a brilliant orange paint job and garish markings in colors that clashed some of the markings seemed to mean something bellamy one year ago hadnt struck me as the type to own such a boat yet there it stood on three wide landing legs with paddleshaped feet its sharp nose pointed up at us it looked ridiculous the hull was too thick and the legs were too wide so that the big businesslike attitude jets in the nose became a comedians nostrils on a slender needle with razorsharp sweptback airfoils that paintjob might have passed but it made the compact finless drunkards walk look like a clown the camp swept under us while we were still moving at mach two emil tilted the car into a wide curve slowing and dropping as we tumed toward the camp for the second time he said bellamys taking precious little pains to hide himself oh oh what the yacht its not big enough the ship captain tellefsen described was twice that size a gift from the gods i hadnt noticed i said youre right well that lets bellamy out go ahead tell me im an idiot no need why should i gloat over one stupid mistake id have had to make the trip anyway sometime emil sighed i suppose that means youll have to see bellamy before we go back finagles sake emil were here arent we oh one thing lets not tell bellamy why we came he might be offended and he might decide im a dolt correctly dont worry i wont tell him the grass covering the veldt turned out to be kneehigh ferns dry and brittle enough to crackle under our socks dark bluegreen near the tips of the plants gave way to lighter coloring on the stalks small wonder the herbivores had left a trail small wonder if wed seen carnivores treading that easy path the goggled figure in front of the camp tent was cleaning a mercy rifle by the time we were out of the car he had closed it up and loaded it with inchlong slivers of anesthetic chemical id seen such guns before the slivers could be fired individually or in onesecond bursts of twenty and they dissolved instantly in anything that resembled blood one type of sliver would usually fit all the lifeforms on a given world the man didnt bother to get up as we approached nor did he put down the gun hi he said cheerfully what can i do for you wed like beowulf shaeffer yeah larch bellamy now he got up cant recognize anybody on this crazy world goggles covering half your face everybody the same color you have to go stark naked to be recognized and then only the women know you whatinhell are you doing on gummidgy bey ill tell you later larch this is emil home emil meet larchmont bellamy pleasure said bellamy grinning as if indeed it were then his grin tried to break into laughter and he smothered it lets go inside and swallow something wet what was funny dont be offended mr home you and bey do make an odd pair i was thinking that the two of you are like a mediumsized beach ball standing next to a baseball bat how did you meet on the ship said emil the camp tent had a collapsible revolving door to hold the pressure inside the tent was almost luxurious though it was all foldaway stuff chairs and sofas were soft cushiony fabric surfaces holding their shape through insulated static charges tables were memory plastic probably they compressed into small cubes for storage aboard ship light came from glow strips in the fabric of the pressurized tent the bar was a floating portable it came to meet us at the door took our orders and passed out drinks all right bellamy said sprawling in an armchair when he relaxed he relaxed totally like a cat or a tiger bey how did you come to gummidgy and wheres sharrol she cant travel in space oh i didnt know that can happen to anyone but his eyes questioned she wanted children did you know that shes always wanted children he took in my red eyes and white hair i see so you broke up for the time being his eyes questioned thats not emphatic enough there was something about bellamy he had a lean body and a lean face with a straight sharpedged nose and prominent cheekbones all setting off the dark eyes in their deep pits beneath black shaggy brows but there was more to it than eyes you cant tell a mans age by looking at his photo not if he takes boosterspice but you can tell to some extent by watching him in motion older men know where theyre going before they start to move they dont dither they dont waste energy they dont trip over their feet and they dont bump into things bellamy was old there was a power in him and his eyes questioned i shrugged we used the best answer we had larch he was a friend of ours and his name was carlos wu youve heard of him mathematician isnt he yah also playwright and composer the fertility board gave him an unlimited breeding license when he was eighteen that young hes a genius as i say he was a good friend of ours liked to talk about space he had the flatland phobia like sharrol well sharrol and i made our decision and then we went to him for help he agreed so sharrols married him on a twoyear contract in two years ill go back and marry her and well raise our fam ill be damned id been angry about it for too long with nobody to be angry at i flared up well what would you have done found another woman but im a dirty old man and youre young and naive suppose wu tried to keep her he wont hes a friend i told you besides hes got more women than ten of him could handle with that license of his so you left i had to i couldnt stand it he was looking at me with something like awe i cant remember ever being in love that hard bey youre overdue for a drunk and youre surrounded by friends shall we switch to something stronger than beer its a good offer but no thanks i didnt mean to cry on your shoulder ive had my drunk a week on wunderland drinking vurguuz finagles ears vurguuz i said to myself why mess around with half measures said i so what does it taste like like a hand grenade with a minted sugar casing like you better have a chaser ready silence threatened to settle no wonder the way id killed the conversation by spilling my personal problems all over everything i said so as long as i had to do some traveling i thought id do some people some favors thats why im here what kind of favors well a friend of mine happens to be an et taxidermist its a complicated profession i told him id get him some information on gummidgy animals and gummidgy biochemistry now that the planets open to hunters sooner or later people like you are going to be carting in perforated alien bodies bellamy frowned i wish i could help he said but i dont kill the animals i hunt i just shoot them full of anesthetic so theyll hold still while i photo them the same goes for the rest of us i see otherwise id offer to take you along one day yeah ill do my own research then thanks for the thought then being a good host bellamy proceeded to work emil into the conversation emil was far from being the strong silent type who smiles a lot in fact we were soon learning all about the latest advances in computer technology but he kept his word and did not mention why we had come i was grateful the afternoon passed swiftly dinnertime arrived early most of the people on gummidgy accommodate to the eighteenhour day by having two meals brunch and dinner we accepted bellamys invitation with dinner arrived a dedicated hunter named warren who insisted on showing us photos of everything hed caught since his arrival that day hed shot a graceful animal like a white greyhound but even faster he said a monkeylike being with a cupped hand for throwing rocks and a flower a flower see those tooth marks on my boot i had to shoot it to get it to let go no real sport in it but as long as id already shot the damn thing his only resemblance to bellamy was this he carried the same indefinable air of age now i was sure it had nothing to dovith appearance perhaps it was a matter of individuality bellamy and warren were individuals they didnt push it they didnt have to demonstrate it but neither were they following anybodys lead warren left after dinner going to see how the others were doing he said they must be hot on the trail of something or theyd have been back to eat not wanting to wear out our welcome we said our goodbyes and left too it was near sunset when we emerged from the camp tent let me drive i said emil raised his brows at me but moved around to the passenger seat he did more than raise his brows when he saw what i was doing i set the autopilot to take us back to the base and let the car fly itself until we were below the horizon we were a mile up by then and a goodly distance away whereupon i canceled the course dipped the car nearly to ground level and swung back toward the forest i flew almost at treetop level staying well below the speed of sound tell me again i said about beowulf the hero what kind of game are you playing now you thought the size of the drunkarda walk cleared bellamy didnt you it does its much too small to be captain tellefsens pirate so it is but we already know there was a pirate on board the argos right lets assume its margo the captain why not ill say this for him he got it all in one gulp margo to release the gas margo to tell bellamy where to meet the argos and to hold the ship in one place long enough to be met margo to lie about the size of bellamys ship and me to keep emil in the dark until now so he wouldnt blow his lines when he met bellamy he gulped and then he said it fits but id swear bellamys innocent except for one thing he didnt invite me to go hunting with him a yellow patch of forest streamed away beneath us the purple polka dots wed seen from high up turned out to be huge blossoms several feet across serviced by birds the size of storks then we were over scarlet puffballs that shook in the wind of our passage i kept us low and slow a car motor is silent but a sonic boom would make us more than conspicuous thats your evidence against him he didnt want you hunting with him and he gave lousy reasons you said he hated ets hes a flatlander to some flatlanders wed both look like ets maybe but the drunkards walk is still the only ship that could have landed lloobee and margos still our best bet as the kidnapper on the argos maybe the pirates could have found the argos by guess and hope but theyd have a damn sight better chance with margo working with them emil glared out through the windshield were you thinking this all the time we were in the camp not until he turned down the chance to take me hunting then i was pretty sure you make a firstclass liar i didnt know how to deny it so i said nothing nonetheless emil was wrong if id spilled my personal problems in bellamys lap if id accepted his hospitality professed friendship drunk his liquor laughed at his jokes and made him laugh at mine it was not an act bellamy made you like him and he made you want him to like you and emil would never understand that in my eyes bellamy had done nothing seriously wrong six years earlier id tried to steal a fullsized spacecraft fitted more or less for war from a group of piersons puppeteers id been stopped before the plan had gotten started but so what the puppeteers had been blackmailing me but again so what who says the aliens of known space have to think were perfect we know were not ask us im sorry said emil excuse my mouth i got you into this practically over your dead body and now when you do your best to help out i jump on you im an ungrateful and what he said then about his anatomic makeup probably wasnt true he was married after all he concluded youre the boss now what depends we dont have any evidence yet you really think bellamys the one i really do he could be holding lloobee anywhere hundreds of miles away well never find him thinking that way he wasnt in the camp tent even bellamy wouldnt have that much nerve if hed been in the ship wed have seen the air lock open closed open lloobee couldnt sense anything through a ships hull in a closed ship that size hed go nuts okay we know one thing that might be helpful bellamys got a disintegrator he does the holes in the argos you didnt see them did you no you think he might have dug himself a hideout yeah bellamy isnt the type to let a tool like that go to waste if hes got a slaver disintegrator hell use it its a fine digging tool a big roomy cave would take you an hour and even the dust would be blown hundreds of miles disintegrator dust is nearly monatomic how are you planning to find this cave lets see if the car has a deepradar attachment it didnt rentacars usually do on worlds where there are swampy areas so now we knew gummidgy wasnt swampy everything on the dash had its uses and not one of them was sonar well have to make a sight search said emil how close are we to bellamys camp about thirty miles well theres a chance they wont see us emil sat forward in his chair hands gripping his knees his smile was thin and tight obviously he had something take us up to ten miles dont cross sonic speed until weve got lots of room what can we see from ten miles up assume im a genius that served me right i took the car up without quibbling ten miles down was the wandering line of the forest border sharply demarcated from the veldt at this height all the magnificent colors of gummidgy vegetation blurred into a rich brown do you see it no look for two nearly parallel lines said emil a little lighter than the rest of the forest i still dont see it it shows on the veldt too nope hah got it crossing the rich brown of the forest was a strip of faintly lighter faintly more uniform brown hard to see though what is it dust blown for hundreds of miles just like you said some of it settled on the tops of the trees so dim was the path that it kept flickering in and out of the visible but it was straight with edges that slowly converged it crossed the veldt too in a strip of faintly dimmed bluegreen before its edges met the path faded out but one could extend those edges in the minds eye i let the car fall unless we were building dream castles lloobees cave must be at the intersection when we got too low the dust path disappeared in the colors of forest and veldt bellamys hypothetical cave was half a mile into the forest i couldnt land there for reasons involving too many big plants and too many pirates i dropped the car in a curve of the forest emil had been fumbling in the back now he pressed something into my hand and said here take this to my amazement i found myself holding a sonic stunner thats illegal i whispered furiously why are you whispering kidnapping kdatlyno is illegal too we may be glad weve got these before were finished but where did you get police stunners lets say some criminal slipped them into my luggage and if youll look at the butts youll see they arent police stunners theyd started life as police stunners but they werent anymore the butts were handcarved from big cultured emeralds expensive dueling pistols sure dueling pistols lose a duel with one of these and youd lose nothing but face i hear most jinxians would rather lose an arm permanently they were not illegal on jinx remember said emil they only knock a man out for ten minutes i can run a long way in ten minutes emil looked me over rather carefully youve changed you could have driven me straight back to base and id never have been the wiser i never thought of that bah would you believe ive decided to be an epic hero whatever that is emil shrugged and moved into the forest i followed i wasnt about to explain my motives to emil hed put me in an unpleasant situation and if he wanted to worry about my backing out let him worry back out i couldnt it was too late there had been a time when i knew nothing about lloobees kidnappers i might suspect margo but i had no evidence later i could suspect bellamy but i had no proof but emil had pressured me into confronting bellamy and bellamy had been pressured into putting on an act if i quit now bellamy would continue to think i was a fool and when bellamy confronted margo margo would continue to think i was a fool that would hurt to have margo and bellamy both thinking that i had been twice an idiot it wasnt bellamys fault except that he had voluntarily kidnapped a valuable kdatlyno sculptor it was partly my fault and mostly emils i might be able to leave margo out of this but bellamy would have to pay for my mistakes and why shouldnt he it was his antisocial act the vegetation was incredibly lush infinitely varied its chemistry was not that of terrain life but the chemical it used for photosynthesis was similar to chlorophyll for billions of years the plants of gummidgy had had oversupplies of ultraviolet light the result was life in plenty a profusion of fungi and animals and parasites on every branch of the magenta trees was an orchid thing a sessile beast waiting for its dinner to fly by the air was full of life birdforms insectforms and a constant rain of dust and spores and feathery seeds and bits of leaf and bird dung the soil was dry and spongy and rich and the air was rich with oxygen and alien smells somewhere in the spectrum of odors were valuable undiscovered perfumes once we saw a flower thing like the one in warrens photo i found a dry branch and stuck it down the things blossom and pulled back half a branch again four feet of snake flew by emil stunned it it had two small fins near the head end and its hind end was a huge leathery delta wing its mouth was twothirds back along the body with typical abruptness the flowering magenta trees gave way to a field of scarlet tubing no branches no leaves just interlocking cables three feet thick moving restlessly over each other like too many snakes in a pit they were four or five deep maybe they were all one single plant or animal we never did see a head or a tail and wed never have kept our footing if wed tried to cross we circled the area staying in the magenta trees because we were getting too close to where the hypothetical cave ought to be that brought us to a small round hill surmounted by a tree that was mostly wandering roots we started around the hill and emil gripped my arm i saw it a cave mouth small and round in the base of the hill and leaning against the dirt slope of the hill was a woman with a mercy gun all right i whispered come on lets get out of here i pulled at emils arm and turned toward freedom it was like trying to stop a warship from taking off emil was gone running silently toward the cave with his gun held ready leaving me with numb fingers and a deep appreciation of finagles first law i swallowed a groan and started after him on flat ground i can beat any jinxian who ever ran the short sprint my legs were twice the length of emils but emil moved like a wraith through the alien vegetation while i kept getting tangled up my long legs and arms stuck out too much and i couldnt catch him it was such a crying pity because we had it we had it all or all we were going to get the guarded cave was our proof bellamy and his hunter friends were the kidnappers that knowledge would be a powerful bargaining point in our negotiations for the return of lloobee despite what id told emil all we had to do now was get back to base and tell somebody but i couldnt catch emil i couldnt even keep up with him a bare area fronted the cave a triangular patch of ground bounded by two thick sprawling roots belonging to the treelike thing on the hill id lost sight of emil when i saw him again he was running for the cave at full speed and the woman with the gun was faceup in the dirt emil reached the darkness at the mouth of the cave and disappeared within and as he vanished into the dark he was unmistakably falling well now they had emil with blazing lasers proof wasnt enough hed decided to bring back lloobee himself now wed have to negotiate for the two of them would we bellamy was back at the hunting camp when he found out his men had emil hed know i was somewhere around but whoever was in the cave might think emil was alone in which case they might kill him right now i settled my back against the tree as a kind of afterthought i focused the dueling pistol on the woman and fired id have to do that every ten minutes to keep her quiet eventually someone would be coming out to see why she hadnt stopped emil i didnt dare try to enter the cave be it man or booby trap whatever had stopped emil would stop me too bad the dueling pistols didnt have more power the craftsmen who had carved their emerald butts had scaled them down because after all they would be used only to prove a point it would take a shopful of tools to readjust them because readjusting them to their former power would violate jinxian law real police stunners will knock a man out for twelve hours or more i was sitting there waiting for someone to come out when i felt the prickly numbness of a stunner the sensations came separately first a pull in my ankles then in the calves of my legs then something rough and crumbly sliding under me separate sensations just above the threshold of consciousness penetrating the numbness a sliding bump bump against the back of my head gritty sensation in the backs of my hands anus trailing above and behind my head conclusion arrived at after long thought i was being dragged i was limp as a noodle and nearly as numb it was all over nobody had walked innocently out of the cave instead the man in there with lloobee had looked out with a heat sensor then used his sonic on anything that might possibly be the temperature of a man things turned dark i thought i was unconscious but no id been dragged into the cave thats a relief said bellamy unmistakably bellamy bastard said a womans voice it seemed familiar rich and fruity with a flatlander accent that was not quite true misplaced in time probably a dialect doesnt stay the same forever my eyes fell open bellamy stood over me looking down with no expression tanya wilson sat some distance away looking sullenly in my direction the man named warren standing behind her carefully did something to her scalp and she winced there said warren you go back to the camp if anyone asks i was scratched by a flower bird said tanya the rest of you are out hunting will you please assume ive got a mind dont be so damn touchy larch youd better tie them up hadnt you you do it if you like its not necessary theyll be out for hours oh really tanya wilson got up and went to the cave mouth before leaving she pulled a cord hanging at the side warren who had followed her pulled it again after she was gone the cord was attached to what looked like a police stunner the same model as emils guns the stunner was mounted on a board and the board was fixed in place over the mouth of the cave aimed downward a booby trap so easy the numbness was gone my problem was the opposite it was all i could do to keep from moving i was stretched fulllength on a rocky floor with my heels a foot higher than my nose and my arms straight above my head if i so much as clenched a fist i wonder bellamy said what made him turn against me who shaeffer i could see four in the cave bellamy was standing over me warren was nearer the cave mouth the two others were near the back near a line of plastic crates one was a man id never seen the other huge and frightening in the semidark a monster from mans dimmest past when demons and supernatural beings walked the homeworld was lloobee they sat silently facing each other as if each were waiting for something yes said bellamy beowulf shaeffer he seemed such a nice guy why would he go to so much effort to get me in troublet you forget larch warren spoke with patient understanding they are the good guys we are the bad guys a simple sense of law and order too much law and order around warren there are no more frontiers we sit in our one small area of the universe called known space sixty lightyears across and we rot too much security everyone wants security thats shaeffers motive he was backing up law and order i dont think so beys not the type what type is he lazy a survival type but lazy he doesnt start to use his brain until hes in obvious overt trouble but hes got pride could the other one have talked him into it i suppose so there was an uncomfortable silence well said warren its too bad whatll we do with them bellamy looked unhappily down at me he couldnt see my eyes behind the goggles not in the dim cave light they could be found halfeaten by one of those big hopping things say the ones that prey on the gray plains herbivores the carnivore that did it would be poisoned it would have to be found nearby right bellamy pondered its vital that there be no evidence against us if we tried to square a murder rap in the contract theyd chivvy our price down to nothing you were bright to use the sonic a mercy needle would have left chemicals a small sharp rock was pressing against the side of my neck it itched if i was planning to leap to my feet from this ridiculous position i couldnt delay too long sooner or later id reach to scratch sooner or later bellamy or warren would notice the butts of emils altered police stunners and know them for what they were first we need a plains carnivore said warren do you think we can starve it into lloobee leapt he was five yards from the man who was guarding him at the back of the cave the man fired instantly and then he screamed and tried to dodge the kdatlyno slammed into him and knocked him sliding across the floor i didnt see any more i was running i heard panicky shouting and then bellamys roar relax you idiot he was unconscious before he left the ground and warrens relax hell wheres shaeffer i barely remembered to pull the trigger cord on bellamys booby trap the cave entrance was long and low sloping upward i took it at a crouching run behind me was more confusion could the first man through have pulled the trigger cord again that would give me time i needed outside the cave i turned sharp right the winding halfexposed roof was almost emils height i went over it like a spider monkey and then under it hiding under its protective bulk cy aquarii was directly behind me minutes from sunset its white light threw a sharp black shadow along the side of the root i started crawling uphill staying in the shadow two sets of pelting footsteps followed me from the other side of the root voices came from below barely audible they didnt sound like a search in progress why not i looked back and saw no pursuit halfway up the hill i slid out of my blue falling jumper tucked it as far under the root as it would go and went on thinking kindly thoughts about tannin pills now id be all but invisible if i stayed in the shadows all but my white hair why had lloobee made that grandstand play it was as if hed read my mind he must have known there was no chance of escape for him but id have had no chance without his diversion had he known i was conscious could kdatlyno read minds at the top of the hill i stopped in a cleft between two huge roots the magenta tree seemed much too small to need all that root area but the sunlight was rich and maybe the soil was poor and the roots would hide me but where were my pursuers i knew they needed me they couldnt dispose of emil until they had me granted that they could find me as soon as it got dark id stand out like a beacon on a heat sensor but suppose i reached the car first the car sure that was it while i was crouching somewhere or taking a tangled trail that would keep me hidden at all times bellamy or one of his men was taking the shortest straightest route to my car to move it before i could reach it i pounded my head to get it working no use i was stymied the cave id find guns in there hunting guns the anesthetic slivers probably wouldnt work on human beings but they might be poisonous and they would certainly hurt but no i couldnt attack the cave thered be no way around the booby trap but thered be someone in there to turn the booby trap on and off and to guard lloobee another on the way to the car that made two the third would have found some high point chosen days previously for its view of the surroundings hed be waiting now for a glimpse of my snowwhite hair i couldnt break and run for the car maybe and maybe the third man had been the first to come charging after me and maybe hed snatched at the trigger cord as he passed to turn off a police stunner that was already off and maybe hed run through the beam maybe but if anyone reached the car i was cooked i spun it over and over while handfuls of needed seconds passed me by there was no other way to figure it tanya was back at camp a second man was in the cave a third was on the way to the car the fourth either was waiting for me to show myself or he wasnt i had to risk it i came out from under the roots running im good at sprinting not so good at a longdistance run the edge of the forest was half a mile away i was walking when i got there and blowing like a citysized air pump there was no sign of anyone and no sign of the car i stood just within the forest sucking wind nerving myself to run out into the fern grass then bellamy emerged to my left he dogtrotted fearlessly out onto the veldt into the fern grass and stood looking around one of emils sonics dangled from one hand he must have known by then that it was only a dueling pistol but it was the only sonic he had he saw something to his right something hidden from me by a curve of forest he turned and trotted toward it i followed as best i could multicolored things kept tripping me and i didnt dare step out into the fern grass bellamy was going to get there first he was examining the car when i found him the car was right out in the open tens of yards from any cover any second now hed get in and take off what was he waiting for me i knelt behind a magenta bush dithering bellamy was peering into the backseat he wanted to know just what wed planned before he made his move every two seconds his head would pop up for a long slow look around a black dot in the distance caught my eye it took me a moment to realize that it was in the plastic goggles blotting out the dot of actinic sunlight the sun was right on the horizon bellamy was opening the trunk the sun i started circling the magenta bushes offered some cover and i used it all bellamys eyes maintained their steady sweep but they hadnt found me yet abruptly he slammed the trunk circled the car to get in i was where i wanted to be my long shadow pointed straight at the car i charged he looked up as i started he looked straight at me and then his eyes swept the curve of forest taking their time he bent to get into the car and then he saw me but his gun hand was in the car and i was close enough the dots on his goggles had covered more than cy aquarii theyd covered my approach my shoulder knorked him spinning away from the car and i heard a metal tick he got up fast emptyhanded no gun hed dropped it i turned to look in the car fully expecting to find it on the floor or on the seat it was nowhere to be seen i looked back in time to duck and his other hand caught me and knocked me away i rolled with it and came to my feet he was standing in a relaxed boxer stance between me and the car im going to break you bey so you cant find the gun either i dont need it any normal tenyearold could break you in two tben come on i dropped into boxer stance thanking finagle that he didnt know karate or juwhatsis or any of the other illegal killing methods hundreds of years had passed since the usual laws against carrying a concealed weapon were extended to cover special fighting methods but bellamy had had hundreds of years to learn id come up lucky he came toward me moving lightly and confidently a flatlander in prime condition he must have felt perfectly safe what could he have to fear from an attenuated weakling a man born and raised in we made its point six gee he grinned when he was almost in range and i hit him in the mouth my range was longer than his he danced back and i danced forward and hit him in the nose before he got his guard up hed have to get used to the extra reach of my arms but his guard was up now and i saw no point in punching his forearms youre a praying mantis he said an insect overspecialized and he moved in i moved back punching lightly staying out of his reach hed have to get used to that too his legs were too short if he tried to move forward as fast as i could backpedal he wouldnt be able to keep his guard up he tried anyway i caught him one below the ribs and his head jerked up in surprise i wasnt hurting him much but hed been expecting love pats four years in earths one point oh gee had put muscle on me muscle that didnt show along my long bones he tried crowding me and i caught him twice in the right eye he tried keeping his guard intact and that was suicide because he couldnt reach me at all i caught that eye a third time he bellowed lowered his head and charged i ran like a thief id led him in a half circle he never had a chance to catch me he reached the car just as i slammed the door in his face and locked it by the time he reached the lefthand door i had that locked too and all the windows up he was banging a rock on a window when i turned on the lift units and departed the field of battle hed have to get used to my methods of fighting too as i took the car up i saw him running back toward the hunting camp no radio no com laser the base was a third of the way around the planet and id have to go myself i set the autopilot to take me a thousand miles north of the base flying low bellamy was bound to come after me with a car and i didnt want to be found come to that did he have a car i hadnt seen one maybe hed use but that didnt bear thinking about so i didnt a glove compartment held a small bar emil and i hadnt depleted it much on the way out i ordered something simple and sat sipping it the forest disappeared behind me i watched the endless plain of fern grass whipping underneath mach four is drifting with the breeze if youre a spaceman but try it in a car with the altitude set for fifty yards it wasnt frightening it was hypnotic the sun had been setting now it stayed just where it was on the horizon a little to my left the ground was a blur the sky was a frozen sphere it was as if time stopped i thought of margo what an actress she would have made the confusion shed shown after the kidnapping she hadnt remembered the cargo mass meter oh no she hadnt even known lloobee was one of her passengers sure she hadnt shed taken me for a fool i had no wish to harm her when i told the mps about bellamy she would not be mentioned but shed know that i knew i wondered what had brought her into this come to that what had brought bellamy he couldnt need the money that badly simple kicks had he wanted to strike at humanalien relationships the races of known space are vastly richer for the interstellar trade but bellamy had lived through at least three humankzinti wars hed read of things that looked like lloobee in his childrens books he was a man displaced in time i remembered the way hed said stark naked id used a nudists license myself on earth not because i believed the incredible claims for nudisms healthgiving properties but because i was with friends who did come to that i was nude now but bellamy had laughed when hed said it nudism was funny i remembered the archaisms in his speech bellamy hed done nothing seriously wrong not until he had decided to kill emil and me we could have been friends now it was too late i finished my drink and crumpled the cup it evaporated a black streak on my goggles at the edge of my right eye much too late the black blotch of bellamys fusion flame was far to the north passing me hed done it hed brought the drunkards walk had he seen me the ship curved around toward the sun slowed and stopped in my path it came down my throat i swerved bellamy swerved to meet me he flashed by overhead and my car moving at mach four bucked under the lash of the sonic boom the crash field gripped me for an instant then went off he turned and came from behind slam and he was disappearing into the blue and green and orange sunset what was he playing at he must know that one touch of fusion flame would finish me he could end me any time he pleased the drunkards walk was moving at twice my speed and bellamy moved it about like an extension of his fingers he was playing with me again he turned and again the hypersonic boom slapped me down the blur of veldt came up at me then receded another such might slap me into the fern grass at mach four he wasnt playing he was trying to force me to land my corpse was to carry no evidence of murder slam and again the black blotch shrank against the sunset it was no playboys yacht he was flying such an expensive toy would have been long and slender with a superfluous needle nose and low maneuverability due to its heavy angular movement the drunkards walk was short with big attitude jets showing like nostrils in the stubby nose i should have known when i saw the landing legs big and wide and heavy folded now into the hull but when they were down they were comically splayfooted with a wide reach to hold the ship on almost any terrain the playboys flashy paint job was indirection only the ship the ship made a wide loop ahead of me and came slashing back i pulled back hard on the wheel the blood left my head and then the crash field took hold i was in a cushioned shell and the crash field held my shape like an exoskeleton as i curved up to meet him bellamy came down my throat give him a taste of his own medicine if i hadnt been halfloaded id never have done it a crash now was the last thing bellamy wanted it would leave evidence not only on the car but on the drunkards walk but space pilots crack up more cars they cant get used to the idea that in the atmosphere of a planet mach four is fast he must have been doing mach eight himself he pulled up too late i smashed into the ships flank at a low angle without the crash field id have been hamburger as it was i blacked out instantly i woke in the midst of a flaming maelstrom gripped in a vise that wouldnt let me breathe with agony tearing at my hands the car was diving out of the sky at four times sonic speed with its aerodynamic stability smashed to hell i could feel the terrific deceleration in my inner ear i tried to use the controls not that they would have worked the ship was obviously stone dead but i tried it anyway and then the pain came my hands had been outside the crash field naturally how else could i control the car half the joints had been dislocated in the crash the ground came up rotating i tried to pull my hands back but deceleration pulled me hard against the crash web and the crash field held i was embedded in glass i hit the car was on its nose in high fern grass all the plastic windows had become flying shards including the windshield they littered the car the windshield frame was crushed and bent i hung from the crash web unable to unfasten it with my crippled hands unable to move even if i were free and i watched the drunkards walk its fusion drive off floating down ahead of me on its gravity drag i didnt notice the anomaly then i was dazed and i saw what i expected to see a spaceship landing bellamy he didnt see it either but he would have if hed looked to the side when he came down the landing ladder he came down the ladder with his eyes fixed on mine and emils sonic in his hand he stepped out into the fern grass walked over to the car and peered in through the bent windshield frame come on out i cant use my hands so much the better bellamy rested the sonic on the rim of the frame and pointed it at my face with his other hand he reached in to unfasten the crash web and pull me out by the arm walk he said or be dragged i could walk barely i could keep walking because he kept prodding the small of my back with the gun youve helped me you know you had a car crash he said you and jilson then some predators found you it sounded reasonable i kept walking we were halfway to the ship when i saw it the anomaly i said bellamy whats holding your ship up he prodded me walk your gyros thats whats holding the ship up he prodded me without answering i walked any moment now hed see what the hed seen it he stared in pure amazement and then he ran i stuck out a foot to trip him lost my balance and fell on my face bellamy passed me without a glance one of the landing legs wasnt down id smashed it into the hull he hadnt seen it on the indicators so i must have smashed the sensors too the odd thing was that wed both missed it though it was the leg facing us the drunkards walk stood on two legs wildly unbalanced like a ballet dancer halfway through a leap only her gyros held her monstrous mass against gravity somewhere in her belly they must be spinning faster and faster i could hear the whine now highpitched rising bellamy reached the ladder and started up hed have to use the steering jets now and quickly with steering jets that size the gyros which served more or less the same purpose must be small little more than an afterthought now was my chance i struggled to my feet and staggered a few steps bellamy looked down then ignored me hed take care of me when he had time where could i go where could i hide on this flat plain some chance i stopped walking bellamy had almost reached the air lock when the ship screamed like a wounded god the gyros had taken too much punishment that metal scream must have been the death agony of the mountings bellamy stopped he looked down and the ground was too far he looked up and there was no time then he turned and looked at me i read his mind then though im no telepath bey whatll i do i had no answer for him the ship screamed and i hit the dirt well i didnt hit it i allowed myself to collapse i was on the way down when bellamy looked at me and in the next instant the drunkards walk spun end for end shrieking the nose gouged a narrow furrow in the soil but the landing legs came down hard dug deep and held bellamy sailed high over my head and i lost him in the sky the ship poised braced against her landing legs taking spin from her dying flywheels then she jumped the landing legs acted like springs hurling her somersaulting into the air she landed and jumped again screaming tumbling like a wounded jackrabbit trying to flee the hunter i wanted to cry id done it i was guilty no ship should be killed like this somewhere in her belly the gyroscope flywheels were coming to rest in a tangle of torn metal the ship landed and rolled bouncing rolling i watched as she receded and finally the drunkards walk came to rest dead far across the bluegreen veldt i stood up and started walking i passed bellamy on the way if youd like to imagine what he looked like go right ahead it was nearly dark when i reached the ship what i saw was a ship on its side with one landing leg up its hard to damage hullmetal especially at the low subsonic speeds the drunkards walk was making when she did all that jumping i found the air lock and climbed in the lifesystem was a scrambled mess parts of it the most rugged parts were almost intact but thin partitions between sections showed ragged gaping holes the flywheel must have passed here the autodoc was near the back it looked intact and i needed it badly to take the pain from my hands and put them back together id as soon have stepped into a bandersnatchs mouth you can get the willies thinking about all the things that can go wrong with a doc the bouncing flywheel hadnt reached the control cone things lighted up when i turned on the communications board i had to manipulate switches with the heel of my hand i turned on everything that looked like it had something to do with communications rolled all the volume knobs to maximum between my palms and let it go at that making no attempt to aim a com laser talk into anything or tap out code if anything was working on that board and something was delivering power even if the machinery to use it was damaged then the base would get just the impression i wanted them to have someone was trying to communicate with broken equipment so i settled myself in the control cone and smoked using my toes was less painful than trying to hold a cigarette in my fingers i remembered how shocked sharrol had been the first time she saw me with a cigarette between my toes flatlanders are less than limber eventually someone came i picked up the open bulb of glass that margo had called a snifter and held it before me watching the play of light in the redbrown fluid it was a pleasure to use my hands twelve hours ago they had been useless swollen and blackening like things long dead to the heros return said margo her green eyes sparkled she raised the snifter in a toast and drank ive been in a doc the past twelve hours i said fill me in are we going to get lloobee back lloobee and your friend too satisfaction was rich in her voice she was almost purring the kidnappers settled for a contract of amnesty and antipublicity with a penalty of ten thousand stars to the man who causes their names to be published anywhere in known space penalty to apply to every man woman and child on gummidgy you and me included they insisted we list the names did you know there are half a million people on gummidgy thats a big contract but they never made a tenth star they were lucky to get what they did with their ship wrecked theyre trapped here lloobee and your friend should be arriving any minute and bellamys death should satisfy kdatlyno honor mm hm she nodded happy relaxed what an actress she could have been how nice it would have been to play along i didnt kill him deliberately i said you told me that leaves us only one loose end she looked up over the snifter whats that persuading emil to leave you out of it she dropped the snifter it hit the indoor grass rug and rolled under the coffee table while margo stared at me as at a stranger finally she said youre hard to read how long have you known practically since your friends took lloobee but we werent sure until we knew bellamy really had him youd lied about his ship i see her voice was flat and the sparkle in her eyes was a long forgotten thing emil home knows who else just me and emil owes me one two really well she said well and she went to pick up the snifter right then the rest of it fell into place youre old youre hard to fool bey ive never seen you move like that before its funny i can tell a mans age within a few decades but i cant tell a womans why dont you move like that all the time she laughed and have everyone know im a crone not likely so i hesitate when i move and i knock against things occasionally and catch my heel on rugs every woman learns to do that usually long after shes learned not to too much poise is a giveaway she stood with her feet apart hands on her hips challenging now her poise was tremendous a shocking glowing dignity perhaps she had been an actress so long ago that her most devoted admirers had died or forgotten her so im old well well now i know why you joined the kidnappers you and bellamy and the rest you all think alike no persuasion needed she shook her head in mock sadness how you simplify do you really think that everyone over two hundred and fifty is identical under the skull piet lindstrom disliked the idea from the beginning but he needed the money hes been off boosterspice for years warrens loved hunting all his life he hadnt hunted a civilized animal since the kzinti wars tanya was in love with larch shell probably try to kill you and you larch would have gone ahead without me anything could have happened so i saw to it that i was flying lloobees ship and i declared myself in she was so damn vivid id thought she was beautiful before but now with the littlegirl mannerisms gone she glowed i thought of the brandy you loved him too i said im his mother that jolted me to my toes the brandy i said what was in the brandy something i developed long ago hormones hypnotics a love potion youre going to love me two years from now ill abandon you like an empty beer bulb you wont be able to live without me her smile was cruel and cold a fitting revenge finagle help me i hadnt drunk the brandy of course but what the hell then it penetrated two years you know about sharrol yes i didnt drink the brandy theres nothing in it but alcohol we grinned at each other across the length of the couch then the ghost was between us and i said what about bellamy larch took his chances he knew what he was doing i cant understand that i couldnt understand why she didnt hate me worse all my questions were sure to be the wrong ones i picked one that might be right and asked what was he doing dying hed run out of things to do hed have taken greater and greater chances until one of them killed him one day ill reach the same point maybe ill know it in time what will you do then dont ask me she said with finality i never did again and what will you do now i have an idea she said carefully watching me sharrol janss is bearing children on earth for you to raise i cant have children myself my ovaries have long since run out of ova but is there any reason why we shouldnt spend two years together i cant think of any but what would you get out of it ive never known a crashlander and youre curious yes dont be offended im not your flattery has turned my head after all there were two years to fill and margo was lovely i was alone on jinx two years later waiting for the next ship to earth as it turned out lloobees latest works were there too on loan to the institute of knowledge to the institute i went to see what my protg had produced seeing them was a shock that was the first shock that they should make sense when seen touch sculpture is to be felt it has no meaning otherwise but these were busts and statuettes someone had even advised lloobee on color i looked closer first a group of human statuettes some seated some standing all staring with great intensity at a flat pane of clear glass second a pair of heads human humane handsome noble as all hell but childs play to recognize nonetheless i touched them and they felt like warm human faces my face and emils third and last a group of four a woman and three men they showed a definite kinship with the ape and a second admixture of what must have been demon blood yet they were quite recognizable three felt like human faces though somehow repellent but the fourth felt horribly dead the kidnappers had neglected to include lloobee in their contract and lloobee has been talking to newsmen telling them all about how his latest works had come to be ghost five can i ghost that story for you ander asked might be money in it old news everyones seen lloobees version i said thinking that my story even edited could call too much attention to margo lloobee hadnt known of margos involvement in the kidnapping and i hadnt told ander i watched him wondering if he knew ive never turned on to a mature woman he said whats it like why did you break up i shrugged it was supposed to be temporary it stayed that way didnt have to just did ander it boggles me a little too margo contracting for a twoyear date the way i used to angle for a hot weekend aliens scare you do you ever worry about elderly humans no theyve learned too much they dont like change if they could stop civilization in its tracks they would he didnt exactly think that over he disliked the taste so he spit it out i always figure if you cant lick em join em so ive decided to get older beowulf general products gave you a number i take it as being for my use only his eyes narrowed but he let it slide but you could use it if we needed to know something i might ask a properly phrased question ander smittarasheed i am out of the aliens business again he let it slide after margo where earth i had a hell of a time getting back did you go back for sharrol janss i stared of course for sharrol and the children carlos wus children i stood up knowing it was a mistake and so what im leaving if you want to apologize my phone is beowulf shaeffer i just cant see you losing your head over a woman i lost my breath it was as if hed punched me in the belly i sat down but my vision was still graying ander watched in amazement when my eyes would focus again he asked what was that about not now i couldnt breathe he sighed he tapped at the menu board a squeezebulb popped up and he handed it across i found my hand massaging my throat removed it took the bulb and drank brandy and soda just right he watched me drink again stet sigmund told me how you got back to sol system he might possibly have left something out go ahead the borderland of sol three months on jinx marooned i played tourist for the first couple of months i never saw the highpressure regions around the ocean because the only way down would have been with a safari of hunting tanks but i traveled the habitable lands on either side of the sea the east band civilized the west band a developing frontier i wandered the east end in a vacuum suit toured the distilleries and other vacuum industries and stared up into the orange vastness of primary jinxs big twin brother i spent most of the second month between the institute of knowledge and the camelot hotel tourism had palled for me thats unusual im a born tourist but jinxs one point seven eight gravities put an unreasonable restriction on elegance and ingenuity in architectural design the buildings in the habitable bands all look alike squat and massive the east and west ends the vacuum regions arent that different from any industrialized moon i never developed much of an interest in touring factories as for the ocean shorelines the only vehicles that go there go to hunt bandersnatchi the bandersnatchi are freaks enormous intelligent white slugs the size of mountains they hunt the tanks there are rigid restrictions to the equipment the tanks can carry covenants established between men and bandersnatchi so that the bandersnatchi win about forty percent of the duels i wanted no part of that and all my touring had to be done in three times the gravity of my homeworld i spent the third month in sirius mater and most of that in the camelot hotel which has gravity generators in most of the rooms when i went out i rode a floating contour couch i passed like an invalid among the jinxians who were amused or was that my imagination i was in a hall of the institute of knowledge when i came on carlos wu running his fingertips over a kdatlyno touch sculpture a dark slender man with narrow shoulders and straight black hair carlos was lithe as a monkey in any normal gravity but on jinx he used a travel couch exactly like mine he studied the busts with his head tilted to one side and i studied the familiar back sure it couldnt be him carlos arent you supposed to be on earth he jumped but when the couch spun around he was grinning bey i might say the same for you i admitted it i was headed for earth but when all those ships started disappearing around sol system the captain changed his mind and steered for sirius nothing any of the passengers could do about it what about you how are sharrol and the kids sharrols fine the kids are fine and theyre all waiting for you to come home his fingers were still trailing over the lloobee touch sculpture called heroes feeling the warm fleshy textures heroes was a most unusual touch sculpture there were visual as well as textural effects carlos studied the two human busts then said thats your face isnt it yeah not that you ever looked that good in your life how did a kdatlyno come to pick beowulf shaeffer as a classic hero was it your name and whos the other guy ill tell you about it sometime carlos what are you doing here i left earth a couple of weeks after louis was born he was embarrassed why i havent been off earth in ten years i needed the break but hed left just before i was supposed to get home and hadnt someone once said that carlos wu had a touch of the flatland phobia i began to understand what was wrong carlos you did sharrol and me a valuable favor he laughed without looking at me men have killed other men for such favors i thought it was tactful to be gone when you came home now i knew carlos was here because the fertility board on earth would not favor me with a parenthood license you cant really blame the board for using any excuse at all to reduce the number of producing parents i am an albino sharrol and i wanted each other but we both wanted children and sharrol cant leave earth she has the flatland phobia the fear of strange air and altered days and changed gravity and black sky beneath her feet the only solution wed found had been to ask a good friend to help carlos wu is a registered genius with an incredible resistance to disease and injury he carries an unlimited parenthood license one of sixtyodd among earths eighteen billion people he gets similar offers every week but he is a good friend and hed agreed in the last two years sharrol and carlos had had two children who were now waiting on earth for me to become their father i felt only gratitude for what hed done for us i forgive you your odd ideas on tact i said magnanimously now as long as were stuck on jinx may i show you around ive met some interesting people you always do he hesitated then im not actually stuck on jinx ive been offered a ride home i may be able to get you in on it oh really i didnt think there were any ships going to sol system these days or leaving this ship belongs to a government man ever heard of a sigmund ausfaller that sounds vaguely wait stop the last time i saw sigmund ausfaller he had just put a bomb aboard my ship carlos blinked at me youre kidding im not sigmund ausfaller is in the bureau of alien affairs bombing spacecraft isnt one of his functions maybe he was off duty i said viciously well it doesnt really sound like youd want to share a spacecraft cabin with him maybe but id thought of something else and now there just wasnt any way out of it no lets meet him where do we find him the bar of the camelot said carlos reclining luxuriously on our travel couches we slid on air cushions through sirius mater the orange trees that lined the walks were foreshortened by gravity their trunks were thick cones and the oranges on the branches were not much bigger than pingpong balls their world had altered them even as our worlds have altered you and me and underground civilization and point six gravities have made of me a pale stick figure of a man tall and attenuated the jinxians we passed were short and wide designed like bricks men and women both among them the occasional offworlder seemed as shockingly different as a kdatlyno or a piersons puppeteer and so we came to the camelot the camelot is a low twostory structure that sprawls like a cubistic octopus across several acres of downtown sirius mater most offworlders stay here for the gravity control in the rooms and corridors and for access to the institute of knowledge the finest museum and research complex in human space the camelot bar carries one earth gravity throughout we left our travel couches in the vestibule and walked in like men jinxians were walking in like bouncing rubber bricks with big happy grins on their wide faces jinxians love low gravity a good many migrate to other worlds we spotted ausfaller easily a rounded moonfaced flatlander with thick dark wavy hair and a thin black mustache he stood as we approached beowulf shaeffer he beamed how good to see you again i believe it has been eight years or thereabouts how have you been i lived i told him carlos rubbed his hands together briskly sigmund why did you bomb beys ship ausfaller blinked in surprise did he tell you it was his ship it wasnt he was thinking of stealing it i reasoned that he would not steal a ship with a hidden time bomb aboard but how did you come into it carlos slid into the booth beside him youre not police youre in the extremely foreign relations bureau the ship belonged to general products corporation which is owned by piersons puppeteers not human beings carlos turned on me bey shame on you damn it they were trying to blackmail me into a suicide mission and ausfaller let them get away with it and thats the least convincing exhibition of tact ive ever seen good thing they soundproof these booths said carlos lets order soundproofing field or not people were staring i sat down when our drinks came i drank deeply why had i mentioned the bomb at all ausfaller was saying well carlos have you changed your mind about coming with me yes if i can take a friend ausfaller frowned and looked at me you wish to reach earth too id made up my mind i dont think so in fact id like to talk you out of taking carlos carlos said hey i overrode him ausfaller do you know who carlos is he had an unlimited parenthood license at the age of eighteen eighteen i dont mind you risking your own life in fact i love the idea but his its not that big a risk carlos snapped yeah what has ausfaller got that eight other ships didnt have two things ausfaller said patiently one is that we will be incoming six of the eight ships that vanished were leaving sol system if there are pirates around sol they must find it much easier to locate an outgoing ship they caught two incoming two ships fifty crew members and passengers gone poof they would not take me so easily ausfaller boasted the hobo kelly is deceptive it seems to be a cargo and passenger ship but it is a warship armed and capable of thirty gees acceleration in normal space we can run from anything we cant fight we are assuming pirates are we not pirates would insist on robbing a ship before they destroy it i was intrigued why why a disguised warship are you hoping youll be attacked if there are actually pirates yes i hope to be attacked but not when entering sol system we plan a substitution a quite ordinary cargo craft will land on earth take on cargo of some value and depart for wunderland on a straightline course my ship will replace it before it has passed through the asteroids so you see there is no risk of losing mr wus precious genes palms flat to the table arms straight carlos stood looming over us diffidently i raise the point that they are my futzy genes and ill do what i futzy please with them bey ive already had my share of children and yours too peace carlos i didnt mean to step on any of your inalienable rights i turned to ausfaller i still dont see why these disappearing ships should interest the extremely foreign relations bureau there were alien passengers aboard some of the ships oh and we have wondered if the pirates themselves are aliens certainly they have a technique not known to humanity of six outgoing ships five vanished after reporting that they were about to enter hyperdrive i whistled they can precipitate a ship out of hyperdrive thats impossible isnt it carlos carloss mouth twisted not if its being done but i dont understand the principle if the ships were just disappearing thatd be different any ship does that if it goes too deep into a gravity well on hyperdrive then maybe it isnt pirates at all carlos could there be living beings in hyperspace actually eating the ships for all of me there could i dont know everything bey contrary to popular opinion but after a minute heshook his head i dont buy it i might buy an uncharted mass on the fringes of sol system ships that came too near in hyperdrive would disappear no said ausfaller no single mass could have caused all of the disappearances charter or not a planet is bounded by gravity and inertia we ran computer simulations it would have taken at least three large masses all unknown all moving into heavy trade routes simultaneously how large mars size or better so you have been thinking about this too carlos smiled yeah it may sound impossible but it isnt its only improbable there are unbelievable amounts of garbage out there beyond neptune four known planets and endless chunks of ice and stone and nickeliron still it is most improbable carlos nodded a silence fell i was still thinking about monsters in hyperspace the lovely thing about that hypothesis was that you couldnt even estimate a probability we knew too little humanity has been using hyperdrive for almost four hundred years now few ships have disappeared in that time except during wars now eight ships in ten months all around sol system suppose one hyperspace beast had discovered ships in this region say during one of the mankzin wars hed gone to get his friends now they were preying around sol system the flow of ships around sol is greater than that around any three colony stars but if more monsters came theyd surely have to move on to the other colonies i couldnt imagine a defense against such things we might have to give up interstellar travel ausfaller said i would be glad if you would change your mind and come with us mr shaeffer um are you sure you want me on the same ship with you oh emphatically how else may i be sure that you have not hidden a bomb aboard ausfaller laughed also we can use a qualified pilot finally i would like the chance to pick your brain beowulf shaeffer you have an odd facility for doing my job for me what do you mean by that general products used blackmail in persuading you to do a close orbit around a neutron star you learned something about their homeworld we still do not know what it was and blackmailed them back we know that blackmail contracts are a normal part of puppeteer business practice you earned their respect you have dealt with them since you have dealt also with outsiders without friction but it was your handling of the lloobee kidnapping that i found impressive carlos was sitting at attention i hadnt had a chance to tell him about that one yet i grinned and said im proud of that myself well you should be you did more than retrieve known spaces top kdatlyno touch sculptor you did it with honor killing one of their number and leaving lloobee free to pursue the others with publicity otherwise the kdatlyno would have been annoyed helping sigmund ausfaller had been the farthest thing from my thoughts for these past eight years yet suddenly i felt damn good maybe it was the way carlos was listening it takes a lot to impress carlos wu carlos said if you thought it was pirates youd come along wouldnt you bey after all they probably cant find incoming ships sure and you dont really believe in hyperspace monsters i hedged not if i hear a better explanation the thing is im not sure i believe in supertechnological pirates either what about those wandering masses carlos pursed his lips said all right the solar system has a good number of planets at least a dozen so far discovered four of them outside the major singularity around sol and not including pluto no we think of pluto as a loose moon of neptune it runs neptune persephone caina antenora ptolemea in order of distance from the sun and the orbits arent flat to the plane of the system persephone is tilted at degrees to the system and retrograde if they find another planet out there theyll call it judecca why hell the four innermost divisions of dantes hell they form a great ice plain with sinners frozen into it stick to the point said ausfaller start with the cometary halo carlos told me its very thin about one comet per spherical volume of the earths orbit mass is denser going inward a few planets some inner comets some chunks of ice and rock all in skewed orbits and still spread pretty thin inside neptune there are lots of planets and asteroids and more flattening of orbits to conform with sols rotation outside neptune space is vast and empty there could be uncharted planets singularities to swallow ships ausfaller was indignant but for three to move into main trade lanes simultaneously its not impossible sigmund the probability infinitesimal right bey its damn near impossible any sane man would assume pirates it had been a long time since i had seen sharrol i was sorely tempted ausfaller have you traced the sale of any of the loot have you gotten any ransom notes convince me ausfaller threw back his head and laughed whats funny we have hundreds of ransom notes any mental deficient can write a ransom note and these disappearances have had a good deal of publicity the demands were a fakes i wish one or another had been genuine a son of the patriarch of kzin was aboard wayfarer when she disappeared as for loot hmm there has been a fall in the black market prices of boosterspice and gem woods otherwise he shrugged there has been no sign of the barr originals or the midas rock or any of the more conspicuous treasures aboard the missing ships then you dont know one way or another no will you go with us i havent decided yet when are you leaving theyd be taking off tomorrow morning from the east end that gave me time to make up my mind after dinner i went back to my room feeling depressed carlos was going that was clear enough hardly my fault but he was here on jinx because hed done me and sharrol a large favor if he was killed going home a tape from sharrol was waiting in my room there were pictures of the children tanya and louis and shots of the apartment shed found us in the twin peaks arcology and much more i ran through it three times then i called ausfallers room it had been just too futzy long i circled jinx once on the way out ive always done that even back when i was flying for nakamura lines and no passenger has ever objected jinx is the close moon of a gas giant planet more massive then jupiter and smaller than jupiter because its core has been compressed to degenerate matter a billion years ago jinx and primary were even closer before tidal drag moved them apart this same tidal force had earlier locked jinxs rotation to primary and forced the moon into an egg shape a prolate spheroid when the moon moved outward its shape became more nearly spherical but the cold rock surface resisted change that is why the ocean of jinx rings its waist beneath an atmosphere too compressed and too hot to breathe whereas the points nearest to and farthest from primary the east and west ends actually rise out of the atmosphere from space jinx looks like gods own easter egg the ends bone white tinged with yellow then the brighter glare from rings of glittering ice fields at the limits of the atmosphere then the varying blues of an earthlike world increasingly overlaid with the white frosting of cloud as the eyes move inward until the waist of the planetmoon is girdled with pure white the ocean never shows at all i took us once around and out sirius has its own share of floating miscellaneous matter cluttering the path to interstellar space i stayed at the controls for most of five days for that reason and because i wanted to get the feel of an unfamiliar ship hobo kelly was a bellylanding job three hundred feet long of triangular cross section beneath an uptilted forwardthrusting nose were big clamshell doors for cargo she had adequate belly jets and a much larger fusion motor at the tail and a line of windows indicating cabins certainly she looked harmless enough and certainly there was deception involved the cabin should have held forty or fifty but there was room only for four the rest of what should have been cabin space was only windows with holograph projections in them the drive ran sure and smooth up to a maximum at ten gravities not a lot for a ship designed to haul massive cargo the cabin gravity held without putting out more than a fraction of its power when jinx and primary were invisible against the stars when sirius was so distant that i could look directly at it i turned to the hidden control panel ausfaller had unlocked for me ausfaller woke up found me doing that and began showing me which did what he had a big xray laser and some smaller laser cannon set for different frequencies he had four selfguided fusion bombs he had a telescope so good that the ostensible ships telescope was only a finder for it he had deep radar and none of it showed beyond the discolored hull ausfaller was armed for bandersnatchi i felt mixed emotions it seemed we could fight anything and run from it too but what kind of enemy was he expecting an through those four weeks in hyperdrive while we drove through the blind spot at three days to the lightyear the topic of the ship eaters reared its disturbing head oh we spoke of other things of music and art and of the latest techniques in animation the computer programs that let you make your own holo flicks almost for lunch money we told stories i told carlos why the kdatlyno lloobee had made busts of me and emil home i spoke of the only time the piersons puppeteers had ever paid off the guarantee on a general products hull after the supposedly indestructible hull had been destroyed by antimatter ausfaller had some good ones a lot more stories than he was allowed to tell i gathered from the way he had to search his memory every time but we kept coming back to the ship eaters it boils down to three possibilities i decided kzinti puppeteers and humans carlos guffawed puppeteers puppeteers wouldnt have the guts i threw them in because they might have some interest in manipulating the interstellar stock market look our hypothetical pirates have set up an embargo cutting sol system off from the outside world the puppeteers have the capital to take advantage of what that does to the market and they need money for their migration the puppeteers are philosophical cowards thats right they wouldnt risk robbing the ships or coming anywhere near them suppose they can make them disappear from a distance carlos wasnt laughing now thats easier than dropping them out of hyperspace to rob them it wouldnt take more than a great big gravity generator and weve never known the limits of puppeteer technology ausfaller asked you think this is possible just barely the same goes for the kzinti the kzinti are ferocious enough trouble is if we ever learned they were preying on our ships wed raise pluperfect hell the kzinti know that and they know we can beat them took them long enough but they learned so you think its humans said carlos yeah if its pirates the piracy theory still looked shaky spectrum telescopes had not even found concentrations of ships metals in the space where they have vanished would pirates steal the whole ship if the hyperdrive motor was still intact after the attack the rifled ship could be launched into infinity but could pirates count on that happening eight times out of eight and none of the missing ships had called for help via hyperwave id never believed pirates space pirates have existed but they died without successors intercepting a spacecraft was too difficult they couldnt make it pay ships fly themselves in hyperdrive all a pilot need do is watch for green radial lines in the masssensor but he has to do that frequently because the mass sensor is a psionic device it must be watched by a mind not another machine as the narrow green line that marked sol grew longer i became abnormally conscious of the debris around sol system i spent the last twelve hours of the flight at the controls chainsmoking with my feet i should add that i do that normally when i want both hands free but now i did it to annoy ausfaller id seen the way his eyes bugged the first time he saw me take a drag from a cigarette between my toes flatlanders are less than limber carlos and ausfaller shared the control room with me as we penetrated sols cometary halo they were relieved to be nearing the end of a long trip i was nervous carlos just how large a mass would it take to make us disappear planet size mars and up beyond that it depends on how close you get and how dense it is if its dense enough it can be less massive and still flip you out of the universe but youd see it in the mass sensor only for an instant and not then if its turned off what if someone turned on a giant gravity generator as we went past for what they couldnt rob the ship wheres their profit stocks but ausfaller was shaking his head the expense of such an operation would be enormous no group of pirates would have enough additional capital on hand to make it worthwhile of the puppeteers i might believe it hell he was right no human that wealthy would need to turn pirate the long green line marking sol was almost touching the surface of the mass sensor i said breakout in ten minutes and the ship lurched savagely strap down i yelled and glanced at the hyperdrive monitors the motor was drawing no power and the rest of the dials were going bananas i activated the windows id kept them turned off in byperspace lest my fladander passengers go mad watching the blind spot the screens came on and i saw stars we were in normal space futz they got us anyway carlos sounded neither frightened nor angry but awed as i raised the hidden panel ausfaller cried wait i ignored him i threw the red switch and hobo kelly lurched again as her belly blew off ausfaller began cursing in some dead flatlander language now twothirds of hobo kelly receded slowly turning what was left must show as what she was a no general products hull puppeteerbuilt a slender transparent spear three hundred feet long and twenty feet wide with instruments of war clustered along what was now her belly screens that had been blank came to life and i lit the main drive and ran it up to full power ausfaller spoke in rage and venom shaeffer you idiot you coward we run without knowing what we run from now they know exactly what we are what chance that they will follow us now this ship was built for a specific purpose and you have ruined it ive freed your special instruments i pointed out why dont you see what you can find meanwhile i could get us the futz out of here ausfaller became very busy i watched what he was getting on screens at my side of the control panel was anything chasing us theyd find us hard to catch and harder to digest they could hardly have been expecting a general products hull since the puppeteers stopped making them the price of used gp hulls has gone out of sight there were ships out there ausfaller got a closeup of them three space tugs of the belter type shaped like thick saucers equipped with oversized drives and powerful electromagnetic generators belters use them to tug nickeliron asteroids to where somebody wants the ore with those heavy drives they could probably catch us but would they have adequate cabin gravity they werent trying they seemed to be neither following nor fleeing and they looked harmless enough but ausfaller was doing a job on them with his other instruments i approved hobo kelly had looked peaceful enough a moment ago now her belly bristled with weaponry the tugs could be equally deceptive from behind me carlos asked bey what happened how the futz would i know what do the instruments show he must mean the hyperdrive complex a couple of the indicators had gone wild five more were dead i said so and the drives drawing no power at all ive never heard of anything like this carlos its still theoretically impossible im not so sure of that i want to look at the drive the access tubes dont have cabin gravity ausfaller had abandoned the receding tugs hed found what looked to be a large comet a ball of frozen gases a good distance to the side i watched as he ran the deep radar over it no fleet of robber ships lurked behind it i asked did you deepradar the tugs of course we can examine the tapes in detail later i saw nothing and nothing has attacked us since we left hyperspace id been driving us in a random direction now i turned us toward sol the brightest star in the heavens those lost ten minutes in hyperspace would add about three days to our voyage if there was an enemy you frightened him away shaeffer this mission and this ship have cost my department an enormous sum and we have learned nothing at all not quite nothing said carlos i still want to see the hyperdrive motor bey would you run us down to one gee yeah but miracles make me nervous carlos join the club we crawled along an access tube just a little bigger than a big mans shoulders between the hyperdrive motor housing and the surrounding fuel fivikage carlos reached an inspection window he looked in he started to laugh i inquired as to what was so futzy funny still chording carlos moved on i crawled after him and looked in there was no hyperdrive motor in the hyperdrive motor housing i went in through a repair hatch and stood in the cylindrical housing looking about me nothing not even an exit hole the superconducting cables and the mounts for the motor had been sheared so cleanly that the cut ends looked like little mirrors ausfaller insisted on seeing for himself carlos and i waited in the control room for a while carlos kept bursting into fits of giggles then he got a dreamy faraway look that was even more annoying i wondered what was going on in his head and reached the uncomfortable conclusion that i could never know some years ago i took iq tests hoping to get a parenthood license that way i am not a genius i knew only that carlos had thought of something i hadnt and he wasnt telling and i was too proud to ask ausfaller had no pride he came back looking like hed seen a ghost gone where could it go how could it happen that i can answer carlos said happily it takes an extremely high gravity gradient the motor hit that wrapped space around itself and took off at some higher level of hyperdrive one we cant reach by now it could be well on its way to the edge of the universe i said youre sure huh an hour ago there wasnt a theory to cover any of this well im sure our motors gone beyond that it gets a little hazy but this is one wellestablished model of what happens when a ship hits a singularity at a lower gravity gradient the motor would take the whole ship with it then strew atoms of the ship along its path till there was nothing left but the hyperdrive field itself ugh now carlos burned with the love of an idea sigmund i want to use your hyperwave i could still be wrong but there are things we can check if we are still within the singularity of some mass the hyperwave will destroy itself yeah i think its worth the risk wed dropped out or been knocked out ten minutes short of the singularity around sol that added up to sixteen lighthours of normal space plus almost five lighthours from the edge of the singularity inward to earth fortunately hyperwave is instantaneous and every civilized system keeps a hyperwave relay station just oumide the singularity southworth station would relay our message inward by laser get the return message the same way and pass it on to us ten hours later we turned on the hyperwave and nothing exploded ausfaller made his own call first to ceres to get the registry of the tugs wed spotted afterward carlos called elephants computer setup in new york using a code number elephant doesnt give to many people ill pay him back later maybe with a story to go with it he gloated i listened as carlos outlined his needs he wanted full records on a meteorite that had touched down in tunguska siberia ussr earth in ad he wanted a reprise on three models of the origin of the universe or lack of same the big bang the cyclic universe and the steady state universe he wanted data on collapsars he wanted names career outlines and addresses for the best known students of gravitational phenomena in sol system he was smiling when he clicked off i said you got me i havent the remotest idea what youre after still smiling carlos got up and went to his cabin to catch some sleep i turned off the main thrust motor entirely when we were deep in sol system we could decelerate at thirty gravities meanwhile we were carrying a hefty velocity picked up on our way out of sirius system ausfaller stayed in the control room maybe his motive was the same as mine no police ships out here we could still be attacked he spent the time going through his pictures of the three mining tugs we didnt talk but i watched the tugs seemed ordinary enough telescopic photos showed no suspicious breaks in the hulls no hatches for guns in the deepradar scan they showed like ghosts we could pick out the massive forcefield rings the hollow equally massive drive tubes the lesser densities of fuel tank and lifesupport system there were no gaps or shadows that shouldnt have been there by and by ausfaller said do you know what hobo kelly was worth i said i could make a close estimate it was worth my career i thought to destroy a pirate fleet with hobo kelly but my pilot fled fled what have i now to show for my expensive trojan horse i suppressed the obvious answer along with the plea that my first responsibility was carloss life ausfaller wouldnt buy that instead carlos has something i know him he knows how it happened can you get it out of him i dont know i could put it to carlos that wed be safer if we knew what was out to get us but carlos was a flatlander it would color his attitudes so said ausfaller we have only the unavailable knowledge in carloss skull a weapon beyond human technology had knocked me out of hyperspace id run of course id run staying in the neighborhood would have been insane said i to myself said i but unreasonably i still felt bad about it to ausfaller i said what about the mining tugs i cant understand what theyre doing out here in the belt they use them to move nickeliron asteroids to industrial sites it is the same here most of what they find is useless stony masses or balls of ice but what little metal there is is valuable they must have it for building for building what what kind of people would live here you might as well set up shop in interstellar space precisely there are no tourists but there are research groups here where space is flat and empty and temperatures are near absolute zero i know that the quicksilver group was established here to study hyperspace phenomena we do not understand hyperspace even yet remember that we did not invent the hyperdrive we bought it from an alien race then there is a genetailoring laboratory trying to develop a kind of tree that will grow on comets youre kidding but they are serious a photosynthetic plant to use the chemicals present in all comets it would be very valuable the whole cometary halo could be seeded with oxygenproducing plants ausfaller stopped abruptly then never mind but all these groups need building materials it is cheaper to build out here than to ship everything from earth or the belt the presence of tugs is not suspicious but there was nothing else around us nothing at all ausfaller nodded when carlos came to join us many hours later blinking sleep out of his eyes i asked him carlos could the tugs have had anything to do with your theory i dont see how ive got half an idea and half an hour from now i could look like a halfwit the theory i want isnt even in fashion anymore now that we know what the quasars are everyone seems to like the steady state hypothesis you know how that works the tension in completely empty space produces more hydrogen atoms forever the universe has no beginning and no end he looked stubborn but if im right then i know where the ships went to after being robbed thats more than anyone else knows ausfaller jumped on him where are they are the passengers alive im sorry sigmund theyre all dead there wont even be bodies to bury what is it what are we fighting a gravitational effect a sharp warping of space a planet wouldnt do that and a battery of cabin gravity generators wouldnt do it they couldnt produce that sharply bounded a field a collapsar ausfaller suggested carlos grinned at him that would do it but there are other problems a collapsar cant even form at less than around five solar masses youd think someone would have noticed something that big this close to sol then what carlos shook his head we would wait the relay from southworth station gave us registration for three space tugs used and of varying ages all three purchased two years ago from intrabelt mining by the sixth congregational church of rodney rodney but carlos and ausfaller were both chortling belters do that sometimes carlos told me its a way of saying its nobodys business whos buying the ships thats pretty funny all right but we still dont know who owns them they may be honest belters they may not hard on the heels of the first call came the data carlos had asked for playing directly into the shipboard computer carlos called up a list of names and phone numbers sol systems preeminent students of gravity and its effects listed in alphabetical order an address caught my attention julian forward southworth station a hyperwave relay tag he was out here somewhere in the enormous gap between neptunes orbit and the cometary belt out here where the hyperwave relay could function i looked for more southworth station numbers they were there launcelot starkey southworth station jill luciano southworth station mariana wilton southworth station these people said ausfaller you wish to discuss your theory with one of them thats right sigmund isnt the tag for the quicksilver group i think so i also think that they are not within our reach now that our hyperdrive is gone the quicksilver group was established in distant orbit around antenora which is now on the other side of the sun carlos has it occurred to you that one of these people may have built the shipeating device what youre right it would take someone who knew something about gravity but id say the quicksilver group was beyond suspicion with upwards of ten thousand people at work how could anyone hide anything what about this julian forward forward yeah ive always wanted to meet him you know of him who is he he used to be with the institute of knowledge on jinx i havent heard of him in years he did some work on the gravity waves from the galactic core work that turned out to be wrong sigmund lets give him a call and ask him what why then carlos remembered the situation oh you think he might yeah how well do you know this man i know him by reputation hes quite famous i dont see how such a man could go in for mass murder earlier you said that we were looking for a man skilled in the study of gravitational phenomena granted ausfaller sucked at his lower lip then perhaps we can do no more than talk to him he could be on the other side of the sun and still head a pirate fleet no that he could not think again said ausfaller we are outside the singularity of sol a pirate fleet would surely include hyperdrive ships if julian forward is the ship eater hell have to be nearby the uh device wont move in hyperspace i said carlos what we dont know can kill us will you quit playing games but he was smiling shaking his head futz all right we can still check on forward call him up and ask where he is is he likely to know you by reputation sure im famous too okay if hes close enough we might even beg him for a ride home the way things stand well be at the mercy of any hyperdrive ship for as long as were out here i hope we are attacked said ausfaller we can outfight but we cant outrun they can dodge we cant peace you two first things first carlos sat down at the hyperwave controls and tapped out a number suddenly ausfaller said can you contrive to keep my name out of this exchange if necessary you can be the ships owner carlos looked around in surprise before he could answer the screen lit i saw ashblond hair cut in a belter crest over a lean white face and an impersonal smile forward station good evening good evening this is carlos wu of earth calling long distance may i speak to dr julian forward please ill see if hes available the screen went on hold in the interval carlos burst out what kind of game are you playing now how can i explain owning an armed disguised warship but i began to see what ausfaller was getting at i said youd want to avoid explaining that whatever the truth was maybe he wont ask i i shut up because we were facing forward julian forward was a jinxian short and wide with arms as thick as legs and legs as thick as pillars his skin was almost as black as his hair a sirius suntan probably maintained by sunlights he perched on the edge of a massage chair carlos wu he said with flattering enthusiasm are you the same carlos wu who solved the sealeyharn limits problem carlos said he was they went into a discussion of mathematics a possible application of carloss solution to another limits problem i gathered i glanced at ausfaller not obtrusively because for forward he wasnt supposed to exist and saw him pensively studying his side view of forward well forward said what can i do for you julian forward meet beowulf shaeffer said carlos i bowed bey was giving me a lift home when our hyperdrive motor disappeared disappeared i butted in for verisimilitude disappeared futzy right the hyperdrive motor casing is empty the motor supports are sheared off were stuck out here with no hyperdrive and no idea how it happened almost true carlos said happily dr forward i do have some ideas as to what happened here id like to discuss them with you where are you now i pulled our position and velocity from the computer and flashed them to forward station i wasnt sure it was a good idea but ausfaller had time to stop me and he didnt fine said forwards image it looks like you can get here a lot faster than you can get to earth forward station is ahead of you within twenty au of your position you can wait here for the next ferry better than going on in a crippled ship good well work out a course and let you know when to expect us i welcome the chance to meet carlos wu forward gave us his own coordinates and rang off carlos turned all right bey now you own an armed and disguised warship you figure out where you got it weve got worse problems than that forward station is exactly where the ship eater ought to be he nodded but he was amused so whats our next move we cant run from hyperdrive ships not now is forward likely to try to lull usr if we dont reach forward station on schedule he might send ships after us we know too much weve told him so said carlos the hyperdrive motor disappeared completely i know half a dozen people who could figure out how it happened knowing just that he smiled suddenly thats assuming forwards the ship eater we dont know that i think we have a splendid chance to find out one way or the other how just walk in ausfaller was nodding approvingly dr forward expects you and carlos to enter his web unsuspecting leaving an empty ship i think we can prepare a few surprises for him for example he may not have guessed that this is a general products hull and i will be aboard to fight true only antimatter could harm a gp hull though things could go through it like light and gravity and shock waves so youll be in the indestructible hull i said and well be helpless in the base very clever id rather run for it myself but then you have your career to consider i will not deny it but there are ways in which i can prepare you behind ausfallers cabin behind what looked like an unbroken wall was a room the size of a walkin closet ausfaller seemed quite proud of it he didnt show us everything in there but i saw enough to cost me what remained of my first impression of ausfaller this man did not have the soul of a pudgy bureaucrat behind a glass panel he kept a couple of dozen specialpurpose weapons a row of four clamps held three identical hand weapons disposable rocket launchers for a fat slug that ausfaller billed as a tiny atomic bomb the fourth clamp was empty there were laser rifles and pistols a shotgun of peculiar design with four inches of recoil shock absorber throwing knives an olympic target pistol with a sculpted grip and room for just one bullet i wondered what he was doing with a hobbyists touchsculpting setup maybe he could make sculptures to drive a human or an alien mad maybe something less subtle maybe theyd explode at the touch of the right fingerprints he had a compact automated tailors shop im going to make you some new suits he said when carlos asked why he said you can keep secrets so can i he asked us for our preference in styles i played it straight asking for a falling jumper in green and silver with lots of pockets it wasnt the best ive ever owned but it fit i didnt ask for buttons i told him i hope you dont mind carlos you will have buttons too carlos chose a fiery red tunic with a green and gold dragon coiling across the back the buttons carried his family monogram ausfaller stood before us examining us in our new finery with approval now watch he said here i stand before you unarmed right sure you are ausfaller grinned he took the top and bottom buttons between his fingers and tugged hard they came off the material between them ripped open as if a thread had been strung between them holding the buttons as if to keep an invisible thread taut he moved them to either side of a crudely done plastic touch sculpture the sculpture fell apart sinclair molecule chain it will cut through any normal matter if you pull hard enough you must be very careful it will cut your fingers so easily that you will hardly notice they are gone notice that the buttons are large to give an easy grip he laid the buttons carefully on a table and set a heavy weight between diem this third button down is a sonic grenade ten feet away it will kill thirty feet away it will stun i said dont demonstrate you may want to practice throwing dummy buttons at a target this second button is power pill the commercial stimulant break the button and take half when you need it the entire dose may stop your heart i never heard of power pill how does it work on crashlanders he was taken aback i dont know perhaps you had better restrict yourself to a quarter dose or avoid it entirely i said there is one more thing i will not demonstrate feel the material of your garments you feel three layers of material the middle layer is a nearly perfect mirror it will reflect even x rays now you can repel a laser blast for at least the first second the collar unrolls to a hood carlos was nodding in satisfaction i guess its true all flatlanders think that way for a billion and a half years humanitys ancestors had evolved to the conditions of one world earth a flatlander grows up in an environment peculiarly suited to him instinctively he sees the whole universe the same way we know better we who were born on other worlds on we made it there are the hellish winds of summer and winter on jinx the gravity on plateau the allencircling cliff edge and a drop of forty miles into unbearable heat and pressure on down the red sunlight and plants that will not grow without help from ultraviolet lamps but flatlanders think the universe was made for their benefit to them danger is unreal earplugs said ausfaller holding up a handful of soft plastic cylinders we inserted them ausfaller said can you hear me sure yeah they didnt block our hearing at all transmitter and hearing aid with sonic padding between if you are blasted with sound as by an explosion or a sonic stunner the hearing aid will stop transmitting if you go suddenly deaf you will know you are under attack to me ausfallers elaborate precautions only spoke of what we might be walking into i said nothing if we ran for it our chances were even worse back to the control room where ausfaller set up a relay to the bureau of alien affairs on earth he gave them a condensed version of what had happened to us plus some cautious speculation he invited carlos to read his theories into the record carlos declined i could still be wrong give me a chance to do some studying ausfaller went grumpily to his bunk he had been up too long and it showed carlos shook his head as ausfaller disappeared into his cabin paranoia in his job i guess he has to be paranoid you could use some of that yourself he didnt hear me imagine suspecting an interstellar celebrity of being a space pirate hes in the right place at the right time hey bey forget what i said the uh shipeating device has to be in the right place but the pirates dont they can just leave it loose and use hyperdrive ships to commute to their btase that was something to keep in mind compared to the inner system this volume within the cometary halo was enormous but to hyperdrive ships it was all one neighborhood i said then why are we visiting forward i still want to check my ideas with him more than that he probably knows the head ship eater without knowing its him probably we both know him it took something of a cosmologist to find the device and recognize it whoever it is he has to have made something of a name for himself find carlos grinned at me never mind have you thought of anyone youd like to use that magic wire on ive been making a list youre at the top well watch it sigmund knows youve got it even if nobody else does hes second how long till we reach forward station id been rechecking our course we were decelerating at thirty gravities and veering to one side twenty hours and a few minutes i said good ill get a chance to do some studying he began calling up data from the computer i asked permission to read over his shoulder he gave it bastard he reads twice as fast as i do i tried to skim to get some idea of what he was after collapsars three known the nearest was one component of a double in cygnus more than a hundred lightyears away expeditions had gone there to drop probes the theory of the black hole wasnt new to me though the math was over my head if a star is massive enough then after it has burned its nuclear fuel and started to cool no possible internal force can hold it from collapsing inward past its own swartzchild radius at that point the escape velocity from the star becomes greater than lightspeed and beyond that deponent sayeth not because nothing can leave the star not information not matter not radiation nothing except gravity such a collapsed star can be expected to weigh five solar masses or more otherwise its collapse would stop at the neutron star stage afterward it can only grow bigger and more massive there wasnt the slightest chance of finding anything that massive out here at the edge of the solar system if such a thing were anywhere near the sun would have been in orbit around it the siberia meteorite must have been weird enough to be remembered for nine hundred years it had knocked down trees over thousands of square miles yet trees near the touchdown point were left standing no part of the meteorite itself had ever been found nobody had seen it hit in tunguska siberia must have been as sparsely settled as the earths moon is today carlos what does all this have to do with anything does holmes tell watson i had real trouble following the cosmology physics verged on philosophy here or vice versa basically the big bang theory which pictures the universe as exploding from a single point mass like a titanic bomb was in competition with the steady state universe which has been going on forever and will continue to do so the cyclic universe is a succession of big bangs followed by contractions there are variants on all of them when the quasars were first discovered they seemed to date from an earlier stage in the evolution of the universe which by the steady state hypothesis would not be evolving at all the steady state went out of fashion then a century ago hilbury had solved the mystery of the quasars meanwhile one of the implications of the big bang had not panned out that was where the math got beyond me there was some discussion of whether the universe was open or closed in fourspace but carlos turned it off okay he said with satisfaction what i could be right insufficient data ill have to see what forward thinks i hope you both choke im going to sleep out here in the broad borderland between sol system and interstellar space julian forward had found a stony mass the size of a middling asteroid from a distance it seemed untouched by technology a lopsided spheroid roughsurfaced and dirty white closer in flecks of metal and bright paint showed like randomly placed jewels air locks windows projecting antennae and things less identifiable a lighted disk with something projecting from the center a long metal arm with half a dozen ball joints in it and a cup on the end i studied that one trying to guess what it might be and gave up i brought hobo kelly to rest a fair distance away to ausfaller i said youll stay aboard of course i will do nothing to disabuse dr forward of the notion that the ship is empty we crossed to forward station on an open taxi two seats a fuel tank and a rocket motor once i turned to ask carlos something and asked instead carlos are you all right his face was white and strained ill make it did you try closing your eyes it was worse futz i made it this far on hypnosis bey its so empty hang on were almost there the blond belter was outside one of the air locks in a skintight suit and a bubble helmet he used a flashlight to flag us down we moored our taxi to a spur of rock the gravity was almost nil and went inside im harry moskowitz the belter said they call me angel dr forward is waiting in the laboratory the interior of the asteroid was a network of straight cylindrical corridors laserdrilled pressurized and lined with cool blue light strips we weighed a few pounds near the surface less in the deep interior angel moved in a fashion new to me a flat jump from the floor that took him far down the corridor to brush the ceiling push back to the floor and jump again three jumps and hed wait not hiding his amusement at our attempts to catch up doctor forward asked me to give you a tour he told us i said you seem to have a lot more corridor than you need why didnt you cluster all the rooms together this rock was a mine once upon a time the miners drilled these passages they left big hollows wherever they found airbearing rock or ice pockets all we had to do was wall them off that explained why there was so much corridor between the doors and why the chambers we saw were so big some rooms were storage areas angel said not worth opening others were tool rooms lifesupport systems a garden a fairsized computer a sizable fusion plant a mess room built to hold thirty actually held about ten all men who looked at us curiously before they went back to eating a hangar bigger than need be and open to the sky housed taxis and powered suits with specialized tools and three identical circular cradles all empty i gambled carefully casual i asked you use mining tugs angel didnt hesitate sure we can ship water and metals up from the inner system but its cheaper to hunt them down ourselves in an emergency the tugs could probably get us back to the inner system we moved back into the tunnels angel said speaking of ships i dont think ive ever seen one like yours were those bombs lined up along the ventral surface some of them i said carlos laughed bey wont tell me how he got it pick pick pick all right i stole it i dont think anyone is going to complain angel frankly curious before was frankly fascinated as i told the story of how i had been hired to fly a cargo ship in the wunderland system i didnt much like the looks of the guy who hired me but what do i know about wunderlanders besides i needed the money i told of my surprise at the proportions of the ship the solid wall behind the cabin the passenger section that was only holographs in blind portholes by then i was already afraid that if i tried to back out id be made to disappear but when i learned my destination i got really worried it was in the serpent stream you know the crescent of asteroids in wunderland system its common knowledge that the free wunderland conspiracy is all through those rocks when they gave me my course i just took off and aimed for sirius strange they left you with a working hyperdrive man they didnt theyd ripped out the relays i had to fix them myself its lucky i looked because they had the relays wired to a little bomb under the control chair i stopped then maybe i fixed it wrong you heard what happened my hyperdrive motor just plain vanished it must have set off some explosive bolts because the belly of the ship blew off it was a dummy whats left looks to be a pocket bomber thats what i thought i guess ill have to turn it in to the goldskin cops when we reach the inner system pity carlos was smiling and shaking his head he covered by saying it only goes to prove that you can run away from your problems the next tunnel ended in a great hemispherical chamber lidded by a bulging transparent dome a manthick pillar rose through the rock floor to a seal in the center of the dome above the seal gleaming against night and stars a multijointed metal arm reached out blindly into space the arm ended in what might have been a tremendous iron puppy dish forward was in a horseshoeshaped control console near the pillar i hardly noticed him id seen this armandbucket thing before coming in from space but i hadnt grasped its size forward caught me gaping the grabber he said he approached us in a bouncing walk comical but effective pleased to meet you carlos wu beowulf shaeffer his handshake was not crippling because he was being careful he had a wide engaging smile the grabber is our main exhibit here after the grabber theres nothing to see i asked what does it do carlos laughed its beautiful why does it have to do anything forward acknowledged the compliment ive been thinking of entering it in a junksculpture show what it does is manipulate large dense masses the cradle at the end of the arm is a complex of electromagnets i can actually vibrate masses in there to produce polarized giaivity waves six massive arcs of girder divided the dome into pie sections now i noticed that they and the seal at their center gleamed like mirrors they were reinforced by stasis fields more bracing for the grabber i tried to imagine forces that would require such strength what do you vibrate in there a megaton of lead lead sheathed in soft iron was our test mass but that was three years ago i havent worked with the grabber lately but we had some satisfactory runs with a sphere of neutronium enclosed in a stasis field ten billion metric tons i said whats the point from carlos i got a dirty look forward seemed to think it was a wholly reasonable question communication for one thing there must be intelligent species all through the galaxy most of them too far away for our ships gravity waves are probably the best way to reach them gravity waves travel at lightspeed dont they wouldnt hyperwave be better we cant count on their having it who but the outsiders would think to do their experimenting this far from a sun if we want to reach beings who havent dealt with the outsiders well have to use gravity waves once we know how angel offered us chairs and refreshments by the time we were settled i was already out of it forward and carlos were talking plasma physics metaphysics and what are our old friends doing i gathered that they had large numbers of mutual acquaintances and carlos was probing for the whereabouts of cosmologists specializing in gravity physics a few were in the quicksilver group others were among the colony worlds especially on jinx trying to get the institute of knowledge to finance various projects such as more expeditions to the collapsar in cygnus are you still with the institute doctor forward shook his head they stopped backing me not enough results but i can continue to use this station which is institute property one day theyll sell it and well have to move i was wondering why they sent you here in the first place said carlos sirius has an adequate cometary belt but sol is the only system with any kind of civilization this far from its sun and i can count on better men to work with sol system has always had its fair share of cosmologists i thought you might have come to solve an old mystery the tunguska meteorite youve heard of it of course forward laughed of course who hasnt i dont think well ever know just what it was that hit siberia that night it may have been a chunk of antimatter im told that there is antimatter in known space if it was well never prove it carlos admitted shall we discuss your problem forward seemed to remember my existence shaeffer what does a professional pilot think when his hyperdrive motor disappears he gets very upset any theories i decided not to mention pirates i wanted to see if forward would mention them first nobody seems to like my theory i said and i sketched out the argument for monsters in hyperspace forward heard me out politely then ill give you this itd be hard to disprove do you buy it im afraid to i almost got myself killed once looking for space monsters when i should have been looking for natural causes why would the hyperspace monsters eat only your motor um futz i pass what do you think carlos natural phenomena or space monsters pirates said carlos how are they going about it well this business of a hyperdrive motor disappearing and leaving the ship behind thats brand new id think it would take a sharp gravity gradient with a tidal effect as strong as that of a neutron star or a black hole you wont find anything like that anywhere in human space i know carlos looked frustrated that had to be faked earlier hed behaved as if he already had an answer forward said i dont think a black hole would have that anyway if it did youd never know it because the ship would disappear down the black hole what about a powerful gravity generator hmmm forward thought about it then shook his massive head youre talking about a surface gravity in the millions any gravity generator ive ever heard of would collapse itself at that level lets see with a frame supported by stasis fields no the frame would hold and the rest of the machinery would flow like water you dont leave much of my theory sorry carlos ended a short pause by asking how do you think the universe started forward looked puzzled at the change of subject and i began to get uneasy given all that i dont know about cosmology i do know attitudes and tones of voice carlos was giving out broad hints trying to lead forward to his own conclusion black holes pirates the tunguska meteorite the origin of the universe he was offering them as clues and forward was not responding correctly he was saying ask a priest me i lean toward the big bang the steady state always seemed so futile i like the big bang too said carlos there was something else to worry about those mining tugs they almost had to belong to forward station how would ausfaller react when three familiar spacecraft came cruising into his space how did i want him to react forward station would make a dandy pirate base permeated by laserdrilled corridors distributed almost at random could there be two networks of corridors connected only at the surface how would we know suddenly i didnt want to know i wanted to go home if only carlos would stay off the touchy subjects but he was speculating about the ship eater again that ten billion metric tons of neutronium now that you were using for a test mass that wouldnt be big enough or dense enough to give us enough of a gravity gradient it might right near the surface forward grinned and held his hands close together it was about that big and thats as dense as matter gets in this universe too bad true but have you ever heard of quantum black holes yeah forward stood up briskly wrong answer i rolled out of my web chair trying to brace myself for a jump while my fingers fumbled for the third button on my jumper it was no good i hadnt practiced in this gravity forward was in midleap he slapped carlos alongside the head as he went past he caught me at the peak of his jump and took me with him via an iron grip on my wrist i had no leverage but i kicked at him he didnt even try to stop me it was like fighting a mountain he gathered my wrists in one hand and towed me away forward was busy he sat within the horseshoe of his control console talking the backs of three disembodied heads showed above the consoles edge evidently there was a laser phone in the console i could hear parts of what forward was saying he was ordering the pilots of the dime mining tugs to destroy hobo kelly he didnt seem to know about ausfaller yet forward was busy but angel was studying us thoughtfully or unhappily or both well he might we could disappear but what messages might we have sent earlier i couldnt do anything constructive with angel watching me and i couldnt count on carlos i couldnt see carlos forward and angel had tied us to opposite sides of the central pillar beneath the grabber carlos hadnt made a sound since then he might be dying from that tremendous slap across the head i tested the line around my wrists metal mesh of some kind cool to the touch and it was tight forward turned a switch the heads vanished it was a moment before he spoke youve put me in a very bad position and carlos answered i think you put yourself there that may be you should not have let me guess what you knew carlos said sorry bey he sounded healthy good thats all right i said but whats all the excitement about what has forward got i think hes got the tunguska meteorite no that i do not forward stood and faced us i will admit that i came here to search for the tunguska meteorite i spent several years trying to trace its trajectory after it left earth perhaps it was a quantum black hole perhaps not the institute cut off my funds without warning just as i had found a real quantum black hole the first in history i said that doesnt tell me a lot patience mr shaeffer you know that a black hole may form from the collapse of a massive star good and you know that it takes a body of at least five solar masses it may mass as much as a galaxy or as much as the universe there is some evidence that the universe is an infalling black hole but at less than five solar masses the collapse would stop at the neutron star stage i follow you in all the history of the universe there has been one moment at which smaller black holes might have formed that moment was the explosion of the monoblock the cosmic egg that once contained all the matter in the universe in the ferocity of that explosion there must have been loci of unimaginable pressure black holes could have formed of mass down to two point two times ten to the minus fifth grams one point six times ten to the minus twentyfifth angstroms in radius of course youd never detect anything that small said carlos he seemed almost cheerful i wondered why and then i knew hed been right about the way the ships were disappearing it must compensate him for being tied to a pillar but said forward black holes of all sizes could have formed in that explosion and should have in more than seven hundred years of searching no quantum black hole has ever been found most cosmologists have given up on them and on the big bang too carlos said of course there was the tunguska meteorite it could have been a black hole of oh asteroidal mass and roughly molecular size but the tide would have pulled down trees as it went past and the black hole would have gone right through the earth and headed back into space a few tons heavier eight hundred years ago there was actually a search for the exit point with that they could have charted a course exactly but i had to give up that approach said forward i was using a new method when the institute ah severed our relationship they must both be mad i thought carlos was tied to a pillar and forward was about to kill him yet they were both behaving like members of a very exclusive club to which i did not belong carlos was interested howd you work it you know that it is possible for an asteroid to capture a quantum black hole in its interior for instance at a mass of ten to the twelfth kilograms a billion metric tons he added for my benefit a black hole would be only one point five times ten to the minus fifth angstroms across smaller than an atom in a slow pass through an asteroid it might absorb a few billions of atoms enough to slow it into an orbit thereafter it might orbit within the asteroid for eons absorbing very little mass on each pass so if i chance on an asteroid more massive than it ought to be and if i contrive to move it and some of the mass stays behind youd have to search a lot of asteroids why do it out here why not the asteroid belt oh of course you can use hyperdrive out here exactly we could search a score of masses in a day using very little fuel hey if it was big enough to eat a spacecraft why didnt it eat the asteroid you found it in it wasnt that big said forward the black hole i found was exactly as i have described it i enlarged it i towed it home and ran it into my neutroniurn sphere then it was large enough to absorb an asteroid now it is quite a massive object ten to the twentieth power kilograms the mass of one of the larger asteroids and a radius of just under ten to the minus fifth centimeters there was satisfaction in forwards voice in carloss there was suddenly nothing but contempt you accomplished all that and then you used it to rob ships and bury the evidence is that whats going to happen to us down the rabbit hole to another universe perhaps where does a black hole lead i wondered about that myself angel had taken forwards place at the control console he had fastened the seat belt something i had not seen forward do and was dividing his attention between the instruments and the conversation im still wondering how you move it said carlos then uh the tugs forward stared then guffawed you didnt guess that but of course the black hole can hold a charge i played the exhaust from an old ion drive reaction motor into it for nearly a month now it holds an enormous charge the tugs can pull it well enough i wish i had more of them soon i will just a minute i said id grasped one crucial fact as it had gone past my head the tugs arent armed all they do is pull the black hole thats right forward looked at me curiously and the black hole is invisible yes we tug it into the path of a spacecraft if the craft comes near enough it will precipitate into normal space we guide the black hole through its drive to cripple it board and rob it at our leisure then a slower pass with the quantum black hole and the ship simply disappears just one last question said carlos why i had a better question just what was ausfaller going to do when three familiar spacecraft came near they carried no armaments at all their only weapon was invisible and it would eat a general products hull without noticing would ausfaller fire on unarmed ships wed know too soon up there near the edge of the dome i had spotted three tiny lights in a tight cluster angel had seen it too he activated the phone phantom heads appeared one two three i turned back to forward and was startled at the brooding hate in his expression fortunes child he said to carlos natural aristocrat certified superman why would you ever consider stealing anything women beg you to give them children in person if possible by mail if not earths resources exist to keep you healthy not that you need them this may startle you said carlos but there are people who see you as a superman we bred for strength we jinxians at what cost to other factors our lives are short even with the aid of boosterspice longer if we live outside jinxs gravity but the people of other worlds think were funny the women never mind he brooded then said it anyway a woman of earth once told me she would rather go to bed with a tunneling machine she didnt trust my strength what woman would the three bright dots had nearly reached the center of the dome i saw nothing between diem i hadnt expected to angel was still talking to the pilots up from the edge of the dome came something i didnt want anyone to notice i said is that your excuse for mass murder forward lack of women i need give you no excuses at all shaeffer my world will thank me for what ive done earth has swallowed the lions share of the interstellar trade for too long theyll thank you huh youre going to tell them julian that was angel calling hed seen it no he hadnt one of the tug captains had forward left us abruptly he consulted with angel in low tones then turned back carlos did you leave your ship on automatic or is there someone else aboard im not required to say said carlos i could no in a minute it will not matter angel said julian look what hes doing yes very clever only a human pilot would think of that ausfaller had maneuvered the hobo kelly between us and the tugs if the tugs fired a conventional weapon theyd blast the dome and kill us all the tugs came on he still does not know what he is fighting forward said with some satisfaction true and it would cost him three unarmed tugs were coming down ausfallers throat carrying a weapon so slow that the tugs could throw it at him let it absorb hobo kelly and pick it up again long before it was a danger to us from my viewpoint hobo kelly was a bright point with three dimmer more distant points around it forward and angel were getting a better view through the phone and they werent watching us at all i began trying to kick off my shoes they were soft ship slippers anklehigh and they resisted i kicked the left foot fire just as one of the tugs flared with ruby light he did it carlos didnt know whether to be jubilant or horrified he fired on unarmed ships forward gestured peremptorily angel slid out of his seat forward slid in and fastened the thick seat belt neither had spoken a word a second ship burned fiercely red then expanded in a pink cloud the third ship was fleeing forward worked the controls i have it in the mass indicator he rasped we have but one chance so did i i peeled the other slipper off with my toes over our heads the jointed arm of the grabber began to swing and i suddenly realized what they were talking about now there was little to see beyond the dome the swinging grabber and the light of hobo kellys drive and the two tumbling wrecks all against a background of fixed stars suddenly one of the tugs winked bluewhite and was gone not even a dust cloud was left behind ausfaller must have seen it he was turning fleeing then it was as if an invisible hand had picked up hobo kelly and thrown her away the fusion light streaked off to one side and set beyond the domes edge with two tugs destroyed and the third fleeing the black hole was falling free aimed straight down our throats now there was nothing to see but the delicate motions of the grabber angel stood behind forwards chair his knuckles white with his grip on the chairs back my few pounds of weight went away and left me in freefall tides again the invisible thing was more massive than this asteroid beneath me the grabber swung a meter more to one side and something struck it a mighty blow the floor surged away from beneath me left me head down above the grabber the huge softiron puppy dish came at me the jointed metal arm collapsed like a spring it slowed stopped you got it angel crowed like a rooster and slapped at the back of the chair holding himself down with his other hand he turned a gloating look on us turned back just as suddenly the ship its getting away no forward was bent over the console i see him good he is coming back straight toward us this time there will be no tugs to warn the pilot the grabber swung ponderously toward the point where id seen hobo kelly disappear it moved centimeters at a time pulling a massive invisible weight and ausfaller was coming back to rescue us hed be a sitting duck unless i reached up with my toes groping for the first and fourth buttons on my falling jumper the weaponry in my wonderful suit hadnt helped me against jinxian strength and speed but flatlanders are less than limber and so are jinxians forward had tied my hands and left it at that i wrapped two sets of toes around the buttons and tugged my legs were bent pretzelfashion i had no leverage but the first button tore loose and then the thread another invisible weapon to battle forwards portable bottomless hole the thread pulled the fourth button loose i brought my feet down to where they belonged keeping the thread taut and pushed backward i felt the sinclair molecule chain sinking into the pillar the grabber was still swinging when the thread was through the pillar i could bring it up in back of me and try to cut my bonds more likely id cut my wrists and bleed to death but i had to try i wondered if i could do anything before forward launched the black hole a cold breeze caressed my feet i looked down thick fog boiled out around the pillar some very cold gas must be spraying through the hairfine crack i kept pushing more fog formed the cold was numbing i felt the jerk as the magic thread cut through now the wrists liquid helium forward had moored us to the main superconducting power cable that was probably a mistake i pulled my feet forward carefully steadily feeling the thread bite through on the return cut the grabber had stopped swinging now it moved on its arm like a blind questing worm as forward made fine adjustments angel was beginning to show the strain of holding himself upside down my feet jerked slightly i was through my feet were terribly cold almost without sensation i let the buttons go left them floating up toward the dome and kicked back hard with my heels something shifted i kicked again thunder and lightning flared around my feet i jerked my knees up to my chin the lightning crackled and flashed white light into the billowing fog angel and forward turned in astonishment i laughed at them letting them see it yes gentlemen i did it on purpose the lightning stopped in the sudden silence forward was screaming know what youve done there was a grinding crunch a shuddering against my back i looked up a piece had been bitten out of the grabber i was upside down and getting heavier angel suddenly pivoted around his grip on forwards chair he hung above the dome above the sky he screamed my legs gripped the pillar hard i felt carloss feet fumbling for a foothold and heard carloss laughter near the edge of the dome a spear of light was rising hobo kellys drive decelerating growing larger otherwise the sky was clear and empty and a piece of the dome disappeared with a snapping sound angel screamed and dropped just above the dome he seemed to flare with blue light he was gone air roared out through the dome and more was disappearing into something that had been invisible now it showed as a blue pinpoint drifting toward the floor forward had turned to watch it fall loose objects fell across the chamber looped around the pinpoint at meteor speed or fell into it with bursts of light every atom of my body felt the pull of the thing the urge to die in an infinite fall now we hung side by side from a horizontal pillar i noted with approval that carloss mouth was wide open like mine to clear his lungs so that they wouldnt burst when the air was gone daggers in my ears and sinuses pressure in my gut forward turned back to the controls he moved one knob hard over then he opened the seat belt and stepped out and up and fell light flared he was gone the lightningcolored pinpoint drifted to the floor and into it above the increasing roar of air i could hear the grumbling of rock being pulverized dwindling as the black hole settled toward the center of the asteroid the air was deadly thin but not gone my lungs thought they were gasping vacuum but my blood was not boiling id have known it so i gasped and kept gasping it was all i had attention for black spots flickered before my eyes but i was still gasping and alive when ausfaller reached us carrying a clear plastic package and an enonnous handgun he came in fast on a rocket backpack even as he decelerated he was looking around for something to shoot he returned in a loop of fire he studied us through his faceplate possibly wondering if we were dead he flipped the plastic package open it was a thin sack with a zipper and a small tank attached he had to dig for a torch to cut our bonds he freed carlos first helped him into the sack carlos bled from the nose and ears he was barely mobile so was i but ausfaller got me into the sack with carlos and zipped it up air hissed in around us i wondered what came next as an inflated sphere the rescue bag was too big for the tunnels ausfaller had thought of that he fired at the dome blasted a gaping hole in it and flew us out on the rocket backpack hobo kelly was grounded nearby i saw that the rescue bag wouldnt fit the air lock either and ausfaller confirmed my worst fear he signaled us by opening his mouth wide then he zipped open the rescue bag and half carried us into the air lock while the air was still roaring out of our lungs when there was air again carlos whispered please dont do that anymore it should not be necessary anymore ausfaller smiled whatever it was you did well done i have two wellequipped autodocs to repair you while you are healing i will see about recovering the treasures within the asteroid carlos held up a hand but no sound came he looked like something risen from the dead blood running from nose and ears mouth wide open one feeble hand raised against gravity one thing ausfaller said briskly i saw many dead men i saw no living ones how many were there am i likely to meet opposition while searching forget it carlos croaked get us out of here now ausfaller frowned what no time get us out ausfaller tasted something sour very well first the autodocs he turned but carloss strengthless hand stopped him futz no i want to see this carlos whispered again ausfaller gave in he trotted off to the control room carlos tottered after him i tottered after them both wiping blood from my nose feeling halfdead myself but id half guessed what carlos expected and i didnt want to miss it we strapped down ausfaller fired the main thruster the rock surged away far enough carlos whispered presently turn us around ausfaller took care of that then what are we looking for youll know carlos was i right to fire on the tugs oh yes good i was worried then forward was the ship eater yeah i did not see him when i came for you where is he ausfaller was annoyed when carlos laughed and more annoyed when i joined him it hurt my throat even so he saved our lives i said he must have turned up the air pressure just before he jumped i wonder why he did that wanted to be remembered said carlos nobody else knew what hed done ahh i looked just as part of the asteroid collapsed into itself leaving a deep crater it moves slower at apogee picks up more matter said carlos what are you talking about later sigmund when my throat grows back forward had a hole in his pocket i said helpfully the other side of the asteroid collapsed for a moment lightning seemed to flare in there then the whole dirty snowball was growing smaller i thought of something carlos had probably missed sigmund has this ship got automatic sunscreens of course weve got there was a universeeating flash of light before the screen went black when the screen cleared there was nothing to see but stars ghost six sigmund ausfaller killed three miners without a thought i said he was right though that weapons shop he built aboard hobo kelly he was in love with it no sane man toys with such things saved your life he was wearing an asymmetrical beard when i first saw him hes too short and stocky to pass for a wunderlander ive wondered about that for twelve years none of my business nor yours ander said maybe someone was supposed to take him for a gullible tourist or a fool or a crazy hes not to be trusted ander ander laughed suddenly stared me in the face and laughed harder thats it he needed to look crazy he needed to look crazy enough to plant a bomb aboard a crashlanders ship all i had for answer was a wordless snarl tanj he could even be right our dinners arrived and anders chuckle died he stared at what was on my plate crew snapper is a sea creature as big as a short mans leg with rows of fins down each side and a jaw built to crush bones it took up most of the table it was hideous have some i said its an order for two we ate in silence for a bit anders eyes kept straying to the crew snapper he wouldnt touch it he wouldnt speak of it presently he said for the record any further contact with piersons puppeteers i said ander this was an amazing expenditure just so you can hear beowulf shaeffers barroom description of a species that no longer deals with any known world ander smittarasheed nodded what if i say i talked sigmund ausfaller out of a free vacation maybe if i didnt know you were recording he was losing patience any further contact none ive seen enough kzinti to last me dont they scare the arm anymore ander smittarasheed said you wouldnt remember the old soviet union they used a technical term that translates as neutral neutral was any nation that could not conceivably damage the soviet union puppeteers think like that if you can hurt them you have to be rendered neutral better keep an eye on the planets theyll be passing on their way to nowhere theyll be in range of some patriarchy worlds including at least three slave species after that theyre out of known space and the core explosion is twenty thousand years away theyll have to turn first plenty of time yeah ander i set down my hashi never mind what theyre moving at near lightspeed through normal space everything comes on as gamma rays at that velocity those planets are repelling gamma rays thatll make the core explosion look sickly he stared but they could have built whatever built it and never if they can shield planets against gamma rays they didnt need to go i felt a grin pulling my lips wayyy back ander had lost his aplomb i wondered what are they running from then what are they up to maybe its not dependable this shield no thats stupid he said i dug into my fish letting him run on so what are they running from i said enjoying myself consider this puppeteers dont like hyperdrive humans do kzinti do by the time their traveling worlds reach the clouds of magellan well have been there for thousands of years after all the core explosion is coming for us too we wondered if they didnt like the kzinti for neighbors ander said or humans or all of us together known space seems to be packed with sapient species maybe the rest of the universe isnt like that they could even be running from their own reputation but theyre not ander theyre going too slowly theyd find all of us waiting every species that uses hyperdrive or else something tougher that ate us and theyre not going to where territory is cheap cheap well theyve got their own planets but even outsiders pay rent when they use somebodys sunlight the clouds will be packed with refugee species and locals too if ander i cant see why they would want the clouds of magellan at all they could find something closer something in the plane of the galaxy for the shielding effect maybe a spherical cluster did i mention i was out of the aliens business he scowled yeah and settled down forever except you werent what happened i thought it through before i spoke here was my tale and whatever ander could check had better be the truth we ran i said bad mistake but i still dont know what i could have done differently puppeteers dont come into it or well i got money from them years ago i thought the arm couldnt trace that of course the arm had and it wasnt much but general products had indemnified elephant for his hull and elephant had given that to me when we were ready to flee earth they wouldnt trace that ander said beowulf what if theyve got a lowthrust drive big enough for a planet the outsiders could boost them up to speed theyd use their own drive to turn and then stop over the next two hundred thousand years i thought it over they wouldnt have to depend on anyone else then yeah puppeteers wouldnt trust outsiders for their species survival do you think outsiders trust puppeteers nobody knew very much about outsiders ander theres a place where theres no outsiders what are you thinking close to a sun outsiders and starseeds we only guess at the relationship but the best guess is theyll try to rescue the starseeds stet stet maybe theyll make for the clouds of magellan the shock wave will drive the starseeds ahead of it wherever theyre going there wont be outsiders near the core ander there wont be anybody near the core i was trying to picture it worlds in flight drive up along the galactic pole then turn toward the hub in ten thousand years theyd meet the shock wave from the core explosion i saw it ander a shell of exploding suns fairly tight fairly narrow theyd be through it in another five thousand years the outsiders are gone all the sapient species are gone too dead or fled or hopelessly mutated and still mutating thousands of worlds would have been sterilized maybe millions but theyd still be covered with free oxygen and organic sludge and maybe even deepsea life all ready for easy terraforming thats it theyre headed for the core he said well and thought again and said at least its different is this what you came for beowulf i believe i can tell sigmund it was worth the trip now will you tell me what happened to feather filip and carlos wu yeah and carlos wus autodoc he shrugged it off feather filip vanished from the same time and locale as you and carlos wu and sharrol janss im supposed to find out whos dead it wasnt a slip of the tongue he put the question that brutally quite deliberately maybe it got him what he wanted because the blood was draining out of my face again i found my hand at my throat massaging i said nobody should have to eat with you ander he looked at the monster on my plate and again wouldnt give me the satisfaction whos dead me i said at least carlos you want it from the beginning why not procrustes asleep my mind plays it all back in fragments and dreams from time to time a block of nerves wakes thats some kind of arm weapon move it move it too late blam my head rolls loose on black sand bones shattered ribs and spine fear worse than the agony agony fading and im gone legs try to kick nothing moves again harder move no go the doc floats nicely on the lift plate but its mass is resisting me push voice behind me i turn shes holding some kind of tube blam my head bounces on sand agony flaring sensation fading try to hang on stay lucid but everything turns mellow my balance swings wildly around my inner ear wheres the planets axis fafnir doesnt have polar caps the ancient lander is flying itself carlos looks worried but feathers having the time of her life sprawled across the planets face a hurricane flattened along one edge under the vast cloud fingerprint a ruddy snake divides the blue of a worldgirdling ocean a long narrow continent runs almost pole to pole the lander reenters over featureless ocean nothing down there seems to be looking at us im taking us down fast larger islands have low flat buildings on them pick a little one hover while flame digs the lamplighter pit wider and deeper until the lander sinks into the hole with inches to spare plan a is right on track i remember how plan a ended the surgery program senses my distress and turns me off im in carlos wus doc in the intensive care cavity the surgery program prods my brain running me through my memories maintaining the patterns lest they fuzz out to nothing while my brain and body heal i must be terribly damaged waking was sudden my eyes popped open and i was on my back my nose two inches from glass sunlight glared through scattered clouds display lights glowed above my eyebrows i felt fine charged with energy ye gods how long had i slept all those dreams dream memories i tried to move i was shrinkwrapped in elastic i wiggled my arm up across my chest with considerable effort and up to the displays it took me a few seconds to figure them out biomass tank nearly empty treatment pages of data horrifying terminated successful date ohmygod four months i was out for four months and eleven days i typed open the dark glass lid retracted sunlight flared and i shut my eyes tight after a while i pulled myself over the rim of the intensive care cavity and rolled out my balance was all wrong i landed like a lumpy sack on sand and managed not to yell or swear who might hear sat up squinting painfully and looked around i was still on the island it was weathered coral nearly symmetrical with a central peak the air was sparkling clear and the ocean went on forever with another pair of tiny islands just touching the horizon i was stark naked and white as a bone in the glare of a yellowwhite dwarf sun the air was salty and thick with organic life sea life where was everybody i tried to stand wobbled gave it up and crawled around into the shadow of the doc i still felt an amazing sense of wellbeing as if i could solve anything the universe could throw at me during moments of half wakefulness id somehow worked out where i must be here it stood half coffin and half chemical lab massive and abandoned on the narrow black sand beach a vulnerable place to leave such a valuable thing but this was where id last seen it ready to be loaded into the boat sunlight could damage me in minutes kill me in hours but carlos wus wonderful doc was no ordinary mall autodoctor it was state of the art smarter than me in some respects it would cure anything the sun could do to me i pulled myself to my feet and took a few steps ouch the coral cut my feet the doc could cure that too but it hurt standing i could see most of the island the center bulged up like a volcano fafnir coral builds a flat island with a shallow cone rising at the center a housing for a symbiote the lamplighter id hovered the lander above the cone while belly jets scorched out the lamplighter nest until it was big enough to hold the lander just me and the doc and a dead island id have to live in the doc come out at night like a vampire my chance of being found must be poor if no passing boat had found me in these past fourplus months i climbed the coral cut my hands and feet and knees from the cone id be able to see the whole island the pit was two hundred feet across the bottom was black and smooth and seven or eight feet below me feather had set the lander to melt itself down slowly radiating not much heat over many hours several inches of rainwater now covered the slag and something sprawled in the muck it might be a man a tall man possibly raised in low gravity too tall to be carlos or sharrol or feather and who was left i jumped down landed clumsily on the smooth slag and splashed full length in the water picked myself up unhurt my toes could feel an oblong texture lines and ridges the shapes within the lander that wouldnt melt police could determine what this thing had been if they ever looked but why would they look the water felt good on my burned feet and on my skin i was already burned albinos cant take yellow dwarf sunlight a corpse was no surprise given what i remembered i looked it over it had been wearing local clothing for a man boots loose pants with a rope tie a jacket encrusted with pockets the jacket was pierced with a great ragged hole front and back that could only have been made by feathers horrible arm weapon this close the head id thought it must be under the water but there was no head it all there were clean white bones and a neck vertebra cut smoothly in half i was hyperventilating dizzy i sat down next to the skeleton so that i wouldnt fall these long bones looked more than four months dead years decades wait now wed scorched the nest but there would be lamplighter soldiers left outside they would have swarmed down and stripped the bones i found i was trying to push my back through a wall of fused coral my empty stomach heaved this was much worse than anything id imagined i knew who this was sunlight burned my back my eyes were going wonky in the glare time was not on my side i was going to be much sicker much quicker than i liked i made myself pull the boots loose shook the bones out and put them on they were too big the jacket was a sailors survival jacket local style the shoulders looked padded shoulder floats the front and sides had been all pockets well stuffed but front and back had been tom to confetti i stripped it off him and began searching pockets no wallet no id tissue pack the shrapnel remains of a hand computer several pockets were sealed emergency gear stuff you wouldnt want to open by accident and some of those had survived a knife of exquisite sharpness in a builtin holster pocket torch a ration brick i bit into the brick and chewed while i searched mag specs one lens shattered but i put them on anyway without dark glasses my pink albino eyes would go blind sun block spray unharmed good a pill dispenser broken but in a pocket still airtight better tannin secretion pills the boots were shrinking adapting to my feet it felt friendly reassuring my most intimate friends on this island i was still dizzy better let the doc take care of me now take the pills afterward i shook broken ribs out of the jacket shook the pants empty balled the clothing and tossed it out of the hole tried to follow it my fingers wouldnt reach the rim after all this what a stupid way to die i said to the memory of sharrol janss what do i do now build a ladder out of bones if i got out of this hole id think it through before i ever did anything i knelt i yelled and jumped my fingers palms forearms gripped rough coral i pulled myself out and lay panting sweating bleeding crying i limped back to the doc wearing boots now holding the suit spread above me for a parasol i was feverish with sunbum i couldnt take boots into the icc wait think wind waves i tied the clothes in a bundle around the boots and set it on the doc next to the faceplate i climbed into the intensive care cavity and pulled the lid down sharrol would wait an hour longer if she was still alive and the kids and carlos i did not expect to fall asleep asleep feverish with sunburn the surgery program tickles blocks of nerves plays me like a complex toy in my sleep i feel raging thirst hear a thunderclap taste cinnamon or coffee clench a phantom fist my skin wakes piloerection runs in ripples along my body then a universal tickle then pressure like that feathercrested snakeskin sharrol put me into for carloss party sharrol sliding into her own rainbowscaled bodysuit stopped halfway you dont really want to do this do you ill tough it out how do i look id never developed the least sense of flatlander style sharrol picked my clothes half man half snake she said me like this snakes fitting mate she didnt really no flatlander is as supple as a crashlander raised in earths gravity sharrol was a foot shorter than i and weighed the same as i did stocky the apartment was already in child mode rounded surfaces everywhere and all storage was locked or raised to eyeball height tanya was five and louis was four and both were agile as monkeys i scanned for anything that might be dangerous within their reach louis stared at us solemn awed tanya giggled we must have looked odder than usual though given flatlander styles its a wonder that any kid can recognize its parents why do they change their hair and skin color so often when we hugged them goodbye tanya made a game of tugging my hair out of shape and watching it flow back into a feathery crest we set them down and turned on the playmate program the lobby transfer booth jumped us three time zones east we stepped out into a vestibule facing an arc of picture window a flock of rainbowhued fish panicked at the awful sight and flicked away a huge fish passed in some internal dream for an instant i felt the weight of all those tons of water i looked to see how sharrol was taking it she was smiling admiring carlos lives near the great barrier reef you said you didnt say he lived in it its a great privilege sharrol told me i spent my first thirty years under water but not on the reef the reefs too fragile the un protects it you never told me that she grinned at my surprise my dad had a lobster ranch near boston later i worked for the epcotatlantis police the ecology isnt so fragile there but bey i should take you there i said maybe its why we think alike i grew up underground you cant build aboveground on we made it you told me the winds sharrol this isnt like carlos shed known carlos wu years longer than i had carlos gets an idea and he follows it as far as itll go i dont know what hes onto now maybe hes always wanted to share me with you and he brought a date for um ever met her balance no carlos wont even talk about feather filip he just smiles mysteriously maybe its love the children protect the children where are the children the surgeon must be tickling my adrenal glands im not awake but im frantic and a bit randy too then the sensations ease off the playmate program it guards them and teaches them and plays with them theyll be fine cant take them to carloss place not tonight sharrol was their mother and carlos wu had been their father earths fertility board wont let an albino have children carloss gene pattern they judge perfect hes one of a hundred and twenty flatlanders who carry an unlimited birthright a man can love any child thats hardwired into the brain a man can raise another mans children and accept their father as a friend but theres a barrier thats wired in too sharrol knows shes afraid ill turn prickly and uncivilized and carlos knows so why tonight was billed as a foursome sex and tapas that was a developing custom dinner strung out as a sequence of small dishes between bouts of recreational sex something inherited from the ancient greeks or italians maybe theres something lovers gain from feeding each other feather the memory blurs i wasnt afraid of her then but i am now when i remember feather the surgeon puts me to sleep but the children ive got to remember we were down sharrol was out of the doc but we left louis and tanya frozen we floated their box into the boat feather and i disengaged the lift plate and slid it under the doc beneath that lumpy jacket she moved like a tigress she spoke my name i turned feather carloss sleepfield enclosed most of the bedroom hed hosted bigger parties than this in here tonight we were down to four and a floating chaos of dishes carlos said were mexican shes an arm carlos said feather filip and i were sharing a tamale too spicy for sharrol feather caught me staring and grinned back an arm id expected feather to be striking she wasnt exactly beautiful she was strong lean almost gaunt with prominent tendons in her neck lumps flexing at the corners of her jaws you dont get strength like that without training in illegal martial arts the amalgamated regional militia is the united nations police and the united nations took a powerful interest in carlos wu what was she carloss bodyguard was that how theyd met but whenever one of us spoke of the arm that afternoon feather changed the subject id have thought carlos would orchestrate our sleepfield dance certified genius that he is would he not be superb at that too but feather had her own ideas and carlos let her lead her lovemaking was aggressive and acrobatic i felt her strength that afternoon and my own lack raised as i was in the lower gravity of we made it and three hours passed in that fashion while the wonderful colors of the reef darkened to lightamplified night and then feather reached far out of the field limber as a snake reached inside her backpurse and fiddled and frowned and rolled back and said were shielded carlos said theyll know they know me feather said theyre thinking that i let them use their monitors because im showing off but now were going to try something a little kinky or maybe im just putting them on ive done it before then find a glitch so i can block their gear with something new then they fix it theyll fix this one too but not tonight its just feather coming down after a long week carlos accepted that stet sharrol beowulf do you want to leave earth wed be traveling as a group louis and tanya and the four of us this is for keeps sharrol said i cant carlos knew that he said you can ride in cold sleep homes rotation period is fifty minutes shorter than earths mass the same air about the same tectonic activity is higher so itll smell like theres just a trace of smog carlos we talked this to death a few years ago sharrol was annoyed sure i could live on home i dont like the notion of flying from world to world like a a corpse but id do it but the un doesnt want me emigrating and home wont take flat phobes the flatlander phobia is a bonedeep dread of being cut off from earth fear of flying and or falling is an extreme case but no flat phobe can travel in space you find few flat phobes off earth in fact earthborn are called flatlanders no matter how well they adjust to life elsewhere but feather was grinning at sharrol we go by way of fafnir well get to home as shashters home has already approved us for immigration under the name graynor were all married carlos amplified i said carlos youve been off earth you were on jinx for a year yeah bey sigmund ausfaller and his gnomes never lost track of me the united nations thinks they own my genes im supervised wherever i go but they keep you in luxury i thought and the grass is always greener and feather had her own complaint what do you know about the arm she asked us we listen to the vid sharrol said sharrol dear we vet that stuff the arm decides what you dont get to know about us most of us take psychoactive chemicals to keep us in a properly paranoid mind frame during working hours we stay that way four days then go sane for the weekend if its making us too crazy they retire us feather was nervous and trying to restrain it but now hardedged muscles flexed and her elbows and knees were pulling in protectively against her torso but some of us are born this way we go off chemicals when we go to work the doc doses us back to sanity thursday afternoon ive been an arm schiz for thirtyfive years theyre ready to retire me but theyd never let me go to some other world knowing what i know and they dont want a schiz making babies i didnt say that i could see their point i looked at sharrol and saw hope in the set of her mouth ready to smile but holding off we were being brought into these plans way late rising hackles had pulled me right out of any postcoital glow feather told me theyll never let you go either beowulf and that was nonsense feather ive been off earth three times since i got here dont try for four you know too much you know about the core explosion and diplomatic matters involving alien races ive left earth since and julian forwards work she gave it a dramatic pause well have some advanced weaponry out of that we would not want the kzinti to know about that or the trinocs or certain human domains that last trip do you know how much talking you did while you were on gummidgy and jinx youre a friendly talkative guy with great stories beowulf i shrugged so why trust me with this why didnt you and carlos just go she gestured at carlos he grinned and said i insisted and we need a pilot feather said thats you beowulf but i can bust us loose ive set up something nobody but an arm would ever dream of she told us about it to the kzinti the world was only a number kzinti dont like ocean sports the continent was shasht burrowing murder shasht was nearly lifeless but the air was breathable and the mines were valuable the kzinti had dredged up megatons of sea bottom to fertilize a hunting jungle and they got as far as seeding and planting before the fourth mankzin war after the war humankind took shasht as reparations and named the world fafnir on fafnir feathers investigations found a family of six two men two women two children the graynors were ready to emigrate local law would cause them to leave most of their wealth behind but then theyd lost most of it already backing some kind of recreational facilities on the continent ive recorded them twice the graynorsll find funding waiting for them at wunderland they wont talk the other graynor family will emigrate to home thats us feather nodded carlos said but if you and the kids wont come featherll have to find someone else i said carlos youll be watched i dont suppose feather can protect you from that no feathers taken a much bigger risk theyll never miss it she turned to me i got hold of a little stealth lander fourth war vintage with a cold sleep box in back for you sharrol well take that down to fafnir ive got an inflatable boat to take us to the shasht north spaceport and well get to home on an outbound enterprises iceliner sharrol youll board the liner already frozen i know how to bypass that stage feather was excited now she gripped my arm and said we have to go get the lander beowulf its on mars sharrol said tanyas a flat phobe too feathers fingers closed with bruising force i sensed that the lady didnt like seeing her plans altered wait one carlos said we can fix that were taking my doc arent we it wouldnt be plausible let alone intelligent for carlos wu to go on vacation without his doc feather how big is the landers freezebox yeah right itll hold tanya better yet both children sharrol can ride in your doc we talked it around when we were satisfied we went home three days out three days returning and a week on mars while the arm team played with the spacecraft boy george it had to be feather and me i would familiarize myself with boy george feather would supervise the arm crews and neither of us were flat phobes i bought a dime disk a tourists guide to fafnir system and i studied it kzinti and human planetologists call fafnir a typical water world in a system older than sol the system didnt actually retain much more water than earth did that isnt the problem but the core is low in radioactives the lithosphere is thick no continental drift here shallow oceans cover percent of the planet the oceans seethe with life five billion years evolved twice as old as earths and where the thick crust cracked in early days magma oozed through to build the worlds single continent today a wandering line of volcanoes and bare rock stretches from the south pole nearly to the north the continents mass has been growing for billions of years on the opposite face of a lopsided planet the ocean has grown shallow fafnirs life presently discovered the advantages of coral building that side of the world is covered with tens of thousands of coral islands some stand up to twenty meters tall relics of a deeper ocean the mines are all on shasht so also are all the industry both spaceports and the seat of government but the life recreation housing families is all on the islands finding the old lander had indeed been a stroke of luck it was an identical backup for the craft that set sinbad jabar down on meerowsk in the fourth war where he invaded the harem of the patriarchs voice the disgrace caused the balance of power among the local kzinti to become unstable the human alliance took meerowsk and renamed the planet and it was jabars prize until a later pacifistic generation took power jabars skin is displayed there still somehow feather had convinced the arms that this twin of jabars lander was wanted for the smithsonian luna and the belt peoples would raise hell if they knew it was to be removed from mars the project must be absolutely secret ultimately the arm crews grew tired of feathers supervision or else her company rapidly after that feather grew tired of watching me read well only be on fafnir two days beowulf what are you learning its a dull dull dull place all the land life is earth imports their lifestyle is strange feather they travel by transfer booths and dirigible balloons and boats and almost nothing in between a very laidback society nobodys expected to be anywhere on time nobodys watching us here you dont have to play tourist i know if the arm had boy george bugged but feather would have thought of that our ship was in the hands of arm engineers and that made for tension but we were getting on each others nerves not a good sign with a threeweek flight facing us feather said youre not playing you are a tourist i admitted it and the first law of tourism is read everything but i switched the screen off and said in the spirit of compromise all right show me what is there to see on mars she hated to admit it nothing we left mars with the little stealth lander in the fuel tank the arm was doing things the arm didnt know about and i continued reading fafnirs twentytwohour day has encouraged an active life couch potatoes court insomnia its easier to sleep if youre tired but hurrying is something else there are transfer booths of course you can jump instantly from a home on some coral extrusion to the bare rock of shasht and buy yourself an elevenhour time lag nobodys in a hurry to go home they go by dirigible ultimately the floatliner companies wised up and began selling roundtrip tickets for the same price as oneway i do know all this beowulf mph oh good so whats the plan feather asked find an island with nothing near it and put down right get out and dance around on the sand while we blow the boat up and load it and go how do we hide the lander sink it read about lamplighters she said so i did after the war and the settlement un advance forces landed on shasht took over the kzinti structures then began to explore halfway around the planet were myriads of little round coral islands each with a little peak at the center at night the peaks glowed with a steady yellow light larger islands were chains of peaks each with its yellow glow in the cup lamplighters were named before anyone knew what they were close up well theyve been called piranha ant nests the bioluminescence attracts scores of varieties of flying fish or lured or just lost a swimming thing may beach itself and then the lamplighter horde flows down to the beach and cleans it to the bones you cant build a home or beach a boat until the nest has been burned out then you have to wait another twelve days for the soldiers caught outside the nest to die then cover the nest use it for a basement put your house on it otherwise the sea may carry a queen to you to use the nest again youre ahead of me on this i admitted what has this lander got for belly rockets your basic hydrogen and oxygen feather said high heat and a watervapor exhaust well burn the nest out good yo boy when carloss doc is finished with you you know it open the sky was a brilliant sprawl of stars some of them movingspacecraft weather eyes the wheel and a single lopsided moon the island was shadowteeth cutting into the starscape i slid out carefully into a blackness like the inside of my empty belly and yelled as i dropped into seawater the water was hip deep with no current to speak of i wasnt going to drown or be washed away or lost fafnirs moon was a little one close in tides would be shallow still id been lucky i could have wakened under water how did people feel about nudity here but my bundle of clothes hadnt washed away now the boots clasped my feet like old friends the sleeves of the dead mans survival jacket tailed way past my hands until i rolled them up and of course the front and back were in shreds the pants were better too big but with elastic ankle bands that i just pulled up to my knees i swallowed a tannin secretion dose i couldnt have done that earlier the doc would have read the albino gene in my dna and cured me of an imposed tendency to tan there was nothing on all of fafnir like carloss doc id have to hide it before i could ever think about rescue our medical equipment carlos had called it and feather had answered hardly ours carlos was patient its all weve got feather let me show you how to use it first the diagnostics the thing was as massive as the inflatable boat that would carry us to shasht carlos had a gravity lift to shove under it the intensive care cavity was tailored just for carlos wu naturally but any of us could be served by the tethers and sleeves and hypotipped tubes and readouts along one whole face of the thing the service wall these hookups do your diagnostics and set the chemical feeds going feather itll rebalance body chemistry in case i ever go schiz or someone poisons me or something ive reprogrammed it to take care of you too i dont think carlos noticed the way feather looked at it and him now the cavity its for the most serious injuries but ive reprogrammed it for you sharrol my dear but its exactly carloss size feather told us pointedly the un thinks a lot of carlos we cant use it sharrol said it looks small i dont mean the ic cavity i can get into that but theres not much room for transplants in that storage space oh no this is advanced stuff i had a hand in the design one day well be able to use these techniques with everyone carlos patted the monster theres nothing in here in the way of cloned organs and such theres the surgery program and a reservoir of organic soup and a googol of selfreplicating machines a few hundred atoms long if i lost a leg or an eye theyd turn me off and rebuild it onto me theres even here pay attention you feed the organics reservoir through here so the machine doesnt run out of material you could even feed it fafnir fish if you can catch them but theyre metaldeficient when he had us thoroughly familiar with the beast he helped sharrol into the cavity waited to be sure she was hooked up and closed it that made me nervous as hell she climbed out a day later claiming that she hadnt felt a thing wasnt hungry didnt even have to use the bathroom the doc was massive i had to really heave against it to get it moving and then it wanted to move along the shore i forced it to turn inland the proper place to hide it was in the lamplighter nest of course i was gasping like death itself and the daylight had almost died and i just couldnt push that mass uphill i left it on the beach maybe there was an answer let my hindbrain toy with it for a while i trudged across sand to rough coral and kept walking to the peak wed picked the island partly for its isolation two distant yellow lights eastward marked two islands id noted earlier i ran my mag specs up to ox and scanned the whole horizon and found nothing but the twin lamplighter glows and nothing to do but wait i sat with my back against the lip of the dead lamplighter pit i pictured her she looked serious a touch worried under a feather crest and undyed skin pink shading to brown an anglo tanned as if by fafnirs yellowwhite sun i said sharrol like the dead she had slept her face slack beneath the faceplate like sleeping beauty id taken to talking to her wondering if some part of her heard id never had the chance to ask i never wondered why you loved me egotist i am but you must have looked like me when you were younger thirty years underwater no sunlight your uncles your father they must have looked a lot like me maybe even with white hair how old are you i never asked her memory looked at me tanj that where are you where are tanya and louis wheres carlos what happened after i was shot faint smile shrug of eyebrows you spent three weeks unconscious in the icc followed by ten minutes on your feet wrong gravity wrong air mix wrong smells we hit you with everything it might take to knock a flat phobe spinning then blam and your love interest is lying on the sand with a hole through him maybe you tried to kill her i dont think youd give her much trouble but maybe feather would kill you anyway shed still have the kids i slammed my fist on coral what did she want that crazy woman i never hurt her at all talking to sharrol lifeless as she was maybe it wasnt quite as crazy as talking to myself i couldnt talk to the others they you remember that night we planned it all feather was lucid then comparatively we were there for her as people on the trip to mars she was a lot wilder she was a hell of an active lover but i never really got the feeling that i was there for her we never talked about each others lovers in truth it was easier to say these things to sharrol when she wasnt here but most of the way to fafnir feather was fine but she wasnt sleeping with me just carlos she could hold a conversation no problem there but i was randy love and frustrated she liked that i caught a look when carlos wasnt looking so i didnt want to talk to her and she was always up against carlos and carlos he was a bit embarrassed about it all we talked about plans but for anything personal there was just you sleeping beauty the night was warm and clear by convention boats would show any color except lamplighter yellow i couldnt miss seeing a boats lights then fifteen hours out from the drop point that night i found her floating in my sleeping plates i suppose i could have sent her to her own room i mean it was within the laws of physics but i didnt i acted like conversation was the last thing id be interested in but so did feather and the next morning it was all business and a frantic business it was we came in in devious fashion and got off behind the moon boy george went on alone decelerating passed too close to an arm base on claim that even feather wasnt supposed to know about turned around and accelerated away in clear and obvious terror heading off in the general direction of hrooshpith pithtcha of another of those usedtobekzinti systems where theyve never got the population records straightened out no doubt the arm is waiting for us there and of course you missed the ride down but my point is that nothing ever got said okay this whole scheme was schemed by feather carried through by feather it i stared into the black night oh i really should have seen this earlier why did feather need carlos through the arm spy net feather filip had found a family of six shashters ready to emigrate why not look for one or two where carlos insisted on taking his children and sharrol and me another man might be more reasonable she doesnt just want to be clear of sol system doesnt just want to make babies she wants carlos carlos of the perfect genes hah carlos finally saw it maybe she told him he must have let her know he didnt want children by an arm schiz angry and randy she took it out on me and then then with my eyes open to the dark entranced i remembered that final night yellow lights sprinkled on a black ocean some are the wrong color too bright too blue avoid those theyre houses pick one far from the rest hover organic matter burns lamplighter yellow below the drive flame then fades i sink us in an egg in an egg cup feather blasts the roof loose and we crawl out we hadnt wanted to use artificial lights when dawn gave us enough light we inflated the boat feather and carlos used the gravity lift to settle the freezebox in the boat they were arguing in whispers i didnt want to hear that i thought i turned off the docs maintenance sequence a minute later sharrol sat up a flat phobe wakened suddenly on an alien world sniffed the air kissed me and let me lift her out heavy in fafnirs gravity i set her on the sand her nerve seemed to be holding feather had procured local clothing i pushed the bundle into her arms feather came toward me towing the gravity lift she looked shapeless with bulging pockets fore and aft we slid the lift into place and i pushed the doc toward carlos and the boat feather called my name i turned blam agony and scrambled senses but i saw carlos leap for the boat reflexes like a jackrabbit my head hit the black sand then she wanted hostages our children but carloss children theyre frozen they wont give her any trouble but me why would she need me killing me lets carlos know she means it maybe i told too many stories maybe she thinks im dangerous maybe for an instant i saw just how superfluous i was from feather filips psychotic viewpoint feather wanted carlos carlos wanted the children sharrol came with the children beowulf shaeffer was along because he was with sharrol if feather shot beowulf how much would carlos mind blam presently i said she shot me to prove she would but it looked to me like carlos just ran there werent any weapons in the boat wed only just inflated it all he could do was start it and go that takes when i thought about it it was actually a good move hed gotten away with himself and tanya and louis with both hostages protect them now negotiate later and hed left feather in a killing rage with that horrible tube and one living target i stopped talking to sharrol then because it seemed to me she must be dead no feather had you she had to have you it could happen it could what else can she threaten carlos with she has to keep you alive i tried to believe it she certainly didnt kill you in the first minute somebody had to put me in the doc feather had no interest in doing that but she had no interest in letting sharrol do that either tanj dammit why did feather let you put me in the doc she even let you what about the biomass reserve my damaged body must have needed some major restructuring the biomass reserve had been feeding sharrol and doing incidental repairs on us all for the entire threeweek trip healing me would take another fifty kilograms more she must have let you fill the biomass reserve with fish feather showing carlos how reasonable she could be too reasonable it felt wrong wrong the other body the headless one why not just push that in the hopper so much easier unless unless material was even closer at hand i felt no sudden inspiration it was a matter of making myself believe i tried to remember sharrol pulling her clothes on quickly shivering and dancing on the sand in the chilly dawn breeze hands brushing back through her hair hair half grown out a tiny grimace for the way the survival jacket made her look bulges everywhere patting pockets opening some of them the doc had snapped her out of a three week sleep like me awake alert ready it didnt go away the answer it just i still didnt know where sharrol was or carlos or the children what if i was wrong feather had mapped my route to home every step of the way i knew exactly where feather was now if a line of logic could point my way but one wrong assumption and feather filip could pop up behind my ear i could make myself safer and sharrol too if i mapped out a wontcase scenario feathers plan b kill shaeffer take the rest prisoners to impose her will on carlos but carlos flees with the boat so plan b feather holds sharrol at gunpoint some days later she waves down a boat blam and a stolen boat sails toward shasht or stops to stow sharrol somewhere maybe on another coral island maybe imprisoned inside a plastic tent with a live lamplighter horde prowling outside and carlos hes had four months now to find sharrol and feather hes a genius ask anyone and feather wants to get in touch unless shes given up on carlos decided to kill him if i could trace carloss path i would find louis and tanya and even sharrol carlos plan b follows plan a as originally conceived by feather the kids would be stowed aboard the iceliner as if already registered carlos would register and be frozen feather could follow him to home maybe on the same ship if she hustled but no way could feather get herself frozen with a gun in her hand that would be the moment to take her coming out of freeze on home there i had a target on shasht they could tell me who had boarded the zombie queen for home what did i have to do to get to shasht feed myself thats easy collect rainwater too get off the island that at least was not a puzzle i couldnt build a raft i couldnt swim to another island but a sailor lost at sea will die if cast ashore therefore local tradition decrees that he must be rescued collect some money get to shasht hide myself whatever else was lost to me to us whoever had died whoever still lived there was still the mission and that was to be free of the united nations and earth and carlos wus doc would finger me instantly it was advanced nanotechnology it screamed its earthly origin it might be the most valuable item on fafnir and i had no wealth at all and i was going to have to abandon it come daylight i moved the doc i still wanted to hide it in the lamplighter nest the gravity lift would lift it but not push it uphill but i solved it one of the secrets of life know when and what to give up i waited for low tide and then pushed it out to sea and turned off the lift the water came almost to the faceplate seven hours later it didnt show at all and the next emergency might kill me unless it happened at low tide the nights were as warm as the days as the tourist material had promised it rained just before dawn i set up my pants to funnel rainwater into a hole i had chopped in the coral the tour guide had told me how to feed myself it isnt that rare for a lamplighter nest to die sooner or later an unlit island will be discovered by any of several species of swimming things some ride the waves at night and spawn in the sand i spent the second night running through the shallows and scooping up sunbunnies in my jacket bigger flying fish came gliding off the crests of the breakers they wanted the sunbunnies three or four wanted me but i was able to dodge one i had to gut in midair the tour guide hadnt told me how to clean sunbunnies i had to fake that i poached them in seawater using my pocket torch on high and i ate until i was bloated i fed more of them into the biomass reservoir with some distaste i fed those long human bones in too fafnir fish meat was deficient in metals ultimately that might kill me but the doc could compensate for a time there was nothing to build a boat with the burntout lamplighter nest didnt show by daylight so any passing boat would be afraid to rescue me i thought of swimming i thought of riding away on the gravity lift wherever the wind might carry me but i couldnt feed myself at sea and how could i approach another island on the fourth evening a great winged shape passed over the island then dived into the sea later i heard a slapping sound as that flyer and a companion kicked themselves free of the water soared passed over the crater and settled into it they made a great deal of noise presently the big one glided down to the water and was gone at dawn i fed myself again on the clutch of eggs that had been laid in the body of the smaller flyer male or female whichever the dime disk hadnt told me about this creature a pity i wouldnt have the chance to write it up at just past sunset on the eighth night i saw a light flicker bluegreenred my mag specs showed a boat that wasnt moving i fired a flare straight up and watched it burn bluewhite for twenty minutes i fired another at midnight then i stuffed my boots partway into my biggest pockets inflated my shoulder floats and walked into the sea until i had to swim i couldnt see the boat with my eyes this close to water level i fired another flare before dawn one of those had to catch someone awake and if not i had three more i kept swimming it was peaceful as a dream fafnirs ecology is very old evolved on a placid world not prone to drifting continents and ice ages where earthquakes and volcanoes know their place the sea had teeth of course but the carnivores were specialized they knew the sounds of their prey there were a few terrifying exceptions reason and logic werent enough to wash out those memories holograms of creatures the match for any white shark i grew tired fast the air felt warm enough the water did too but it was leeching the heat from my flesh and bones i kept swimming a rescuer should have no way of knowing that i had been on an island the farther i could get the better i did not want a rescuer to find carlos wus doc at first i saw nothing more of the boat than the great white wings of its sails i set the pocket torch on wide focus and high power to compete with what was now broad daylight and poured vivid green light on the sails and i waited for it to turn toward me but for a long time it didnt it came in a zigzag motion aimed by the wind never straight at me it took forever to pull alongside a woman with fluffy golden hair studied me in some curiosity then stripped in two quick motions and dived in i was numb with cold hardly capable of wiggling a finger this was the worst moment and i couldnt muster the strength to appreciate it i passively let the woman noose me under the armpits watched the man lift me aboard utterly unable to protect myself feather could have killed me before the doc released me why wait id worked out what must have happened to her it was almost plausible but i couldnt shake the notion that feather was waiting above me watching me come aboard there was only a brawny golden man with slanted brown eyes and golden hair bleached nearly as white as mine tor shed called him and she was wil he wrapped me in a silver bubble blanket and pushed a bulb of something hot into my hands my hands shook a cup would have splashed everything out i got the bulb to my lips and sucked strange taste augmented with a splash of rum the warmth went to the core of me like life itself the woman climbed up dripping she had eyes like his a golden tan like his he handed her a bulb they looked me over amiably i tried to say something my teeth turned into castanets i sucked and listened to them arguing over who and what i might be and what could have torn up my jacket that way when i had my teeth under some kind of control i said im persial january hebert and im eternally in your debt leaving all our earthly wealth behind us was a pain feather could help she contrived to divert a stream of arm funds to fafnir replacing it from carloss wealth riiight but sharrol and i would be sponging off carlos and maybe it wouldnt be carlos feather controlled that wealth for now and feather liked control she had not said that she expected to keep some for herself that bothered me it must have bothered carlos too though we never found privacy to talk about it i wondered how carlos would work it had he known feather filip before he reached jinx i could picture him designing something that would be useless on earth say an upgraded version of the mass driver system that runs through the vacuum across jinxs east pole replacing a more normal worlds pinwheel launcher design something copyright it on jinx under a pseudonym form a company just in case he ever found the means to flee sol system me i went to my oldest friend on earth general products owed elephant a considerable sum and elephant gregory pelton owed me he got general products to arrange for credit on home and fafnir feather wouldnt have approved the breach in secrecy but the aliens who run general products dont reveal secrets wed never even located their homeworld and feather must have expected to control carloss funding and carlos with it and sharrol was with me shed trusted me now she was a flat phobe broke and stranded on an alien world if she still lived if she wasnt the prisoner of a homicidal maniac four months going on five long enough to drive her crazy i thought how could i hurry to her rescue the word hurry was said to be forgotten on fafnir but perhaps id thought of a way they let me sleep when i woke there was soup i was ravenous we talked while we ate the boat was gullfish the owners were wilhelmin and toranaga brother and sister both recently separated from mates and enjoying a certain freedom clean air exercise celibacy before they returned to the mating dance its embarrassments and frustrations and rewards there was a curious turn to their accents i tagged it as australian at first then as plateau softened by speech training or by a generation or two in other company this was said to be typical of fafnir there was no fafnir accent the planet had been settled too recently and from too many directions wil finished her soup went to a locker and came back with a jacket it was not quite like mine and new untouched they helped me into it and let me fish through the pockets of my own ragged garment before they tossed it in the locker they had given me my life by fafnir custom my response would be a gift expressing my value as perceived by myself but wil and tor hadnt told me their full names i hinted at this they failed to understand hmm my dime disk hadnt spoken of this it might be a new custom the rescuer conceals data so that an impoverished rescuee need not be embarrassed he sends no life gift instead of a cheap one but i was guessing i couldnt follow the vibes yet as for my own history i just gave up i blurted it was so stupid i hadnt hadnt tried everything at all toranaga said what kind of everything were you after i lost my wife four months ago a rogue waveyou know how waves crossing can build into a mountain of water it rolled our boat under a trawler picked me up the triton a civil being must be able to name his rescuer surely there must be a boat named triton theres no record of anyone finding milcenta i bought another boat and searched its been four months i was doing more drinking than looking lately and three nights ago something rammed the boat a torpedo ray i think i didnt sink but my power was out even my lights i got tired of it all and just started swimming they looked at each other then at their soup sympathy was there with a trace of contempt beneath middle of the night i was cold as the sea bottom and it crossed my mind that maybe mil was rescued under another name we arent registered as a partnership if mil was in a coma theyd check her retina prints use our caller wilhelmin said i thanked them with your permission ill establish some credit too ive run myself broke but theres credit at shasht they left me alone in the cabin the caller was set into a wall in the cabin table it was a portable just a projector plate and a few keys that would get me a display of virtual keys and a screen but a sailors portable with a watertight case and several small cleats i found the master program unfamiliar but userfriendly i set up a search program for milcenta adelaide graynor in any combination milcenta was sharrol and adelaide was feather as determined by their iceliner tickets and retina prints milcentas name popped up at once i bellowed out of the hatch they saved her wil and tor bolted into the cabin to read over my shoulder hand of allah a fishing boat milcenta but not adelaide sharrol had been picked up alone id been at least halfright shed escaped from feather i realized i was crying and no life gift that was the other side of it if she sent a proper gift the embarrassment of needing to be rescued at sea need never become public record wed drilled each other on such matters she must have been in bad shape yes if she didnt call you wilhelmin said and she didnt go home either i told martin graynors story we sold our home we were on one last cruise before boarding an iceliner she could be anywhere by now if she thought the wave killed me ill have to check i did something about money first there was nothing aboard gullfish that could read persial january heberts retina prints but i could at least establish that money was there i tried to summon passenger records from the iceliner zombie queen this was disallowed i showed disappointment and some impatience but of course they wouldnt be shown to hebert theyd be opened to martin wallace graynor they taught me to sail gullfish was built for sails not for people the floors werent flat ropes lay all over every surface the mast stood upright through the middle of the cabin you didnt walk in you climbed there were no lift plates you slept in an oddshaped box small enough to let you brace yourself in storms i had to learn a peculiar slang as if i were learning to fly a spacecraft and for the same reason if a sailor hears a yell he has to know what is meant instantly i was working hard and my body was adjusting to the shorter day sure i had insomnia but nobody sleeps well on a small boat the idea is to snap awake instantly where any stimulus could mean trouble the boat was giving my body time to adjust to fafnir once i passed a mirror and froze i barely knew myself that was all to the good my skin was darkening and despite sun block would darken further but when we landed my hair had been cut to fafnir styles it had grown during four months in the doc the doc had cured my depilation treatment i had a beard too when we reached civilization i would be far too conspicuous a pinkeyed paleskinned man with long wild white hair my hosts hadnt said anything about my appearance it was easy to guess what theyd thought theyd found a neurotic who sailed in search of his dead wife until his love of life left him entirely i went to tor in some embarrassment and asked if they had anything like a styler aboard they had scissors riiight wil tried to shape my hair laughed at the result and suggested i finish the job at booty island so i tried to forget the rest of the world and just sail it was what willhelmin and toranaga were doing one day at a time islands and boats grew more common as we neared the central isles another day for feather to forget me or lose me another day of safety for sharrol if feather followed me to her id have to watch for that and peace would have been mine but that my ragged vest was in a locker that wouldnt open to my fingerprints wil and tor talked about themselves a little but i still didnt know their identities they slept in a locked cabin i noticed also an absence wil was a lovely woman not unlike sharrol herself but her demeanor and body language showed no sign that she considered herself female or me male let alone that she might welcome a pass it might mean anything in an alien culture that my hair style or shape of nose or skin color was distasteful or i didnt know the local body language or i lacked documentation for my gene pattern but i wondered if they wanted no life gift in any sense from a man they might have to give to the police what would a police detective think of those holes why hed think some kinetic weapon had torn a hole through the occupant killing him instantly after which someone had stolen the vest for himself and if wil and tor were thinking that way what i did at the caller might it be saved automatically now there was a notion i borrowed the caller again i summoned the encyclopedia and set a search for a creature with boneless arms there were several on fafnir all small i sought data on the biggest particularly those local to the north coral quadrant there were stories no hard evidence and another day passed and i learned that i could cook while a kitchen was rolling randomly at dinner that night wil got to talking about fafnir sea life shed worked at pacifica which i gathered was a kind of underwater zoo and had i ever heard of a kdatlyno lifeform like a blind squid no i said would the kzinti bring one here i wouldnt think so the kzinti arent surfers tor said and we laughed wil didnt she said they meant it for the hunting jungle on kdat the damn things can come ashore and drag big animals back into the ocean but theyve pretty well died out around shasht and we never managed to get one for pacifica well i said and hesitated and i think i was attacked by something like that but huge and it wasnt around shasht it was where you picked me up jan you should report it wil i cant i was fast asleep and half dead of cold lost at sea at midnight i woke up under water something was squeezing my chest and back i got my knife out and slashed slashed something rubbery it pulled apart it pulled my jacket apart if it had ripped the shoulder floats id still be down there but i never saw a thing thus are legends born booty island is several islands merged i counted eight peaks coming in there must have been more we had been sailing for twelve days buildings sat on each of the lamplighter nests they looked like government buildings or museums no two were alike houses were scattered across the flatlands between a mile or so of shopping center ran like a suspension bridge between two peaks on earth this would have been a park here a center of civilization a line of transfer booths in the mall bore the familiar flickering pelton logo they were all big cargo booths and old i didnt instantly see the significance we stopped in a hotel and used a coin caller the system read my retina prints persial january hebert sure enough wil and tor waited while i moved some money collected some cash and a transfer booth card and registered for a room i tried again for records of milcenta adelaide graynor sharrols rescue was still there nothing for feather wil said jan she may have been recovering from a head injury see if shes tried to find you i couldnt be mart graynor while wil and tor were watching the net registered no messages for jan hebert feather didnt know that name sharrol did but sharrol thought i was dead or maybe she was crazy incapacitated with tor and wil watching i tried two worstcases first executions a public doc can cure most varieties of madness madness is curable therefore voluntary a capital crime committed during a period of madness has carried the death penalty for seven hundred years on earth and on every world i knew it was true on fafnir too but sharrol had not been executed for any random homicide and neither worse luck had feather next there are still centers for the study of madness the best known is on jinx on earth there are several plus one secret branch of the arm there was only one mental institution to serve all of fafnir and that seemed to be half empty neither feathers nor sharrols retina prints showed on the records the third possibility would have to wait we all needed the hotels styler though i was the worst off the device left my hair long at the neck and theirs too a local style to protect against sunburn i let it tame my beard without baring my face the sun had had its way with me i looked like an older man i took wil and tor to lunch i found gullfish on the menu and tried it like much of fafnir sea life it tasted like something that had almost managed to become red meat i worked some points casually into conversation just checking it was their last chance to probe me too and i had to improvise details of a childhood in the north sea tor found me plausible wil was harder to read nothing was said of a vest or a great sea monster in their minds i was already gone i was schrodingers cat i had murdered and not murdered the owner of a shredded vest at the caller in my room i established myself as martin wallace graynor that gave me access to my wives autodoc records a public doc will correct any of the chemical imbalances we lump under the term crazy but it also records such service milcenta graynor sharrol had used a doc eight times in fourplus months starting a week after our disastrous landing the record showed much improvement over that period beginning at a startling adrenaline level acid indigestion and some dangerous lesser symptoms eight times within the central islands none on shasht if shed never reached the mainland then shed never tried to reach outbound enterprises never tried to find carlos or louis and tanya adelaide graynor feather had no doc record on this world the most obvious conclusion was that wherever she was she must be mad as a march hare boats named gullfish were everywhere on fafnir fiftyone registries twentynine had sail ten of those would sleep four i scanned for first names no wilhelmin no toranaga maybe gullfish belonged to a parent or to one of the departed spouses id learned a term for gullfishs sail and mast configuration sloop rig every one of the ten candidates was a sloop rig wait now wil had worked at pacifica i did some research pacifica wasnt just a zoo it looked more like an underwater village with listings for caterers costume shops subs repair work travel hotels but wil had worked with sea life might that give me a handle i couldnt see how it wasnt that i didnt have an answer i just didnt like it wil and tor had to hand my vest to the cops when persial january hebert was reported rescued i would send them a gift feather didnt know my alternate name but if she had access to the fafnir police shed tanj sure recognize that vest with the rest of the afternoon i bought survival gear a backpurse luggage clothing on earth i could have vanished behind a thousand shades of dyes here i settled for a double dose of tannin secretion an underdose of sun block a darkened pair of mag specs my height and a local beard and hairstyle arming myself was a problem the disk hadnt spoken of weapons on fafnir my safest guess was that fafnir was like earth they didnt put weapons in the hands of civilians handguns rifles martial arts training belong to the police the good news everyone on the islands carried knives those flying sharks that attacked me during the sunbunny run were one predator out of thousands feather would arm herself somehow shed look through a sporting goods store steal a hunting rifle nope no hunting rifles no large prey on fafnir unless in the kzinti jungle or underwater there were listings for scuba stores i found a stun gun with a big parabolic reflector big enough to knock out a onegulp too big for a pocket i took it home with more diving gear for versimilitude and a little tool kit for repairing diving equipment with that i removed the reflector now i couldnt use it underwater it would knock me out because water conducts sound very well but it would fit my pocket i took my time over a sushi dinner quite strange some time after sunset i stepped into a transfer booth and stepped out into a brilliant dawn on shasht outbound enterprises was open i let a ms machti take martin wallace graynors retina prints your ticket is still good mr graynor ms machti said the service charge will be eight hundred stars youre four months late i was shipwrecked i told her did my companions make it iceliner passengers are in no hurry the ships keep prices down by launching when theyre full i learned that the zombie queen had departed a week after our landing about as expected i gave ms machti the names she set the phone system searching and presently said your husband and the children boarded and departed your wives tickets are still outstanding both yes she did a double take oh good heavens they must think youre dead thats what im afraid of at least john and tweena and nathan would they were revived in good shape yes of course but the women could they have waited for you stet carlos tanya and louis were all safe on home and had left the spaceport under their own power feather and sharrol waited but theyd have left a message she was still looking at her screen not for you mr graynor but mr john graynor has recorded a message for mrs graynor for mrs adelaide graynor for feather but nothing for milcenta but they both stayed how strange ms machti seemed the type of person who might wonder about other peoples sexual arrangements i wanted her curious because this next question can you show me what john had to say to adelaide she shook her head firmly i dont see how now john wouldnt have said anything someone else couldnt hear you can watch it yourself her head as still turning left right left in fact you should then you can at least tell me if theres been if well i have to know dont i if milcentas dead that stopped her she nodded barely and tapped in the code to summon carloss message to feather she read it all the way through her lip curled just a bit but she showed only solemn pity when she turned the monitor to face me it was a posed scene carlos looked like a man hiding a sickness the view behind him could have been a manor garden in england a tamed wilderness tanya and louis were playing in the distance hideandseek in and out of some earthly tree that dripped a cage of foliage alive ever since i had first seen them frozen i must have been thinking of them as dead carlos looked earnestly out of the monitor screen adelaide you can see that the children and i arrived safely i have an income the plans we made together half of us have carried out your own iceliner slots are still available i know nothing of mart i hope youve heard from him but he should never have gone sailing alone i fear the worst addie i cant pretend to understand how youve changed how mil changed or why i can only hope youll both change your mind and come back to me but understand me addie you are not welcome without milcenta your claim on family funds is void without milcenta and whatever relationship we can shape from these ashes i would prefer to leave the children out of it he had the money carlos stood and walked a half circle as he spoke the camera followed him on automatic and now it showed a huge sprawling house of architectural coral pink and slightly rounded everywhere carlos gestured ive waited the house isnt finished because you and milcenta will have your own tastes but come soon ive set credit with outbound messages sent to home by hyperwave will be charged to me ill get the service charges when you and milcenta board call first we can work this out the record began to repeat i heard it through again then turned the monitor around ms machti asked you went sailing alone she thought id tried to commit suicide after our wives had changed parity and locked the men out an implication carlos had shaped with some skill i made a brushoff gesture and said ive got to tell him im still alive the credit he left doesnt apply i want to send a hyperwave message my expense lets see does outbound enterprises keep a camera around no ill fax it from the hotel whens the next flight out at least two weeks but we can suspend you any time i used a camera at the hotel the first disk i made would go through outbound enterprises john im all right i was on a dead island eating fish for a while a slightly belligerent tone i havent heard a word from adelaide or milcenta i know milcenta better than you do and frankly i believe they must have separated by now home looks like a new life but i havent given up on the old one ill let you know when i know myself so much for the ears of ms machti time lag had me suddenly wiped out i floated between the sleeping plates exhausted but awake what should i put in a real message carloss tape was a wonderful lesson in communication he wants to talk to feather the children are not to be put at risk beowulf is presumed dead cest la vie carlos will not seek vengeance but he wants sharrol alive feather is not to come to home without sharrol carlos can enforce any agreement he hadnt said so because its too obvious a frozen feather arriving at home unaccompanied need never wake and he had the money not just his own funds but the money feather knew about family funds he must have reached civilization ahead of her and somehow sequestered what feather had funneled through the arm if feather was loose on fafnir then she was also broke she owned nothing but the credit that would get her a hyperwave call to home or herself and sharrol shipped frozen though carlos didnt know it even sharrol had escaped nearly five months how was feather living did she have a job something i could track with her training she might be better off as a thief yeah i tumbled out of the sleepfield and tapped out my needs in some haste she hadnt been caught at any capital crime but any jail on shasht would record adelaide graynors retina prints the caller ran its search nothing okay job feather needed something that would allow her time to take care of a prisoner she had to have that if she had sharrol or in case she recaptured sharrol or captured beowulf so i looked through some job listings but nothing suggested itself i turned off the caller and hoped for sleep perhaps i dozed a little sometime in the night i realized that i had nothing more to say to carlos even sharrols escape wasnt information unless she stayed loose feather was a trained arm i was a selftrained tourist i couldnt possibly hunt her down there was only one way to hunt feather it was still black outside and i was wide awake the caller gave me a listing of all night restaurants i ordered an elaborate breakfast six kinds of fish eggs gulper bacon cappuccino five people at a table demanded that i join them so i did they were fresh from the coral isles via dirigible still timelagged looking for new jokes i tried to oblige and somewhere in there i forgot all about missing ladies we broke up at dawn i walked back to the hotel alone i had sidetracked my mind hoping it would come up with something if i left it alone but my answer hadnt changed the way to hunt feather was to pretend to be feather and hunt sharrol stet im feather filip what do i know about sharrol feather must have researched her she sure as tanj had researched me back up how did sharrol get loose the simplest possible answer was that sharrol dove into the water and swam away feather could beat her at most things but a woman who had lived beneath the ocean for thirty years would swim just fine eventually a boat would find her eventually an island penniless she needs work now what kind of work is that it has to suit a flat phobe shes being hunted by a murderer and the alien planet around her forces itself into her awareness every second dirigible stewardness is probably out hotel work would be better feather days behind her seeks work for herself but the listings will tell her sharrols choices too and now i was back in the room and scanning through work listings qualifications i couldnt remember what milcenta graynor was supposed to be able to do sharrols skills wouldnt match anyway any more than mine matched mart graynors so look for unskilled low salaries of course except here servant kzinti embassy was that a joke no here was museum maintenance must work with kzinti some of them had stayed with the embassy or even become citizens could sharrol handle that she got along with strangers even nearaliens like me fishing boats pefiod of training needed hotel work underwater porter work unskilled labor in pacifica pacifica of course briefly i considered putting in for the porter job sharrol and or feather must have done that grabbed whatever was to be had but i told myself that feather thought i had no money shed never look for me in pacificas secondbest ah best hotel the truth is i prefer playing tourist i scanned price listings for hotels in pacifica called and negotiated for a room at the pequod then i left shasht in untraditional fashion via oversized transfer booth still in early morning it was night in pacifica i checked in crawled between sleeping plates and zonked out my timelagged body back on track i woke late fully rested for the first time in days there was a little round window next to my nose i gazed out floating half mesmerized remembering the great barrier reef outside carlos wus apartment the strangeness and variety of earths sea life had stunned me then but these oceans were older evolution had filled ecological niches not yet dreamed of on earth it was shady out there under a wonderful variety of seaweed growths like a forest in fog life was everywhere here a school of transparent bell jars nearly invisible opened and closed to jet themselves along quasiterresftial fish glowed as if alien graffiti had been scrawled across them in dayglo ink to identify them to potential mates predators hid in the green treetops torpedo shapes dived from cover and disappeared back into the foliage with prey wriggling in long jaws a boneless arm swept straight down from a floating seaweed island toward the orange neon fish swimming just above the sandy bottom its stingerarmed hand flexed and fell like a net over its wriggling prey and a great mouth flexed wider and closed over the wrist the killer was dark and massive shaped like a ray of earths sea the smaller fish was painted on its back it moved with the motion of the ray the ray chewed reeling the arm in until a onearmed black oyster was ripped out of the seaweed tree and pulled down to death one big beast like a long dolphin with gills and great round eyes stopped to look me over owl raw were said to be no brighter than a good dog but fafnir scientists had been hard put to demonstrate that and fafnir fishers still didnt believe it i waved solemnly it bowed well bobbed in place before it flicked away my gear was arrayed in a tidy row with the stunner nearest my hand id put the reflector back on i could reach it in an instant your honor of course its for scuba swimming why else would i be in possession of a device that can knock feather filip into a coma before she can blow a great bloody hole through my torso i didnt actually want to go scuba swimming sharrol swam like a fish she could be out there right now still at a distance and underwater would i know her and feather might know me and feather would certainly swim better than me and i could hardly ignore feather sharrol had to be living underwater it was the only way she could stay sane life beyond the glass was alien stet but the life of earths seas seems alien too my slow wits hadnt seen that at first but feathers skills would solve that puzzle and beowulf shaeffer had to be underwater to avoid sunlight feather could find me for the wrong reasons and the police of fafnir of whom i knew nothing at all might well be studying me in bemused interest hes bought a weapon but why if he has the blaster that blew a hole through this vest and its a fishing weapon and hes gone to pacifica which might cause them to hold off a few hours longer so with time breathing hot on my neck i found the hotel restaurant and took my time over fruit fish eggs in a baked potato and cappuccino my time wasnt wasted the window overlooked a main street of pacificas villagesize collection of bubbles i saw swimsuits and casually dressed people carrying diving or fishing gear almost nobody dressed formally that would be for shasht for going to work in the breakfast room itself i saw four business tunics in a crowd of a hundred and two men in dark blue police uniforms that left arms and legs bare you could swim in them and one long table empty with huge chairs widely spaced i wondered how often kzinti came in it was hard to believe theyd be numerous forty years after mankind had taken over back in the room i fished out the little repair kit and set to work on my transfer booth card we learned this as kids the idea is to make a bridge of superconductor wire across the central circuits transport companies charge citizens a quarterly fee to cover local jumps the authorities dont get upset if you stay away from the borders of the card the borders are area codes well it looked like the kind of card wed used then fafnirs booth system served a small population that didnt use booths much it could well be decades old long due for replacement so id try it i got into casuals i rolled my wet suit around the rest of my scuba gear and stuffed the stunner into one end where i could grab it fast stuffed the bundle into my backpurse it stuck way out and left the room elevators led to the roof admissions was here and a line of the big transfer booths and a transparent roof with an awesome view up into the sea forest i stepped into a booth and inserted my card the random walk began a shopping mall high up above a central well booths in a line just inside a big water lock a restaurant another an apartment building i was jumping every second and a half nobody noticed me flicking in would they notice how quickly i flicked out nobody gets upset at a random walk unless the kids do it often enough to tie up circuits but they might remember an adult how long before someone called the police a dozen kzinti lying about in cool half darkness gnawing oddly shaped bones rolled to a defensive fourfooted crouch at the sight of me i couldnt help it i threw myself against the back wall i must have looked crazed with terror when the random walk popped me into a solarico omni center i was trying to straighten my face when the jump came hey a travel terminal of some kind i turned and saw the dirigible like an underpressured planet before the scene changed her beyond a thick glass wall the seaweed forest swarmed with men and women wearing fins farmers picking spheres that glowed softly in oilslick colors i waited my moment and snatched my card out of the slot was it really i tapped quickly to get an instant billing counted two back along the booth numbers i couldnt use the jimmied card for this so id picked up a handful of coins her solarico omni top floor i stepped out of the booth and saw the gates that would stop a shoplifter and a stack of lockers for the first time i had second thoughts about the way i was dressed nothing wrong with the clothes but i couldnt carry a mucking great package of diving gear into a shopping center with a stunner so handy i pushed my backpurse into a locker and stepped through the gates the whole complex was visible from the rim of the central well it was darker down there than i was used to pacifica citizens must like their underwater gloom i thought two floors down an open fastfood center wasnt that where id seen her she was gone now id seen only a face and i could have been wrong at least shed never spot me not before i was much closer but where was she dressed how employee or customer it was midmorning she couldnt be on lunch break customer then only shashters kept poor track of time three floors down the sports department good enough i rode down the escalator id buy a spear gun or another stunner shove everything into the bag that came with it then i could start window shopping for faces the sports department aisles were pleasantly wide most ofwhat it sold was fishing gear a daunting variety there was skiing equipment too and hunting it looked like huge weapons built for hands bigger than a baseball mitt the smallest was a fat tube as long as my forearm with a grip no bigger than a kzinti kittens hand oh sure kzinti just love going to humans for their weapons maybe the display was there to entertain human customers the clerks were leaving me alone to browse customs differ what the tanj was that two kzinti in the aisle spaced three yards apart hissing the heros tongue at each other a handful of human customers watched in some amusement there didnt seem to be danger there one wore what might be a loose dark blue swimsuit with a hole for the tail the other took down four yards of disassembled fishing rod a kzinti clerk the corner of my eye caught a clerks hands opening the case and reaching in for that smaller tube with a grip built for a kzin child or a man my breath froze in my throat i was looking into feathers horrible arm weapon i looked up into the clerks face it came out as a whisper no sharrol no no no its me its beowulf she didnt fire but she was pale with terror her jaw set like rock and the black tube looked at the bridge of my nose i eased two inches to the right very slowly to put myself between the tube and the kzin cop that wasnt a swimsuit he was wearing it was the same sleeve less legless police uniform id seen at breakfast we were eye to eye the whites showed wide around her irises i said my face look at my face under the beard its bey love im a foot shorter remember she remembered it terrified her i wouldnt fit the cavity was built for carlos my heart and lungs were shredded my back was shattered my brain was dying and you had to get me into the cavity but i wouldnt fit remember sharrol i have to know i looked around quickly an aisle over kzinti noses came up smelling fear did you kill feather kill feather she set the tube down carefully on the display case her brow wrinkled i was going through my pockets it was distracting me keeping me sane i needed that the light was wrong the gravity was wrong the earth was so far away shh survival gear always know what you have you taught me that she began to tremble i heard a sonic boom i looked up just as you were blown backward i thought i must be ccrazy i couldnt have seen that it was my back that felt vulnerable now i felt all those floors behind and above me all those eyes the kzin cop had lost interest if there was a moment for feather filip to take us both this was it but the arm weapon was in sharrols hands but carlos jumped into the boat and roared off and feather screamed at him and you were all blood and sprawled out like like dead and i i cant remember yes dear i took her hand greatly daring but i have to know if shes still chasing us she shook her head violently i jumped on her back and cut her throat she tried to point that tube at me i held her arm down she elbowed me in the ribs i hung on she fell down i cut her head off but bey there you were and carlos was gone and the kids were too and what was i going to do she came around the counter and put her arms around me and said were the same height futz i was starting to relax feather was nowhere we were free of her i kept telling myself you must have killed her a trained arm psychotic but she didnt take you seriously she couldnt have guessed how quick youd wake up i fed herinto the organics reservoir yeah there was nowhere else all that biomass could have come from it had to be feather and i couldnt lift your body and you wouldnt fit anyway i had to cut off your hh she pulled close and tried to push her head under my jaw but i wasnt tall enough any more head i cut as low as i could tanj were the same height did it work are you all right im fine im just short the doc rebuilt me from my dna from the throat down but it built me in fafnir gravity good thing too i guess yeah she was trying to laugh gripping my arms as if i might disappear there wouldnt have been room for your feet bey we shouldnt be talking here that kzin is a cop and nobody knows how good their hearing is bey i get off at sixteen hundred ill shop were both overdue on life gifts how do i look how should i look i had posed us on the roof of the pequod with the camera looking upward past us into the green seaweed forest i said just right pretty cheerful the kind of woman a man might drown himself for a little bewildered you didnt contact me because you got a blow to the head youre only just healing you ready take one now i keyed the vidcamera me wilhelmin toranaga i hope youre feeling as good as we are i had no trouble finding milcenta once i got my head on straight sharrol hello thank you for jans life and thank you for teaching him to sail i never could show him how to do that were going to buy a boat as soon as we can afford it me im ready to face the human race again i hope you are too this may help i turned the camera off what are you giving them sharrol asked silverware service for a dozen now theyll have to develop a social life do you think they turned you in they had to they did well by me love what bothers me is theyll never be sure im not a murderer neither will the police this is a wonderful planet for getting rid of a corpse ill be looking over my shoulder for that kzinti cop no bey he smelled our fear they smell everyones fear they make wonderful police but they cant react every time a kzin makes a human nervous he may have pegged you as an outworlder though oop why bey the kzinti are everywhere on fafnir mostly on the mainland but theyre on site at the fishing sources too fafnir sea life feeds the whole patriarchy and its strictly a kzinti operation shashters are used to kzin but kids and wimps and outworlders all get twitchy around them and theyre used to that he might have smelled more than our fear i thought our genetic makeup our diet but wed been eating fafnir fish for over a month and fafnirs people were every breed of man stet shall we deal with the hand of allah now she looked nervous i must have driven them half crazy and worried them sick its a good gift isnt it shorfy and isfahan were constantly complaining about fish fish fish theyll love it its about five ounces of red meat per crewman i suppose thats freerange lifeforms from the hunting parks and fresh vegetables to match i bet the kzinti dont grow those okay take one sharrol captain muhmad i was a long time recovering my memory i expect the docs did more repair work every time i went under my husbands found me we both have jobs and this is to entertain you and your crew in my absence me for my wifes life blessings and thanks i turned it off now carlos her hand stopped me i cant leave you know sharrol said im not a coward feather learned that its just overkill ive been through too much its all right carlos has louis and tanya for awhile and thats fine they love him were free of the un everything went just as we planned it more or less except from feathers viewpoint do you mind do you like it here there are transfer boodis if i want to go anywhere sharrol i was raised underground it feels just like home if i dont look out a window i wouldnt mind spending the rest of our lives here now this is for ms machti at outbound not to mention any watching arms ready take one me hi john hello kids weve got a more or less happy ending here brought to you with some effort sharrol im pregnant it happened yesterday morning thats why we waited to call i was calling as martin wallace graynor carlos john could reach us the same way we wanted no connection between mart graynor and jan hebert visuals were important to the message the undersea forest was behind us i stood next to sharrol our eyes exactly level thatd give him a jolt me john i know you were worried about mil and so was i but shes recovered mils a lot tougher than even addie gave her credit for sharrol still the situation was sticky at first messy she rubbed her hands but thats all over marts got a job working outside in the water orchards me its just like working in freefall ive got a real knack for it sharrol weve got some money too and after the babys born ill take marts job itll be just like im back in my teens me you did the right thing protecting the children first its worked out very well sharrol were happy here john this is a good place to raise a child or several some day well come to you i think but not now the changes in my life are too new i couldnt take it mart is willing to indulge me me addie is gone john we never expect to see her again and were just as glad but i feel shell always be a part of me i waved the camera off now lets see carlos figure that out he does like puzzles ghost seven so there you have it i told ander carlos is dead i saw feather shoot him before she shot me sharrol and the children must have gotten away feather stayed to put me in the doc then used the other boat she left me marooned on a desert island i think shed already given up on catching sharrol otherwise why would she need me for a hostage i cant guess where they all are now but if feather was holding sharrol i think id know it how by now she must know im gone she could advertise on the personals net there hasnt been anything like that ander held his peace no point in his telling the poor crashlander that his story leaks like a nasa spacecraft from the way id told it ander could only guess that feather had covered her back trail sharrol and the children must be as dead as carlos and beowulf shaeffer didnt have the courage to face it if he bought it ander would be hunting feather not carlos and i live in pacifica because anywhere else id need pills to protect me from sunlight feather might trace that ander can you do something about feather i keep expecting her to pop up behind my ear ill see what i can do shes arm responsibility could she be dead for all i know carlos cut her i dont know how bad but i saw blood carlos yeah sigmund isnt going to like that what do i give him for proof you might find traces of him on the island but i doubt it ander i think feather dumped him in the hopper for biomass the closest youll get to any remains of carlos wu is right here he didnt understand i stretched my arms flexing my still not quite familiar body not the fish ander me stet which island on another matter i said carlos wus experimental autodoc is a very valuable item i propose to sell it to you ander studied me mildly amused his hands wandered into pockets and came out with a silver match and a box of fat green cigars he said your bargaining position isnt that terrific was he really going to fire up that thing tobacco it had to be tobacco i tore my eyes off his hands cheap i assured him i cant touch it myself after all and you cant afford to lose it look at me that thing rebuilt me from a severed head buying up your trash is not exactly in my job description ill sell you the location you collect it and do with it as you will one hundred thousand stars ander smiled at the number conveying that it was too high even to be funny he said they wouldnt let me smoke on the ship want one no i said watching all my problems solve themselves well half my problems i could run clear off the planet while ander worked at getting himself out of a cell but hed chosen the wrong restaurant and i didnt believe it anyway hed delayed too long his body language was wrong i said wait up dont light that he sat there with the cigar poking out of the center of his grin i thought youd let me do it i said i toyed with the notion if it was just a matter of you going to jail ritz that might improve my leverage i could make you an offer you couldnt walk away from you used to have the tobacco habit yourself but i gave it up to make sharrol happy and tanj if my sense of taste didnt come back ander put those things away pacifica is a big spaceship make you nervous ander dont tease the kzinti the breath caught in his throat the match and cigar disappeared with minimal motions of his hands then his head turned casually they looked at him three big males with glossy orange coats and carefully closed mouths looked away again they werent doing anything threatening maybe they hadnt even noticed riiight kzinti living in pacifica might never have smelled tobacco but any who had would not forget ander seemed calm almost sleepy except that his breathing was a little ragged and there was sweat trickling down his neck the cigar had been for my benefit but he really hadnt noticed the kzinti mankind had claimed this world hadnt we kzinti didnt belong here did they he sought the thread of conversation you dont know where feather filip is and you last saw the magical autodoc a year and a half ago exactly i dont know that feather hasnt been watching for me to come back and get it there were lamplighter islands in line of sight she could be watching for me with a pair of mag specs or she could be anywhere on fafnir but if i find her she can take me to the island i kept silent i can reach some funds tell you what ander said take my entire expense credit five thousand and change ill have to live on credit till sigmund can send me more no no ander i want a hundred thousand id have to beam sigmund id have to tell him what it is for where does that leave me tell him i want two hundred thousand keep half yourself beowulf what you have to sell is a tool thats been left under seawater the technology is in records left behind by carlos wu did he leave records of his research you dont know that encrypted you dont know i dont either could the fafnir government get the techniques by studying the autodoc itself we dont know ander laughed at that what are you going to tell the fafnir bureaucrats you stand five ten maybe but you can produce records that show you seven feet tall records can be faked beowulf im your only customer this was fun i had his attention finally what if we take a stunted kzinti there are a few and skin him and before he suffers too much trauma we shove him in carlos wus doc would it rebuild him into a passable human a perfect spy he guffawed that is really ridiculous oh maybe but there are wealthy kzinti families on fafnir they dont know how tall you used to be either anyway dealing with kzinti is crazy dangerous beowulf ive got nearly six thousand and you can have it all otherwise youll have to wait while i tell sigmund ausfaller what youre selling and sigmund makes a counteroffer and you settle and he finally sends credit all by hyperwave across ten lightyears and if i find feather while youre waiting you get nothing good enough tell him two hundred thousand stars one one half in advance half when youve got the doc ill be here at the pequod until the money comes in i stood up its midnight pay my consultants fee at the hotel desk i walked out thinking id timed that nicely i stopped at the desk to learn my room number i told them there would be a payment entered against room charges my backpurse was hanging in the sleeping plates i checked through it someone might have searched it someone had sharrol looking for what might identify me as a family man shed found and removed my two holos of her one with tanya and louis but not carlos the other more recent pregnant with jeena at her breast twenty minutes between the plates would do me a world of good i thought four hours would be even better no time i rode an elevator to the roof there i paused gazing idly up into the black oceanic night sanity check was i being watched in what fashion arm cameras are little transparent disks you apply with a thumb to a flat surface they dont cost that much and are impossible to spot my room would be a good place to scatter a few so would the lobby doors and the line of transfer booths behind me on the pequods roof but ander had had no chance to set them had he i wished that id known ander smittarasheed better i hadnt learned much today he had the instincts of a cop hed treated me as a felon ready to escape he remembered me fairly well strong as hell what else he had come here for me hed said more likely hed come for us for carlos the valuable one feather the dangerous one beowulf shaeffer the talkative one who knows too much carloss children both united nations citizens sharrol janss could lead him to the rest but i could do that for him too he didnt need sharrol ander must have reached fafnir by tracking a sighting of carloss ship where had he begun his investigations hed started where he had landed at the shasht spaceports of course a party of six three of us flat phobes would not have come to a weird world like fafnir to stay he would search through the hotels and spaceports and hiding places on shasht try to learn if wed left before he faced eleven hours worth of jet lag in the islands if hed gone to outbound hed have found the graynor family all registered for flight those names and a phone file would have brought him to pacifica the public booths in pacifica are lined along the dome with a view up into the underwater jungle for its impact on tourists incoming from shasht ander smittarasheed must have just arrived from shasht when he saw me looking down at him i didnt like that it would mean ander had placed cameras at outbound they would have been waiting when sharrol came in with jeena theyd be there now for me but i couldnt be wrong about this ander had been shocked stupid at the sight of me if he had found records for the graynors hed have everything our transplant types allergies eye color height ander would have given up then or persuaded himself that beowulf shaeffer had made himself shorter but he hadnt known that he hadnt no he hadnt followed a paper trail he had followed one of six fugitives the one he knew through a chain of logic beowulf shaeffer albino track him through the regular purchase of tannin secretion pills no then he must be living like a vampire working a night shift at shasht or the islands at any business that caters to jetlagged travelers no then under the sea losing hope and there he is hed run up a long flight of stairs to catch me he certainly hadnt phoned anyone on the way he hadnt let me out of his sight since congratulations ander beowulf shaeffer has not escaped but ander hadnt had a chance to call for backup the curve of glass above me supported kilotons of seawater and a life older than planet earth luminescent angler fish and eels and elaborately shaped jellyfish writhed through the blackness i sat on a bench and watched perhaps something was watching me ander would search in vain for feather filip that wouldnt stop his search using instruments on a ship or satellite he would pick out every darkened island dead lamplighter no glow of house lights choose among those for just two live islands in line of sight then deep radar for a hollow object more massive than sand offshore carios wus doc in the lamplighter pit the scorched remains of an antique lander hed search out human remains hed find bits of my bones and read their dna if he found traces of feathers blood it would only confirm my story if ander was honest hed return the machine to earth and the un if he changed his mind so much the better give him something to hide to sell meanwhile beowulf shaeffer waits patiently for word let him stew long enough paying hotel rates when he clearly cant afford it and hell settle for much less than his hundred thousand monitor his phone we wouldnt want him looking for a better offer from the shashters let alone the patriarchy at least we know hell wait the thing is shaeffer knows too much a man who has seen julian forwards miniature black hole and the tools he used to make it a weapon should not be running loose the money is trivial well trivial given that it will never be paid but shaeffer needs the money he wont run away from that i watched the eternal show of fafnirs sea life for a time in case i was being watched myself i fished my flat portable out less advanced than anders purchased locally and tapped at it idly addresses popped up with transfer booth numbers some i filed filling in a map people went in and out of the booths maybe one was an arm planting cameras maybe not so i strolled into the near booth got to kill some time right ander or the waiting will drive me nuts my card in the slot look at the wall watch the advertisements flow past and presently tap out a number there were places a single might visit they advertised on the walls of transfer booths id never been in one honest sharrol but when the booth flicked me in i didnt see anything surprising it was noisy and close they were dressed to catch the eye in those bodysuits with windows men and women both the dim light favored them and holograms of real and fantasy worlds made a distracting magic eyes looked me over judging not liking what they saw on every world some singles nodes welcome the tourist trade some dont how they knew me i cant guess because shashters are a varied lot but i was not welcome here one or two men were preparing to tell me so i retrieved my persial january hebert card stepped from the booth and walked straight to the door faster than they could decide and then out any flatlander who followed me through might well be delayed i was hoping to see a restaurant or juice bar but i didnt around the nearest corner then and here was a public booth i didnt use the card i used coins my ears felt the pressure drop what i saw as i stepped from the booth was a patchy cityscape these were the disneys a cluster of ten coral peaks linked to another dozen by slidebridges it was still night a shadow blocked a patch of stars a wedgeshaped dirigible just departing from the flying island terminal you wouldnt find more than one dirigible company to an island why risk dirigibles floating into each other when any customer can take a booth to the next island over there were four terminals in the disneys all on outlying islands from the flying island terminal i began walking daylight would have fried me before i reached my target but the night was a gorgeous display of stars and the waves crashed down in spectral blue and yellow flashes of luminous algae in this light an albino would look no weirder than anyone else if i had a trick worth trying it was unpredictability ander might trace me as far as the singles node what he would learn there might set him to searching hospitals for a battered p j hebert he couldnt follow coins i thought but if somehow he did hed find i had reached the flying island dirigible terminal then then somewhere else with the same haste id shown up to now possibly id boarded a dirigible more likely i was on shasht via instantaneous booth but for most of an hour i rode slidebridges toward beast island on aladdin island i found a tourist section and a hairstyler with a wide range of settings nobody but a flatlander would want his hair colored i turned it sandy and curly and short i stopped again to buy fresh clothing and a bigger backpurse again for a steam bath and massage and to ditch my old clothing ander could have left any number of cameras on my person well before dawn i walked into the grail hunt terminal where i bought my dirigible ticket as martin wallace graynor if ander knew that name hed have milcenta graynor too sharrol but he didnt have feather and feather was adelaide graynor we werent caught yet i boarded the wyvern i settled into a hammock chair and fell fast asleep ghost eight the core ashes of supernovas plasma thick and glowing among millions of neutron stars lighter stars still glowed still retained their retinue of planets automated spacecraft streamed out from a pentagon of blue and white worlds terraforming began on a vast scale would they all be farming worlds to feed one homeworld with a population approaching quintillions the surface would be lost a hollow world would form and swell to jovian size tens of thousands of years away would anyone remember the piersons puppeteers they would yes information is too easy to record too difficult to destroy when the core explosion glared in the night sky anyone who cared would find the fleet of worlds in ancient united nations records and the record of their departure and even beowulf shaeffers opinion as recorded by ander smittarasheed as to where theyd gone if our civilization survived there would be records showing whether i was right the easy sway of wyvern had awakened me i knew before i opened my eyes we were airborne i studied my watch four hours id slept not enough dawn must be a long way away but i ought to do something about it the floor jittered under my feet as i made my groggy way to the dispenser wall the dispensers were coinoperated i thanked my luck and bought tannin secretion pills for the first time in a year and a half i downed four at the fountain then made my way back to the hammock i watched black water and bright islands their centers marked by white city glow or yellow lamplighter glow with the electric blue flash of breakers to outline their rims presently one crept near i watched while wyvern descended to a mooring and a spiral stair came snaking up to us passengers were boarding at thelindas island others were getting off i got off my phone was listed under graynor not hebert i called outbound enterprises ice trireme would lift for home in four days more or less milcenta graynor and a child were frozen solid and doing fine i was expected milcenta had already signed me in was i aware that milcenta was carrying a child special techniques had been required and a surcharge had been added it had been too long since id had my physical id need another before i could board and that too required a surcharge which milcenta had paid shed done it shed retrieved jeena shed reached the terminal and checked us all in and kept her cool until they cooled her down and had never made a mistake my turn now the real martin wallace graynor had played the futures market it had broken him feather had made him an offer and i had become mart graynor i had taken up his habit i bought options to buy shares of cargoes on outgoing spacecraft sold the option if the price went up sometimes exercised the option instead id been doing that for over a year ever since i had reasoned out how it worked i was down a few thousand but that wasnt the point mart graynor held options on cargoes bound for home ice trireme was carrying a fertilizer package cattle dung seeded with minerals earthworms and small lifeforms including unicellular rock eaters the stuff would be treated like a concentrate mixed into rock dust and used as soil mart graynor owned an option to buy at a set price i bought it all i would own it when it landed on home and there i would sell it money moving between stars might be noticed but fertilizer packages were supposed to move next the apt in pacifica in milcenta graynors name should i do something about that but sharrol had been so efficient she might well have put it up for sale herself or we could just let the lease lapse i left it alone twenty minutes gone plenty of time to cross the slidebridge to baker street island put coins in a booth and be waiting on landis island when the dirigible wyvern touched down direct sunlight flamed on my cheeks forehead closed eyelids i thrashed in terror and snapped awake id taken the pills hadnt i pat pockets find the bottle seal broken good we had left most of the islands behind a balcony rimmed the gondola screened with webbing to discourage fools and jumpers several passengers had taken their trays out there i got my breakfast and went out in time to occupy an inflated chair i took my shirt off my blood was suffused with the antisunburn chemicals and my skin darkened fast as the morning wore on we flew not far above the water following the surfaces of enormous swells wyvern felt a longperiod surge and drop this was the deep ocean waves had room to grow out here so did the sea beasts a voice from the control room directed our eyes to where a black shadow was forming in the dark water it surfaced water ran from it a black island then a neck rose and rose farther dozens of yards into the air a bar of a head with eyes widespaced for binocular vision studied the lights of the flying machine above it i felt the heady ecstasy of the discoverer and then a sudden savage guilt we would end on home a flat phobe could live and raise her children there without forcing her body to admit that she had left earth in that respect it lacks interest and that was why we chose it i would be there too marooned beneath the stars at the bottom of a hole as the belters say of planets i didnt even know if there were alien embassies on home im out of the aliens business id said id been on fafnir for a year and a half and id spent it beneath the ocean this was my last chance to see the world my last spaceflight in miniature its misdirection see sharrol the crashlanders hand is more nimble than the eye of the arm but id known what i was doing all along sanity check ander wouldnt ignore the spaceports ander wouldnt forget the iceliners i had to gamble that he had looked at outbound enterprises first and thoroughly before he had come to pacifica sharrol and jeena and i might get clear before ander looked again then the records would tell him that a family native to fafnir had been frozen while halfway around the planet ander was watching water war with beowulf shaeffer he would have no reason at all to connect these graynors with fleeing flatlanders i was not burning time at my familys cost i was confusing my back trail with luck and ingenuity wed be clear of ander smittarasheed and would stay that way now what of sigmund ausfaller they had followed us to fafnir by following the track of carloss ship but fafnir wasnt even the best bet flat phobes would try to reach home my best guess was that sigmund had sent ander here and taken home for himself i would wake from the frozen state and sigmund ausfaller would be looking down at me if ausfaller was on home then there was not one tanj thing i could do to protect us carlos wu must deal with him for i could not i told myself that carlos wu was a match for a dozen sigmund ausfallers night came and the air grew chilly i waited until i was alone and presently pushed my persial january hebert identity through the safety web and watched it fall it was very like flying with nakamura lines as a passenger the differences were all to the good the breeze the clean taste of the air the lesser isolation in case of disaster help was hours away not weeks or months i noticed a recess mentality id seen during spaceflight this was not a real place breaks in discipline would not be paid for diets broke down couples paired off or split up for quick liaisons children ran wild distance and the soft walls absorbed their shrieking a few adults were trying out funny chemicals or flying by wire the people around me were mostly shashters eager for company to while away the hours some of us squared off for computergame competitions our numbers kept changing staying with the same people was difficult because jet lag was hitting us all differently i let conversation find me doing very little of the talking i didnt want anyone remembering a pale flatlander or exastronaut on his way to shasht i turned down some interesting offers honest sharrol the vast reach of fafnirs ocean passed beneath us two days passed very pleasantly before the long backbone of shasht rose from the sea and then all the relaxed people around me began acting like children who have remembered their homework the terminal was on the ridge perched on the spine of the continent i had my choice of booths or a magnetic car or a footpath down through a rocky canyon i chose the footpath maybe i was being overcautious maybe i just wanted the walk or the tan or some extra time before they froze me into something not much like a living man nobody tried to stop me an hours walk brought me to the outbound enterprises office at shasht north spaceport outbound was a smallish pillbox of a building surrounded by parldand it reminded me a little too much of a certain park on earth that had once been a burial ground like forest lawn the outbound building was a pocket of green surrounded by glass slabs of cityscape within the glass wall was a circle of benches and an arc of transfer booths six with phones at either end ms machti ruled at the center she was a dark pretty woman guarded by handsoff body language and by the circle of desk that enclosed her like a fortress i was glad to see her she knew me by sight her fingers were dancing over her keyboard even as she greeted me mr graynor youve had a busy year and a half nice and quiet actually i said are milcenta and jeena all right cooled down and ready for shipment i take it adelaide never appeared no went her own way i guess just as well perhaps she said primly i dont think she approved of mart graynor having two wives let alone bent ones well we have a few formalities to cover and then you can join them did you know that your specs list you at six feet eleven inches my shock must have showed who would have seen that listing i managed a credible laugh did you have an oversized box laid out for me no thats not a problem it was only a matter of rewriting the specs but we couldnt do that ms graynor doesnt seem to know your exact height well have to measure you stet so she waved in a counterclockwise circle waving me around the desk i walked that way and saw the sliding staircase leading down of course most of outbound must be underground i started down ms machti called mr graynor youve a call from a mr ausfaller he says you cant take off yet ausfaller how could he know what did he know he asked for martin wallace graynor no he wanted the redhaired man at the desk and i said mister graynor and he stet can you i did not want the call transferred to my pocket phone may i take it on one of those i waved at the booths certainly it was half a phone booth just two black walls and a projection table it would give me privacy but i could still see out i tapped the receiver and a lifesized bust of sigmund ausfaller popped into view his rather vicious smile faded a little he hadnt expected me at eye level i thought sigmund youre bothering a total stranger sandyhaired tanned a foot shorter than your albino quarry could i get away with that i didnt feel lucky i said long story ask ander so your name is graynor now braynard i said distinctly where are you hed only heard the name over a phone graynor would give the bastard sharrol and jeena too where should i be i saw nothing of background just the head and torso solid projection he could be anywhere i suggested retrieving carlos wus autodoc in due course it shouldnt be left here look outside bey turn left farther look up he was ten floors up in a glass slab looking down at me dollsized he was just big enough to recognize he waved at me from the window then turned back to his holovid phone im right on top of you it would take you hours to freeze yourself perhaps days to be stowed and launched i need only cross the street to stop you let us reason together bey you always seem to have an offer i cant refuse why are you picking on me sigmund i told ander everything he wanted to know i havent heard from ander feather carlos piersons puppeteers youll still have to come home with me bey you know too much and you talk too much now wait dont go off halfcocked i can get you a birthright yeah it was dawning on me that he might not know about sharrol one child we have that much power if you can do something of clear public benefit can you return carlos wu to his home carlos is dead sigmund dead how did you find me you cant see it bey but im looking at four walls of vidscreens we scattered cameras everywhere then we plastered the screens all over my room its been wait one pray turn all screens off he waited an instant looking offstage then thank god i can throw these things away and watch blank walls again ive been watching three spaceport terminals and the top five restaurants and ten hotel lobbies and when you finally showed i couldnt believe it was you you damn well convinced yourself somehow i couldnt believe it wasnt either sorry about that bey are you sure about carlos feather blew a hole through him but the nanotech doc is his last legacy and its un property and i might arrange to put that in your hands very good well have a chance to talk about puppeteers and the like on the way home a bell pinged he turned around and shouted pray open the door he turned back and feather you know we never intended to turn her loose on an alien world we want some weaponry back too and the others sharrol and the children i set my face for the big lie feathers g signumd jumped at me banged his face on the edge of the field recoiled and fell backward and out of sight ander smittarasheed stepped into view wading through the table short ribs deep he was holding a familiar object he reached down sigmund ausfaller was pulled into view by his hair sigmunds chest was shattered a huge hole rammed through it ander was holding feather filips horrible arm weapon the gun that had blown a hole through my own chest he pointed it at me recognize this for an instant i thought i was going mad he couldnt have that he couldnt it was in the apt sharrols apt hidden ah sharrol left it for me she left me a weapon in my backpurse not a bad idea but ander must have searched my room searched by backpurse found it there when after dinner when i was at the hotel desk getting my key ander said where are you beowulf i was still looking through outbounds huge window high up in that glass slab i could see a tiny figure where ausfaller had waved at me the back of anders head and shoulders if he turned around and looked down he would see me i didnt turn away the front of me now looked less like beowulf shaeffer than the back and what could ander see in his phone the miniature bust of a tanned stranger and nothing behind it i said im in my room at the pequod ander nothing was said about killing the poor flat beowulf we can hardly sell our wonderful nanotech machine without sigmund knowing where we got it the room isnt registered to anyone and the punchgun can go with me you havent used the punchgun have you like for robbing a droud shop no then at worst theyll track it back to the arm and then maybe to you my head seemed filled with fog did i do this did i find the temptation that turned ander smittarasheed into a thief and killer or was he always that what do i do now play it out a dead man cant send us money i said sigmund brought local money itll be in that case it may take me a while to break the security programs and i dont really know how much he brought show me the case what you think im lying he bent out of view then rose again with a heavy silver briefcase in his fist now is when you tell me where the island is i gave him a longitude the right one latitude when ive got half the money ill be in touch wait ander get rid of the punchgun ander laughed i think ill keep it hed seen how i feared it hed keep it to intimidate me i tried anyway ander i was wearing a v he flicked off i waited at the phone until i saw the shape in the hotel room window stand and step out of view then i went back to the desk are you ready to freeze me ms machti whitegarbed medics wanted my retina prints and a voice match i was five feet ten and a half inches tall the physical exam they put me through seemed perfunctory but what could they find carlos wus autodoc had rebuilt me almost from my dna map id never been in better shape i wanted to view sharrol and jeena the doctors let me see them they looked all right well dead but otherwise i was nerving myself to join them as if id left myself a choice what a mess poor sigmund what would the local police make of that wound theyd never seen a corpse like that but theyd seen a vest like that the punchgun had torn that kind of hole through a survival vest that had belonged to a persial january hebert whod sunk out of sight a year and a half ago surely theyd make the connection theyd come looking for the reclusive persial january hebert hebert had indulged in a sudden flurry of activity a phone call here a hotel room at the pequod hotel a dinner with ander smittarasheed without the punchgun ander might bluff his way through but the weapon would nail him would identify him he couldnt hold on to the gun without using it would he even hesitate a trained arm facing colony cops fafnir is a human world ander was unlikely to guess how many police are kzinti i wondered how much damage ander would do before it all caught up with him there could be one fearful bloodbath if he tried to shoot his way free nice for me ander dead was ander silent but tens of thousands of years from now nobody would find the old arm records of a wild hypothesis nobody would wonder if a trillion powerful aliens had left known space to take possession of the galactic core it might never matter even if i was right or be all to the good if i was wrong either way i couldnt think of a way to stop him they were spraying my arm i would be in a coma when they cooled me down and launched me i wondered whose face would be looking down at me when i woke
