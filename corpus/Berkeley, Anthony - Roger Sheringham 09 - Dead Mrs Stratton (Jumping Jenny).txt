dead mrs stratton anthony berkeley concerning roger sheringham roger sheringham was born in in a small english provincial town near london where his father practised as a doctor roger therefore grew up in a familiar atmosphere of drugs and medical talk he was an only child and was educated in the usual english way for the sons of professional men that is to say he went first to a local day school then at the age of ten as a boarder to a preparatory school in surrey then at fourteen he won a small scholarship at one of the ancient smaller public schools which despise eton and harrow just as thoroughly as eton and harrow ignore them and finally in he went up to merton college oxford where he failed to win a scholarship at oxford he read classics and history and took a second class in each but distinguished himself more conspicuously by winning his blue in his last year for golf he played rugby football for his college but did not shine at it and he lazed most of his summer terms away in a punt on the cherwell he was just able to take his degree before the war shut oxford down like an extinguisher roger served from to in a sound line regiment was wounded twice not very seriously and though recommended twice for the military cross and once for the dso was awarded nothing which privately annoyed him a good deal after the war he spent a couple of years trying to find out what nature had intended him to do in life and it was only after spasmodic interludes as a schoolmaster in business and even as a chicken farmer that by the merest chance he bought some pens some ink and some paper and at enormous speed dashed off a novel to his extreme surprise the novel jumped straight into the best selling ranks both in england and america and roger had found his vocation he exchanged his pens for a typewriter engaged a secretary and got down to it he was always careful to treat his writing as a business and nothing else privately he had quite a poor opinion of his own books combined with a horror of ever becoming like some of the people with whom his new work brought him into contact authors who take their own work with such deadly seriousness talk about it all the time and consider themselves geniuses beside whom wells and kipling and sinclair lewis are just amateurs for this reason he was always careful to keep his hobbies well in the front of his mind and his chief hobby was criminology which appealed not only to his sense of the dramatic but to his feeling for character it had never occurred to him that he himself might have any gifts as a detective though a love of puzzles of all kinds had been handed down to him by his father so that when on a visit to a country house called layton court in his host was discovered one morning dead in his library in circumstances pointing to suicide it did not occur to roger at once to make any investigations on his own account it was only when certain points struck him as curious that his inquisitive nature asserted itself the same thing happened at a town called wychford which was in a ferment over the arrest of the french wife of one of its leading citizens on a charge of poisoning her husband the woman and her husband were both complete strangers to him but roger on the evidence in the newspapers decided that she was innocent and really more for his own gratification than anything else set out to prove it this case brought him the recognition of scotland yard and a certain amount of publicity with the result that his hobby developed and he was soon in a position to take an active part in any case which interested him just as roger the novelist had determined to avoid becoming like the worse specimens of that profession so roger the detective was anxious not to resemble the usual pompous and irritating detective of fiction or rather one should say of the fiction at the time when he began his career for the fashion in detectives has since altered considerably he knew that he could never pose as one of the hatchet faced tight lipped hawk eyed lot while his natural loquaciousness would prevent him from ever being inscrutable as a result he went perhaps too far to the other extreme and erred on the side of breeziness in matters of detection roger sheringham knows his own limitations he recognizes that although argument and logical deduction from fact are not beyond him his faculty for deduction from character is a bigger asset to him and he knows quite well that he is not infallible he has in point of fact very often been quite wrong but that never deters him from trying again for the rest he has unbounded confidence in himself and is never afraid of taking grave decisions and often quite illegal ones when he thinks that pure justice can be served better in this way than by twelve possibly stupid jurymen many people like him enormously and many people are irritated by him beyond endurance he is quite indifferent to both possibly he is a good deal too pleased with himself but he does not mind that either give him his three chief interests in life and he is perfectly happy criminology human nature and good beer chapter i the gallows tree from the triple gallows three figures swung lazily one woman and two men only a gentle creaking of their ropes sounded in the quiet night a horn lantern perched above the triangle of the crosspieces swayed in the slight wind causing the three shadows to leap and prance on the ground in a grotesque dance of death like some macabre travesty of a slow motion film in silhouette very nice said roger sheringham it is rather charming isnt it agreed his host two jumping jacks i see and one jumping jenny jumping jenny doesnt stevenson in catriona call them jumping jacks and i suppose the feminine would be jumping jenny i suppose it would morbid devil ronald roger said curiously arent you ronald stratton laughed well i thought at a murderer and victim party the least one could have was a gallows it took me quite a long time to stuff those chaps with straw two of my suits and an old dress dug up from goodness knows where i may be morbid but i am conscientious its extremely effective roger said politely it is rather isnt it you know i should hate to be hanged so very ignominious to say the least really roger i dont think murders worth it well lets go down and have a drink the two men went towards the door in a little gable of its own which led from the big flat roof on which the gallows had been erected into the house the little gable carrying the door projected at right angles from a larger one and almost in the angle was a short flight of iron steps leading over the tiles and ending apparently in nothing the glint of the bright moonlight on the metal caught rogers eye and he jerked his head towards it whats up there not another flat roof yes a small one i ran a flat across the top of those two parallel gables they used to be an awful nuisance when there was any snow or stormy weather i thought the flat would be rather pleasant as an observation point one gets a big view from it but i dont suppose i go up there once a year roger nodded and the two passed through the doorway and down the flight of stairs which led from the roof they crossed the top landing of an ancient well staircase passed the open door of a very large room full of oak beams and dim corners in the gabled ceiling where a dozen murderers and murderesses were dancing on a parquet floor to a very modern radio gramophone and walked into another room scarcely less large at the end of the landing as they stepped into the lighted area it could be seen that rogers companion was picturesquely dressed in a black velvet suit and knee breeches he and his younger brother david stratton represented the princes in the tower roger himself clinging like most of the men present to the conventional dinner jacket and black tie had announced that he was gentleman george joseph smith of brides in the bath fame who did not know that he ought to have come in a white tie and tails stratton looked hospitable with bottles what will you have what have you got asked his guest cautiously roger having been furnished with a tankard of old ale and his host with a whiskey and soda the two men leaned their backs against the heavy oak crossbeam of the wide open fireplace and warming themselves pleasantly in the traditional masculine regions continued to chat lightly upon sudden death roger did not know ronald stratton particularly well stratton was something of a dilettante a man in young middle age comparatively wealthy who wrote detective stories because it amused him to do so his detective stories were efficient imaginative and full of a rather gruesome humour the idea of this party exactly carried out the light handed treatment of death in his books there were about a couple of dozen guests certainly not more and each one was supposed to represent a well known murderer or his victim the idea was not strictly original but the embellishment of a gallows on the flat roof was typically so the party was nominally in honour of roger who with half a dozen others was staying in the house for the week end but roger himself was not at all sure that he was not an excuse rather than a cause still he was not disposed to worry about that he liked stratton who amused him and the party not yet an hour old promised to be a good one his eye wandered across the room to a far corner where an exquisitely polished sofa table loaded with decanters and glasses was doing somewhat vulgar duty as a bar most of the other guests were dancing to the wireless in the adjoining ballroom but by the bar mrs pearcey was telling dr crippen the story of her life it was not the first time that rogers eye had lingered on mrs pearcey mrs pearcey seemed to invite the eyes of others to linger upon her not indeed through her good looks for she had few nor through anything so coarse as ogling but simply because she appeared determined that wherever she might be she should be noticed roger always on the lookout for types was interested he felt too that it was probably significant that the lady should have chosen the dowdy but undoubtedly striking role of mrs pearcey rather than the showier costume part of mary blandy there was a mary blandy and undoubtedly mrs pearcey was the more effective he turned to stratton mrs pearcey over there i dont believe ive met her yet it is your sister in law isnt it it is ronald strattons voice had lost its usual humorous tone and become flat and expressionless i thought so roger said carelessly and wondered why strattons voice should have changed like that it was plain that he did not very much like his sister in law but roger thought that was hardly sufficient reason for such a very blank tone however it was obviously impossible to probe further stratton began to ask questions about the cases with which his guest had been connected roger replied without his customary enthusiasm his ears were directed towards the low conversation on the other side of the room which was not so much a conversation as a monologue it was impossible to hear the words through the music which came from the ballroom but the tone was eloquent it meandered on and on and roger thought he could detect in it a note of noble endeavour thwarted mingled with a deeper undercurrent of christian resignation he wondered what on earth the woman was talking about so interminably whatever it was dr crippen was plainly bored by it roger wished unblushingly that he could hear what it was all about the dance came to an end and some of the dancers drifted in to the bar a large man with one of those pleasant nobbly faces strolled up to stratton and roger well ronald my man hullo philip been doing your duty no yours ive been dancing with your young woman perfectly charming my dear fellow said the newcomer with an air of naive sincerity which was in itself charming thats rather what i think ronald grinned by the way have you met sheringham this is dr chalmers sheringham how do you do said the doctor shaking hands with obvious pleasure your names very familiar to me is it said roger good it all helps sales oh i didnt say id gone so far as to buy one of your books but i have read them better and better roger grinned dr chalmers stayed for a few moments and then moved off to the bar to get his late partner a drink roger turned to stratton thats a particularly nice man isnt it yes stratton agreed his family and mine and his wifes family were all more or less brought up together so the chalmers are really about my oldest friends philips elder brother was my contemporary and philip is really a closer friend of my brothers than mine but i like him immensely hes absolutely genuine nearly always says just what he thinks and is the only man ive ever met called philip who isnt a prig and more i cant say for any man hear hear roger agreed hullo is that the music i suppose id better go and do a bit of duty introduce me to somebody id like to dance with will you ill introduce you to my young woman stratton said finishing off his drink odd roger remarked idly i always used to think you were married i always used to be then we had a divorce now im going to do it again you must meet my ex wife some time shes quite a nice person shes here tonight with her fiance were the best friends in the world very sensible roger approved if i ever got married so that i could be divorced im sure i should be so grateful to my wife that id want to be the best friends in the world with her they walked together towards the ballroom roger noticed with interest that mrs pearcey was just in front of them with an unknown man evidently she had torn herself away from dr crippen i say ronald a low guarded voice had assailed them from behind turning about they beheld dr crippen clinging as it were desperately to a large whiskey and soda no one else remained at the bar hullo osbert said stratton i say dr crippen sidled towards them with a surreptitious air as one not quite sure whether he is standing on solid ground again or not i say yes i say said dr crippen with a confidential guilty grin is your sister in law quite mad ronald eh is she quite said stratton equably come on sheringham ronald strattons young woman proved to be a charming lady of about his own age with very fair hair and a delightful smile who admitted to two children of her own and the name of mrs lefroy she wore a seventeenth century dress of white satin brocade with a hooped skirt which admirably set off her fair colouring youve been married before then roger asked conversationally as they began to dance i still am replied mrs lefroy surprisingly at least i think i am roger made an apologetic noise i somehow thought you were engaged to ronald he said lamely oh yes i am said mrs lefroy brightly roger gave it up ive got my nisi mrs lefroy explained but not my absolute this seems to be quite a modern party roger observed mildly swerving somewhat violently to avoid another couple who did not seem to know what they were doing as they passed he saw that the couple was composed as to its feminine half of mrs pearcey who was talking so earnestly to her partner that he was able to devote little attention to the steering of her modern echoed mrs lefroy is it only as regards the strattons and me i think if by modern you mean not only readiness to recognize that youve made a mistake in your marriage which is what most married couples always have done but readiness to rectify it which is what most of them still havent the courage to do and yet youre ready to try again oh yes one mistake doesnt make a series besides i never think a first marriage ought to count do you ones so busy learning how to be married at all that one can hardly help acquiring a kind of resentment against ones partner in error and once resentment has crept in the things finished anyhow there one is all nice and trained to the house the complete article for the next comer after all ones got to cut ones teeth on something but one doesnt cherish the dummy for the rest of ones life does one she laughed and roger laughed too but nature provides a second set of teeth havent they to be cut on another dummy oh no they just come all ready cut but im quite serious mr sheringham one isnt the same person at thirty four as one was at twenty four so why should one be expected to be suitable to the human being who fitted ten years earlier probably both of you have developed on completely different lines i think one should change partners when ones development is complete except of course in the rare cases where the two do happen to have developed together you neednt apologize for your divorce you know roger murmured mrs lefroy laughed again i wouldnt dream of doing any such thing it just happens to be a subject i feel rather strongly about what i think is that our marriage laws are all on the wrong lines marriage oughtnt to be easy and divorce difficult it ought to be just the other way about a couple ought to have to go up before a judge and say please weve lived together for two years now and were quite certain were suited to each other weve got our witnesses here to swear that were terribly fond of each other and hardly ever quarrel and we like the same things and were both quite healthy were certain we know our own minds so please cant we get married now and then theyd get their marriage nisi and if by the end of six months the kings proctor couldnt prove that they were unsuited after all or didnt really love each other or would be better apart their marriage could be made absolute dont you think thats a very good idea its the best idea ive ever heard about marriage yet said roger with conviction and ive produced a few myself oh yes i know your idea is that the best thing to do is not to get married at all well theres something to be said for that at least im sure my poor brother in law to be would agree with you ronalds brother you mean yes you know him i suppose that tall good looking fair young man over there dancing with the woman in the leg of mutton sleeves mrs maybrick no i dont know him why would he agree with me oh mrs lefroy looked a little guilty perhaps i oughtnt to have said anything after all i only know what ronalds told me is it a secret roger pleaded with unabashed curiosity well i suppose so in a way anyhow i dont think id better say anything but i shouldnt think added mrs lefroy with a smile that it will be a secret for long youve only got to watch her ill watch her said roger in the meantime do you mind telling me who youre supposed to be havent you guessed i thought you were a criminologist mrs lefroy looked down not without pride at her billowing white skirts so i am not a costumier well the marquise de brinvilliers then didnt you recognize the arsenic green of my necklace i thought that was rather a subtle touch she picked up her bag and white velvet gloves from the top of the grand piano and glanced round the room i can see that ronalds infecting you roger regretted he was sorry when ronald came up as if in response to the glance and claimed his young woman mrs lefroy seemed to him a woman of ideas and women of ideas are rare so for that matter are men roger drifted as a man will to the bar his feeling that the party was going to be an interesting one was confirmed it pleased him that ex mrs stratton should be present as well as future mrs stratton both of them all smiles and friendliness and completely unembarrassed that is how things should be done in an enlightened age at the bar were dr chalmers and another local doctor who had once played rugger for england and was broad in proportion he wore a red and white bandana handkerchief round his neck and a black mask pushed up on his forehead and his hands were splashed with red the two were discussing in the way of doctors some obscene innard belonging to one of their less fortunate patients which dr mitchell had been engaged that afternoon in yanking out beside them stood angrily a thin dark lady roger recognized her as the mrs maybrick with the leg of mutton sleeves who had been dancing with david stratton ah sheringham dr chalmers greeted him were talking shop im afraid do you ever talk anything else observed the thin dark lady acidly mr sheringham my wife said dr chalmers with the greatest cheerfulness and this is frank mitchell another of our local medicos roger professed himself enchanted to meet mrs chalmers and dr mitchell but whom he added scrutinizing the latters bandana and mask are you supposed to represent i thought i had them all at my fingertips but i cant place you are the two of you brown and kennedy no jack the ripper said dr mitchell proudly he displayed his red splotched hands this is blood disgusting said mrs chalmers maybrick i quite agree roger said politely i much preferred your methods you used arsenic didnt you or never used it according to another school of thought if i did its a pity i used it all said mrs chalmers with a short laugh i might have saved some up for a better purpose a little mystified roger produced a polite smile the smile died away as he observed a significant glance pass between the two doctors a glance which he could not quite interpret but which seemed to convey a kind of mutual warning in any case both doctors immediately began to speak at once i suppose you dont know many sorry frank talking of arsenic i wonder if sorry phil there was an awkward pause this is odd thought roger what the devil is going on in this place to fill up the pause he said and you still baffle me completely chalmers you dont seem to be made up as anyone at all phil never will dress up remarked mrs chalmers resentfully dr chalmers who appeared to have remarkable powers of blandly ignoring the observations of his wife replied heartily im an undiscovered murderer thats out of compliment to you i know its a theory of yours that the worlds full of them roger laughed i dont call that quite fair and anyhow put in mrs chalmers philip couldnt murder anyone to save his life she spoke as if this were an old grievance of hers well ill be an undiscovered doctor murderer if you like said dr chalmers with complete equanimity i expect there are plenty of them about eh frank my man sure to be agreed dr mitchell with candour hullo is that the music stopping i think ill he finished off his drink and strolled towards the ballroom hes only been married four months remarked mrs chalmers tolerantly ah said roger the three exchanged smiles and roger wondered why it should be amusing when a man has only been married four months he could not quite see why but undoubtedly it was roger decided that almost anything to do with marriage was either comedy or tragedy it depended whether one was looking at it from the outside or the in good gracious exclaimed dr chalmers you havent got a drink sheringham ronald will never forgive me what can i get you thanks roger said ive been drinking beer he stood hopefully by as one does when someone else is manipulating a bottle for ones benefit watching he could not help noticing the unhandy way in which dr chalmers carried out that same manipulation instead of holding both bottle and tankard on a level with his chest in the usual way he held them much lower and after he had filled the latter roger noticed that he put down the tankard which he had been holding in his right hand and gave his left arm a jerk upwards with that hand before he could lift the bottle over the edge of the table the disability was so obvious that roger remarked on it thank you he said taking the tankard got a bad arm yes a bit of trouble from the war you know philip had the whole of his left shoulder shot away said philips wife in an annoyed way did you that must be rather a nuisance to you isnt it i suppose you cant operate oh yes dr chalmers said cheerfully it doesnt bother me much really i can drive a car and sail a yacht and do a bit of flying when i can get off and operate of course its only the shoulder thats gone you see i cant raise my upper arm from the shoulder but i can lift my forearm from the elbow it might have been a lot worse he spoke quite naturally and without any of the false embarrassment which seems to overtake most men when forced to speak of their war wounds rotten luck said roger sincerely well heres the best mrs chalmers arent you drinking anything not just yet thank you i dont want to make an exhibition of myself im sure you wouldnt do that said roger a little taken aback the remark had seemed so pointed that it could only have been directed at himself but he could not understand why mrs chalmers should have thought it necessary to be so rude no and i dont intend to said mrs chalmers grimly and looked fixedly in his direction the next moment roger saw that she was not looking at him at all but over his right shoulder he turned round and followed her eyes several people had drifted in from the ballroom and among them was ronald strattons sister in law the woman dressed as mrs pearcey it was on her that mrs chalmerss gaze was fixed she was standing by the bar in company with a youngish tall man whom roger had not yet met and he was evidently asking her what she would like ill have a whiskey and soda thanks she said in a voice which was just loud enough to be a shade ostentatious a large one i feel like getting drunk tonight after all its the only thing worth doing really isnt it this time roger joined in the significant glance which passed between dr and mrs chalmers he finished up his beer made his excuses to the chalmers and went off to look for ronald stratton i must meet that woman he said to himself drunk or sober ronald was in the ballroom twiddling with the wireless the music to which they had been dancing had been provided by konigswusterhausen and ronald had decided it was too heavy something french was indicated three persons were remonstrating with him for no particular reason beyond the strange prejudice most people have against seeing the owner of a large wireless set twiddling its knobs one of them roger knew to be ronalds sister celia stratton a tall girl picturesquely dressed as eighteenth century mary blandy the other two were crippen and a small woman dressed as a boy who was not difficult to recognize as miss le neve a piercing soprano voice shot out from the wireless in one momentary shriek instantly cut off but not quickly enough for the manipulators critics leave it alone ronald begged miss stratton it was perfectly all right as it was reinforced miss le neve its a funny thing pronounced dr crippen with some weight as one who has given considerable thought to the point that people who have a wireless cant leave it alone for more than two seconds at a time blah said ronald and continued to twiddle the knob a burst of jazz music rewarded him there he said with pride thats a great deal better it isnt a bit better his sister contradicted its worse opined miss le neve its rotten dr crippen supported her where is it konigswusterhausen replied ronald blandly and with a wink at roger walked quickly away before the latter could follow him a question from celia stratton took his opportunity away did he know mr and mrs williamson roger had to admit that he did not know mr and mrs williamson dr crippen and miss le neve were made acquainted with him under that title roger politely expressed admiration of their disguises osbert only had to put on a pair of gold rimmed glasses volunteered mrs williamson hes just like crippen isnt he mr sheringham how unsafe you must feel lilian said celia stratton can you wonder i want to leave the studio and get a place with a few more rooms if the fit came on him there i could never get away in time you know perfectly well lilian remonstrated her husband that you only wanted me to be crippen so that you could be miss le neve lilian never loses a chance of getting into trousers explained mr williamson with candour to the group in general why shouldnt i get into trousers if i want to demanded mrs williamson and sniffed i hope youve got them fastened with a safety pin at the back said roger fatuously everyone looked at him inquiringly and he wished he had not spoken miss le neves trousers were too large for her he had to explain and she took a tuck in them at the back with a safety pin the captain of the liner noticed it and thought it rather odd lilians certainly arent too large for her said mr williamson with a rude husbandly laugh though they may be quite as odd eh lilian what i like my trousers tight said mrs williamson and sniffed again roger who was not so interested in these garments as the others appeared to be turned the conversation with a jerk i havent met your sister in law yet miss stratton he said in a blandly conversational tone i wonder if youd introduce me davids wife yes of course where is she she was at the bar a minute ago shes mad observed mr williamson with some interest really osbert expostulated his wife with a glance at celia stratton oh dont mind me said miss stratton kindly roger could not let this promising opening pass mad is she i like mad people what particular form does your sister in laws madness take miss stratton oh i dont know celia stratton said lightly shes just generally mad i expect if osbert says so roger noticed that in spite of the lightness of her tone there was an undercurrent of caution in miss strattons voice it was almost as if she had been glad to accept the idea of her sister in laws madness in order to hide something worse she wants to talk about her soul explained osbert williamson with some gloom osbert isnt interested in souls mrs williamson explained not having one of his own he cant very well be im not interested in her soul pronounced mr williamson but id keep an eye on her celia if i were you when i was with her she was swigging down double whiskies nineteen to the dozen and saying she wanted to get tight because it was the only thing worth while or some nonsense oh dear sighed miss stratton is she in that mood perhaps id better go and look after her then why does she want to get tight mr williamson asked her as she moved away she thinks it clever mr sheringham youd better come with me if you want to meet her roger went with alacrity chapter ii not a nice lady it was ronald strattons custom to enliven his parties with charades as he candidly explained this was solely because he happened to like charades and as the party was his he did not see why he should not play them unfortunately for roger ronald had decided upon charades at just that moment and before the introduction could be effected celia stratton had been called in to search the sitting out places for unwilling players meanwhile sides were chosen out of those who were present and since mrs david stratton and roger were on opposite sides the acquaintanceship had again to be postponed roger was interested however to find that the ladys husband was on his side although he had known ronald stratton slightly for some years roger had never before met david as with so many brothers the two were utterly unlike ronald was not particularly tall david was quite six feet ronald was broad david was slight ronald was dark david fair ronald had a snub nose david an aquiline one ronald was enthusiastic and sometimes rather childish in his amusements david had a wearily disillusioned air and his wit had a cynical trend one would have said that ronald was the younger and david the elder instead of the other way about celia stratton who had been appointed captain of the side took her duties seriously it was their turn to perform first and shepherding her flock out of the ballroom she called firmly upon roger for an actable word of two syllables roger instantly found his mind an utter and complete blank and could only eye the bar with distant longing in the end it was david stratton who produced the word and a neat little three act drama to fit it which as an impromptu impressed roger considerably your brothers very much on the spot tonight he remarked casually to celia as they looked out props suitable to the inhabitants of nineveh prior to the engulfment of jonah by the whale oh david can usually be relied on for something like that said miss stratton can he i wonder he doesnt try his hand at writing david he used to do a little before he married punch you know and some of the weeklies we thought at one time that he might do something quite good he began a book which promised very well why didnt he finish it celia stratton bent a little lower over the drawer into which she was delving oh he got married she said and once again roger felt that she was hiding something under the apparent indifference of her tone he looked at her curiously but did not pursue the topic of two things however he felt quite sure that somehow david strattons marriage had spoilt what might have been a successful career and that celia stratton was not nearly so indifferent about it as she pretended more mystery he thought under cover of the general badinage he observed david stratton more closely at a first glance the latter looked animated enough as he laughingly tried to persuade a pretty plump woman whom everyone called margot to impersonate the whale but it needed little more than a casual look to see that underneath the temporary excitement was an immense weariness indeed the man looked tired to death and not only tired but positively ill and yet roger knew that his job of acting as his brothers estate agent was not at all an exacting one why then did he look as if he had hardly slept for a month roger wondered if he were making mountains out of molehills the charades pursued their usual and hilarious course and roger found himself enjoying them absurdly the williamsons were on his side and so was dr mitchell and his pretty young bride to whom her groom was as patently and as unselfconsciously devoted as any wife could have hoped roger found himself becoming quite sentimental in contemplation of the two of them jean mitchell was dressed as madeleine smith in crinoline and poke bonnet and looked quite charming enough to deserve all the attentions that were being poured out on her it was not until their own turn of activity was ended and they were sitting on a row of chairs at one end of the ballroom waiting to deride the efforts of the other side that a hint of drama underneath the froth began to show itself roger found himself rather marooned on his left sat celia stratton with dr mitchell and his wife beyond her on his right the plump lady called margot whom roger had now discovered to be ronald strattons late wife with david stratton separating her from her fiance a large and somewhat silent young man whose name roger had gathered to be mike armstrong and almost immediately celia stratton had begun to engage in a low toned and extremely earnest conversation with dr mitchell while ex mrs mar got stratton at the same time embarked on an exactly similar one with david stratton roger hid his yawns and wished that the other side would be a little quicker then willy nilly scraps of the two conversations began to reach him but are you sure it was ena who was responsible for it he heard celia stratton ask in a worried voice positive dr mitchell replied grimly i went straight round to mrs farebrother as soon as jean told me and she said that ena had told her in the strictest confidence of course confidence i told mrs farebrother it was an infernal lie of course and i think ive stopped it going any further in that direction but how many other dr mitchell lowered his voice ena observed roger pensively to himself is mrs david stratton he became aware of david strattons voice unguardedly loud on his other side i tell you margot i cant stand it much longer im about at the end of my tether its a damned shame david his late sister in law replied warmly you know what i thought about her ronald used to say i made things very awkward for him but i couldnt help that after that eaves business i swore id never have her in any house of mine again and i never did i know david stratton rejoined gloomily it was a bit awkward for me as well as ronald but i couldnt blame you after all as i pointed out to her you might have done a good deal more than refuse to receive her here if youd been really vindictive thats what i told ronald roger shifted in his chair i wouldnt mind if there was an atom of truth in any of it said dr mitchell with sudden violence but these damnable lies i know its the way it takes her personally broke in jean mitchells small clear voice i dont see that it matters everyone must know theyre lies what i cant understand is why she wants to do it oh shes a pathological case darling theres no doubt about that but really celia something ought to be done about her shes a danger to the community yes but what thats the trouble i dont know yet dr mitchell folded his arms and looked for a pleasant man quite formidable but i can promise you shes going to be sorry she started monkeying with jean thats a little bit too much roger took a notebook out of his pocket and began jotting down names among so many strangers with so many different relationships he found it difficult to keep his head clear still the other side did not appear only suppressed gigglings and an occasional hoot of laughter outside the door testified to their continued existence but why dont you leave her david money of course if only i could afford to keep her apart from me id do it like a shot cant ronald help at all no david stratton was firm enough about that its damnable margot stratton stared ahead as if racking her brains for something that would help celia stratton turned to roger i quite forgot to ask you mr sheringham did you find everything in your room that you wanted everything thank you said roger politely rogers list of his fellow guests and hosts ran as follows ronald stratton prince in tower david stratton ena stratton celia stratton margot stratton mike armstrong dr chalmers mrs chalmers dr mitchell mrs mitchell mr williamson mrs williamson mrs lefroy colin nicolson these roger considered comprised all ronald strattons intimates and seemed to fall into a group of their own there were a dozen or so more people present all from the neighbourhood but they kept more or less to themselves and stratton did not try to mingle the two groups the doctors of course were local men and they formed something in the nature of a connecting link between the two lots roger had been told by stratton that the local group would probably leave early and the house party would then keep it up there were about half a dozen of the latter the williamsons who lived in london were staying the night and so was colin nicolson who was the assistant editor of a weekly paper for which stratton did a good deal of work and whom roger had known and liked for some years mrs lefroy was staying too and celia stratton had come down to act as hostess for her brother roger himself had also been asked for the night when the charades were over at last roger once more tried to effect contact between himself and ena stratton and once again he was foiled ronald himself had swung his sister in law onto the floor to set the dancing in train again glancing round in a baffled way roger saw that agatha lefroy was sitting alone on a couch at one end of the room and he joined her do you mind if we dont dance he said i used to be considered rather good before the war but somehow the old zest seems to have gone of course not mrs lefroy smiled lets stop here anyhow id much rather talk than dance what shall we talk about ena stratton roger said promptly he was hardly surprised when even mrs lefroy reacted in the usual way to that name her smile did not waver she did not start or turn pale but precisely the same guarded air showed itself to rogers observation as she replied brightly enough she interests you she does decidedly and i havent even met her yet tell me about her i dont know that theres much to tell you is there in what way particularly any way i wont ask about her marriage because you said that was a secret just tell me why youre afraid of her afraid of her mrs lefroy echoed indignantly im not in the least afraid of her yes you are roger said calmly why or shall i ask ronald no dont ask ronald mrs lefroy said quickly and added rather inconsequently anyhow he wouldnt tell you nor will you said roger half lightly and half seriously youre really rather inquisitive mr sheringham arent you intolerably i cant help it you see i scent a mystery and i cant bear mysteries oh said mrs lefroy slowly theres no mystery about ena and yet roger hazarded quite a number of people in this room cordially detest her i can quite believe it mrs lefroy smiled shes really rather a dangerous woman how can such a totally unimportant person be dangerous roger asked following the young woman in question round the room with his eyes and yet youre the second person within the last half hour whom ive heard call her that i suppose i ought not to ask you what shes been doing to dr mitchell and yet i wish i could oh ill tell you that shes been spreading a ridiculous lie about his wife why mrs lefroy shrugged her shoulders she seems to enjoy doing that sort of thing which sort of thing lying for lyings sake or doing an inoffensive person a bad turn neither exactly i think its really an opportunity to make herself appear important thats her idee fixe she must be the centre of things the wonder of all beholders philip chalmers ronalds great friend you know says shes a pronounced ego maniac no doubt thats as good a term for her as any williamson has a better one he just says simply that shes mad mrs lefroy laughed in a way i suppose she is anyhow is that all you wanted to know not quite whats your own private trouble with her dont tell me of course roger added kindly if you dont want to i shouldnt dream of it but i really dont mind as it seems to worry you so much i dont trust her thats all dont trust her ronalds been rather indiscreet in calling us engaged mrs lefroy explained its all right of course in the family and so on or should be but as i told you i havent got my absolute yet well david warned ronald this afternoon that enas been hinting that she could make trouble with the kings proctor if she wanted to roger whistled why should she want to mrs lefroy looked a little uncomfortable oh there are reasons no doubt from her point of view reasons for making trouble reasons why she might be sorry to see ronald marry again oh yes i see it did not need very much perspicacity on rogers part to guess something of what those reasons might be ronald and margot stratton had had no children david and ena had a small boy as roger knew the boy was ronalds godson ronald who had a flair for business as well as for writing detective stories had made his money not inherited it it seemed likely that as things had been he might have made his godson his heir with perhaps a life interest for david if he married again another heir might present itself it was decidedly in ena strattons interests that her brother in law should not marry again yes i see roger repeated quite like a plot for one of ronalds own detective stories isnt it by mrs lefroys smile he knew that his guess had been right so ronald says himself he looks on it as a joke she added but it might be quite serious an unscrupulous woman would do things that an equally unscrupulous man might boggle at yes thats quite true is she unscrupulous perfectly i should think said mrs lefroy with resignation there was a short silence then roger looked puzzled i dont know much about these things but would it really worry the kings proctor to know that you were going to marry ronald when youre free i know the kings proctor is very easily worried but that does seem almost hypersensitive mrs lefroy looked at the tip of her neat slipper once he begins making special inquiries who knows what might happen to him she said cryptically collusion like a worm i the bud might feed on his damask cheek as my friend lord peter wimsey might say roger nodded with sympathetic understanding shall i strangle the woman for you i wish to heaven someone would said mrs lefroy with sudden bitterness we all do roger examined his fingernails if i were mistress ena stratton he thought to himself id watch my step in the end the introduction was effected with complete ease oh ena said ronald stratton i dont think youve met roger sheringham yet have you mr sheringham my sister in law ena stratton looked at roger with large eyes swimming with discipleship weltschmerz humble pride and all the other things with which a high souled young womans eyes should swim when confronted with a successful author roger saw that these proper emotions were being registered for him almost automatically how do you do he said without any weltschmerz at all ena stratton was a young woman of about twenty seven she was moderately tall of good athletic looking figure with dark almost black hair which she wore cut in a straight fringe across her already rather low forehead her hands and feet were on the large side her face was neither exactly ugly nor exactly pretty it was a hagridden face roger thought with big grey eyes whose promise was counteracted by the wide thin lipped cruelty of her mouth when she smiled the corners of her mouth seemed in some curious way to be drawn downwards rather than up there were innumerable wrinkles at the corners of her eyes and two deeply graven lines running down from her nostrils her complexion was sallow judging by appearances roger thought not a nice person he wondered why david stratton had married her presumably she had looked nicer then that neurotic type stamps its own face very early shall we dance said roger id rather have a drink i havent had one for at least half an hour she spoke slowly and her voice was not unpleasant rather deep and with a particularly clear enunciation she managed to convey that for a woman of her sophistication not to have had a drink for at least half an hour was quite too ridiculous roger piloted her to the bar and asked what she would have a whiskey please and dont drown it roger gave her a stiff whiskey and soda and she tasted it i think ill have a little more whiskey in this please i like it almost neat you know ass of a woman thought roger why does she imagine its clever to like her whiskey neat and a good deal too much of it at that he handed her the amended drink thanks yes thats better i feel like getting drunk tonight do you said roger lamely yes i dont often feel like that but i do tonight really sometimes getting drunk seems the only thing worth while in life dont you ever feel like that only in private said roger rather prudishly he noticed that she was repeating a set of remarks which he had overheard earlier almost word for word evidently mrs stratton was extremely proud of her own appreciation of intemperance oh she expostulated theres no point in getting drunk in private in other words thought roger she admits to being an exhibitionist well that was probably exactly what she was an exhibitionist and rather a crude one at that aloud he said by the way i really must congratulate you on your dress mrs stratton its extremely good just like mrs pearceys in madame tussauds i recognized her at once how very brave of you to come as a charwoman hat and all against such competition competition oh you mean celia and mrs lefroy but you see im a character actress costume parts dont interest me at all anyone can do a costume part dont you think can they oh yes i think so of course one of my best parts actually was a costume one did you see sweet nell of old drury no it was a wonderful part but of course it was character not just being able to wear the dresses that i got it on i didnt know youd been on the stage oh yes mrs stratton sighed dramatically i was on the stage for a time before you were married of course no since but id studied for it before i didnt find said mrs stratton earnestly that marriage gave me the fulfilment i expected from it and the stage did for a time but even that didnt satisfy me altogether but i managed to find fulfilment in the end can you imagine what it was that brought it i expect you can mr sheringham i cant think oh and i did think youd understand the women in your books are always so very true why having a baby its the only possible way really to fulfil oneself mr sheringham said mrs stratton with much intensity then i look like remaining unfulfilled said roger ribaldly mrs stratton smiled tolerantly for a woman of course i meant a man can fulfil himself in so many ways of course cant he oh yes roger agreed he was wondering what people like mrs stratton really meant by that cant word if indeed they meant anything at all in any case he had felt as yet no urge to be fulfilled in any of the many ways your writing for instance mrs stratton added rather helpfully yes yes of course that fulfils me all right shall i put your glass down that would be rather wasting an opportunity wouldnt it said mrs stratton with ponderous kittenishness as roger poured out the drink he pondered on the determination with which mrs stratton had dragged into the conversation within three minutes what were evidently the two most important achievements of her life that she had been on the stage and that she had had a baby it was plain too that in ena strattons opinion these two events reflected the greatest possible credit on ena stratton what roger himself thought reflected credit on ena stratton was that in spite of the amount of whiskey she had apparently absorbed during the evening she showed no sign at all of approaching the only thing really worth while in life thank you she said as he gave her the replenished glass lets go up on the roof shall we i feel stifled here in this crowd i want to look at the stars would you mind frightfully i should love to look at the stars said roger carrying their glasses they went up the little staircase that led to the big flat roof in the middle of it the three straw figures still dangled from their heavy gallows mrs stratton gave them a tolerant smile ronald is really rather childish sometimes isnt he mr sheringham its a great thing to be able to be childish sometimes roger maintained oh yes i know i can be absurdly childish when the fit takes me of course the edge of the roof was bounded by a stout railing the two leaned their elbows on it and gazed down into the blackness that shrouded the back kitchens below mrs stratton had apparently forgotten that she wanted to gaze upwards at the stars the april night was mild and fine oh dear sighed mrs stratton im an awful fool i expect roger deliberated between a polite oh no a blunt why or a not very tactful but encouraging yes i feel so terribly introspective tonight pursued his companion before he could decide on any of these choices do you he said feebly yes do you often feel introspective mr sheringham not very often at least i try not to encourage it its terrible said mrs stratton with gloomy relish it must be there was a pause for contemplation of the terribleness of mrs strattons introspection one cant help asking oneself is there really any use in life a dreadful question said roger keeping his end up as well as he could ive had a baby i suppose i could say ive had some success on the stage ive got a husband and a home but is it worth while ah said roger sadly mrs stratton moved a little nearer to him so that their elbows touched sometimes i think she said sombrely that the best thing to do would be to put an end to it all roger did not reply that mrs stratton would apparently find a number of persons in hearty agreement with this sentiment he merely remarked in a suitably hushed voice oh come i do really if only one could find an easy way out ah said roger repeating himself you dont think it would be cowardly come come mrs stratton you mustnt talk like this you know of course you dont mean it but i do i assure you mr sheringham i lie awake for hours sometimes just wondering whether a gas oven isnt after all the easiest solution solution of what life exclaimed mrs stratton with drama well it certainly is a solution one cant deny that you dont mind me talking to you like this do you not in the least on the contrary i take it as a great compliment mrs stratton moved an inch nearer ive been so much looking forward to meeting you all the evening i thought those silly charades would never come to an end i knew i should be able to talk to you and ive been feeling so introspective tonight its such a relief to talk it out it must be said roger heartily do you believe in the soul asked mrs stratton now shes really off thought roger the soul he repeated in a meditative voice as if weighing its value as an object of belief i do for some people but i dont believe all of us have souls her voice throbbed on as the discourse proceeded roger began to perceive that the lady might be talking about souls but she was undoubtedly preoccupied with bodies she was pressing hard against him her hand was on his sleeve her whole attitude was one invitation to the waltz very odd thought roger and edged away mrs stratton immediately pursued him as a rule roger had no need to be pursued if a lady happened to attract him and herself was not averse he saw no reason for wasting useful time but mrs stratton did not attract him more she definitely repelled him roger could at that moment imagine no woman in this world with whom he less wanted to dally he therefore decided to end the interview he had no wish to hear more about mrs strattons soul its presence or absence or about her singular powers of self analysis or about her considered tendency towards self immolation nor on this last head had he any good news to take down to such as would have welcomed an impending self immolation it is a truism that those who talk about suicide shrink from committing it while those who do commit it never chatter about it in advance there was no chance of mrs stratton ever gratifying her relations in law with good news about a gas oven for the rest the lady bored him quite intolerably she had not proved nearly so interesting as he had hoped she was just a ridiculous mass of blind self conceit an ego maniac no doubt as dr chalmers had said any more time spent on her was time wasted for even as a type she was too exaggerated to be of the least use to a writer of fiction who had to preserve the probabilities roger waited until a sentence came to an end and then asked abruptly if that was not the music mrs stratton agreed perfunctorily that it might be the music we must be getting down said roger and led the way at the entrance to the ballroom he got rid of her and sought the bar he felt he needed a drink chatting together there he found williamson and colin nicolson who with a paper frill stuck into his dress waistcoat was calling himself william palmer roger knew nicolson tolerably well a hefty young scotsman who was a better rugger forward than an assistant editor and a better fisherman than either ah sheringham been taking the air hullo colin is that beer youre drinking can you find me a tankard certainly i can its grand stuff too heres all the best you know williamson dont you did you ever see anything more magnificent than his disguise its crippen to the life upon my word it is williamson bestowed on roger his slightly guilty ruminative grin you were a long time on the roof werent you sheringham it seemed a long time said roger frankly did she tell you she was feeling terribly introspective tonight she did did she say that marriage hadnt given her enough fulfilment or whatever it was she did did she tell you that she sometimes thought the best thing to do would be to put an end to it all if only one could find an easy way out she did did she talk like hell about her infernal soul like hell she did shes mad said mr williamson simply she is said roger whats all this asked nicolson bewildered whos been talking about her infernal soul i name no names said mr williamson solemnly but itll be your turn next but whats it all about man here ronald ask these two what the deuce theyre talking about will you ronald stratton was coming towards them his face decorated with a large grin here sheringham he said happily what have you been doing to my poor sister in law really im surprised at you what do you mean shes just told me that you lured her up on the roof and tried to flirt with her there quite drastically i gather it was all she could do to hold you off she confided to me that youre the most disgusting man shes ever met the devil she did said roger really annoyed ronald dance an apache dance with me oh ronald do dance an apache dance with me david ronald wont dance an apache dance with me wont he dear well never mind but i do mind i want to dance an apache dance ronald you are a pig everybody pretended not to notice ena stratton in the middle of the ballroom floor it was close on one oclock the local contingent with the exception of the two doctors and their wives had left nearly an hour ago the party was warming up well if you wont dance an apache dance with me ronald im going to climb up on the beam david give me a start across the ballroom ran a big oak beam about seven feet from the floor part of the structure of the heavily timbered roof it was ronalds custom when he felt so disposed to take a flying leap at it swing himself up and then taunt his male guests into trying to join him there this time his sister in law was bent on forestalling him arent you going to applaud the athletic introvert roger drily asked margot stratton no im not enas only making an exhibition of herself as usual dont take any notice of her mr sheringham mike armstrong said nothing there seems a conspiracy not to take any notice of her i cant think why ronald asked her i never would shes made an exhibition of herself at every single party here that i remember i suppose he wanted david and couldnt get him without her poor david hes very patient with her too patient thats the trouble philip chalmers says that what ena needs is to be married to a great big he man whod give her a sound thrashing every now and then thats the only way to keep her in order davids far too civilized for her mike armstrong said nothing i hardly need to ask whether you like her said roger with a smile out of the corner of his eye he could see the lady in question struggling ungracefully to get abreast of the beam everywhere in the room people were talking in little knots carefully not watching only her long suffering husband stood by to catch her if she fell margot stratton laughed i cant stand the sight of her luckily were not on speaking terms which saves a lot of trouble mike armstrong said nothing it must have been very awkward for you to refuse to have your own sister in law in the house she wasnt my sister in law she was ronalds no i dont think it was awkward and in any case she brought it on herself she did her best once to do me a very bad turn when i was perfectly friendly with her and it was the sort of thing one just couldnt forgive mike armstrong broke his silence what was it he asked gruffly oh far too bad to tell you mike margot said she spoke lightly but roger had an idea that she was telling the truth mike armstrong bent a frowning glance on the clambering creature who had dared to do his ladylove a bad turn with a final spasm the creature succeeded in getting right way up on the beam hullo everyone she called from the other end of the room ronald alone looked round very clever ena he said perfunctorily now see if you can get down again somebody put a record on the gramophone and people began to dance again as margot stratton and mike armstrong moved off roger strolled across the room to join colin nicolson who like himself did not find much pleasure in dancing well colin going to accept the ladys challenge and have a try at the beam nicolson made a scotch noise of disgust its a sad thing to see a woman making such a fool of herself well sheringham hows the criminology ah said roger and they plunged happily into a discussion of the murder case of the moment among his other accomplishments nicolson numbered a deep interest in criminology with a minute knowledge of every murder of importance during the last hundred years roger had often been able to obtain from him details of almost forgotten crimes which had been of considerable help to him in his work it was not long however before their attention was distracted by a repetition of mrs strattons importunities ronald i insist on your dancing an apache dance with me ive an urge for it do dance an apache dance with me ronald im not your husband ena ask david oh david couldnt do an apache dance to save his life come on ronald i shall probably run amok if you wont and you wouldnt like that roger and nicolson exchanged looks thats a very irritating woman said nicolson mildly whats the matter with her exhibitionism roger explained the ordinary dancing doesnt give her a chance to show herself off she must be the centre of the picture all the time you notice she wont perform with her husband why not too mild for her she knows he wouldnt throw her about enough and ronald might besides ronald doesnt want to and that in itself is enough for her ive no patience with that sort hullo ronalds going to take her on rogers prophecy was fulfilled it appeared that ronald knew quite well what was wanted of him and he proceeded to give it in full measure all right ena ill dance an apache dance with you he caught his sister in laws hand swung her round with all his strength and let go she shot across the wide floor ended up on her hands and knees and darted back for more for a full three minutes ronald threw her about in and out of the other dancers who refused to clear the floor for the pair to roger and nicolson looking on it seemed that ena stratton must have suffered considerably in the process but from the wailing outcry she raised when ronald refused to maltreat her any more it was clear that she had prodigiously enjoyed this singular amusement and she the mother of a fine wee son said nicolson disgustedly roger the only person in the room who had watched the performance with any real interest nodded gently its typical of course and significant too significant of what of everything that has happened to that young woman so far and of anything that might happen to her in the future well well said dr chalmers time we were going home i suppose you always want to go home as soon as im beginning to enjoy myself said his wife bitterly ive got to do a days work tomorrow my dear its nearly half past one not just yet mrs chalmers pleaded frank and jean arent going yet are you frank would you like to stay on a bit darling dr mitchell asked his wife yes rather im enjoying it sure youre not tired dr mitchell asked anxiously not a bit well we shall stay on for a bit lucy there you are philip frank and jean arent going yet and hes got to do a days work tomorrow we can stop for a bit too you know ronalds parties go on till about four sorry dear said dr chalmers with the utmost heartiness frank may be able to stand late hours i cant run and get your cloak on theres a good girl roger turned away marvelling he did not know much about marriage but he did know that such firmness in husbands is rare ena stratton ought to have married dr chalmers he might have been able to keep her in order ronald came running up the stairs phil youre wanted on the telephone hurray exclaimed mrs chalmers callously arresting her reluctant progress downstairs i hope its a call and i hope it keeps him out for hours loathsome woman laughed dr chalmers unperturbed and went downstairs as things turned out it was a call i shall be about an hour said dr chalmers good said mrs chalmers the party then resumed its course a little group was sitting at one end of the ballroom in amicable converse mrs lefroy ronald and david stratton roger and nicolson to them came ena stratton david im bored lets go home the david strattons lived in a small house not five hundred yards away from the gates of ronalds drive nonsense ena you dont want to go home yet said ronald youll spoil the party i cant help that im bored sit down my dear and dont be rude to your kind brother in law said david i wont sit down and he isnt kind he wouldnt do an apache dance with me till i made him come on david lets go but i dont want to go yet but i do well give me the key if you wont come i tell you im bored roger wondered if everyone else were feeling as uncomfortable as this exchange was making him he caught mrs lefroys eye and they smiled surreptitiously and ruefully david stratton could not recognize an opportunity when he saw one instead of handing the key over thankfully he attempted to persuade his wife to stay dont be an ass david said ronald give her the key if she really wants to go i do said ena all right then if you really want to here it is ena took the key and balanced it on the palm of her hand i dont think i will go after all lets do something amusing ena shouted ronald what good night but im not going yes you are you wanted to and you shall besides youre bored only because im tired of dancing i shouldnt be if only we could do something amusing well were not going to do anything amusing so off you go i cant stand the sight of bored guests about the place good night ena plumped herself down in a vacant chair laughing triumphantly now shes got our attention shes happy again roger confided to mrs lefroy ronald was happy too at the prospect of getting rid of ena good night ena he repeated no no im not going ive changed my mind its a womans privilege to change her mind you know i dont care about that you said you were going and you are ronald spat ostentatiously on his hands come on david you take her head and ill take her heels ronald doing the he man stuff said roger to mrs lefroy take warning theyre only joking not altogether ronalds pretending to joke but hes extremely annoyed and im not surprised whats the betting on him getting rid of her about a hundred to one against i should think said mrs lefroy not very hopefully with merry laughter the trio set about their tussle ronald caught his sister in law by the heels david took her shoulders on the surface it was just meaningless horseplay at any rate ena herself seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it as such while she pretended to struggle and resist the two men carried her kicking and shrieking with laughter across the floor then all of a sudden by the door ena precipitated a change she aimed a really vicious kick at ronald she struck up with her fists at her husbands face and she screamed out let me go you swine damn you let me go they let her go with a thud on the parquet floor ena scrambled to her feet rushed out of the room and banged the door behind her with a crash that shook the house well well well said roger to mrs lefroy david stratton stood looking uncertainly at the closed door oh let her be said ronald david shrugged his shoulders then he walked back to the group where he had been sitting sorry everyone he said briefly a flush on his usually rather pale face everyone began to be as nice to him as possible with the result that a perfectly unnatural atmosphere was created and it was all rather embarrassing roger made what was probably a popular movement when he rose to his feet with the remark that a drink he must and would have and carried david stratton off with him to the bar where he gave him a stiff whiskey and soda and talked firmly to him about the exploits of the mcc cricket team in australia the previous winter a topic which somewhat to his surprise he discovered stratton to be passionately interested in the meantime the party relieved of ena strattons blighting presence went on with renewed vigour dancing was resumed those who wanted to do so stood in little groups and discussed with the academic ferocity appropriate to two am such questions as interested them and everything in the ballroom was harmony at a quarter past two david stratton joined his brother and roger who happened to be together at the bar and announced that he thought he must be pushing off dont go yet david everyone will think they ought to go too if they see you slinking away i think id better if youre thinking of ena much better leave her alone for a bit longer shell take it out on you as usual if you get back before shes safely asleep still said david with a rueful smile i think id better if you dont mind all right if you really mean it anyhow good luck thanks ill probably need it good night sheringham when he had gone ronald sighed im afraid the poor lads in for a nasty quarter of an hour but he didnt do anything oh that doesnt matter hes always the scapegoat when that maniac of a woman doesnt think shes had enough admiration davids such a good chap and she leads him an absolute dogs life oh well thank heaven im a bachelor very temporarily though oh very said ronald with a laugh once a married man always a married man im afraid roger said compassionately both you and your brother are marrying types arent you yes i suppose so ronald agreed and swallowed a sip of his whiskey and soda poor david though a first marriage should never be binding roger who had heard something like this already during the evening knew what line to take one develops he said tactfully yes of course but apart from that one hasnt the knowledge of the other sex an experienced man might have seen through ena during the engagement and been able to save his soul david was far too green and now that he has seen through her no met the girl who would be exactly right for him yes its very tough luck theres no chance of a friendly divorce none ena would certainly never agree shes got her bird in its cage and it wouldnt be she whod ever open the door so david hasnt approached her on the topic at all shed only be more impossible than ever if she knew he was in love with someone else i dont know why im telling you all this sheringham you should drink beer instead of whiskey roger suggested perhaps thats it anyhow i apologize for inflicting all this family history on you it cant possibly interest you on the contrary all human relationships interest me especially tangles but i really am very sorry for your brother isnt it possible for anything to be done nothing short of murder said ronald gloomily and that said roger always does seem to me a little drastic well heres luck to you ronald at any rate thanks said ronald brightening yes my goodness sheringham ive struck it lucky agatha really is his conversation threatened to become maudlin ronald should have stuck to beer yes rather said roger hastily look here hadnt we better be getting back to the ballroom chapter iv someone is murdered dr philip chalmers ran his car into the garage yard which had once been the stable yard his radiator had nearly boiled on the way back and he wanted to fill it up now and not keep lucy waiting when they came down he had had to drive past but not across the big semicircle of gravel in front of the house to reach the yard and in the moonlight had seen three cars still standing there so evidently the party had not broken up yet without bothering to work it out dr chalmers knew that one of these cars must be the mitchells one the david strattons and the other the one which had brought margot stratton and mike armstrong from london whither they were returning that night the party therefore remained exactly as he had left it three quarters of an hour ago dr chalmers was a little sorry because that meant that it would be he who would break up the gathering lucy would be annoyed too because the visit had not taken as long as he had expected he had been only three quarters of an hour over it instead of the hour he had promised her but that could not be helped dr chalmers was tired and intended to get to bed as soon as he possibly could party or no party lucy or no lucy late hours did not suit him any longer dr chalmers mildly envied ronald who in spite of being three years older seemed to thrive on late hours while he was filling his radiator he heard one of the cars starting up and a moment later saw its tail light disappearing down the drive that was rather a relief he and lucy would not now be the first to leave as a minute later he passed the two remaining cars on his way to the front door dr chalmers had the curiosity to see which one it was that had gone he noticed that it was davids poor david dr chalmers sighed that damnable ena had spoiled the evening again dr chalmers wished for the thousandth time that he could somehow wangle a certificate and get her put into an asylum but that of course was impossible the latch was still up on the front door and dr chalmers walked in as he climbed the stairs he could hear the radio gramophone in the ballroom so they were still dancing turning the last angle of the staircase dr chalmers saw a back disappearing through the ballroom door which looked like ronalds he called out a greeting but the owner of the back evidently had not heard it for the door was closed the next instant behind him as his head came level with the floor of the barroom dr chalmers looked in there but the room was empty a last very small drink would be pleasant after his cold drive he took a step or two into the room and then remembered that he was still without his pipe which he had missed badly on the journey back he was dying for a smoke the drink could wait he had an idea that he had left his pipe in the sun parlour after he had been sitting up there with margot dr chalmers went up onto the roof any noise his footsteps might have made on the landing carpet was drowned in the music from the big gramophone but dr chalmers did not appreciate that the sun parlour was apparently empty for the lights were out dr chalmers switched them on and glanced round for his pipe he saw not the pipe but ena stratton lying in a basket chair and frowning at him why hullo ena he said in the pleasant hearty tones with which he was accustomed to greet everyone whether he happened to love or detest him or her as a matter of fact dr chalmers although mildly disliking one or two people detested only two ena stratton and an aunt of his wifes he was a tolerant man hullo phil said ena flatly dr chalmers gave his useless arm a twitch so as to lodge the hand in his dinner jacket pocket and smiled in a friendly way the more he disliked a person the more careful he was to smile at her in a friendly way i thought you and david had gone wasnt it davids car that drove away just now was it i daresay anything the matter asked dr chalmers smiling more amicably than ever oh david and ronald between them threw me out of the ballroom just after youd gone i dont know whether you call that anything said ena in a martyrs voice threw you out oh come ena that cant be quite accurate surely enas scanty bosom heaved thats right now you begin phil go on call me a liar my dear girl i have no intention of calling you a liar but i cant believe that youre not exaggerating a little when you say ronald and david threw you out of the ballroom then ask anyone else who was there they did they picked me up by the head and the heels and carried me across the room my god i tell you ive had about enough im not going to stand it much longer phil but if they did carry you across the room it must have been only in fun oh no it wasnt they may have pretended it was but it wasnt they wanted to get rid of me ronald especially hes been publicly insulting me all the evening even you must have noticed that i tell you phil im not going to stand that kind of treatment ronald neednt think hes going to get away with that kind of thing from me in front of all those grinning apes dr chalmers may have meant well but his tact was not always very tactful i expect weve all had a little too much to drink this evening said dr chalmers smiling pleasantly youll feel different about it in the morning ena if you mean im drunk ena said indignantly im not i only wish i were heaven knows ive tried hard enough this evening but it just seems as if my head were cast iron i simply cant get drunk so its no good saying that phil but why on earth did you want to get drunk because getting drunk explained mrs stratton with dignity is the only thing worth while in a life such as i have to lead getting drunk is the only thing thats real oh rubbish said dr chalmers far too robustly mrs stratton rolled her eyes you can say that of course you just dont happen to know me thats all not the real me dr chalmers dropped into a chair he knocked out the pipe he had retrieved and refilled it now look here ena arent you talking a little wildly im quite sure ronald hadnt the slightest wish to get rid of you nor david if they really did pick you up then it must have been just horseplay you mustnt take that sort of thing seriously you know dr chalmerss voice was quite treacly with soothing syrup ronald will find hes got to take me seriously said ena setting her mouth like a rat trap how do you mean i could make things very awkward for ronald very awkward and thats just what i intend to do but how i dont like that woman he thinks hes going to marry mrs lefroy oh dont you i think shes particularly charming yes no doubt it takes a woman to see through her type i call her a bad lot really ena you mustnt say that kind of thing you know ena began to breathe more quickly i shall say exactly what i like i shall say what i think mrs lefroy isnt the kind of woman whom i intend to have as a sister in law but why shes been extremely rude to me this evening oh come ena im sure she didnt mean to be oh yes she did do you think i dont know but what has she done nothing thats just the point she just nodded to me in the most offhand way when we arrived and hasnt spoken a word to me all the evening if she thinks she can treat me like that shes quite mistaken ena youre exaggerating again i tell you im not phil i know margot was bad enough but this womans worse but i can get my own back on them theyll soon see that what are you thinking of doing ena dr chalmers asked relighting his pipe its not what im thinking of doing its what im jolly well going to do im going to write to the kings proctor about the two of them oh nonsense ena you cant do a thing like that cant i theyll very soon see whether i can or not no its no good you saying anything phil ive been thinking about it up here and ive made up my mind its simply horrible the way they go on somebody ought to stop it in any case but my dear girl youve nothing to go on this is only guesswork youve no evidence ena uttered a hard little bray of a laugh oh yes i have im afraid theyll be surprised but i have and evidence that they wont be able to explain away either but how could you possibly have got it never mind that phil ive got it and im going to use it you can tell ronald so if you like i dont care if he thinks he can treat me like that in public hell find hes very much mistaken dr chalmers sighed the emollient did not seem to have acted youll feel quite different in the morning ena believe me you will then i dont believe you phil said mrs stratton shortly dr chalmers sighed again he did not believe himself either mrs strattons bosom began to heave once more and as for david yes asked dr chalmers disguising with difficulty his apprehension mrs stratton sat for a moment or two in silence while the heaving of her bosom grew more and more tumultuous then she almost threw herself round in her chair and burst out what do you know about david and that griffiths creature elsie griffiths why nothing what is there to know but you know all right which of the griffiths girls it is dont you cried ena with bitter triumph my dear ena i simply dont know what youre talking about oh yes you do phil so you neednt put on that damned smooth voice any longer everyones known about it i expect except me thats always the way isnt it the wife hears last of all ena began to laugh shrilly ena said dr chalmers most impressively if youre suggesting that theres anything at all between david and elsie griffiths i can assure you youre absolutely mistaken oh you can can you and how do you happen to know there isnt phil im quite certain there isnt then youre wrong because there is my god when i think of all ive done for david but if that little cat thinks shes going to get him oh really phil its terribly funny when one comes to think of it isnt it terribly funny ena youre getting hysterical dr chalmers said with professional sharpness i dont care why shouldnt i ive had enough to make me ive had a terrible evening phil you must have seen how rude ronalds been to me all the time and horrible men trying to make love to me she looked expectantly at dr chalmers oh said that gentleman warily yes my god phil why cant men leave a woman alone really youre the only decent one of the lot its simply disgusting whos been trying to make love to you ena oh everyone they always do i suppose there must be something about me good heavens i wish there wasnt that horrible mr williamson oh yes said dr chalmers with great heartiness what did he do he tried to make me sit on his knee in here it was frightfully awkward and mr sheringham was worse really phil i cant think how ronald could have invited him hes the most disgusting man ive ever met i simply had to fight him to get away you do have a tough time with the lads dont you ena said dr chalmers with all except you said mrs stratton seriously youve never tried to make love to me phil i wonder why you havent this time dr chalmers was a little more tactful david happens to be a friend of mine ena yes agreed mrs stratton mournfully youre terribly fond of david arent you phil hes always been my best friend said dr chalmers with hearty lack of emotion it must be wonderful to be a man and be able to have a real friend regretted mrs stratton yes i expect it is the conversation then paused apparently for contemplation by mrs stratton of her feminine handicap then she leaned a little towards her companion i dont think david would mind in the least you know phil not now mind what your making love to me said ena in a small but hopeful voice dr chalmers realized that he had already been labelled as suffering from a hopeless passion for his companion which only masculine loyalty withheld him from voicing he was in something of a difficulty ena was usually ready to pay attention to him he knew so far as she could respect anyone besides herself she respected him he had not yet given up all hope of persuading her to take no steps in the two matters in which her emotions were involved but to do so he must reduce her to softer mood that ronald had wanted to get rid of her and had let her see it quite plainly he was perfectly ready to believe ronald was not tactful enas amour propre that tender plant had been badly damaged he was being offered the chance of administering a little nourishment to it in the obvious and traditional way dr chalmers however was a cautious man he never acted on impulse before taking action he would weigh the fors and againsts not once but several times it is possible that had he been a little less deliberate he might have shut his eyes taken a deep breath and proceeded to administer the more practical rehabilitation for which he was being asked as it was consideration showed him that to embrace ena stratton would probably make him physically ill he therefore contented himself but not her with reaching out his sound hand patting her paternally on the shoulder and saying with bluff joviality nonsense ena of course david would mind besides you know you wouldnt like me to do anything of the sort would you it would spoil hm everything ena paused for a moment then she nodded solemnly yes phil youre quite right i shouldnt like it at all oh dear how i wish all men were like you you mustnt say that said dr chalmers much encouraged i dont expect theyre so bad really you know anyhow ena i want you to do me a favour will you what phil dr chalmers laid his pipe on the table beside him and spoke with deliberation i want you to give up this idea of writing to the kings proctor about ronald and i want you to put quite out of your head this idea about david and elsie griffiths and not say a word to him about it youll only upset him very much you know without any cause at all ena shook her head no im sorry phil i cant do that i feel its really my duty to write to the kings proctor after all what are laws for unless we all help to enforce them well well we can talk about that again tomorrow theres no hurry and you mustnt do anything without thinking it over very carefully first and as for david enas thin lips set in an ugly line as for david she said sharply you must leave that to me no im sorry phil it was decent of you to try to shield him but i must have that out with him myself not tonight at any rate dr chalmers pleaded yes tonight theres no point in losing time i only heard about it this evening dr chalmers wondered savagely which of the local busybodies had laid up this trouble for david but listen ena you its stifling in here ena said abruptly i want some air she jumped up and almost ran up onto the roof dr chalmers followed gloomily he had thought she was landed and she had wriggled away once more he knew it was no good appealing to her again for months now possibly for years she would be throwing elsie griffiths up at david till she had succeeded in driving him almost as insane as herself oh curse the woman muttered dr chalmers who never swore he followed her to where she was leaning over the railing youll catch cold ena he said mechanically i dont care if i do i wish i could catch pneumonia and die could i catch pneumonia if i stayed up here long enough phil david would be glad he could have elsie all right then dont talk such nonsense ena it isnt nonsense you know it isnt david would be glad oh phil arent men brutes ive given david everything everything a woman can and now hes got it all he doesnt want it any longer oh whats the good of going on living phil now ena you know you dont mean that yes i do i often think how wonderful it would be to end it all if only one could find an easy way out nobodys really fond of me no phil not even you really im sick of life ive a good mind to jump over this railing here and now shall i she looked round at dr chalmers wildly that wouldnt be a very easy way out said dr chalmers with bluff common sense oh i wouldnt mind a little pain it would be worth it its terribly appropriate isnt it said mrs stratton with a hollow laugh to be standing under a gallows while we talk about life and death a gallows from which i perceive one of the felons has fallen if you can draw a moral from that said dr chalmers and aimed a vicious kick at the felons severed head it soared up in the air and out of sight somewhat relieved dr chalmers dealt in a similar manner with the trunk yes there ought to be a moral in that oughtnt there said mrs stratton with mournful relish do you think its an invitation phil an invitation from fate for me to take its place i shouldnt think so returned dr chalmers well are you ready to go downstairs ena its a bit too cold out here besides david will be wondering whats happened to you let him wonder he doesnt care phil dont you really think its an invitation from fate i think thats such a nice idea look it would be so easy mrs stratton pulled a chair up underneath the swinging rope mounted on it and put the stiff loose round her neck where do they have the knot phil lets get the details right at any rate i know they have a special place for the knot under the left ear i believe said dr chalmers bored with this play acting and kicked moodily at one of the uprights of the gallows mrs stratton adjusted the knot under her left ear and tightened the noose a little round her throat look phil it would be terribly easy wouldnt it ive only got to jump off the seat of this chair shall i nobody would mind david and ronald wouldnt i dont believe even youd mind much shall i dr chalmers leant with his sound hand on the back of the chair come on ena im cold no but shall i jump off this chair phil shall i tell me i will if you say so shall i yes said dr chalmers suddenly and walked away with the chair for the only time in his life dr chalmers had acted on impulse dr chalmers did not hear the faint thud and the gurgle behind him he did not even look round and so was able to pretend to himself in some curious way that nothing had happened without pausing he dumped the chair down on the roof somewhere near the door where it promptly fell over and with his hands in his pockets continued on his way whistling under his breath a little out of tune he could hardly believe that technically he had committed a murder yet presumably he had inside the door to the house he remembered that he must take precautions he was perfectly safe of course so long as no one saw him coming in from the roof suicide would be taken for granted and there was nothing to disprove it everyone knew that one of enas favourite topics of conversation was suicide still whistling softly under his breath dr chalmers closed the door very quietly behind him and stood stock still listening there was no sound of voices he ventured a peep round the concealing angle of the ceiling into the barroom it was empty the sound of music still came from the ballroom on quiet feet dr chalmers ran down two flights of stairs there he turned and whistling loudly now mounted once more slowly and trampingly he glanced at the watch on his wrist to his surprise it was only a quarter of an hour since he had come in all that had happened in fifteen minutes and that made exactly lucys hour dr chalmerss luck held just as he arrived at the top landing the door of the ballroom opened and margot stratton came out passing him on the landing on her way upstairs hullo phil she called out im looking for mike have you seen him anywhere no said dr chalmers ive only just got back chapter v search party it was a minute or so before half past two when dr chalmers presented himself again in the ballroom oh hang observed mrs chalmers with even less tact than she knew im going to finish this dance anyhow she called across the room dr chalmers nodded pleasantly as he shut the ballroom door behind him roger alone at the moment strolled across the room and joined him have a drink chalmers you look as if you could do with one i could admitted dr chalmers with a smile it was quite cold driving but i think ill wait till my wifes gone to put her things on otherwise well never get off you know what women are they waited till the dance was over now lucy said dr chalmers with good humoured firmness oh no phil pleaded mrs chalmers now come along my dear said dr chalmers but margot isnt here i must say good night to her off with you woman margot will be back by the time youve got your things on mrs chalmers who had known it was hopeless all the time consented to go now sheringham what about that drink said dr chalmers they strolled into the other room to the bar dr and mrs mitchell decided that it was high time for them to go too and husband and wife divided in the same directions as the chalmers the other dancers realizing that the party was breaking up drifted automatically towards the bar oh there you are mike said margot stratton i was looking for you wed better go too i suppose had a good party margot asked her late husband a marvellous party ronald thank you its been a grand party colin nicolson chimed in have another drink before you go margot well it is getting cold out now margot agreed mike armstrong said nothing wonderful our margot isnt she dr chalmers appealed to roger getting on for three in the morning and not a hair out of place i believe if margot was in a liner that sunk shed be found sitting on a lifebelt perfectly powdered and waved and looking as if shed stepped straight out of a bandbox thank you phil said margot affably ha ha said mike armstrong suddenly and blushed what was that you said just now colin asked mr williamson thoughtfully another drink eh was that it well thats not a bad idea eh that isnt a bad idea at all is it its a magnificent idea osbert it is affirmed mr williamson much struck it is a munificent idea colin mines whiskey oh osbert said mrs williamson tentatively do you really think youd better i said mines a whiskey repeated mr williamson firmly yes and make it a double one thanks colin well cheerio margot cheerio osbert osbert you are awful said mr williamsons wife and removed herself somewhat huffily the women took their usual time to get their things on delayed in this case longer than usual by the arrival of margot stratton in the bedroom just as they were ready to leave at last however they presented themselves cloaked and befurred and the chorus of farewells arose well good night ronald its been a lovely party good night mr sheringham good night ill ring you up tomorrow perhaps you and ronald would dine with us one night mrs lefroy say good night to mrs williamson for me dont forget that book you promised me mr nicolson well goodnight sheringham good night its been a marvellous party ronald darling well good night at last and at last only the house party remained we are seven said ronald looking round the circle of faces or should be i think do we go to bed or not i think not then help yourselves to more drinks everyone and be merry seven has always struck me as absolutely the ideal number for a party the party complied i dont want to dance any more announced mr williamson suddenly and weightily no agreed mrs lefroy lets turn out the lights and sit round the fire while mr sheringham tells us about his murders oh yes roger said celia with enthusiasm thats a good idea ronald backed them up in the strictest confidence roger of course i really ought not said roger happily oh do mr sheringham begged mrs lefroy come along roger be a man added colin nicolson it wont go any further oh very well said roger mr williamson went to the landing and roared like a bull lilian hullo came a faint and distant voice youre wanted what for murder howled mr williamson and left it at that certainly it brought him his lilian hotfoot but then he had all the bother of explaining in the meantime chairs were being pulled into a semicircle round the fire which still glowed on the big open jacobean hearth and the party settled down to enjoy itself sheringham said mr williamson in a confidential tone hullo before you begin will you promise me one thing what that if i murder lilian you wont give me away you wont will you eh that said roger depends entirely on the amount of provocation youve had oh ive had plenty you see said mr williamson still more confidentially i cant bear her wearing my trousers and having delivered himself of this complaint mr williamson leaned back in his chair and instantly went to sleep carry on sheringham ronald stratton ordered comfortably roger was clearing his throat while he wondered on which case to begin when a voice from the doorway checked him it was david stratton changed and in a lounge suit sorry to interrupt he said but can i speak to you a minute ronald ronald was only out of the room for a couple of minutes before he returned with his brother david says ena doesnt seem to have gone home he thinks she may still be here were just going to have a look round magnificent said nicolson jumping up well help you oh it doesnt matter david demurred dont you bother ronald and i can manage not a bit of it of course well give you a hand come along osbert you lazy devil eh what whats up hide and seek said nicolson youre seeking get up and do it under his rousing energy the whole party was stirred into action roger noticed that after a first few moments of uncertainty everyone seemed to be taking the search as a huge joke even davids deprecatory air did not check the growing hilarity no doubt it was the best way to treat the situation and really for davids own sake the most tactful it was no good going about with long faces silently sympathizing with the unfortunate stratton in his possession of an almost insane wife ena was after all a joke if rather a bad one come out in the open and laugh with david instead of weeping with him in twos and threes the search party worked through the various rooms ronald strattons house was jacobean and spacious it had belonged to the stratton family for nearly three hundred years almost ever since its erection as the dower house of a mansion nearly six miles away ronald had inherited it but not the land and the farms which had once belonged to it or the money to keep it up properly he had made the latter and bought back the former since it had come into his hands ronald had spent a great deal on it in a thoroughly dilapidated condition it had been actually in danger of collapsing altogether ronald had reroofed it re planned it and almost rebuilt it the top of the three stories where the party had been held had been completely reorganized by him originally this had consisted of almost a dozen small bedrooms ronald had ruthlessly knocked more than half of these into one huge room running from front to back of the house and one other almost as big the former with a parquet floor added had become the ballroom the other with one of its walls knocked completely out to open onto the lovely well staircase was anything from a studio to a music room tonight it had done duty as a bar parlour the rest of the top floor served by another staircase constituted the servants quarters ronald had been as ruthless with the roof as with the top story he had kept only the main gables in the front of the house the rest he had levelled and put in a concrete roof with an asphalt surface which was just large enough for a badminton court the game was a little windy at such a height but ronald played it with zest this evening the net and posts had been stowed away and the rather gruesome triple gallows erected in their place over a subsidiary roof a few feet lower than the main roof and reached from it by a short flight of steps had been erected a fair sized hothouse where stratton amused himself with growing certain exotic plants or it might be more accurate to say trying to grow them it was called the sun parlour and furnished with wicker chairs and tables and was usually in considerable use at dances as for the rest of the house the main bedrooms and bathrooms occupied the first floor while the library and a small morning room opened off one side of the big hall on the ground floor the drawing room off the other the kitchens were stowed away somewhere at the back with access to the hall and through a service door to the dining room to search such a house thoroughly was no small task at first the party confined itself to the top floor and the roof in spite of the extreme unlikelihood of the lady being stowed away in either roger himself felt a little perfunctory in his seeking he had no expectation that mrs stratton really was still on the premises most probably she had gone off to wake up some unfortunate friend and explain with sobs and heroic gestures and complete untruth that her husband had practically barred her own door against her nevertheless slightly annoyed as he was at having been cut short so abruptly in his story telling his sense of the picturesque appreciated the appropriateness of its setting for such a search the heavy oak beams which formed the fireplace opening and studded the unevenly plastered walls gleamed with age and generations of elbow grease as they threw back the red glow of the log fire and the carefully placed electric lights left the quaint angles of the ceiling which ronald had thrown up from its original seven feet to a dozen or more to show off the roof timbers dim and mysterious on the outside walls long casement windows with the original tiny diamond panes of greenish much scratched glass heavily leaded looked out over the blackness which covered that part of the grounds lying between the house and the main road a hundred yards away roger opened one and leaned out everything was still and remote and obscure it was odd to remember that london was within eighteen miles now then roger shes not out there you know why man this ought to be a job after your own heart roger drew back guiltily and looked round well you see colin i dont believe shes here at all what does that matter demanded nicolson robustly a game of hide and seeks a game of hide and seek wherever the persons hiding off with you and search like a man has anyone tried the sun parlour roger asked languidly i expect so but no one of your skill who knows she may have dug into the big bed and be disguised as a sweet pea by now more probably a cactus said roger sourly and went up to look electric light was laid on to the sun parlour but the place was in darkness when roger reached it he was about to turn on the switch when a slight movement on the farther side of the room made him jump violently there is nothing more disconcerting than a human movement in the darkness when one has been quite sure there is nothing human there the next instant he smiled ive got her he said to himself he could see now the figure whose movement had startled him it was leaning out of an opened window just as he had been leaning out of the room below two minutes ago and evidently it had not heard his approach it was small and slight and quite obviously feminine ive a jolly good mind to smack her hard as she stands thought roger vindictively she deserves a fright it was roger however who got the fright for the figure shifted its position slightly and roger saw that it was not a woman at all the faint moonlight gave just enough illumination to throw up the whitewashed wall underneath the windows and roger could now see white wall between the figures legs moreover those legs were clothed in unmistakable trousers roger stared at it with something like alarm no man in the party was nearly so small or so slight as that who on earth could it be he solved the problem by switching on the light and the rather witchlike face of mrs williamson shot round over her shoulder with a little exclamation oh how you frightened me not before youd already frightened me i thought you must be an elf or a hobgoblin or something brooding out of that window mrs williamson laughed the night was so perfect i simply had to get away from everyone and drink a little of it in funny thought roger she can say that sort of thing and one accepts it because shes natural whereas exactly the same words from ena stratton would sound just nauseating im sorry i disturbed you he said i was sent by colin to search this place shes not here i looked round before i turned the light out all i could find here was someones pipe she nodded towards one of the wicker tables on which lay a brier pipe roger picked it up i expect someones missing this id better take it to ronald they havent found her yet then no i suppose i must go and help look shall i turn out the light again and leave you and the night together no i feel better now do people ever make you feel like that that you simply must get away from everybody to get the bad taste out of your mouth i can quite believe that ena stratton would leave a bad taste in anyones mouth said roger as he stood aside for mrs williamson to precede him up the steps in the house the search had now spread to the lower floors roger could hear colin nicolson in one of the bedrooms protesting his fears to his hostess its no good celia i wont be able to get a wink of sleep tonight and thats the truth each time i shut an eye ill imagine the pestilential woman ready to pop out at me from every nook and cranny he pulled open the bottom drawer of a chest of drawers and peered hopefully inside well i dont suppose shes in there said celia somewhat literally who knows what she may not have squeezed herself into colin lifted the lid of a powder box which happened to be that of mrs lefroy on the dressing table and then opened the door of an extremely small cupboard in the wall into which one could with difficulty have squeezed a top hat hey i see you come oot now will you come away oot ach who knows where she is curse the woman said celia with feeling i want to go to bed im simply dropping its a bit thick it is really besides rogers sure she isnt here cant we call it off and all get to our beds david really is rather worried celia said doubtfully why is he worried he ought to be glad to be rid of her for a bit he doesnt know what she might do you see and isnt that just playing her own game why do you think shes hiding like this at all and giving us all this bother looking for her just to make herself important of course she just wants us to be bothered about her and here we are playing her game its sickening thats what it is colin colin whats this said roger walking into the room you who were hounding us all on to be fainting by the roadside like this ah a jokes a joke but this is too much heres poor celia dropping with fatigue and all of us wanting our beds no its too much besides were just playing the womans own game yes thats her idea of course youre perfectly right she must be the centre of the picture even when she isnt in it i agree wed much better go to bed well then wheres wee ronald wee ronalds downstairs i think with wee david having a look round there said celia very well lets go down and tell him weve struck come along and back me up roger but dont be too hard on david said celia as the two men went out of the room it isnt the poor lads fault and its a rotten position for him its certainly a rotten position for david roger agreed to colin outside having to admit tacitly to a lot of strangers that hes got an imbecile for a wife very rotten ach why doesnt he give the woman a sound thrashing thats what she needs a jolly good hiding id like to have the administering of it wistfully said roger who also would have liked to get to bed ronald and david were discovered in the hall outside the morning room they looked at the two inquiringly no luck said roger honestly ronald i dont think shes here better call the search off dont you think yes i think so im sure weve looked everywhere now david all right david nodded can i use your telephone before i go whom on earth do you want to telephone to at this time of night the police oh come stratton roger said with a slight smile thats hardly necessary is it you dont know my wife sheringham david stratton said ruefully in these moods of hers she simply isnt responsible i wouldnt put anything past her you mean she might walk into the pond at westerford and pretend to drown herself said ronald for all one knows she might actually drown herself then for heavens sake man said ronald fervently let her dont raise one little finger to stop her from such a blessed action i wont david stratton said candidly but ive got to cover myself how by warning the police that theres a woman loose who isnt responsible for her actions dont you agree that i should sheringham yes said roger i dont for one moment think that shes in the least likely to do any such thing but it certainly wont do any harm to warn the police and if you tell your wife later that you felt you had to do so and why it may give her the fright which if youll allow me to say so she very badly needs yes said david briefly id thought of that all right ronald nodded well you know where the telephone is david david disappeared in the direction of the morning room and the others loitered in the hall waiting for him well give the poor lad a stiff nightcap before he goes off into the jaws of his doom ronald remarked yes its ten to one that hell find her there when he gets home this time and i hope he deals with her faithfully oh by the way mrs williamson found this pipe on the table in the sun parlour someone left it there i suppose youd better take charge of it ronald ronald glanced at it before he dropped it into his pocket oh yes i know whose this is its phil chalmers just a final nightcap everyone said ronald as he went towards the bar no dissentients i hope there appeared to be no dissentients do you really think youd better osbert doubtfully suggested mrs williamson williamson gazed at her with owlish disapproval are you trying to drive me to drink lilian dont you know thats absolutely the surest way of making a man drink when he doesnt want to practically hinting that isnt it sheringham absolutely said roger then give me a double said mr williamson mr williamson lurched slightly as he trod on a last step that wasnt there before emerging on the roof the others were still finishing their nightcaps but a sudden craving for fresh air had invaded mr williamson fresh air and plenty of it and space for a man to sway in was what mr williamson wanted he stood just outside the doorway that gave egress to the roof his back propped against the lintel and contemplated with some disapproval the gallows in the middle the lantern which had crowned it had gone out long since but the gallows itself and its three grisly occupants stood out clearly against the moonlit sky dam silly idea commented mr williamson sternly dam silly some people wouldnt like it at all some people would dislike it very much morbid thass word morbid and damsilly he set out towards the railing on the other side of the roof the same railing over which roger and ena stratton had leaned earlier in the evening it was a railing which seemed to invite leaning to lean over it now seemed to mr williamson the height of admirable ideas leaning is so much less trouble than standing it was not really necessary for mr williamson to walk right through the gallows in order to reach the railing he could quite easily have gone round it but mr williamson was full of ideas just at present and to walk right under the middle of the triple gallows seemed a positively brilliant idea by that gesture he would be able to express all sorts of things what sort of things did not matter mr williamson would be able to express them he steered carefully round a chair that was lying in his path to self expressionism in the same way it seemed to mr williamson an equally clever idea to halt right in the middle of the gallows and hiccough his contempt of them so halt he did not without a bit of a lurch recovering himself from the lurch mr williamson happened to knock quite gently into one of the dangling figures the figure swinging back promptly dealt him a shrewd buffet in the side hey said mr williamson resentfully mr williamson was not drunk or if he had been drunk he very quickly became almost sober it was less than half a minute before he realized that it was a very shrewd buffet indeed to have been delivered by a straw figure he stared up at the figure in question even then mr williamson did not lose his head he turned round and walked with some care and extreme dignity down into the barroom there he grasped roger sheringham by the elbow and drew him firmly aside i say sheringham just come with me a minute will you eh just come with me a minute where to roger asked good humouredly just with me just in here eh just come with me with great deliberation mr williamson led him into the exact middle of the ballroom floor i say sheringham well ive found her said mr williamson chapter vi odour of a rat ena stratton was quite dead there was no doubt about that with a hurried injunction to williamson not to alarm the company for the moment roger had called ronald stratton out as normally as he could and rushed up to the roof with him breaking the news as he went there ronald had held the dangling body up to take its weight off the rope round its neck while roger had quickly felt its hands they were icy cold im afraid shes dead he said but we must make quite sure run and get a sharp knife ronald and well cut her down and bring colin back with you he knows something about first aid ill hold her up ronald went and returned with the knife and colin nicolson and williamson too for safety between them they cut the cord which was too thick and stiff to have buried itself in the dead womans neck and laid her flat on the roof a little way from the gallows nicolson at once set about trying artificial respiration mr williamson took one horrified look at the distorted face and then retired to the railing and was sick mrs stratton was not a soothing sight for a queasy stomach after five minutes strenuous work nicolson sat back on his heels im afraid its no good shes gone roger nodded i was sure but we had to try no ones telephoned for the police ronald youd better do that at once yes ronald said soberly and your brother hasnt gone yet tell him and hadnt we better get her into the house ronald asked doubtfully i know one isnt supposed to disturb things but we had to cut her down so it cant matter i dont think we ought to leave her out here just in case you know well said roger it cant matter moving her in such an obvious case of suicide man urged nicolson ronalds right no roger acquiesced it cant matter well will you go along colin and get the women somehow into the ballroom theyd better not see her then well get her down as soon as ronalds telephoned well get her down before i telephone said ronald ill go and fetch david he made for the door into the house roger raised his eyebrows slightly at colin by rights the police ought to be told the very first thing ach what does that matter ronalds right lets get the poor body comfortable first its too cold out here altogether well i dont suppose it matters in this case and ronald will have to break the news to the women ill go down and get them out of the way said colin left alone roger walked over to comfort mr williamson shes quite gone asked that gentleman now somewhat restored and impeccably sober im afraid so but were going to get her downstairs into the warmth just in case theres any hope ah said mr williamson profoundly roger looked at him what i was just wondering how many people would thank you if you did bring her to life again thats all after the first shock said roger probably not very many no thats what i was thinking eh well its no good pretending is it eh dont you agree i think roger said gently that those same people will have to put up a decent pretence to the police however thankful they may feel privately eh oh yes of course yes they will wont they well i said mr williamson nobly wont drop any hints any hints about what roger asked a little sharply why that they arent as sorry as they make out if you like that theyre jolly thankful she strung herself up suicide during temporary insanity eh well i remember asking ronald if she were mad hours ago i thought she was then you agree eh she was mad wasnt she eh perfectly mad roger agreed the police will have to be told that of course it will help them will it oh i see what you mean yes it will wont it yes the arrival of ronald stratton and his brother put an end to this somewhat laboured conversation in the moonlight davids face showed no change of colour and it was almost without expression that he stood for a few moments staring down at the body of his wife it was impossible to say what emotion he was feeling or even whether he was feeling any at all finally ronald touched him gently on the arm all right david dont look at her any more roger and i will take her downstairs as if he had become an automaton david stood obediently aside nor did he attempt to help in any way as his brother and roger between them picked the body up and carried it past the closed door of the ballroom down to the floor below leaving mr williamson to look after the roof alone have to put her in my room ronald muttered there isnt an empty one they laid her on the bed and ronald with a shudder he could not suppress spread a little towel across her face from the doorway david watched them lifelessly ronald turned to roger look here once i telephone the police things are taken out of our hands theyll be here in less than a quarter of an hour i should think are we quite sure theres nothing we want to do first roger hid a slight start what kind of thing well ronald hesitated i mean about the party its bound to look rather bad isnt it well known murderers and victims and heres one of the party hangs herself theyre bound to raise the question of suggestion the coroner could make himself quite unpleasant about it i dont see how you can very well hide it up the women are all in fancy dress and so are you we could change much too risky said roger decidedly it would only look as if you were trying to keep something back ronald glanced down at his own velvet suit well im going to change anyhow whatever it looks like i dont feel like facing the police like this davids changed too you see and you and williamson are in your dinner jackets colins only got to take his paper frill out as for the women why not just say they were in fancy dress and leave it at that i suppose you could if you really think its important i do rather otherwise the newspapers will probably get hold of us and heaven knows what yes thats true enough and mrs stratton herself ena well she was in fancy dress too wasnt she as a charwoman yes and thats an important point its just because she was in that nondescript shapeless black dress that no one found her earlier if shed been in an ordinary evening frock mrs williamson and i and anyone else who went on the roof could hardly have failed to notice her so theres point in the fancy dress situation yes i see that well ill go up and tell the women and warn them that were not saying anything about murderers and victims they can easily find historical characters to fit their costumes if necessary and dont forget the doctors i dont think it matters much about the people who left early but both chalmers and mitchell were on the premises after mrs stratton left the ballroom so the police are bound to interview them in fact the best thing you can do is to ring one or both of them up at once and ask them to come round here even before you ring up the police a doctor ought to examine her immediately you see and really youd better hurry ronald yes i will but do you know its only eight minutes since you called me up on the roof said ronald glancing at his wrist watch so we cant be said to have lost any time in the meantime take david upstairs and give him a stiff drink will you he added in an undertone roger nodded david stratton could hardly have had much affection left for his wife and when the sudden shock of her death was over he could hardly have any regrets but at the moment he seemed quite dazed coming upstairs stratton roger said to him david did not answer ronald passing him in the doorway gave his arm a brotherly squeeze buck up david old lad come upstairs and let me get you a drink roger repeated david looked at him yes i could do with a drink he said in a perfectly normal voice he followed roger upstairs like a child and so said roger thoughtfully she really did do it after all why after all asked mrs lefroy they were standing alone in the barroom in front of the fire after breaking the news to the women ronald had telephoned to the two doctors and the police and was now downstairs changing his clothes celia stratton had taken charge of her younger brother whom even the stiff drink administered by roger did not seem to have shaken quite out of his trance of amazement or incredulity or concealed relief or whatever it was that had temporarily numbed him colin nicolson and the williamsons were in the ballroom debating whether lilian williamson should change out of her husbands trousers or whether this action would look suspicious to the local police force why after all roger repeated because she was telling me herself earlier in the evening how much she would have liked to commit suicide if only she could find an easy way out i believe she said as much to osbert too nodded mrs lefroy she did he told me so there was a little pause that said mrs lefroy as if speaking rather carefully will be a useful piece of information for the police yes and yet roger meditated with a vivid remembrance of that distorted face i shouldnt have said that hanging was a very easy way out would you i suppose it depends said mrs lefroy vaguely her hands smoothed over the white satin on her waist in a series of nervous little jerks roger noticed that she had very pretty hands white and small as a matter of fact he pursued i never thought for a single moment that she meant a word of what she was saying of course i didnt i imagined she was just talking for silly effect as usual well that seems to dispose of the good old cliche doesnt it what good old cliche that people who talk about committing suicide never do it and yet roger ruminated i could have sworn that it applied in her case more forcibly than it could in any other the more i think of it the more certain id have been that she was just talking poppycock i suppose it couldnt possibly have been an accident is this the celebrated detectives brain working for our benefit asked mrs lefroy with a laugh that sounded a little forced hardly roger smiled but if youd like to hear the celebrated novelists opinion it is that such a situation simply couldnt be entrusted to fiction one has to go to real life for such boldness what do you mean the coincidence of it all here is a woman whose existence is a source of annoyance and perhaps a good deal more than annoyance to several different people and that for several different reasons and just at the moment when those people are resenting it perhaps more intensely than ever before she very obligingly and most unexpectedly kills herself you must admit that the coincidence is far too violent to be stomached in fiction is it mrs lefroy asked reluctantly i dont think really its as strong as all that dont you well it is just a coincidence of course and nothing else oh of course said roger they looked into the fire for a few moments mrs lefroy leaned her bare arm on the beam that formed the rough mantelpiece and fidgeted with the toe of her white satin slipper among the dead ashes on the edge of the fire i wish the police would hurry up and come she burst out suddenly i thought you said just now you were dreading them did i how foolish of me of course im not said mrs lefroy with an unnatural little laugh roger said nothing apparently mrs lefroy read into his silence a mild expostulation for she added yes youre quite right i am dreading them it was ridiculous to pretend that im not why are you dreading them mrs lefroy looked at him bravely because there isnt a single person connected with this family who wont be absolutely delighted to hear that enas dead its no good beating about the bush there wont be and im so afraid that the police may guess it is there any particular reason why they shouldnt guess it i mean as you say mrs stratton wasnt a very pleasant person and not to beat about the bush myself i should say that shes a lot more use to the community dead than alive but does it matter that the police should know that too well its not very nice is it mrs lefroy hedged sudden death never is very nice roger said solemnly mrs lefroy moved impatiently oh dont talk platitudes werent you rather talking platitudes yourself mrs lefroy well you know perfectly well whats in my mind its in your own too if you want me to put it into plain words im terribly afraid that if the police do guess that they may suspect something absolutely preposterous yes roger agreed with a little sigh youre right that was in my own mind too dr chalmers arrived before the police he came up the stairs alone roger looked round from where he was standing by the fireplace and saw him ascending the last short flight of the well staircase ah chalmers youve been very quick i hadnt got to bed this is a terrible business sheringham yes have you seen ronald no i came straight in the front doors still unlocked where is he in his bathroom i think changing and mrs stratton on ronalds bed shall i tell him youve come oh its all right thanks ill find him myself dr chalmers turned and went down the stairs again did you notice roger said conversationally to mrs lefroy did you notice how his manner had changed meeting him before one couldnt possibly have told that he was a doctor except for the very faint smell of ether that always hangs about a doctor but just then he couldnt have been anything else even his voice was a bedside voice yes said mrs lefroy colin nicolson appeared in the ballroom door was that the police he asked no chalmers lilians decided to change at last cut along lilian it wasnt the police agatha you havent forgotten who you are now have you mrs lefroy looked at him vacantly for a moment before her face resumed its normal expression oh yes of course henrietta of france wasnt it i dont think it matters much in any case lilian williamson hurried off to change and her husband followed her out of the ballroom to join the group in the other room nicolson began to forecast the questions which the police would probably ask roger stood for a moment uncertainly among them then he edged towards the stairs a sudden wish had come to him to have another and closer look at the roof before the police arrived and yet there seemed very little to be seen on the roof literally very little the heavy beams of the gallows a chair or two here and there for those willing to brave the temperature of an april night and a little arbour of trelliswork set in wooden troughs of earth with the bare stems of virginia creeper and polygonum baldschuanicum writhing in and out of it there was nothing else at all yet roger felt that there ought to be something else he did not know what but he was not satisfied it was too neat too tidy altogether too convenient that ena stratton should have committed suicide just at this juncture when so many people desired it did mrs lefroy suspect that perhaps her future sister in law had not committed suicide mrs lefroy was a shrewd woman as well as an intelligent one she was worried about something was it only what she had voiced or had she a deeper untellable fear yet of course ena stratton must have committed suicide there was absolutely no evidence of anything else not the smallest sign of it and roger very sincerely hoped that she had committed suicide he would have been extremely sorry to see a decent person hang for such a worthless excrescence on humanitys surface and yet he stood in the middle of the gallows triangle peering up at the crossbeams they were high there were three good feet of cord showing above the heads of the two life size figures that remained and the toes of their shoes were at least eighteen inches off the ground those crossbeams were ten feet high and more but that did not appear to have the least significance roger fetched a chair which was standing somewhere between the gallows and the door into the house set it beside one of the dangling figures and mounted upon it his body stood almost level with that of the figure neck and neck practically on the same plane standing there he could have unfastened the noose from the figures neck and draped it around his own it would have sagged a little on his shoulders but not much when the noose was enlarged unquestionably ena stratton could have stood there and done the same he jumped down onto the roof again the chair spurned by his retreating foot tumbled over with a crash and roger cursed his nerves were upset and that added to his sense of frustration yet he did not know why he should be feeling frustrated at all if there was nothing there to discover he could discover nothing and he wanted nothing there to be discovered why then feel frustrated if nothing presented itself for discovery he walked down into the sun parlour switched on the light and looked moodily round found nothing and walked back to the roof again a thought pulled him up with a jerk where after all was the third straw dummy it took him twenty five seconds to find it in the shadow of the little arbour it lay there huddled grotesquely the path from it to the gallows was unobstructed so that it might have been carelessly tossed or kicked there roger knelt down to examine it and found that it was headless it was a minute or two before he found the ball of plaited straw which had served as the head lying in a gully on the way down to the sun parlour he wondered how it had got there but chiefly he was wondering whether the figure had fallen down or had been torn down the answer to that question might be quite significant but roger did not see how an answer could possibly be obtained the few wisps at the top of the trunk were no indication either way well what did it matter he was only wasting time playing at being a detective till the real police should arrive trying to be cleverer with the facts than the facts themselves would allow coincidences and far worse coincidences too had occurred in the history of crime before now undoubtedly ena stratton had committed suicide and a very good thing for all concerned that hagridden lady herself included and that was that and he would go downstairs again and behave like a reasonable being and have another tankard of beer before the police came he walked quickly over to the house door nevertheless something caused him to stop there and turn back for a last look across the roof some remnant that had refused to be stifled of that extra sense of his which automatically rejected the improbable in human nature however plausibly probable argument might make it his hands in his pockets he stood still and let his eyes move very slowly over the whole space before him as if to give them one last chance to pick out any detail to which they had been blind before it was then that roger decided with an incredulous shock that his powers were waning for the detail on which his eyes alighted was no insignificant one but a glaring enormous whitewashed elephant of a detail it was no less than the fallen chair off which he himself had stepped not till then did he realize that where that chair now was no chair had been before and quite certainly mrs stratton had not taken a flying and accurate leap upwards straight into the noose to hang oneself it is necessary first to adjust the noose about ones neck and then step off an eminence into vacancy and there had been no eminence the phantom pricking of rogers mental thumbs had been justified murder had been committed chapter vii facts and fancies right under the very nose of roger sheringham himself murder had been committed in spite of the tragedy roger could hardly suppress a smile at the audacity of it he was not unaware of his reputation among the laity at times indeed he was almost childishly pleased about it somebody evidently thought it undeserved somebody too who could make such a colossal blunder of his own as to leave that hanging body without the overturned chair which should have been its natural corollary and roger had to admit that the unknown might not have made such a mistake in his estimate of roger sheringhams stupidity it was only by the smallest chance that he had turned round right in the doorway for that last look roger smiled again then he turned round passed through the doorway and walked downstairs it was the murderers own huge luck which had placed an overturned chair just where an overturned chair ought to be and roger was not going to interfere with it let the police make anything of it if they could roger was accustomed to look facts in the eye it was a fact if a regrettable one that mrs ena stratton meant nothing at all to him as a person dead or alive it was no less a fact that as a human being she had herself thrown away any sympathy in her fate more she had pulled that fate upon her with both hands roger could not feel any drivings of conscience to help the police towards avenging her but he could and did feel that a challenge had been thrown down to him personally and a rush of exhilaration drove the fatigue out of him no he would not take that chair away again any more than he would tell the authorities exactly what he knew not yet this was going to be played out first as a perfectly private battle of brains he hurried downstairs in view of what he had learnt he must have another look at the body alone before the police arrived dr chalmers had not quite finished his examination the stethoscope hanging round his neck he was bending over the bed when roger looked in at the doorway no hope im afraid roger asked tentatively dr chalmers glanced round and then straightened up none a dreadful business what can have possessed her to take her life like that you think it was suicide then chalmers stared at him his pleasant face showing his surprise why what else could it be oh nothing i suppose roger said airily i just wondered if there was any possibility of accident thats all i shouldnt have said she was a suicidal type at all you see at least on the little i saw of her dr chalmers drew the coverlet carefully over the body before he replied wouldnt you he said slowly well of course thats more in your line than mine but i should certainly have said that enas neurotic egocentrical type has a predisposition to suicide i may be wrong of course morbid psychology doesnt enter very much into a general practitioners work but though i was very shocked when ronald told me what had happened i cant say i felt much surprise youll be prepared to give evidence at the inquest then that in your professional opinion mrs stratton was a suicidal subject roger asked wishing that chalmers would go i think so unless said dr chalmers with interest you can convert me to the opposite view he looked as if he would like to embark upon such a discussion at once oh no roger said firmly for all i know youre right the stage seemed to be setting itself without hesitation for a verdict of suicide and roger had no intention of interfering with it at this juncture well he added i expect you want to see ronald is he still changing no he looked in a minute ago to say he was going upstairs i think someone ought to stay with the body roger said cunningly ill take charge if you like while you go upstairs dr chalmers looked for a moment a little doubtful as to the propriety of this suggestion then he nodded thanks i dont suppose it will be for more than a minute or two in any case the police ought to be here any minute now you live nearer here than dr mitchell does i suppose roger asked casually as the other moved over to the doorway yes we both live in westerford but franks at the farther end roger waited until the door was safely closed then he hurried over to the bed turning back the coverlet he stood for a moment looking down at ena strattons body she was still dressed exactly as she had been even to the misshapen hat on her head and roger could not see that her dress had been torn or damaged in any way if violence had been used it must have been a tidy violence he would have liked very much to know whether there were any marks or bruises on the trunk but that was impossible forcing himself to look calmly at her face he could detect none there with careful fingers he felt gingerly round the back of her head sliding his hand underneath the hat but no bump or swelling rewarded his search he lifted her hands and scrutinized in turn the space beneath each nail so far as he could make out without a magnifying glass nothing was to be seen there except a few tiny strands belonging obviously to the cord that had hanged her and some fragments of skin on either side of her neck as roger had expected were a number of long deep scratches before losing consciousness ena stratton must have scrabbled desperately at the cord that was choking her the palms of her hands too showed distinct signs of excoriation but that did not of necessity say that all of the little lumps of skin under her nails came from her own neck had the murderer succeeded in removing himself quickly enough out of the range of those clawing hands or was there anyone in the party who carried a brand new scratch on his or her own hands or face roger could not go and look for the answer to that interesting question until the police arrived to set him free from his vigil ronald strattons house sedge park lay three miles or so outside the fair sized town of westerford the constable who had been on duty in westerford police station had to cover them on his push cycle he arrived just thirteen minutes after ronald had telephoned which in view of the number of things the man himself had had to do before he could leave the station was not too bad ronald who was perfectly well known to all the members of the westerford police and himself knew most of them brought him up to the bedroom where he at once began asking his routine questions perfectly unnecessary thought roger as he left him to it because the inspector will ask exactly the same ones all over again as soon as he arrives but they always do it he went upstairs once more most of the party were collected now in the big room with the side open to the head of the well staircase where the bar had been set up nearly everyone was extremely tired and conversation was only spasmodic but bed was out of the question ronald had already warned them that the police would almost certainly want to question each person standing about or thrown into the big leather armchairs they stared moodily into the still glowing fire at rogers arrival a flicker of interest went round and dr chalmers asked whether frank mitchell had yet arrived no roger explained but the police have a constable he says the inspector will be here in five or ten minutes he looked round the room there was no scratch visible on any face he had hardly expected that there would be he joined dr chalmers by the fireplace and opened a low toned conversation did you arrive at any conclusion as to how long shed been dead he asked dr chalmers looked at him inquiringly how long he repeated yes i was just wondering whether she did it immediately after she rushed out of the ballroom or whether she brooded about it first oh i see well its difficult to say to a few minutes you know i took the temperature of the body and from that and certain other indications i should say that allowing for the temperature of the outside air she must have been dead at least two hours two hours roger said thoughtfully then she probably did it at once oh i think so undoubtedly she made the scene my wife told me just after i was called out yes said roger inattentively yes by the way whats the local police inspector like a very good fellow not a fusser but quite thorough hell go into all details of course but in such a straightforward case theres not very much he can do is there no said roger i suppose there isnt his eyes were on the top of the staircase perfectly visible through the low balustrade which had replaced the wall on that side of the room the staircase ended in a small landing off which the ballroom opened the landing ran on for a few yards past the ballroom door and at the end on the left there rose the short flight of stairs which led up onto the roof this flight pierced through one of the remaining gables so that its upper half was concealed from the barroom but the lower half and the whole of the landing was perfectly visible anyone mounting to the roof would therefore be under the observation of anyone standing at the bar the conversation with dr chalmers petered out as roger pondered over his very meagre two and two and tried to make them into a robust four anyone going up onto the roof could be seen by anyone in the barroom but nobody knew where ena stratton had gone therefore nobody had been in the barroom just then because the most absorbed toper could not have remained oblivious of her exit and passage therefore if her murderer followed her almost at once onto the roof again nobody was in the barroom or in all probability nobody to mark his passage either but of course one must not forget that the murderer might have been on the roof already and met her there anyhow the obvious question was who was in the ballroom just then and stayed there it was possible at any rate to eliminate if one could not construct quite unconscious of the fact that to dr chalmers his conduct might appear extremely rude roger pushed his hands in his pockets turned his back on the other man and wandered absorbed in his thoughts onto the landing where he propped his back against the stalwart pillar which ended the balustrade and frowned ferociously as he tried to throw his memory back over the last two hours first of all dr chalmers himself was eliminated as he had not been on the premises at all then ronald mrs lefroy celia stratton and mrs williamson had been with himself in the group which had tried to be kind to david stratton yes and margot stratton and mike armstrong so they were all cleared whom did that leave williamson colin nicolson mrs chalmers dr and mrs mitchell but the last two had been the first to begin the dancing again just before he himself had led david stratton why dash it all he himself had been at the bar within a few minutes of mrs strattons disappearance he himself had been mounting guard over the only way of access to the roof and had anyone passed along the landing and gone up there roger smiled to himself with exasperation for the life of him he could not say of so much value is the evidence of the man on the spot roger sheringham himself simply had not the faintest idea whether anyone had slipped out of the ballroom or not nevertheless this line of inquiry had not been quite fruitless one thing at any rate was certain david stratton who after all might be said to have a greater motive than anyone else could not possibly have murdered his wife during the really critical period he had been in rogers own company well that was one step and a big one roger looked up to find colin nicolson talking to him thought about said colin do you mind saying that again colin said roger politely i said well whats the great man plunged in thought about not very well put perhaps but thats what i said nicolson lifted a hand and felt in the eternal gesture of the dinner jacketed male the sit of his tie roger looked at the hand with interest just above the knuckles ran a long new scratch it was impossible of course that colin nicolson could be the murderer of mrs stratton absolutely and entirely out of the question for one thing colin would no more commit a murder than rob a blind widow and for another he scarcely knew mrs stratton at all possibly had not spoken to her the whole evening it was quite out of the question that colin could have done such an incredible thing nevertheless roger had been looking for someone who bore a nice new scratch somewhere visible and here was a nice new scratch on colin colin at any rate must account for the scratch what was i thinking about roger repeated vaguely ah very interesting no doubt well this is a nice business i must say how long do you think the police are going to keep us hanging about oh most of the night i expect you seem to have scratched your hand colin roger said mildly ach yes a nasty jab yes come up on the roof on the roof i want a mouthful of fresh air itll be deuced parky fresh air besides weve only just come down no no if you want more fresh air you can go up there alone as a matter of fact i want to speak to you rather particularly colin away from these people ach youre a nuisance roger all right i suppose youll give me no peace till i do roger led an unwilling colin out on the roof ah thats better you ought to do something about that scratch colin how did you get it oh its nothing do you expect me to faint at every wee scratch i get well what do you want to say now youve got me here asked colin turning up the collar of his coat for pitys sake hurry up and get it over roger took the others hand and examined the scratch it was broad but not deep how did you get it colin he repeated ach man whats it matter id just like to know colin stared at him youre very suspicious whats the idea roger laughed soothingly just exercising my well known powers whatever caused that scratch my dear colin it wasnt for instance a pin look at it for yourself does it matter a tuppenny damn what caused it not even a three hapenny one its just my regrettable curiosity dont tell me if its anything terribly private why should it be private you old rascal well it looks to me like a scratch from someones fingernail in fact if i didnt know you so well colin i should say you had been making a nuisance of yourself to a lady and got very properly scratched for your pains rogers fly fishing was rewarded well it was nothing of the sort colin said crossly and none but a mind like yours would have thought it was if youre really so curious i got it on a bit of broken glass and where have you been playing with broken glass colin grudgingly gave the commonplace particulars he had broken a glass at the bar and hidden the pieces under the table chapter viii the case against roger sheringham i accept your explanation colin roger said judicially leaning back against the railing that bordered the roof the deuce you do roger thats very kind of you dont get heated i was only thinking that men have been hanged before now because their explanations werent accepted many many men colin have you brought me up here in the cold just to tell me that well go into the sun parlour if you prefer it roger said kindly i do prefer it ive reached the age when i appreciate comfort colin nicolson was an elderly and disillusioned twenty eight they went down the steps to the sun parlour switched on the light and found two chairs well now whats on your mind roger colin asked when they were settled why should you think anythings on my mind i know the signs youre like an old war horse that smells the powder surely youre not trying to wist this business into anything serious i should have thought roger said mildly that it was quite serious enough already huh colin made a scottish noise expressive of any interpretation which its hearer might care to put on it roger was minded to try a little experiment no of course not i was just thinking on what small points these cases depend one single piece of evidence is enough to turn an apparently obvious case of suicide into a still more obvious case of murder or an accident into a suicide or what you will as a student of crime yourself colin can you pick out the vital piece of evidence in this case vital you mean for suicide yes colin thought that shed been talking about killing herself half the evening no no no thats evidence the other way if anything no i mean material evidence colin pondered no im blessed if i can well everyone just takes it for granted that it was suicide why no ill tell you because theres a piece of evidence which does actually prove it was suicide but which in all probability no one has consciously realized theyve seen it and theyve absorbed it but because it was part of the general picture of suicide they just take it for granted like you not one of them could put a name to it cant you colin its something perfectly obvious do you mean the absence of any signs of violence no but of course that is a point too roger had to concede well what is it then why that chair on the ground below her of course you remember there was a chair lying on its side under the gallows yes well the presence of that chair proves that she wasnt lifted up into the noose and it proves too that she did voluntarily put her own head in doesnt it yes i see what you mean very interesting roger yes thats the important piece of evidence without a doubt roger nodded and lit a cigarette his experiment had been successful the human mind is apt to accept what it thinks ought to exist with such decision that it will even construct and imprint on the memory perfectly detailed pictures the originals of which never in fact did exist at all colin without doubt had looked several times when they were on the roof just now at the gallows underneath the gallows was a fallen chair that fallen chair was a necessary detail in a stage set for suicide colin therefore perfectly remembered it being there while he was administering first aid to mrs stratton twenty minutes ago the picture was firmly printed on his brain a gallows with only two figures instead of three and a fallen chair on the ground beneath the third crossbeam it was impossible that the chair could not have been there twenty minutes ago colin remembered its presence perfectly he would swear with complete sincerity not merely that he thought the chair was there when he first came out on the roof but that it actually was there and so would everyone else in the party roger never had been troubled by the smallest doubt that the addition of the chair to the picture would be noticed by a single person and you think colin pursued that if the chair hadnt been there the case would have smelt of murder id put it a little more strongly than that i should say that murder would have been perfectly obvious roger was enjoying the irony of discussing fact as if it were wild hypothesis it was a pity colin could not appreciate the irony because she couldnt possibly have got her neck into the noose without either being lifted up or standing on something high enough exactly do you agree yes i certainly do this is very interesting roger its good exercise to appreciate the importance of trifles roger said cautiously and thats why you were so interested in my scratch roger laughed if colin only knew how near the wind he was sailing well we can say that it amused me by way of exercise to pretend to myself that the chair never had been there at all and therefore it was a case of murder and there were you with a nice scratch on your hand just such as i might have been looking for on one of the party in that event well well but what motive could i have had for making away with the unfortunate woman theres motive enough going about ill grant you but not in my case id never met her before this evening but dont you see thats precisely what would make the perfect murder roger said with enthusiasm its motive in ninety nine cases out of a hundred that really pins a murder on a certain individual without a motive suspicion might never be directed towards him at all without a motive thered be no murder colin was entering into the discussion with nearly as much interest as roger himself although to him it must have seemed almost preposterously academic when i say without a motive of course i mean without an apparent motive but take this very instance you apparently had no motive at all for mrs strattons death that is to say no material motive but need a motive always be material what about a spiritual one well what about a spiritual one said colin rather aggressively de mortuis nil nisi verum i see no reason why one shouldnt speak the truth about the dead the woman was a pest she was making a nuisance of herself to almost everyone she came in contact with she was a real menace to the happiness of at least two people here tonight and she was making her husbands life a misery to him there were only two things that could be done to stop her shut her up in a madhouse or polish her off unfortunately she wasnt quite insane enough to be certifiable therefore only the second alternative remains but not a one of the people who had a material motive for her removal had the moral guts to effect it along comes colin nicolson judicial sympathetic strong minded clear sighted enough to see right through shibboleths and courageous enough to act on his own judgment he knows that laws were made for man but he knows too that some people put themselves outside those laws he is socialistic enough to believe that the security of the majority demands the sacrifice of the individual he is intelligent enough to realize that it is hardly possible that suspicion can ever fall on him and that he is taking very little risk he is sorry of course that what he conceives to be his duty should require of him anything so drastic and he is sorry too for mrs stratton but he is a great deal more sorry for the people whose lives might be ruined if mrs stratton is allowed to go on living and so well well said colin calmly but im not sure youve got my character so well im afraid im not so noble as all that roger it all sounded to me much more like you it did rather didnt it said roger not without surprise anyhow you see what i mean oh yes said colin slowly i see that he sat for a moment in thoughtful silence and then lifted his stocky bulk to its feet going down again roger asked no back in a minute colin went out of the sun parlour and up onto the roof through the glass wall roger saw him walk across the roof and come to a halt under the gallows with his hands in his pockets he seemed to be staring at the chair which had been the cause of all the talk then roger saw him take a large white silk handkerchief out of his breast pocket and thoroughly wipe over the back rails and seat of the chair after that he walked in his unhurried way back to the sun parlour what on earth said roger in bewilderment not unmixed with apprehension colin looked at him with some severity the trouble with you roger he said is that you talk a jolly sight too much talk yes in the circumstances i should keep my mouth shut if i were you how on earth did you know i was safe i might not have been my dear colin what on earth are you talking about and what were you doing with that chair wiping your fingerprints off colin said calmly just in case youd forgotten to do so yourself wiping my yes you see i happen to know that chair wasnt under the gallows at all when we first came up on the roof it was in the middle somewhere i know because i almost fell over it and barked my shin rather nastily if i were you i wouldnt tell anyone else you moved it it might look fishy but i didnt yes you did in so many words i tell you roger you talk too much if i were you i wouldnt sound anyone else about suicide or murder in fact i wouldnt say a word about the case at all its too dangerous man of course i know youve probably got an urge to talk about it but you must just shut it down i wont give you away of course and i suppose really it was a pretty good thing for you to have done but you cant bank on everyone else you know i dont think there was any risk really roger said feebly somewhat taken aback by this severity and cursing himself for having underestimated colins shrewdness no risk colin snorted its all very well to talk of spiritual motives and no suspicion and all that but if you think you can get away with murder without any risk and then go boasting about it youll soon find your own neck in the same place as you put mrs strattons is it the least good roger said desperately for me to go on telling you that i did not murder mrs stratton ill believe you of course colin said without the least trace of credulity in his voice thank you colin roger said bitterly and in any case colin added i told you i wouldnt give you away roger began all over again well anyhow colin said judicially someone murdered her i know someone did my goodness i wish id never moved that blessed chair this is what comes of trying to do someone a good turn even in that case said colin smugly its a pretty serious thing you know monkeying about with evidence but dash it all man the woman deserved murdering i know that in theory its a shocking thing to shield a murderer but this case is exceptional whoever did such a good deed deserves shielding youd have done the same yourself i would not said colin with decision ive told you ill hold my tongue but thats as far as id go i wouldnt fake the evidence the game wouldnt be worth the candle i wouldnt risk my neck to get other people out of their own troubles risk your neck it would make me an accessory after the fact wouldnt it and the legal penalty for that is the same as for murder i suppose by the way colin added uneasily that im an accessory after some sort of fact now why on earth couldnt you hold your tongue roger i should never have guessed if you hadnt given yourself away i was a fool though too to let you know i had guessed but i keep on telling you i didnt murder the woman i know you do said colin and i keep on telling you that i wont give you away oh hell said roger there was an unhappy little silence my dear colin you cant possibly pretend theres a case against me roger said almost plaintively do you want me to show you the case against you id love you to roger said bitterly well man you told me the motive yourself it was silly to pretend it was a motive for me because it isnt im not nearly high minded enough to take a risk like that for someone i hardly know and i might add that im not officious enough either to meddle in other peoples affairs to such an extent as that but you are roger if you want me to be candid youre the most officious person i know and the most self confident if anyone in this world could commit an entirely spiritual altruistic infernally officious murder its you thank you colin said roger without gratitude well im just applying your own methods and all youve proved is that i might possibly be said to have a motive out of having no motive at all what sort of proof do you call that the small fact that i had no opportunity at all just doesnt concern you i suppose opportunity colin exclaimed well if you hadnt the opportunity i dont know who had when did i have an opportunity roger demanded astonished mrs stratton was found on the roof wasnt she so its a reasonable inference that she was on the roof or in here all the time after she left the ballroom in fact as no one saw her again its more than a reasonable inference that she was up here its almost a dead certainty youll agree with that i suppose yes i do roger said defiantly well well so far as i know you were the only person during the time she was missing who was up here too what after youd been consoling poor wee david at the bar didnt you come straight up here when i joined the two of you asked colin calmly good good lord exclaimed roger thunder struck it was perfectly true the advent of colin had given roger the excuse to slip away the conversation with david had in the circumstances been somewhat forced and roger felt that the enormous log fire was making the room not only uncomfortably hot but much too smoky he had gone up onto the roof and stood for a few minutes just outside the door smoking a cigarette and allowing the smoke from the room below to pour out through the open doorway he had forgotten all about it but colin was perfectly right he had seen no one on the roof but he must have been there at least four or five minutes and during that time there could be no doubt now that ena stratton must have been in the sun parlour alone or with her murderer this was infernally awkward and of course colin pursued after that poor david had been telling you all his troubles youd have been feeling nasty and worked up roger turned a distressed face on his accuser david didnt tell me all his troubles he could only say feebly he didnt even mention his wife at all we talked about the test matches and the leg theory you can ask him i wouldnt think of it said colin primly roger said nothing it was you who asked me for the case said colin and you think roger said with emotion that during those few minutes i was up here i carried mrs stratton to the gallows and hanged her there someone did if it wasnt you roger who was it you might at least give me the credit of not being such a bungler as to have forgotten the essential chair someone forgot it it was a bad mistake of course but the murderer whos found out always has made a bad mistake i suppose said colin regarding the end of his cigarette that having been mixed up with murder so much you didnt regard it quite so seriously as some of us do and that may have made you a bit careless about the details roger choked and of course it was your talking about the chair that gave the whole thing away colin went on with complete imperturbability i wondered what you were driving at then i understood you were worried about that chair you knew youd forgotten to put it there at the time and though youd seen your mistake and put it right afterwards you were a bit frightened that somebody might have noticed it wasnt there before so you tried to suggest it on me in order to have a witness that it had been there all the time just in case of trouble that was jolly clever of you roger but it didnt come off did it no you overdid it said colin frankly still it was a bright idea after youd given yourself away to pretend youd moved it to shield someone else very bright but unfortunately not very probable it just happens to be the truth thats all and as youd made so many bloomers already colin went on just as if roger had not spoken at all i thought you might quite well have been ass enough to have left your fingerprints on it too and id better wipe them off first and hear what youd got to say afterwards did you leave your prints on it by the way colin asked with interest yes said roger wrathfully i thought you would have done said colin with insufferable complacence i do seem to have been a clumsy murderer dont i i expect it takes practice colin soothed him again there was a little pause well any more isnt that enough asked colin and are you going to the police with this fool of a story i told you i wont give you away but youd better watch out that you dont give yourself away again i wish you would go to the police roger yammered thanks i dont want to be mixed up in it at all then ill go to them myself and tell them exactly what youve said youre a fool if you do colin said coolly in spite of his indignation roger still had enough sense left to see that he would indeed be a very great fool if he did once more there was a raging silence then there was the sound of footsteps outside and ronald stratton appeared in the doorway oh here you are roger ive been looking for you everywhere the inspectors here and wants to see you in the dining room roger rose not unthankful to escape he caught colins eye colin nodded reassuringly chapter ix the case against dr chalmers inspector crane of the westerford police was a tall loosely built man not in the least like the usual drill sergeant type of police inspector he had a pleasant face and in this house at any rate almost an apologetic manner certainly there was none of the snapping self importance about him which some police officials adopt ronald stratton already knew him fairly well and so had been able to explain the circumstances to him without the uneasy constraint which the presence of a stranger might have induced on learning that roger sheringham had been among the guests the inspector had named that gentleman as the first of the party whom he would like to interview very pleased to meet you sir he greeted roger heard about you before now of course a terrible business this sir though fortunately not in your line we hope no said roger firmly of course not no well sir if youll sit down i should very much like to hear from you anything which you think may throw light on the tragedy or assist the coroner it was the dining room which had been offered to the inspector for the conduct of his interviews and both men seated themselves at one end of the long table the inspector with his notebook expectantly open before him roger saw at once that the proceedings were not going to be unduly formal for both the stratton brothers were present too ronald perched on the edge of the table with his foot on a chairs seat and david leaning silently back against the mantelpiece you must understand inspector that i scarcely knew mrs stratton roger began and went on to give an account of his own dealings with her that evening ah the inspector pricked up his ears and licked his pencil hopefully mrs stratton actually mentioned to you her intention of taking her own life the possibility rather than the intention roger corrected still yes she did but in spite of that you did nothing said the inspector somewhat apologetically what could i have done she merely referred to the possibility in the future she said nothing about carrying out any such intention tonight so you took no steps sir none i ought to ask you said the inspector still more apologetically why you did not consider it necessary to take steps because i didnt believe a word of what shed been saying im bound to tell you that i thought she was talking just for effect i did not consider her intentions serious said the inspector writing busily does that express what you felt mr sheringham i think so roger agreed avoiding ronald strattons eye you didnt mention her words to anyone else to mr stratton for instance no as you say i didnt take them seriously enough but somebody else mentioned them to me sir someone else asked me if she had spoken to me about doing away with herself i gather roger said drily that she had touched on this possibility to other people besides myself is that the case thats very interesting will you be good enough to tell me who asked you that certainly it was mr williamson mr williamson asked me at one period whether mr williamson had already asked me in mr sheringhams hearing put in ronald stratton whether my sister in law was mad you remember sheringham quite early yes roger nodded i remember quite well it made me wonder at the time what did it make you wonder sir whether mrs stratton might be a little unbalanced and am i right in thinking that your subsequent conversation with mrs stratton did lead you to that conclusion asked the inspector with an uneasy glance at david stratton it did i think mrs stratton was undoubtedly a little unbalanced but not i thought then to the point of suicide roger did not add that he did not think that now either the inspector turned with awkward sympathy to david stratton that did not coincide with your own opinion mr stratton no david said shortly thats why i rang you people up i considered my wife totally irresponsible for her actions yes yes the inspector was a little flustered i have our mans report very curious that should have happened on the very same evening when the coroners bound to ask something about that but it all fits in inspector doesnt it ronald put in smoothly i mean its a rather remarkable piece of corroborative evidence about mrs strattons state of mind why should the coroner ask about it particularly well you see mr stratton hadnt ever rung us up like that before had you mr stratton no thered never been any occasion to do so ronald amplified it struck you this evening that mrs stratton was behaving how shall i put it in a more irresponsible way than usual the inspector asked david yes i think she was david stratton had spoken all the time in a curiously sharp voice as if he wanted to get his words out and be done with them after all ronald put in again my brother didnt ring up until mrs stratton had been missing from her home for some time and not until wed looked everywhere here first as i told you he was naturally alarmed and i dont suppose mrs stratton had ever behaved in that way before had she david never so in view of the irresponsibility she had shown during the evening and which other people had noticed besides ourselves he thought that you people ought to be warned just in case though i dont think he anticipated anything really serious did you david not really i thought it better to be on the safe side thats all you didnt anticipate that mrs stratton might do away with herself sir no i said not really my wife had often talked about suicide she had moods of great depression but like mr sheringham im afraid i didnt take it very seriously i see what was it that mrs stratton was depressed about nothing mrs stratton suffered from melancholia to some extent ronald supplied as smoothly as before she had nothing to worry about really her life should have been a very happy one but you know how that kind of person magnifies trifles and twists the smallest things into big ones it was all part of her complaint its no good trying to hide the fact inspector said ronald with an air of frankness my sister in law was really not quite normal i think the doctors will be able to give you some useful information on that point if they havent done so already no sir we havent got on to that yet but no doubt they will now mr sheringham let me see you were telling me roger resumed his story he had been listening with considerable interest to the three cornered conversation which had just taken place it was the attitude of david stratton which had been puzzling him that of ronald was plain enough he had been trying to take as much of the burden off davids thinner shoulders as he possibly could even to the risk of getting rapped over the knuckles for answering davids questions for him but why this sharp almost aggressive manner of davids when he did speak and why did he answer sometimes just as if he were repeating a lesson and a lesson not too intelligently learned at that he did not seem to roger to be suffering still from shock but he did seem to be concealing by this attitude some emotion which he did not care to show though whether that emotion was joy or sorrow fear or relief it was impossible to guess the laborious interrogatory was resumed roger corroborated the account ronald stratton had already given of the scene in the ballroom and mrs strattons exit and provided his own version of the return of david and the subsequent search everything was written down by the careful inspector and though roger made his story as brief as possible it seemed as if the thing never would be finished yes mr sheringham and after mr williamson made his communication to you i called mr stratton and we ran up on the roof mr stratton held mrs stratton up roger dictated slowly while i made a quick examination which convinced me that she was already dead i then held her up while mr stratton went to fetch a knife on my instructions when he returned i told him to cut the cord and i would take full responsibility for the fact that she was cut down it would in fact not be an exaggeration to say that you took charge immediately you suspected that mrs stratton was dead yes in view of the experience ive had in similar circumstances i felt justified in taking charge quite so mr sheringham and a very fortunate thing for mr stratton no doubt that he had you on the premises now did you form any opinion when you examined mrs stratton as to the length of time she had been dead no that would be impossible for me i havent the knowledge all i can say is that i thought she must have been dead some time an hour at least and probably more because her hands were quite cold i understand the doctors thought she must have been dead not less than two hours when they examined her just now would you agree with that oh yes but thats a matter for them you know not me mitchells arrived then roger added to ronald stratton yes he came just after the inspector and chalmers brought him in to see the body at once he agrees with chalmers estimate of the length of time she had been dead yes roger nodded to the inspector to go on with his questions it was all very informal and pleasingly unofficial but it was all very tedious too twenty minutes later after the inspector had dealt with and dwelt on every conceivably relevant point and a great many irrelevant ones roger was allowed to escape and sent williamson in his place the inspector was a thorough man and obviously intended to earn his superintendents praise for taking pains but it was clear that no thought of anything but suicide had ever seriously entered his mind not a question had roger been asked among all that welter of questions which might have caused him to depart from the strict truth concerning any such matters as chairs or fingerprints and yet colin nicolson was convinced that he roger sheringham of all people had murdered ena stratton colin was being quite nice about it but that he was so convinced roger was sure and roger was worried the crime of evidence faking had come home to roost on him with a vengeance he cursed the self satisfied smug impulse which had prompted him to alter the position of that chair that and the fact that he was known to have been on the roof during the crucial period gave colin an unpleasantly strong case against him not that roger was afraid that colin would inform on him he was quite sure that nothing of that kind would enter colins head but nevertheless to be suspected so strongly of a murder which one has not committed does give one a nasty haunted feeling in justice to himself now as well as in mere acceptance of a challenge it was up to roger to discover the real murderer and colin should jolly well help him he went upstairs in search of colin roger had always respected colin in rather a tolerant way now he found himself respecting colin in great sincerity one does respect a person who could land one quite easily in a singularly unpleasant prison cell he found williamson and sent him downstairs now unassailably sober to be interrogated in the barroom colin was alone dozing in front of the fire just as williamson had been dozing alone in the ballroom when shaken into consciousness the latter had informed roger that the women had retired worn out to get a little sleep before the inspector wanted to see them the time was now close on half past four in the morning with ruthless hand roger roused colin into complete wakefulness theres going to be no sleep for you this night my lad nor for me either come into the ballroom i want to talk to you seriously ach let me alone man i told you id forget it at four thirty in the morning sleep becomes almost more important than murder come along said roger sternly grumbling colin went where are the doctors roger asked as they shut themselves in and sat down gone while you were downstairs they came up for a wee nightcap and then went off poor chaps they looked whacked both of them i wonder they were able to get away so early roger said heartlessly theyd made their report and the inspector said he wouldnt want them any more theyve got to see the superintendent some time today you were a very long time downstairs roger put you through it did they oh they were quite kind roger said bitterly i told them how id committed the murder and they just told me to run away and be a good boy and not do that sort of thing again ah said colin evidently he did not consider this a suitable topic for jest blast you colin ive got to find out who did it now im not going to have you looking at me for the rest of my life as if i were a murderer its going to keep me up all night and its going to keep you up too so that for your infernal interference why me because youre going to help me so wed better get down to it but they did not get down to it at once for some minutes they sat in silence busy with their thoughts then colin looked up you know roger say what you like this is damned interesting it really was murder was it youre convinced of that absolutely it must have been the hypothetical case i put to you in the sun parlour like a damned fool was the real one that chair wasnt there at all i put it there but why thats what i cant understand why roger tried to explain why and have you blabbed it out to anyone else besides me asked colin no said roger wincing well whats your idea ill help you why man this is great stuff i hope it wasnt wee ronald because i like him no roger said slowly i have an idea it wasnt wee ronald but you have an idea it might have been someone else come on roger out with it this is grand yes i have got an idea do you remember what i was saying to you in the sun parlour about a man being actuated not by a material motive but a spiritual one sure i do whats in your mind well i was trying out a theory on you to see how it sounded it sounded all right to me or the way you put it it did and to me too colin im pretty sure i know who did string up ena stratton the dickens you do who dr philip chalmers said roger phil chalmers colin echoed incredulously oh come now roger hes a grand fellow its just because hes a grand fellow that i suspect him roger retorted or partially you see he hasnt any other motive this is going a bit too deep for me i dont see this at all well look at it this way roger explained with energy chalmers is a very old friend of the strattons and hes a doctor that means that hes in a better situation than anyone else to know exactly the position with regard to ena stratton that shed make the life of any man living with her a burden and a misery to him and that theres no hope at all of her ever getting any better he knows in fact that mrs stratton ought to be behind locked doors but that she just cant be now chalmers particularly close friend among the strattons is not ronald but david and chalmers as you say is a grand fellow its impossible that chalmers shouldnt have been very worried and very upset by the fact that his great friend david is being led the hell of a life by a worthless woman obviously he must have been youre with me so far i suppose yes ill grant you all that but what next well briefly that he saw an opportunity tonight of getting rid of her and just took it ach wait a minute i said he saw an opportunity i dont for a moment suggest that chalmers planned to get rid of ena stratton he isnt that type at all he couldnt plan a crime certainly not a murder but on the other hand hes a man of character if the opportunity presented itself i can quite see him seizing it and you must remember that hed seen enough this evening to stir him up to a considerable pitch of indignation on davids behalf mrs stratton did make an exhibition of herself didnt she and as davids friend chalmers was probably quite as embarrassed altruistically as david was on his own behalf perhaps a little more so david seems to have become rather dulled to his wifes performances in public you neednt look at me like that colin its quite conceivable well say it was what was the opportunity then how did he do it i imagine they must have been on the roof together perhaps they were leaning over the railing and she was inflicting her remarkable introspections on him as she seems to have done on most people this evening she may even have been trying to get him to make love to her ah come steady now roger talk sense women have been known to do such a thing roger said drily anyhow lets say she goaded him just beyond that limit of endurance which we call sanity they were somewhere near the gallows chalmers sees that the figure of the woman has fallen onto the roof the straw neck wasnt strong enough to last instantly the idea jumps into his mind put a woman where a woman was he looks round its all perfectly safe no one else is likely to come up its too cold and once shes safely strung up its odds against anyone finding her for hours let him get out of the house on that call of his and hes safe shes been talking of suicide its bound to be put down to suicide and then david can live a life of his own again and half a dozen other people will be able to sleep more easily at night and no one will regret her it will be the best minutes work he ever did in his life by the time hed thought all that out shed have been down at the bar again lapping up more double whiskies without soda idiot all those things flash through his mind in ten seconds there was no time to think or hed never have done it well he inveigles her to the gallows just underneath the noose and then for a strong man just one second would do it before she even realized what he was after or had time to scream out well well its a case i suppose colin said judicially but not so strong as the case against me i told you id forgotten that but come now roger you know well enough thats all guesswork you havent a mite of evidence besides you said let him get out of the house on that call of his but hed gone he wasnt here at all we saw him go and then we went into the ballroom all of us chalmers could have come up again couldnt he but man youre talking at random he could have come up again yes but wheres even a wee bit of evidence that he did as a matter of fact colin there is a tiny bit of evidence i dont say that it proves chalmers did come up again after wed all gone into the ballroom but it does prove that he was on the roof some time this evening mrs williamson found his pipe in the sun parlour ronald identified it ach he could have left it there any time he could yes and he did thats the point im not suggesting that he left it there then and the talk with mrs stratton was conducted in the sun parlour im suggesting that he had left it there earlier and when he got outside the house on the way to his call perhaps not until he was actually in his car he felt for his pipe in the way one does and remembered that he had left it there so he ran up for it we know the front door was left unlatched all the evening so there was no difficulty in getting in again and in the sun parlour he found not only his pipe but mrs stratton too sulking perhaps they did talk there before moving up to the main roof anyhow mrs stratton was intense enough to make him forget his pipe all over again but considering it was mrs stratton roger added shrewdly i shouldnt be surprised if she wasnt in the sun parlour at all it would have been far more typical for her to have been out on the cold cold roof pretending to commit suicide by pneumonia and praying for someone to come up and catch her at it for a little more glorification now youre at your guesswork again oh admittedly but if youre going to call every theory guesswork even when i can argue it from observed facts and reasonable inferences were not going to get much further no no i wont do that but i would like to hear a little more evidence to support your theories i dont deny that youve put up quite a possible case against chalmers but it all depends on one thing doesnt it and that is that he did it before he went out on that call roger considered yes thats right the time of death shows that she must have died within half an hour at most of leaving the ballroom and chalmers was away an hour yes if he did it it must have been before he went colin heaved himself up in his chair stretched and grinned well i didnt say anything before because i didnt want to spoil your fun but im afraid your case falls to the ground roger im willing to bet you five pounds to a sixpence that chalmers went out on that call before mrs stratton ever left the ballroom at all what do you say to that rogers face fell oh my goodness yes i believe youre right colin you would be of course yes i remember distinctly she only began saying she wanted to go home after chalmers had gone out and that was what led up to the scene dash you colin that seems to have scuppered it ah said colin complacently does it though wait a minute it was only because of the time of death that i said chalmers must have done it before he went out supposing the presumed time of death isnt correct its chalmers own word weve got for that you see and if it suited him he could have pronounced a false time of death quite easily no youre wrong again roger mitchell supported him he did yes they were talking about it up here while you were downstairs with the inspector oh roger considered but that might have been a case of unconscious suasion colin he went on eagerly i should think that a second doctor is always prejudiced in favour of the opinion of the one who made the examination first mitchell knows chalmers is a sound man hed be perfectly ready to accept chalmers opinion especially in a matter like this where theres a certain amount of latitude yes the more i think of it the more it fits in the point may be a small one but chalmers has been gently rubbing his alibi into all of us hasnt he i remember now he took the very first opportunity of mentioning to me that the ballroom scene occurred after hed been called out it may have been quite a natural thing to say but it may equally have been rather gratuitous and look roger continued quite excitedly how quickly he got here after ronald telephoned he does live nearer than mitchell its true but why hadnt he gone to bed he must have been home very nearly an hour three quarters at any rate three quarters of an hour at that time in the morning and he hasnt even gone to bed or apparently undressed doesnt that look as if he might have been waiting for the telephone call which he knew very well would come obviously he wanted to get here first before any other doctor or the police to have a good look at the body in the light and remove any possibly suspicious or incriminating traces well isnt that all perfectly reasonable ach come now roger colin shook his head your case against chalmers wont hold water and you cant twist it into doing so perhaps you still believe im the man roger asked unpleasantly i wouldnt be surprised though if you say not ill help you look for another but chalmers wont do he wont do at all i still think hes got a lot to explain away roger said obstinately yes id very much like to ask friend chalmers a few questions no its no good shaking your head like a mantelpiece mandarin there is a case against chalmers if he is the man we can assume that he could cook the time of death to make it appear that mrs stratton was dead half an hour before he got back to the house cant we cant we colin yes but wait a minute roger i no you wait a minute well if we can assume that theres a very big hole in his defence in that case the theory is that he came back from his visit and instead of coming into the ballroom to the rest of us went straight up to the sun parlour to get his pipe then everything else as before he knows hes pretty safe because not a soul has seen him go up on the roof well all hes got to do then is to wait till the coast is clear run downstairs again and then walk up singing loudly and announce himself and he could know when the coast was clear because the roof door cant be seen from the barroom or the landing hed only have to slip inside it and wait hows that oh very neat no doubt but listen to me no you listen to me therefore the objection you made just now has no point and the case against chalmers remains as strong as ever it did stronger if anything and whats more it may be quite easy to test it all weve got to do is to find out where that call of his came from and then very gently and subtly get to know at what exact time chalmers left there to come back here of course they may not will you listen to me roger colin shouted ive just thought of something well done colin roger said kindly its your theory that whoever killed mrs stratton held her up with one arm and pulled the noose round her neck with the other thats right isnt it certainly for a strong man never mind about your strong man thats how you say chalmers did it and he couldnt have done it any other way yes well he couldnt for instance have done it without using both arms no what about it oh said roger in a dying kind of voice exactly colin cried with tactless triumph why roger man where were your eyes you know as well as i do that chalmers has a dud arm he couldnt have held a fly with it that didnt want a noose round its neck let alone a great strapping wench like mrs stratton now perhaps youll have the sense to admit that whoever did it chalmers couldnt will you dash you colin said roger annoyed must you rub it in he tried to look on the bright side at any rate the discussion had not been totally useless chalmers as well as david stratton was now eliminated but at this rate it looked like being a long job colin was lighting a fresh cigarette well roger he said youve got to show me show you what that it wasnt you who strung up mrs stratton colin said calmly chapter x the case against david stratton in spite of rogers prophecy he and colin did get to bed that night some time after five oclock when roger got down the same morning colin had already breakfasted the women and williamson had not yet appeared roger was rather annoyed that he had got up so early ronald stratton found him in the dining room toying in a somewhat disaffected way with a tired looking egg and some bacon look here roger i dont know if you were thinking you ought to hurry away this morning but i dont want anyone to go unless they really prefer i dont think theres the least need and though the police havent definitely said so i think theyd rather that the party remained here intact till tomorrow ill stay with pleasure roger agreed but isnt it a little awkward with the body was taken away this morning to my brothers house ronald explained the inspector gave permission oh i see that was very quick wasnt it for a sunday morning very david made the arrangements himself i offered to let her stay here till the funeral considering the boy and everything but david thought better not and the inquest eleven oclock tomorrow morning here i rather think the police will want you to give evidence yes the inquests to be here is it then wouldnt it have been more convenient in that case for for ena to stop here yes i should have thought so but david imagined it might upset my arrangements for you people i sec that was very thoughtful of him is he roger appeared to himself to be putting most of his questions in the form of dots is he all right oh yes perfectly its an open secret between ourselves that enas death is just nothing but a huge relief to him more than to anyone else but of course we dont want to advertise the fact at the inquest no of course not the police hadnt gone by the way when i went to bed this morning i suppose theyre perfectly satisfied said roger in a casual voice helping himself to another cup of coffee oh quite here let me do that after all why shouldnt they be why indeed but you seemed a little worried last night about the nature of the party ronald smiled yes im afraid i kept quiet about that i just said that some of the guests were in fancy dress i dont think its likely to come out before the inquest but if it does i really cant help it after all were not children one cant be expected to take precautions against the word murderer or the sight of a gallows suggesting someone into suicide can one not really but you must anticipate a possible howl from the sensational press if it does come it sounds like jam for them morbid amusements at house party ghoulish jests lead to tragedy ronald made a grimace yes i know it all rather depends on the coroner luckily i know him pretty well and hes quite a decent fellow then you ought to be fairly safe but youll have to explain away the gallows in any case how are you going to do that the gallows said ronald with a grin were a subtle compliment to the presence among us of the great detective in dam bad taste ive no doubt were the police shocked not so much as i expected in fact the inspector was really rather amused i think if anything though of course he had to hide it hes a good chap well well hullo said ronald wasnt that the telephone excuse me a minute he was away for some minutes margot he explained briefly wanted to know how we all were this morning so i broke the news i shouldnt imagine she was very distressed to hear it no ronald smiled she seemed a little more agitated than id have expected but i suppose that was the surprise and your sister asked roger hows she this morning i havent had her disturbed the poor girl was quite whacked she practically collapsed while the inspector was interviewing her and i had to call down agatha to help me get her to bed she hadnt anything of the least importance to tell the police of course so it didnt really matter i shall keep her in bed till lunch yes i should said roger mechanically and took another piece of toast roger found colin smoking his morning pipe in the rose garden ah roger colin greeted him and added a little pointedly how did you sleep my guilty slumbers were perfectly sound thank you roger replied coldly i hope your position as accessory after the fact didnt interfere with yours nothing could have interfered with them last night colin said simply i wonder why ronald built his rose garden just like a ruined roman temple roger looked round the sunken oval of lawn in the centre surrounded by a wide raised bed within little walls of red brick and enclosed by tall brick columns beyond to carry the ramblers did look like a ruined roman temple at the moment however roger was not interested in roman temples i couldnt tell you colin he seated himself in the sun on the brick parapet look here when i left you and david last night by the bar to go up on the roof what happened to the two of you when i came down you werent there in fact that room was empty had you gone back to the ballroom colin made the face of one trying to chase an elusive memory im not sure why are you still on the trail roger i am roger said grimly and thats your fault so kindly rack those things of yours you call brains and answer my question colin thoughtfully scratched the top of his slightly bald head deuce take it i dont know does it matter of course it matters i want to trace the movements of every single person with a motive for mrs strattons death from the time the woman left the ballroom till the time david came back to say she hadnt gone home the devil you do thats not an easy job well ill do my best for you wait now and let me think again roger waited fiddling with a wireworm which had been illegally investigating the roots of one of the rose bushes if you kept still said colin i might have a chance to think roger kept still i believe ive got it i went back to the ballroom yes thats how it was because i remember lilian asking me how wee david was and i said i thought the drink had done him good yes i went back to the ballroom and david didnt where did david go how on earth should i know but we must know cant you see how important it is roger said excitedly did he go up on the roof why should he do that look here colin roger said patiently is it lack of sleep thats made you this way this morning or are you deliberately trying to be obstructive cant you see that after i came down someone went up on the roof and that someone killed ena stratton after you came down yes well who was it thats what im asking you because cant you see too that of all the people who had motives for cutting mrs stratton out of the way her husband had the biggest so far as motive goes david stratton is it no no no youll not persuade me its no good roger no good at all youll never persuade me that wee david strung his wife up on that gallows colin will you talk sense said roger exasperated im not trying to persuade you im only asking you to consider the possibility and then see if theres any evidence to support it we must keep open minds if were to get anywhere in this job at all youre just one lump of prejudices david wouldnt have the heart to squash a slug i can quite believe that several people who hadnt the heart to squash slugs have found they had the heart to commit murder ach come now roger do you mean to tell me you consider that wee david a potential murderer most certainly i do and all criminological history supports me as you ought very well to know david strattons just exactly the type that does commit murder i thought you were saying last night that chalmers was theyre as different as as chalk from cheese yes of course they are dont be so dense colin roger thumped the brick parapet beside him and hurt his hand cant you see the difference in what im suggesting for them chalmers could never possibly commit a murder on his own behalf david stratton couldnt conceivably commit one for somebody else but philip chalmers can be imagined as doing for his david what he wouldnt do for himself and david as i said is own brother to hundreds of excellent long suffering husbands married to domestic pests who just couldnt stand it any longer and reached for the meat chopper well ill be fair with you colin conceded ill grant you that crippen crippen precisely a charming little man driven completely off his balance by that terrible wife of his though in his case of course there was the extra motive in colin roger stared at the other with sparkling eyes whats the matter now i happen to know that davids in love with another woman he had motive enough without that how do you know i was told last night as a matter of fact someone let it out i neednt say who but id stake my income on its truth now see here roger colin said not without heat im not going on with this if youre going to try to fasten it on that poor chap im not going on with it and thats flat you didnt in the least mind it being fastened on me though roger said bitterly you fastened it on yourself but if youre going to prove that david did it then lets not do anything of the kind i dont want to know if he did or he didnt but if he did in heavens name lets leave him in peace he must have been goaded pretty far ah so youre beginning to admit the possibility i just dont want to have anything more to do with it and be at liberty to drop hints for the rest of your life i suppose that i did it no colin im afraid thats not good enough for me and in any case i cant quite see what your trouble is are you afraid of knowing that a friend of yours has committed murder just like the ostrich husband whod much rather not know that his wife has kicked over the traces where ignorance is bliss is that your idea and yet it didnt seem to shatter you when you jumped to the conclusion that i had that was different colin growled you can look after yourself david cant oh stop being an old hen roger said impatiently and discuss it reasonably i didnt say we were bound to act on anything we discovered in any case i doubt very much whether we could prove it as the police consider proof since i moved that chair you neednt be so frightened on behalf of your poor wee david im quite prepared to shield him if it does turn out that he made away with her ill even shake his hand and congratulate him if you like but i must know why must you know colin asked plaintively because dash it roger shouted youve accused me and i didnt do it youve nibbled at the roots of my self respect you you wireworm and ive got to restore them oh well colin grumbled all right then get on with it roger moved himself along to another patch of sun warmed brickwork and thus comforted took up his rede its quite plain colin that youre going to disagree with every single thing i say this morning so youd better take up the position of counsel for the defence at once and ill prosecute first of all then id like to hear from you why you thought david behaved in that very strange manner last night after wed found the body or didnt you consider his manner strange it was a terrible shock to the man naturally what do you expect not quite what i saw i think roger said meditatively it would have been a shock of course on the other hand david must have detested his wife and it cant be such a shock to lose a wife you detest as to lose a wife you love though ill grant you that the first reaction for an innocent man of course would probably be horror after all a wife is a wife even if you do detest her and there must be times and moments to which one instinctively looks back with emotion even with ena stratton there must have been such times or david would never have married her and why the deuce he ever wanted to do so is more than i can say nevertheless he evidently did but davids manner last night didnt strike me quite as a result of that natural and innocent feeling there was shock but somehow i shouldnt have said that it was the shock of loss am i unconsciously influencing myself now if i think that it was much more like the shock of fear demanded roger oratorically quite possibly but there was no doubt about ronald he was clucking round david just like an old hen what i wonder is there about david that causes perfectly strong men to cluck like hens i dont know ronald anyhow was much concerned about david why colin i dont know nor do i but would you jump down my throat if i suggested that it was because ronald knew what david had done and was frightened out of his wits that david might give himself away to the police would you be extremely angry if i put that forward as the reason why ronald should have nipped in and answered the questions addressed by the inspector to david almost before his brother could open his own mouth would you colin oh so weve got a brand new accessory after the fact as well as a new murderer have we colin asked sarcastically it looks as if we might have roger admitted i hope so for davids sake well theres the question of davids reactions as expressed in his manner as a matter of fact david might be said to have had two manners an early and a late in his early manner he appeared to be dazed no doubt by shock possibly by the shock of loss possibly not his later manner was exactly the opposite when he was allowed by ronald to answer the inspectors questions he almost barked out his replies they were curt to the point of rudeness now i actually did have during that interview two rather interesting thoughts it seemed to me that david had been rehearsed in what he was to say to the inspector and perhaps hurriedly and sketchily rehearsed at that and it seemed too that he was concealing an emotion of some kind both these suppositions fit in very well with davids guilt but great snakes man its all so vague its only possibly this and perhaps that not a fact in the lot of it complained colin vigorously yes i know we havent got on to the facts yet im dealing first with the tiny straws well come to the trusses in a minute so far then weve established that david had an overwhelming motive beforehand and an uneasy manner afterwards and now if you want facts heres a very big fact indeed and id like to hear you explain it away if you can why did david ring up the police about his wife before it was ever known that anything had happened to her at all ach come now roger you know why he did that i know what he gives as his reason for doing it to warn them that an irresponsible woman was loose in the countryside yes thats what he said at the time in case of suicide and yet david stratton as an intelligent man must have known that the chances of his wife committing suicide were extremely remote he must know as well as i do that the people who chat impressively about committing suicide arent the people who do it that was the very first thing that made me really suspicious about the death but doesnt it strike you as a very cunning move mrs stratton were actually dead and the stage set for suicide to suggest to the police the fear of suicide in advance im not sure that it does wouldnt it be just as likely to make the police more suspicious i dont think so with all the evidence for suicide that was waiting for them to collect the police you see dont bother about psychological probabilities like you its facts they want and the fact is that mrs stratton had been braying her intention of committing suicide all the evening very nice it seems to me said colin that for david to go and do a thing like that when all the time hed really murdered her would be just like those detective stories where the murderer himself goes rushing off for the great detective and begs him to take up the case which only proves that he was daft as well as a murderer thats a point roger said thoughtfully but not i think in this instance a sound one the police are bound to investigate in any case you see the great detective isnt though youre right to the extent that the inspector himself did appear a little curious as to why david should have rung up the police station on this particular occasion and never before ronald jumped in and explained it all away by the way another confirmation of collusion between those two roger had spoken a little mechanically he was thinking of someone else who had voiced to him a fear that the police might suspect something absolutely preposterous and that was before he himself had proved murder at all but he had suspected it and probably he had shown that he suspected it had this remark been by way of a feeler was there by any chance a second accessory after the fact roger would have to secure a few tactful words with mrs lefroy some time during the day what say that again colin sorry i was thinking i dont believe a word of it colin repeated robustly there was no reason why david shouldnt have rung up the police as an innocent man with a daft woman about the place like that no reason at all and every reason why he should well i disagree thats all i think with the inspector that it was to say the least curious now what else have we got against david ach supposing him innocent was it really quite natural for him to come back to the house and search roger asked argumentatively could he really have thought that she actually was hiding there i dont know it seems a little odd much more likely that shed have rushed off to the house of some friend or hidden herself outside anywhere rather than in the house of the hated ronald wouldnt you think youre just twisting things no im not thats a perfectly sound point and so is its corollary in fact more interesting still what why dont you see if david knew she was dead and ronald too we might say knew she was dead either then or later then theyd have to organize that search just exactly as they did in fact organize it because neither of them must find the body or it would look better if neither did and so we had to be kept at it till one of us did dont you think thats rather interesting colin but these are nothings man just nothings no theyre not nothings i grant you theyre not very big somethings but they are somethings just tiny little pointers which all seem to me to indicate guilt more than innocence not much separately of course but in the mass just a bit formidable dont you think and another one is davids anxiety to have the body in his own keeping at the first possible moment quite natural no doubt if hes innocent but still more explicable i should have said if hes not colin made a scottish noise of exasperation which roger ignored thats interesting by the way he resumed it shows that the police have no suspicion at all otherwise of course theyd have taken the body off to the mortuary well i cant say im sorry i believe you said colin meaningly roger laughed so im still under suspicion am i more than that wee david at any rate colin muttered why man you said yourself last night that he and chalmers were the only two who were definitely cleared yes but that was before id fully realized that the time of death might not be what chalmers suggested you cant have it both ways roger colin pointed out it wasnt till you were trying to prove that chalmers was the man that you decided the time of death might be half an hour later than he fixed it because he might have been deliberately misleading us its only if chalmers is guilty that the time of death might be late enough for david to have done it and if chalmers were guilty david couldnt be if chalmers isnt guilty then the time of death must be as he said and that lets wee david out again youve no case at all time of death is never so rigid as that roger retorted within two hours as this was and in the cold outside air to complicate things the doctors may well have made a perfectly genuine error of half an hour anyhow you dont agree that im building up against david a case quite worth answering no i dont colin maintained stoutly i think youve exaggerated all the points against him out of all proportion and not even considered the ones in his favour thats quite true i havent im not concerned with them i just wanted to see whether there was a case for him to answer and there is ach you could make out as good a case as that against any of us well its as good at least as the case you made out against me roger retorted would you like to lay both of them before the inspector im quite willing youre not really thinking of stirring up the mud like that roger are you colin asked in some alarm no im not but your answer shows what you wont admit that there is a case against david roger rose and stretched himself well im quite willing to leave it at that if you are great guns yes i dont want to have anything more to do with the business at all then thats all right roger bent over his pipe which had been unable to stand up to this oratory what are you going to do now colin asked me oh i think i shall stroll back to the house to see if theres anything doing i rather liked that inspector fellow i think ill have a chat with him by the way i suppose youre staying till tomorrow ronald seems to want us to no said colin i dont care about the idea at all ive told him ill be pushing off after lunch oh well i think i shall stay but what about the inquest ach said colin confidently they wont want me for that why should they roger walked back to the house if he had not succeeded in convincing colin he had convinced himself he was quite sure now that either david stratton or ronald had been responsible for enas death with the other brother as accomplice either before or after in any case they were both in it on the whole roger fancied ronald as the more probable candidate for the actual deed ronald was a man of more decision than david and he was a man roger fancied who could be fairly ruthless if he had decided that ruthlessness was necessary besides he had the double motive solicitude for his brother of whom he was obviously very fond and the silencing of ena on his own behalf for that matter however david had a double motive too as a husband and as a lover i should like to know where david went when colin left him roger thought to himself did he go up onto the roof then or didnt he the time of death does give us that amount of latitude whatever the doctors say now i wonder how i can possibly find that out the more closely he looked at this new solution the more certain roger became that it was the right one he had been led away before by the pretty will of the wisp of chalmers but examining the situation with an unprejudiced eye he saw now that a simple elimination left no one at all but one of the stratton brothers as the guilty man colin williamson and himself were out of the question dr mitchell he was sure had not left the ballroom or his wifes side during that hour mike armstrong equally had been constant in his attendance on margot the women were all ruled out as not possessing the necessary physical strength chalmers was cleared for the same reason only david and ronald remained and still further against these two davids alibi was not sound and ronalds had not even been examined well good luck to both of them by the time he reached the house roger had decided that he no longer wanted to find out where david had gone when colin left him whether it was he or ronald who had done the actual deed roger had not the least intention of interfering murder could seldom be justified but it was difficult to look on the elimination of a piece of blight like ena stratton as murder and the best thing for roger was simply not to know who had done it or anything about it but as he passed through the front door roger could not help smiling did any lingering suspicion still really remain with colin that he of all people roger sheringham had taken it upon himself to string up ena stratton or was that merely a retort on the part of that obstinate young man to rogers charges against david in either case roger could not help feeling amused at the idea of roger sheringham being suspected of murder chapter xi a hive in the helmets roger found inspector crane on the roof talking to ronald stratton a uniformed constable hovered in the background good morning inspector roger said cheerfully good morning sir funny i was just saying to mr stratton could i have a word with you up here were you a lucky arrival then roger glanced round with interest he had not seen the roof in daylight before and it did not look quite as he had imagined it in the dark much smaller for one thing and the arbour was almost at the end instead of nearly in the middle as he had thought the gallows were exactly in the middle and from them still hung the two remaining straw effigies in the sunlight these looked merely ludicrous and no longer in the least grisly the inspector and ronald were standing close to the gallows and roger intercepted a surreptitious wink from the latter which puzzled him slightly its about this chair mr sheringham the inspector explained in a somewhat apologetic voice and pointed at the chair lying on its side underneath the gallows a tiny stab of alarm pierced rogers chest but he answered easily enough oh yes what about it well sir you see how its lying right underneath the rope now ive taken measurements and it appears that the poor lady would have been able to stand on it quite easily if it had been like that these rungs support me as ive tried so they would quite easily have supported her yes i see what you mean but perhaps its been moved thats just what i wanted to ask you mr sheringham was it to your knowledge moved last night while you and mr stratton were cutting the poor lady down roger looked as meaningly as he dared at ronald he did not want his reply to clash with any story that ronald might have told well thats rather difficult to say he answered cautiously do you remember if it got moved ronald to rogers horror ronald said brightly no i cant say as a matter of fact i was just telling the inspector that i dont remember it being there at all when we were cutting her down after a moments stupefaction before this stupidity roger regained control of himself dont you oh i think i do it was rather in the way yes i expect someone must have kicked it aside inspector yes i can understand that sir agreed the inspector in a worried voice but why was it put back again oh well probably someone just kicked it back in any case i dont think its a point of any importance is it no mr sheringham probably not i just didnt quite understand about it and i thought you might have been able to give me some information yes well you see inspector it isnt the kind of thing about which one can be very accurate i daresay i ought to have noticed exactly the position of the chair when mr stratton and i got up here but im afraid i was much more concerned in finding out if she was really dead and trying to save her life if she wasnt yes sir of course yes i quite understand that no doubt its of no importance at all and there was a certain amount of confusion up here you must remember mr stratton and i and mr williamson and mr nicolson too and it was quite dark no i think its only surprising that the chair didnt end up in the garden below instead of more or less where it started from yes no doubt youre quite right mr sheringham agreed the inspector and made a note in his little book but he did not sound quite so convinced as roger would have liked ronald stratton who had been viewing this exchange apparently with tolerant amusement said well that was all you wanted to ask mr sheringham inspector its all very well my dear ronald thought roger but there is such a thing as overconfidence he was astonished that ronald should have made such a blunder over the chair for the second time apparently he still did not realize its vital importance yes i think so mr stratton thank you the inspector replied perhaps a little uncertainly and youve finished up here for the time being sir yes then come down into the house and let me give you a glass of beer its getting on for twelve oclock thank you mr stratton i wish i could say yes but i have to see the superintendent ill just say a word to my man and then i must be off the inspector walked aside and said a few words to his constable in a low voice neither roger nor stratton could overhear them nor tried youll have a spot of beer roger ronald remarked more in the manner of one making a statement than asking a question thanks roger agreed i will ill come upstairs again when ive seen the inspector off no said roger ill come down he wanted a closed door between them and the rest of the world while he said a few firm words to ronald on the topic of his imbecility and the late barroom was altogether too public they escorted the inspector politely to the front door chatting about the weather and stratton took roger into his study i keep a cask in here he said happily its handier this cupboard might have been specially built for a cask mightnt it yes said roger look here ronald ronald looked round from the tankard he was filling yes i want to speak to you in words of one syllable dont you inconceivable bonehead say anything more about not remembering that chair being there when we were taking down the body last night ronald turned off the tap put the other tankard under it and turned it on again whats that why not because roger explained with suppressed fury the presence of that chair nincompoop means suicide and its absence means murder think it out and youll see ronald stratton turned a suddenly white face over his shoulder and stared at roger while the beer ran unheeded over the top of the tankard good lord he muttered that had simply never occurred to me he turned back mechanically stopped the flow from the cask and got to his feet i say roger no roger interrupted quickly much better not ronald didnt they drank their beer looking surreptitiously at each other then roger said in quite a casual voice want any help in getting things down from the roof ronald there are still some things up there chairs and things its nice and sunny now but who knows whether it maynt rain later in april ronald grinned thats quite a sound idea roger yes id like your help they finished off their tankards and went solemnly up to the roof with a nod to the constable who was still loitering there ronald walked over to the nearest pair of chairs near the steps that led to the sun parlour before he could touch them however the constable had lifted his voice sorry mr stratton sir were you wanting anything yes were going to take these chairs and things into the house in case it rains later its april you know im sorry sir said the constable portentously but the inspector said for me to see that nothing wasnt moved up here he did roger could not tell whether stratton was really surprised or was only acting surprise in either case he sounded highly surprised but why couldnt tell you sir but thats what he said nothing to be moved nor touched he left me here for the purpose what on earth said stratton and lifted his eyebrows at roger but surely inspector crane didnt mean that nothing was to be touched on the whole roof constable roger came to the rescue sorry sir those are my orders nothing to be moved on this roof nor yet touched oh well roger shrugged his shoulders there must be some mistake i think but youll have to wait for the inspector to put it right ronald inspector crane will be coming back soon i take it as hes left you here he added to the constable bout half an hour he said sir i see well ronald we must just wait thats all shall we go in as they went down the stairs ronald said surely thats rather queer sheringham isnt it oh no i dont think so roger replied probably the superintendent has told crane hed like to have a look at the scene before things are moved and cranes gone off to get him but crane didnt say anything last night about things not being moved on the roof when i took him up there well he hadnt seen the superintendent then had he roger said smoothly but he felt a little uneasy it certainly was rather queer downstairs they found colin reading the sunday times in front of the hall fire hullo colin all alone said ronald none of the women down yet no nor osbert either the lazy hound oh by the way ronald i told you id be pushing off after lunch sorry ive got to change my plans ill be staying tonight well we shall be very glad to have you colin decided your appointment wasnt so urgent after all not a bit of it i met that inspector chap as i was coming in just now and he asked me was it a fact that i was going off after lunch i said it was and he told me there was nothing doing or words to that effect told you you couldnt go ronald said incredulously well not quite like that he said i should probably be wanted at the inquest tomorrow and it would be a great convenience to him if i stayed so of course i said i would but if id said i couldnt i wouldnt put it past him to have told me id jolly well got to he had that sort of look in his eye the devil he had said ronald the half hour passed slowly and as it passed rogers uneasiness grew he knew the signs and be knew the ways of the police the inspector was not satisfied that was quite obvious but what on earth could have managed to rouse his dissatisfaction if it was just the position of the chair then that really was the most thundering bad luck for had everything been as innocent as it could be it was inevitable that the chair should have been kicked about a bit with four men scrimmaging round it the inspector could hardly have expected that it could have been left quite untouched no in spite of his deferential manner inspector crane must be a busybody with a death at such a house as sedge park he saw his chance of making himself important if he could find a few niggling points over which to raise queries he could get his name put forward as a keen man and the devil of it was that without knowing it inspector crane might be carrying a match towards a powder magazine if he really did begin to uncover the surface heaven knew what train he might not fire roger hoped most sincerely and with all the fervour of a guilty conscience that inspector cranes match might prove a damp one the same constraint seemed to be resting on the others as on himself they sat in gloomy silence round the big open fireplace and rustled their newspapers but it was doubtful if any of the three read very much as the time passed roger began to feel more and more like a schoolboy before a house match that nasty sensation of sick emptiness and if he felt like that what must ronald stratton be feeling for ronalds reception of the warning about the chair had gone all the way to confirm rogers conclusion there had been real fear on the face that ronald had shown him and in these circumstances fear could surely be caused only by a knowledge of guilt either on his own behalf or davids well roger would do all he possibly could for him but there might be some awkward times ahead with this infernal inspector raking over the dung heap it would look bad uncommonly bad if the man brought to light the feelings with which the stratton family in general had regarded ena and precious little raking would be needed to do that a few minutes after twelve oclock mr williamson appeared looking perhaps a trifle yellow round the eyes and with a perfunctory remark or two added himself to the silent circle again the rustling of newspapers was the only sound in the hall once ronald stratton betrayed his anxiety by a muttered remark i thought the constable said crane would be back in half an hour its forty minutes already since he went at twenty five minutes past twelve ronalds parlourmaid presented herself at williamsons side and said in a flat voice which must have masked much interior fluttering i beg your pardon sir but inspector crane would like to speak to you for a moment on the roof what to me did you say he wants to speak to me if you please sir inspector crane stratton repeated i didnt know he was here edith yes sir he came about a quarter of an hour ago with superintendent jamieson and another gentleman but i never saw them come and ive been in here all the time they came to the back door sir but why didnt you tell me they said they were just going up to the roof for a minute or two sir and it wasnt necessary to disturb you so i didnt think to tell you i see well if they come if anyone comes like that another time edith i think youd better let me know very good sir whats up asked williamson as the parlourmaid disappeared eh whats it all about whats he want to see me for i saw him last night and told him everything i knew whats he want to see me again for i dont know osbert but presumably youd better go yes i suppose i had well i wonder what the devil he wants to see me for williamson began to climb the staircase which led up from one end of the big hall roger watched his back in an agonized way he was quite sure there was some terribly important thing he must say to williamson before the interview some warning hint he must give him which would smooth everything out there was such a thing but his mind seemed paralysed he could think of nothing at all in a kind of hopeless despair he watched williamson out of sight well ronald muttered and what the deuce do you make of that colin looked at them over the huge hornrimmed spectacles he used for reading dirty work in the camp he asked tentatively dont know yet roger answered in a tone to discourage further questions in front of ronald ronald made a movement as if to rise shall i go up he asked better not roger said they obviously dont want you the superintendent has come then yes i thought thats what it might be yes i wonder who the other one is oh some plain clothes man i expect i expect so but why on earth should they want williamson well he found the body didnt he oh yes so he did yes thats why the superintendent wants to see him of course just routine i suppose thats it no doubt just routine but roger did not think it was routine at all williamson was away for twenty minutes and they were the longest twenty minutes that roger had ever known williamson was wearing his guilty grin third degrees nothing to it he said as he dropped into his chair nothing to what osbert asked colin to what theyve been putting me through up there eh this is a nice party of yours ronald havent you even got a drink to offer me eh havent you damn drinks are the police still up there you bet they are the superintendent the inspector two constables and what did they want to see you for oh a lot of dam nonsense wanted me to tell the superintendent everything i told the inspector last night and a hell of a lot more how i found the body which way it was facing how far i thought the feet were off the ground where some chair or other was how roger uttered an exclamation he had remembered at last what the thing was about which he should have warned williamson the chair he ought to have inserted into williamsons consciousness just as he had tried last night to insert it into colins the idea that the chair had been there from the beginning now it was too late eh sheringham what did you say nothing oh yes what did you tell them about the chair roger avoided colins eye told them i couldnt remember of course how could i possibly remember a thing like that and what did they say to that told me to try and remember told me to try and throw my mind back to the moment i found the body and see if i couldnt picture the scene and all that and where was the chair well i did remember as a matter of fact that it couldnt have been in the middle of the gallows because i walked clean through them so i said it must have been under the body yes and then they said it couldnt have been under the body or mrs stratton would have been able to stand on it so i said it must have been beyond the body then mustnt it well it must mustnt it so then they asked me if i remembered now that it was beyond the body and so i was getting a bit fed up and said i did and would i swear to it and i said no i wouldnt swear to it because i wasnt prepared to swear to it but thats where it must have been and now for heavens sake ronald let me have a drink ive been through the third degree man eh you dont seem to understand what with the police and then lilian and now you people lilian said colin idly i met her on the stairs and of course she had to know all about everything too mr williamson sighed deeply as a husband will roger was considering mr williamsons story williamson had given him better luck than might have been expected at any rate he had not denied the presence of the chair altogether as he very well might have done but according to williamsons account the police had framed their questions in a rather odd way they had seemed much more concerned with the exact position of the chair than with the possibility of its total absence did that mean that they really were worrying only over inspector cranes ridiculously insignificant point and the other alternative had never occurred to them at all if so they were more foolish than roger would have expected but he would be very grateful to them for their foolishness williamson sipped the glass of sherry with which he had now been provided and continued his story well i dont know what else there is to tell you they kept on asking me that sort of thing and the inspector wrote most of it down where oh we were in the sun parlour didnt i tell you that eh yes thats where we were the inspector and the superintendent and me in the sun parlour oh i know something else they asked me about yes look here ronald theyre onto the state of affairs about your sister in law like hell they are youd better watch out there i mean they might make a spot of trouble over that mightnt they eh driven to suicide poor girl because of being cold shouldered and all that you know what state of affairs ronald demanded why my dear fellow that all of you hated the woman like poison what you did didnt you well theyre on to it all right how do you mean why they kept asking me had i noticed during the evening any coolness between mrs stratton and any of the members of her husbands family had i noticed any bad blood and whats its name did i know that mrs stratton was not persona grata or whatever you call it in this house had i seen a quarrel between mrs stratton and her husband during the evening well ronald said sharply what did you say to that oh i didnt give you away its perfectly all right of course i told them it was all news to me i hadnt noticed anything so far as id seen your brother and she seemed a particularly affectionate couple you all appeared not to be able to do enough for her its quite all right said mr williamson with pride i handed out the dope good and strong i see said roger and the police are still up there any idea what theyre doing williamson oh yes said mr williamson cheerfully theyre still taking photographs theyve been at it all the time with the inspector popping in and out of the sun parlour like a jack in the box trying to do two things at once did you say theyre taking photographs said roger in rather a strained voice thats it theres a professional photographer there from westerford i believe though how they got hold of him on a sunday morning i dont know anyhow theyve got him there taking photographs of the roof and the gallows and heaven knows what from every angle they can think of seemed a bit unnecessary to me i must say but i suppose they think differently keen chaps your police here ronald very said ronald flatly may i suggest said roger elaborately that this room is open to the staircase and williamson has rather a strong voice as he spoke the telephone bell rang ronald disappeared into his study to answer it roger and colin exchanged glances colin peering over his glasses lifted his eyebrows in reply roger shrugged his shoulders both of them looked grave i say said mr williamson seriously i say sheringham yes i say this is really awfully good sherry of ronalds have you tried it you should i wonder where he gets it youve no idea colin have you eh have you ach shut up osbert said colin mr williamson looked surprised but not very hurt ronald appeared at the door of his study sheringham he said can i speak to you for a minute in here of course said roger jumping up he hurried across the hall ronald shut the study door roger did not bother to disguise his anxiety more bad news he asked ronald nodded that was my brother on the telephone he says the police have just taken enas body away from the house theyre taking her to the mortuary i say this is serious isnt it it might be look here ronald get your brother on the telephone again and ask him to lunch here at once never mind if he turns up late its the best excuse for having him up here and tell him to answer no questions from anyone until ive seen him yes i will thanks davids a bit what does it mean roger that the police arent satisfied i suppose goodness only knows why not but that must be what it means that theyve got some sort of a bee in their bonnets a bee said roger unhappily a hive the lunch gong brought the women downstairs fortunately the continued presence of the police in the house was looked upon by them as part of the normal procedure so that while lunch could hardly be called a cheerful meal there was at any rate no spirit of general apprehension halfway through it david arrived very haggard and curt and his presence naturally added a further constraint to the gathering immediately the meal was over roger made a sign to ronald who said a low word to david and carried him off coming back at once he said to roger hes in my study shall i come along no said roger and went off to the study alone he had been debating during the lunch how exactly to convey his warning to david without appearing to know everything and yet without minimizing the danger the compromise on which he had decided had the weakness of all compromises but it was the best one he could find look here stratton he said without beating about the bush you know what this means of course taking your wifes body off to the mortuary and messing about on the roof as the police have been doing it means that theyre not satisfied that your wifes death was quite so uncomplicated as it looked at first im not in their confidence so i dont know what their trouble is but at a guess it might be that there was last night some special motive some particular incident or scene such as a quarrel which led to her taking her life and which has not yet been disclosed now whether there was anything of the sort i dont know and i dont want to know any more than i want to know the exact details of her last moments but if there was and it comes to light theres bound to be a great deal of mud slinging over the case and that i do want to prevent for all our sakes so id like to impress on you that its essential for you of all of us to have a perfectly simple story for the police which can easily be supported elsewhere so that they can understand that you didnt follow your wife up onto the roof when she ran out of the ballroom and quarrel with her there or anything like that you understand that dont you well thats perfectly simple david said shortly i wait a minute let me tell you i know you didnt go up there because i was with you myself for at least ten minutes at the bar you remember we were talking about the test matches and the absurd fuss the australians made because haye bowled at their leg stumps instead of their off stumps im your alibi for that time then colin nicolson joined us and i strolled up onto the roof for a minute or two myself where i may say i saw no sign of your wife who must have been in the sun parlour why asked david curtly why roger repeated yes why must she have been in the sun parlour it was ten minutes or more that was plenty of time for her to have done it of course said roger hurriedly he had completely forgotten that his very first theory had exonerated david because of those ten minutes of course that was davids best defence the doctors report as to the time of death must be firmly taken for granted it had been clever of david to see that of course he repeated i dont know why i said that she was probably in the sun parlour most likely she had done it already still theres no harm in your having a margin of safety so well just get it exact i left you and you stayed with nicolson another three or four minutes and then said roger with meaning you followed him straight into the ballroom didnt you where your brother no doubt and other people saw you not at once said david obtusely i went down to the bathroom first no you didnt roger retorted with some exasperation you never went near the bathroom you followed nicolson straight into the ballroom in fact you both went together he remembers you did a very faint smile appeared on davids pale face yes thats right i remember now too and if you want to know i went straight up to agatha and asked her to dance because i hadnt been able to dance with her before my wife said david in an expressionless voice didnt like her god knows why exactly shell remember that too and you stayed with her some time of course and after that you were never alone until ronald actually saw you off the premises ronald didnt i yes he did oh all right it all seems very unnecessary said david wearily but i suppose youre right roger snorted leaving the study roger hurried off in search of mrs lefroy he ran her to earth in the drawing room detached her from a group and led her outside the door time was short and he could not mince matters you remember when i took david off to have a drink after his wife had flung herself out of the ballroom well i didnt come back with him colin nicolson did you remember seeing them come in dont you no said mrs lefroy doubtfully i remember david coming and sitting by me but i think that was some time later wasnt it it was exactly thirteen minutes after i took him out but you dont know that what you do know is that you saw him and colin come into the ballroom together and david came straight across and joined you mrs lefroy was a rare woman yes she said at once i remember perfectly bless you said roger wheres ronald ronald was discovered in the study with david they were not talking go home david said roger you mustnt be here too much we dont want to look like a conspiracy whether we are one or not go home and stick to your story and youll be all right david went the police have gone ronald said shall we damn the police said roger theyll be back soon enough yes im afraid so by the way theyve altered the place of the inquest its to be in westerford now not here roger nodded i expected that now listen to me ronald because im going to speak very carefully he repeated the gambit which he had already used on david yes said ronald i understand perfectly but i dont think you do i dont want to any more than that roger said quickly all i want you to do is to look after your own alibi because i havent the time and be ready to swear that you went down to the front door with your brother and saw him out of the house oh my alibis all right ronald said carelessly i never left the ballroom at all from the time ena went out of it till just before david went when i was at the bar with you you didnt said roger so it had been david after all no heaps of people can swear to that but look here roger said ronald anxiously are you quite sure davids is all right is it really cast iron absolutely no not cast iron not so brittle wrought iron ive just said roger with a smile been forging it ah well listen roger ronald said slowly i want to speak carefully to you too i havent said a word to david and he hasnt said a word to me i quite agree with you that its much better not to know anything i can see thats your line and its the right one but i do just want to say this roger that woman utterly deserved well anything she got i know she did roger said not without emotion and thats just why im not knowing anything at all but ill say this ronald everything will be all right sure sure you see after all theres no evidence at all not to say evidence fleeing any more emotion roger hurried off in search of colin the police might be back at any moment and roger wanted everything nice and simple for them when they came colin was smoking his pipe with williamson on the lawn in front of the house roger called him aside and began once more colin after id gone up on the roof last night and left you with david you didnt go back to the ballroom alone david went with you but ive told you already i colin i havent got much time listen david went with you mrs lefroy remembers seeing you both come in together and said roger with emphasis david himself remembers that he went in with you david himself remembers it colin oh said colin slowly yes you were wrong im afraid but the lads perfectly safe so long as you remember just that thing of course i remember we went in together said colin firmly havent i told you so all along then thank goodness thats settled roger mopped his brow and took a breath of relief but roger man what are the police up to do you mean to tell me they smell a rat what were they doing taking photographs on the roof i dont know roger admitted but that appears to be my next job to find out little did i think that the great detective would ever come down to detecting what the official detectives may have detected already well well does it look serious do you think no i dont think so really roger said as they walked back towards the house its alarming of course but i dont see how it can possibly be serious they cant have anything more than the vaguest suspicions and suspicion never even arrested anyone without some kind of evidence too let alone hanged him anyhow if the coasts clear well see if we can make out what theyve been up to the coast was clear and the roof unguarded even the large constable had been withdrawn ah said roger and looked round at a first glance everything seemed exactly the same well i dont know what the deuce they were at unless they really were still worried about that chair said roger and walked towards the gallows hullo he exclaimed in surprise its gone he looked round again undoubtedly the chair was gone three chairs still stood on the roof but exactly as they had stood before the fourth under the gallows had disappeared lets see if its in the sun parlour said roger it was not in the sun parlour well what on earth would they want to take it away for asked colin no less puzzled heaven only knows roger was beginning to feel worried in the way that the inexplicable does worry i cant make it out at all the only importance in the chair to them was its position with regard to the gallows as an object apart from its position i cant see how it could possibly interest them already such a simple act as the carrying away of the chair was beginning to look sinister roger felt perfectly equal to combating the known moves of an opponent but this was an unknown one and how can one combat that ach colin tried to be reassuring theyre just daft trying to be too clever thats all no roger worried no i dont think that can be it they must have had some reason he stared at the roof where the chair had lain suddenly he uttered an exclamation and dropped on his hands and knees to peer intently at that same bit of roof have you found something colin asked eagerly roger blew gently at the ground and then again then he got up and faced colin i know why they took that chair away he said slowly colin im afraid were rather up against it what do you mean man i was wrong when i said they were working just on suspicion with no evidence to back it they have got evidence can you see faint traces of grey powder there thats insufflator powder theyve been trying to take fingerprints off that chair and theyve found that there arent any at all not even enas chapter xii unscrupulous behaviour of a great detective we must keep calm said roger not at all calmly we mustnt lose our heads were in a nasty jam but we must keep calm colin its the devil muttered colin in a distressed voice we must try to work out their moves roger continued a little less wildly so that we can forestall them youre the only person i can talk to freely so youve got to help me im with you all the way roger youd better be said roger grimly because were both of us for it if the truth comes out in a moment of lunacy i put myself in the position of accessory after the fact to shield someone else and you did the same by shielding me i hope you realize that im afraid youre right im an accessory to an accessory at any rate if there is such a position but lets look on the bright side roger things might have been worse if i hadnt wiped those prints of yours off the chair worse for you i mean and possibly worse still for someone else besides me roger retorted the two were sitting in the sun parlour whither they had retired in some alarm after rogers discovery on the roof to talk the thing over roger had spent another five minutes crawling about on his hands and knees round the gallows to see whether anything else was to be read from the surface of the roof but beyond one or two burnt matchstalks had found nothing he had explained to colin that the police would have done exactly the same thing and equally it was to be presumed found no scratches or other marks on the surface of the asphalt to indicate that anything in the nature of a struggle had taken place there though whether they might have found anything else of a removable nature could not be said roger relit his pipe and continued considerably calmer unlike many people roger found argument soothing yes thats quite true colin he said if you hadnt wiped off my prints what would they have found that officious inspector was going to test the chair for prints in any case hed have found mine and presumably those of the person who carried all the chairs onto the roof and probably several others as well but he wouldnt have found ena strattons which he was looking for and that might have made things more awkward even than they are now i wonder by the way roger added vaguely how the particular chair of the four which i chose happened to get where it was right in the middle of the fairway it was the one of course which you knocked over i didnt knock it over colin contradicted it nearly knocked me over it was lying on its side thats why i didnt see it lying on its side just about halfway between the gallows and the door into the house roger meditated it might have been there of course when i was standing just outside the door earlier but if so i dont remember noticing it and it certainly wasnt there at the beginning of the evening when ronald took me up to show me his gallows because we walked abreast straight across from the door somebody must have put it there later i wonder if that has any significance well there was a chair missing from the picture colin pointed out exactly could the murderer have been going towards the gallows with it intending to complete the picture and then been alarmed or distracted and dropped it there to make his escape that sounds feasible enough roger yes but its so easy to think of a feasible explanation of a fact without knowing in the least whether its the right one and probably without realizing how many other feasible explanations of the same fact there may be that was the trouble with the old fashioned detective story said roger somewhat didactically one deduction only was drawn from each fact and it was invariably the right deduction the great detectives of the past certainly had luck in real life one can draw a hundred plausible deductions from one fact and theyre all equally wrong however weve no time to bother with that now you were talking about the chair colin reminded him yes its odd that it should have been there but i cant see that it has any real bearing on the actual crime though if my explanation is right the police would have found the murderers prints on it though not ena strattons im sorry by the way to keep on using that term for the poor fellow who retorted on her at last in the only possible way but there doesnt seem to be another executioner is too formal david said colin carefully actually admitted it to you oh no he didnt try and i wouldnt have let him if he had it just went tacitly by default but ronald did ronald told you he and david had done it no no ronald apparently had no hand in it he doesnt appear to be in the least worried about his alibi but he knows david did it he told me with some care that david hasnt said a word to him or he to david but he knows all right and i should imagine that david knows he knows but ronald and i took some time in explaining elaborately to each other that neither of us does know anything and doesnt intend to so thats all quite satisfactory and the police dont know no thats our great consolation and thats what weve got to build on lets try to reconstruct their ideas they cant possibly know even that murder has been committed at all let alone who did it they may remotely suspect but all they actually know is that there has been some hanky panky going on some interested party wiped that chair clear of fingerprints and not just the back but the sides and seat and everything you did wipe the seat didnt you i polished the blessed seat groaned colin dont be unhappy its a very good thing you did dont you see that with a wooden seat like that not only fingerprints but traces of footprints would be looked for the suicide theory involves mrs stratton having stood on a chair well with modern methods of detection it would be perfectly simple to establish whether anyone had or had not stepped recently onto the seat of that chair from this roof the surface of the asphalt is covered with flint quite a large amount of it would be carried up onto the seat of the chair and pressed firmly into the varnish and even into the wood by the weight of the person the knocking over the chair would displace some but not all and the traces of what had been displaced would be quite visible a microscopic examination of the seat would tell all this as clearly as ive told it to you and im not at all sure added roger uneasily that a microscopic examination even after the polishing you gave it wont show that mrs stratton didnt stand on it at all its marvellous how accurate these expert witnesses are still as you can understand much better that you did polish than that you shouldnt have done well come thats something said colin but he sounded more than a little uneasy too so what do we come to then the police know that someone has been tinkering with that chair with or without a criminal motive and they may be pretty certain that mrs stratton never stood on it at all if they are then undoubtedly there is going to be the devil to pay because that proves murder but even then looking on the hopeful side to prove murder isnt to prove a murderer and though there certainly would be a nasty pother and a great deal of unpleasantness all round im not at all sure that davids neck would ever be seriously in danger even if the police were quite quite sure hed done it theres so little real evidence in the case at all that they would have an exceedingly difficult job to prove it however thats the worst that can happen and it may not so lets leave that possibility out of the reckoning just now and concentrate on what is quite certain well all thats really certain so far i think is that the police feel that there is cause for further investigation theyve made photographic records of the appearance of the roof and theyre retaining all of us here in case they want to question us further thats all quite normal and not so very formidable after all im glad to hear it said colin but what i dont quite like is the removal of the body to the mortuary it was inevitable if the police werent satisfied but it means a postmortem and goodness knows what that may reveal but hang it all man the cause of death must be obvious enough oh the cause of death yes but thats not all theyll look for theres the question of bruises you see i didnt ask chalmers last night whether hed looked for any bruises on the body but i dont imagine he did or mitchell in a perfectly straightforward case they probably wouldnt but now of course the man who does the pm will and that may prove a little awkward but why might there be bruises on the body well consider how it must have been done i dont suppose mrs stratton was persuaded quite peaceably to put her neck in the noose while david gave her a friendly hoist do you how it was actually effected i cant say and no doubt a certain amount of guile was employed as far as possible but there must have been some kind of a last second struggle not a long one because so far as we know she never screamed and i think she would have been heard if she did i wonder said roger thoughtfully how the devil the man did succeed in getting it done so quietly and so quickly he cant have been more than three or four minutes over it at the most so far as i can work out the times though it is a little doubtful just when he got back into the ballroom you always say colin remarked tentatively that the psychology of the murderer is a great help in reconstructing a crime couldnt that apply too to the psychology of the victim thats a very shrewd observation colin said roger with enthusiasm and it interests me particularly because it reminds me of a remark i made last night about ena stratton which sounded very profound but which i thought as soon as id made it might not bear very much examination perhaps it was deeper than i suspected in fact colin i believe i made it to you do you remember my saying that something or other i forget now what was significant not only of everything that had happened to mrs stratton so far but of anything that might happen to her in the future yes i do remember i wondered at the time what the deuce you meant to tell you the truth so did i but i must have meant something surely you cant call to mind what the occasion was i suppose yes i do it was her exhibitionism ah was it i said her exhibitionism was significant of anything that might happen to her in the future and what did happen was that she got murdered well could her exhibitionism have been responsible for that i dont quite see how it was the time she climbed on that beam can you get anything out of that suppose she climbed up on the gallows and wee david swarmed up after her roger laughed thats taking me a trifle too literally but its a possible idea for all that thats the trouble any extravagant idea in that line is possible with mrs stratton but im afraid that if your theory were right and david had slipped the noose over her head on top of the gallows instead of underneath them her neck would have been broken and theres no question of that she died from strangulation all right the rope was much thicker and suffer than the ordinary hangmans rope and the excoriations on her palms show that she tried to clutch at it so she probably died more slowly but her own movements would tighten the noose round her neck in a fairly short time still you may not be so wide of the mark colin its certain if we accept that there was no more than a very short struggle as i think we can that some kind of ruse was employed and ive no doubt that mrs stratton herself and possibly her exhibitionism dictated the ruses nature still thats beside the point the trouble is that there must have been some violence used if only at the last second and violence always leaves traces and if there are such traces the suspicion of the police will be confirmed the inquest will be adjourned tomorrow after just a formal opening for further evidence and therell be the devil and all to pay hells bells observed colin gloomily so what said roger are we going to do about it what roger did about it first of all was to go downstairs and ask ronald to find out for him when the post mortem was to be performed and what doctor was going to perform it ronald rang through to chalmers and learned that it was to be carried out that afternoon by a doctor from westerford named bryce and that both chalmers and mitchell were to be present half a minute said roger and took over the receiver is that you chalmers sheringham speaking oh yes came dr chalmerss pleasant tones this man bryce hes a good man quite an elderly man with a good deal of experience a little odd isnt it roger said cautiously a little odd i mean the police wanting a pm in such a very straightforward case oh i dont think so really they usually do here coroner fussy oh no but the police havent much to do you know and that makes them keener when they do get anything i see you think thats all there is to it oh im quite sure theres nothing more said dr chalmers most reassuringly roger handed over the receiver to ronald ask him to ring you up as soon as the post mortems over and tell you its findings he said even if it is a bit unofficial i expect he will ronald put forward the request then he nodded to roger to intimate that dr chalmers had agreed to do so roger sidled out of the room with the noiseless shuffle to which one feels driven when another person is telephoning it appeared to him that nothing further could be done until the result of the post mortem was known he wandered slowly out into the garden the inaction irked him for he was more worried even than he had let colin see that thoughtless action in adding the one detail which ena strattons murderer had stupidly overlooked might have unpleasantly serious consequences roger was not thinking so much of possible punishment as of the effect on his hobby if things did reach the point when he had to admit what he had done the confidence of the police would be lost to him for ever never would he be allowed to go officially detecting again and yet he could not regret the action better that roger sheringham should be in the permanent black books of scotland yard than that david should suffer what blind justice would certainly order him to suffer for an act of almost insane desperation but if roger could prevent it things would not reach that point and the really important thing was to prevent the inquest from being adjourned an adjourned inquest in such circumstances would mean the ears of every pressman in the kingdom cocked to high heaven inevitably mud would be slung reputations spotted and the whole childish joke of the party twisted to fit the most preposterous insinuations the party and all those who had attended it would be news of the yellowest description if it could possibly be done that must be stopped but how time was so infernally short the police had somehow got to be convinced that very day that there was no ground for further inquiry that the case really was as simple as it had looked at first and with that damning chair in their possession roger did not see how on earth he was going to convince them of anything of the sort besides the trouble was that he himself for all he knew might be suspect it would only be justice and not merely poetic justice at that if he were he tried to remember what his attitude to the police had been and theirs to him had he for instance appeared too partisan that morning in dismissing the position of the chair as of no importance and yet the irritating thing was that it had been of no importance none at all had he tried to lead the inspector too obviously last night roger mounted the steps that led to the raised walk round the rose garden his hands sunk in his pockets his head dropped in thought yes the attitude of the police towards him had altered last night the inspector had been delighted to meet him only too eager to ask his advice and listen to his suggestions this morning on the roof rogers suggestions had plainly failed to convince him later when the scenes with which he was so familiar were being enacted he had not even been consulted at all more it might be that he had been purposely excluded the arrival of the police at the back door and the injunction to the maid to say nothing to the master of the house about it might have been aimed more at roger than at ronald it was not nice to feel suspect roger who had chased so many quarries with gusto felt horrid little cold finger taps up and down his spine at the idea of being a quarry himself was it possible that the police suspected him even of the actual murder he must not get morbid but was it and if so and the fact of his having handled that chair did come out together with the fact that he had been on the roof alone during the crucial time well colin had put up a very nasty case against him last night how would that case sound in open court from the dock no it was ridiculous he was roger sheringham but still hullo mr sheringham said a voice at his elbow ive been watching you pace round like a lion in a cage im sorry to disturb the reverie but im simply dying to know what its about mrs lefroy was sunning herself in a little arbour let into the rambler walk then i shant tell you said roger recovering himself not without difficulty you brought my heart into my mouth and nearly out through the top of my head you really mustnt speak suddenly like that to people in the dock for murder were you in the dock for murder mrs lefroy asked curiously i was im not thank goodness now he seated himself on the bench beside her the presence of mrs lefroy was right obviously there was not the least use in brooding do you mind talking to me he said carefully about about pancakes yes pancakes pancakes are very soothing things pancakes mrs lefroy repeated rather dubiously im not sure that i know much about pancakes but i can tell you how to cook a chicken a la toulousaine tell me said roger eagerly at a quarter to four ronald stratton on rogers impatient instigation rang up dr chalmers no the doctor was not yet back roger possessed himself somehow for twenty five minutes but certainly not in patience and they started at three he groaned oh ring up again ronald ronald rang up again this time he was more lucky dr chalmers has just come in ask him to speak to me will you mr stratton in the pause ronald beckoned to roger if you put your head close to the receiver youll probably be able to hear too roger nodded and put his head close to the receiver he could actually hear ronalds heart thumping and knew that ronald could probably hear his then came chalmerss voice just as cheerful as ever that you ronald i was just going to ring you up my man yes just got in the pms over oh yes quite simple of course the cause of death was never in doubt no no but what is it my man well did you find anything else bruising on the body or anything like that oh yes the body was rather badly bruised the skin broken on both kneecaps a large contusion on the right hip and another on the right buttock and a bit of a bruise on the back of the head which im afraid we must have overlooked last night otherwise nothing i see said ronald in a dull voice he looked inquiringly at roger who shook his head there was no need to ask anything further that all you wanted to know we shall just send in a formal report in fact the whole thing was nothing but a formality yes well good bye ronald ronald hung up the receiver and looked at roger roger looked at him a bruise on the back of the head roger was thinking then he must have overlooked that too as well as the doctors for he had felt the back of mrs strattons head last night for the exact purpose of finding out if there was any bump or swelling and had detected none it must have been too high up under her hat in any case that explained only too clearly why there had been no struggle or noise david had stunned her roger wondered what with and whether it was now safely concealed david had stunned her and she had slumped down to her knees breaking the skin on the rough surface of the asphalt how the other bruises had been acquired did not matter the one on the back of the head was the damning one so that was how david had done it roger realized that he was still looking at ronald and ronald at him and he was pretty sure that the thoughts which had just been chasing one another through his own mind had equally been chasing themselves through ronalds aloud he said thats a bit of a nuisance yes said ronald dr mitchells house was of cheerfully modern red brick with a small garden in front full of flowering shrubs and a glimpse down one side of a lawn and rose bushes at the back it stood in a pleasant green avenue and roger had had no difficulty in finding it on the instructions ronald had given him he had asked ronald to drop him at the westerford crossroads whence he could make his way to dr mitchells on foot as he considered that it might be unwise for ronald to drive all the way to the house for all anyone knew ronald might now be under police suspicion and he must not appear to be trying to tamper with the medical evidence for that matter so might roger himself but people in westerford could not recognize him as they could ronald and ronalds car he waited for dr mitchell in a somewhat severe room with an official looking desk in one corner of the room and rather incongruously a piano in another why sheringham this is a surprise delighted to see you come into the other room and have some tea dr mitchell no longer jack the ripper but a thoroughly respectable practitioner in a lounge suit was obviously pleased to see him roger however had no time for tea though his conscience felt a little uneasy as he tried to detach the doctor from the young woman waiting in the next room who would certainly be cursing him heartily for the next fifteen minutes thanks very much but im rather in a hurry can you spare me a couple of minutes or are you in the middle of tea not a bit sit down youve not come to consult me professionally surely dr mitchell seated himself at the official looking desk and roger took a convenient chair no at least not exactly i just wanted to ask you one or two questions about mrs stratton oh yes said dr mitchell quite pleasantly but quite noncommittally you may know roger began that ive done a good deal of work at one time and another with the police of course but you dont mean to tell me youre interested in mrs strattons death from that point of view no no what i was going on to say was that having worked so much with the police i know the signs and quite between ourselves im pretty sure said roger frankly that theyre not altogether satisfied about mrs strattons death he had worked out with some care the best way of approaching dr mitchell a slightly worried look appeared on the others face well to tell you the truth sheringham i was a little afraid of that myself i dont know whats in their minds but calling for a postmortem and so on i think i know whats in their minds roger said with a confidential air its this they suspect that something is being kept back from them which the coroner ought to know they think it very odd you see both that mrs stratton should have taken her life at a party where everything ought to have been bright and gay and alcoholic depression put in dr mitchell thats a good point roger said gratefully i was going to suggest it in my report as a contributory cause i suppose said dr mitchell a little uneasily this is all quite between ourselves oh entirely and i think wed better be quite frank as youll understand in a minute so ill say at once that the other thing which the police find curious as the inspector himself told me said roger not altogether accurately is that david stratton should have warned them about suicide so pat before it happened when hed never done such a thing before you knew about that yes i heard that last night but i dont quite see the idea why said roger producing his old ace of trumps they suspect that there was some direct cause for mrs stratton doing what she did beyond just general depression and melancholia and they suspect a conspiracy among all of us to hush it up but what kind of direct cause oh a violent quarrel between herself and some other person probably her husband or a scene of some kind anything like that but we can give evidence that there wasnt if we get the chance roger cried but you know what the procedure is when the police are suspicious the inquest is adjourned for further evidence after just a formal identification of the remains and you know what happens then the newspapers get hold of it dr mitchell nodded i see the point precisely it wasnt the kind of party that anyone will want to advertise seeing that it ended in a real death you can imagine the amount of mud slinging there would be and no one who attended it would escape its to the interest of all of us to see that the inquest is not adjourned tomorrow and that everything passes off smoothly and quickly and i imagine that is to the interest of you and chalmers as much as anyone dr mitchell sighed my dear sheringham if you just knew the ridiculously tiny things which give offence in a doctor yes i should think it is in our interest very well then im working to do that and dispel the police suspicions and i want you to give me all the help you can anything i can do that isnt too unprofessional i certainly will thats good i thought of going to talk it over with chalmers and then i remembered that id had a chat with him last night but not with you besides i know the evidence he is prepared to give on one very important point and i didnt know your opinion chalmers considers that mrs stratton was a suicidal subject do you yes undoubtedly good even though its a stock remark that the people who talk about suicide dont commit it roger ventured that may be true of the normal person but mrs stratton wasnt normal im prepared to back phil up in that too by the way well it was obvious no i think mrs stratton must be excepted from that stock remark she was quite irresponsible and likely to act on any wild impulse well thats quite satisfactory now you agree with chalmers about the time of death i think he puts it at somewhere round about two am within half an hour anyhow of her leaving the ballroom yes its very difficult to say you know especially in the case of sudden death and with the complication of the cold night air but it was certainly within an hour of her leaving the ballroom and quite probably half an hour the sooner said roger airily the better dr mitchell looked interrogative you saw her state of mind when she flung out of the ballroom without giving all the details we can certainly tell the police that she left in a raging fury after working herself up over nothing at all any impulse might have been present in her mind then the longer the time of death is delayed the longer the time for reflection and the less the impulse i see what you mean said dr mitchell slowly yes perhaps an hour was rather an overstatement on my part after all chalmers has been practising longer than i have he may quite probably be right in cutting it down to half an hour as an outside limit it may quite well have happened immediately oh yes quite well good again now another point you made your report to the inspector last night have you made one to the superintendent yet yes i was intending to go down to see him this afternoon but he came to me instead directly after lunch he told me about the post mortem at the same time yes and what did you report to him there was nothing to add really to what pd said to the inspector he asked a good many questions he did did he yes but i had to keep telling him i couldnt give him any more information till after the pm of course now i understand this afternoon you found a good deal of bruising on the body and particularly one place on the back of the head yes we did not a very bad one and it was hidden under the hair just at the back of the scalp though i dont think wed have missed it last night if we hadnt both been so whacked yes roger paused now that he had come to the really crucial part of the interview he was not quite sure how to proceed somehow dr mitchell had got to help him to explain that bruise away and yet he could not even hint to the doctor why but roger was sure that the police would draw precisely the same deduction from it as his own and while the body bruises were damning enough the stunning bruise might be fatal somehow a convincing explanation of that bruise had got to be found must be found before there could be any hope of achieving anything else at all yes he said at last taking the bull by the horns and how do you account for the presence of that bruise on the head mitchell well said dr mitchell bluntly i suppose someone must have given her a knock on it roger looked at him in distress this was about as bad as it could be is that the only possible explanation i mean it looks so much like that quarrel which we know didnt take place he added feebly she must have had a bang on the head to cause a bruise like that dr mitchell pointed out with reason yes but couldnt she have banged it herself oh she could have undoubtedly but do people bang themselves on the back of the scalp i mean on a low doorway or something like that not unless she was going through it backwards surely roger felt he was losing grip he was handicapped by not being able to come out into the open it was impossible to explain that the police suspecting not just a more complicated suicide but something far more serious would almost certainly have been wondering if there might be just such a sign of violence on the back of the head to explain the absence of any indication of a scuffle on the asphalt surface for asphalt marks very easily and if a scuffle had taken place traces of it would undoubtedly remain and here just such a sign was well isnt there any way she could have got it without having it inflicted on her by another person he asked desperately and for that matter the body bruises too dr mitchell looked serious i quite see what you mean sheringham but theres no getting away from it she does look as if shed been knocked about a bit bryce himself said so and hes sure to put it in his report he actually said hullo whos been knocking ena about hell said roger despondently then suddenly he turned on the other a face full of excitement mitchell were the knees of her stockings torn the knees of her stockings i dont believe they were no im sure they werent because one was stuck to her kneecap with a spot of dried blood and there had been no sign before we turned it down why because that explains everything said roger happily all the bruises shall i tell you where she got that mark on the back of her head from the grand piano the grand piano yes in the ballroom good lord what an idiot i am of course her knees couldnt have been bruised on the roof because the asphalt would have torn her stockings but what will break the skin underneath thin silk and yet not injure the silk moderate friction against a polished wood surface in other words we both saw mrs stratton bruising her knees and all the rest of her if we happened to be watching now have you got me that apache dance she did with ronald of course roger beamed at his pupil it is so much better for the pupil himself to voice the obvious conclusion that means that he will take it for granted afterwards that he thought of it for himself without any prompting and consequently he will stick to it like glue by jove roger followed this up and i remember now seeing her get up off the floor once by the piano rubbing her head did you see that no i cant say i did oh yes said roger with enthusiasm who had not seen it either but was determined that mrs lefroy should have and ronald himself and colin she rubbed her head and said oo er that was a nasty bump do it again ronald or something like that you know well thats the explanation undoubtedly agreed dr mitchell equally relieved yes and i suppose added roger with a passing qualm of anxiety that all the bruises are accounted for in the same way oh certainly she came down once or twice very heavily i thought at the time that she must be getting hurt but she seemed to like it precisely and thats another point for the coroners jury theyll be quite ready to believe that a person who liked getting hurt would enjoy the idea of suicide and so for that matter she did well thats most satisfactory did you say something just now by the way about a cup of tea dr mitchell rose with alacrity roger almost danced in again through the front door of the stratton house everything was going splendidly only one snag now remained and that depended not on the police but colin but before even breaking the good news to ronald roger hurried straight upstairs to the empty ballroom and there he did a very regrettable thing closing the door carefully behind him he chose a nice nubbly piece of moulding on the lower edge of the grand piano and going down on his hands and knees rubbed his head carefully against it there is a certain amount of grease on every head of hair and roger contemplated with pleasure the faintly dull patch he had caused on the brilliant shine of the varnish he would have liked a nice black hair to add to it but unfortunately such a thing was not available it would have been unkind roger felt seeing that the police would probably look for it not to gratify them with a nice bit of evidence then he went down to look for ronald and mrs lefroy and tell them what they remembered seeing the questionable ethics of all this simply did not occur to him any more than did the notion that ena stratton might really and truly have banged her head on that grand piano chapter xiii wiping the slate at twenty minutes to six roger no longer losing grip was closeted with colin nicolson in ronalds study with what looked like an uphill job in front of him every other point is cleared up he pleaded every single one theres only that chair left if we can clear that up too theres not only no case left there isnt even any more room for suspicion and you want me to go to the police and admit i wiped the prints off the chair roger yes nothing doing said colin firmly but you must man must nothing i wiped your prints off that chair to save you from getting into a nasty jam roger through your own silly carelessness im not going to put myself in a jam over it instead but dont you see what i see is that you ought to have wiped the prints off yourself so go and tell the police you did you old rascal but i cant wailed roger im too well trained to destroy evidence theyd smell a rat at once if i told them id done such a thing ach rubbish said colin rudely youre afraid to take the blame thats all you think it would put you in bad with the police for the future and so it would well i cant help that you should have thought of that before you interfered no no this is your pigeon roger nothing to do with me at all nothing at all look here colin roger said desperately if you wont own up like a man ill tell the police myself that you did wipe that chair right you are and ill tell them that you moved it but you cant that would give david away and weve got him absolutely covered then you tell them you wiped off the prints yourself roger groaned colin was being excessively scottish but roger could not but admit to himself that colin had reason he had performed an action which roger ought to have performed for himself and he did not see why he and not roger should have the blame nevertheless colin must not be allowed to have reason it looked like finishing roger with the police for ever if he were look here colin if i can think up some excellent reason for you to have done it wont you no i wont roger and thats flat oh blast said roger there was a knock at the door come in called roger morosely mrs lefroys head appeared round the lintel oh mr sheringham ronald asked me to let you know that the police are here again hes upstairs with them in the ballroom thank you no dont run away mrs lefroy come in and see if you can persuade colin to be noble i cant oh colin you will be noble surely dont you try your wiles on me agatha im proof against all that sort of thing im afraid he is mr sheringham what is it you want him to do only tell the truth well that would be a nice change for some of us said mrs lefroy pleasantly i dont think ive ever undertaken to tell so many lies in my life roger looked at her eagerly you wouldnt tell one more would you what would one more be among so many i mean what one in particular roger hesitated mrs lefroy really knew nothing whatever she might think was it wise to let her see how very serious things actually were shut up roger you ass roger took his decision he would have trusted very few women to this extent but mrs lefroy really was different would you say that youd wiped the back of a chair on the roof last night and incidentally the fingerprints off it mrs lefroy when you know perfectly well that you never did anything of the kind ach roger come now you cant ask her to do that do it yourself man is it important mr sheringham one might almost say that its vital and colin wont no but i tell you theres no need agatha roger can say it himself theres no necessity at all for me or you to put ourselves in hot water on his account it isnt on my account roger snapped you know that perfectly well mr sheringham must have some good reason for not saying he did it colin of course i have but colin wont see it the police would be more suspicious than they are already theyd know i would never destroy evidence like that without knowing what i was doing and that would make them do just what i want to prevent them from doing and that is ask themselves just what i was playing at what i want is for someone to come forward and say he did it who might never have realized what an important action it was you understand that surely because colin doesnt ach yes i do but they wouldnt believe that i didnt know what i was doing either i did know jolly well now youre shifting your ground well its true enough anyhow dont quarrel any more you two said mrs lefroy soothingly because ill say it i can quite conveniently because i actually was on the roof last night soon after ena had been found you were roger said in surprise i didnt know yes i was im afraid i didnt tell the inspector so last night because it didnt seem of the least importance but as it happened i wasnt in the ballroom when colin came down to keep us penned in i was anyhow said mrs lefroy i heard a lot of commotion on the stairs so i went straight up to the roof osbert was there and he told me what had happened osberts never mentioned that i dont expect said mrs lefroy that he remembers very much about it but he probably would if i reminded him thats excellent yes so what exactly is it that im to confess to something about a chair did you say its like this mrs lefroy roger explained rapidly you know there was a chair lying under the gallows which mrs stratton must have used for a certain reason which i neednt go into colin gave that chair a polishing with his handkerchief thereby incidentally rubbing off any fingerprints that might have been on it including mrs strattons own the police have discovered that the chair has been wiped and are choosing to put a sinister interpretation on the fact its essential that someone should own up to the wiping laughing heartily and without the faintest notion that the act might be considered a serious one thats what i want you to do well that seems quite easy mrs lefroy said i do like a woman who doesnt ask a lot of unnecessary questions said roger with enthusiasm yes but there seems one rather necessary one why did i do such a thing why indeed roger said thoughtfully yes its essential to have a really good reason and one that will bring in the seat as well as the back added colin yes the seat i do wish by jove ive just remembered something thats a bit of luck what why i was rather worried about that seat wasnt i but its all right i stood on it myself so even if you did polish it a bit thats bound to show and now i come to think of it the polishings all to the good it will have left the traces of slightly gritty feet but it will have destroyed any awkward contrasts between flat heels and high ones yes that is a bit of luck im glad there was some use in what i did colin said drily do you know that im absolutely dying to ask a thousand unnecessary questions mr sheringham said mrs lefroy i should like you to know that because im not going to ask a single one of them ill tell ronald what a magnificent woman you are roger promised he may have some idea but he cant realize fully agathas a grand woman colin agreed but why did she wipe that chair they looked at one another it was very difficult to imagine why mrs lefroy should have wiped the chair it couldnt have had jam on it or anything like that asked mrs lefroy not very hopefully a wee dicky bird suggested colin roger groaned you wiped it so thoroughly he said why should anyone want to wipe a chair thoroughly on a roof because of smuts mrs lefroy said promptly after all my dress was white roger looked at her with admiration then his face fell but you werent going to sit on it for one thing it was on its side for another you wouldnt have been going to sit on that particular chair yes i came over queer and had to sit on the nearest chair if you came over queer you wouldnt have bothered to wipe it besides what did you wipe it with the skirt of your white dress not very convincing im afraid ach agatha never wiped it at all osbert wiped it for her with his handkerchief the man was as tight as a lord he wont know whether he wiped fifty chairs last night or not colin said roger i believe youve hit it but wait a minute did osbert wipe it on its side hadnt he the common politeness to pick it up oh yes said mrs lefroy but i knocked it over again when i got up then why hasnt it got osberts prints on it oh well i picked it up myself before he wiped it and it hasnt got my prints on it because i was wearing my velvet gloves so you were roger said happily and you asked osbert to wipe it because it made a smutty mark on your white velvet glove when you picked it up naturally i did and i was just able to stand up queer though id come over till hed done it and all that fits beautifully because there i was actually on the roof with osbert while you and ronald were with ena downstairs im afraid it was rather morbid of me to go and examine the gallows so soon but there im not ashamed of that this said roger looks to me like a very pretty piece of work well rehearse it once just to make sure that the details are perfect and then well tell osbert now mrs lefroy youre you im osbert and colin isnt there here are the gallows and this is the chair we three have just gone down and youve come up to find osbert in possession hes told you what has happened and youve walked over to the gallows yes heres the rope you see how dreadful murmured mrs lefroy was she really oh osbert i feel horribly faint i must sit down she picked up the chair oh look at my glove have you got a handkerchief osbert just wipe the chair for me will you roger wiped the chair there you are thank you mrs lefroy sat down oh dear no im all right thanks it will pass off in a minute yes im better now but i think ill go down whos going to tell the others oh dear i cant think how they managed these skirts ive knocked the chair over well it doesnt matter wed better go down osbert i must see if i can do anything excellent roger applauded yes that seems perfectly natural colin do you think you could find williamson and lure him here colin nodded and went off to do so dear me said mrs lefroy i suppose this is all quite unprincipled isnt it mr sheringham quite said roger cheerfully mr williamson looked bewildered whats that im upsetting the police what do you mean i havent upset any police eh have i i may be wrong said roger unctuously but i have an idea that youve worried them a little by wiping that chair for mrs lefroy last night you know i think you ought to tell them about it in any case wiping a chair what i never wiped any chair for agatha last night osbert exclaimed mrs lefroy much pained well when did i wipe a chair for you really osbert when i joined you on the roof after theyd taken ena down you must remember remember wiping a chair for you im blest if i do whats it all about eh what do you mean well you remember my coming up on the roof dont you did you yes i believe you did yes i remember and you told me what had happened yes well and i came over rather queer did you did you mrs lefroy turned to roger well it isnt much good if osbert doesnt even remember what he did she said with proper indignation roger looked serious dont you really remember williamson i remember agatha coming up on the roof yes at least vaguely but i dont remember what i did i mean anyhow whats it matter rogers gravity deepened im afraid it may matter quite a lot you see you destroyed some rather important evidence i did how the dickens did i do that mr williamson looked decidedly alarmed roger set about deepening the alarm look here this is rather awkward youd had one over the eight last night you know two over the dozen i should say suggested mrs lefroy offensively i wasnt drunk if thats what you mean mr williamson demurred with indignation no roger said with great emphasis you werent drunk whatever happens the police mustnt get the idea you were drunk if they once get that notion into their heads theyll think we were all drunk then theyll begin talking about drunken orgies in the course of which a death occurs and for all we know the whole lot of us may end up in the dock for manslaughter the devil we might squeaked mr williamson sheringham i say you dont really think that do you i certainly do so the best thing is for you to remember quite clearly what you did last night and then own up to the police like a man after all its quite a simple thing and i dont suppose theyll do more than give you a formal wigging perhaps not even that but look here what did i do asked mr williamson desperately roger told him now do you remember osbert asked mrs lefroy well not altogether said mr williamson unhappily vaguely you know tell me again agatha you asked me if id got a handkerchief mrs lefroy told him again then she told him a third time to make sure then roger told him all over again in the end mr williamson remembered it perfectly for himself roger paused for a few moments outside the ballroom door and frankly eavesdropped from inside came the sounds of a gruff voice followed by ronalds lighter tones evidently an inquisition of some kind was in progress but it was impossible to make out the words of question and answer roger opened the door and went into the room after him sidled a sheepish mr williamson besides ronald and his interlocutor there stood a little apart celia stratton looking distinctly worried and inspector crane looking apologetic ah here is mr sheringham said ronald in tones of unmistakable relief hell bear me out roger if youll excuse me mr stratton interrupted the owner of the gruff voice a larger person running somewhat to girth whom roger instantly and correctly put down as the local superintendent of police if youll excuse me ill ask the gentleman myself mr roger sheringham thats me roger said cheerfully and you of course are superintendent jamieson is the name sir pleased to meet you said the large man without however very much enthusiasm i was asking mr stratton about the quarrel which preceded mrs strattons departure from this room we have already learned from miss stratton said the superintendent sternly with a glance at the obviously distressed celia that such a quarrel took place i should be glad to have your version of it celia exaggerated it ronald said quickly to roger ive told the superintendent mr stratton boomed the superintendent so ferociously that inspector crane looked even more deprecatory than before yes mr sheringham but there was no quarrel roger said blandly the superintendent bent his formidable brows then how do you account for the fact that miss stratton admits that there was a quarrel mr sheringham i didnt admit celia said with spirit you speak as if i were in the witness box i told you perfectly willingly that please miss the superintendent held up a hand like a bread trencher mr sheringham i cant quite see what the confusion is about roger said pleasantly what happened was perfectly simple there was no quarrel and nothing approaching a quarrel mr stratton and mr david stratton and mrs stratton were indulging in a little horseplay when mrs stratton without the slightest warning lost her temper and banged out of the room in a fury there was no time for a quarrel or anything like that umph grunted the superintendent in a disappointed kind of way obviously this information exactly coincided with what he had heard from another source and his disappointment was due to his failure to make more importance of it then why he asked suddenly rounding on ronald did you deny that any unpleasantness had taken place at all damn it superintendent ronald said hotly dont be so beastly offensive if you want me to answer your questions kindly put them with ordinary politeness shut up ronald barked roger noticing with alarm the growing tinge of puce which was overspreading the superintendents already inflamed countenance ive a good mind to ring up major birkett and ask him to come along ronald grumbled roger deduced that major birkett might be the chief constable major birkett has already been communicated with said the superintendent with something of an ominous ring in his voice yes well thats really all that happened superintendent roger said smoothly mrs stratton flew into a raging fury over simply nothing at all and almost threw herself out of the room you can get confirmation of that from anyone who was in here and of course as youve seen its a matter of considerable importance what is a matter of considerable importance mr sheringham why i mean the state of her mind when she went up on the roof thats very suggestive isnt it but thats not really my province added roger cunningly remembering his hints on this matter to dr mitchell you must ask one of the doctors whether that would have been likely to influence her immediate actions thank you sir returned the superintendent shortly as one to say that he knew what he must ask the doctors and what he need not not a pleasant person superintendent jamieson thought roger realizing now who it was that had caused all the trouble roger considered it time to lead the conversation to his objective he strolled over to the inspector by the way inspector he said in a casual voice you were interested this morning in the position of that chair right under the gallows ive been amusing myself by tracing its history if youd still like to hear how that happened roger had purposely addressed the inspector and not the superintendent as if the matter of the chair and everything connected with it were far too insignificant to interest that august person but behind him he could almost hear the superintendent creak as his large body stiffened into attention indeed sir said the inspector eagerly yes i should like to hear that well mrs lefroys skirt caught it when she got up from it and knocked it over you remember she was wearing one of those old fashioned balloon skirts mrs lefroy sat in that chair uttered a slightly stifled voice behind roger she sat in it roger turned round what oh i see what you mean the smuts and her white dress but of course she didnt sit down till after the chair had been wiped the chair had been wiped repeated the superintendent spacing his words with pregnant blanks roger looked surprised you knew that surely he said in tones just scornful enough to stimulate without scourging surely you knew that mr williamson wiped the chair for mrs lefroy the superintendent flung himself round so suddenly that mr williamson leapt back in alarm you wiped that chair he roared y yes i mean well why the devil not retorted mr williamson regaining courage as he found himself still alive eh why shouldnt i you wouldnt want her dress spoilt would you what did she want to sit down at all for because she came over queer replied mr williamson with dignity i mean she felt faint eh why shouldnt she what it was pretty unnerving wasnt it why the dickens shouldnt she feel faint eh said mr williamson aggressively the superintendent turned to his inspector crane go down and bring mrs lefroy up inspector said ronald stratton gently yes mr stratton give mrs lefroy superintendent jamiesons compliments and ask her if she would oblige him by coming up here for a moment roger shook his head it does not pay to irritate the police and now mr williamson said the superintendent grimly having taken no apparent notice of this exchange id be obliged if you would be kind enough to tell me what the blazes you did with that chair thats given us so much trouble trouble said mr williamson with innocent astonishment why trouble whats it got what did you do barked the superintendent rudely mr williamson told his story he told it well roger listening to his pupil with admiration awarded him full marks there is nothing like implicit belief in ones fact to present a convincing result mr williamson had not the faintest doubt of any of his facts his air of mild indignation that anything so ordinary as to wipe a chair for a lady should have given offence to the police could not possibly have been assumed mrs lefroy seconded him with the true art that conceals art whats all the fuss she appealed to celia oughtnt i to have felt faint or what dont ask me said celia im simply lost fingerprints repeated mrs lefroy wonderingly a moment later after another glimpse of the superintendents heart im afraid i never thought of them why should i or footprints oh yes talking of footprints roger put in glibly were you able to verify the presence of grit on the chair seat superintendent or had mr williamson in his zeal for mrs lefroys frock polished all that off too oh he managed to leave a trace or two replied the superintendent grumpily mr williamson summed it all up in a thoroughly dignified manner if i really did anything i shouldnt have done i apologize but i still cant really see what the hell all the troubles about eh it was for roger however to administer the final jab it was a nasty little underhand jab for not only did it wound but it managed to transform what must have been considered by its perpetrator as the keenest efficiency into a miserable piece of bungling i noticed said roger airily that youd had the chair removed and i couldnt imagine why it wasnt until i made inquiries myself and heard how the chair had been wiped that i wondered whether the absence of fingerprints might possibly be worrying you but even then i could hardly believe that it was so or youd have made the same elementary inquiries as i did and found out what had happened i must tell moresby about that at scotland yard hell be amused why superintendent roger added with a light laugh youll be telling me next that you dont know where all the bruising on the body came from the superintendent appeared to have been stricken dumb but inspector crane was able to ask did you anticipate bruising on the body mr sheringham anticipate it what happens when you bang the back of your head against the lower edge of a grand piano roger patted affectionately the piano in question what happens when someone picks you up and throws you violently on the floor do you bruise or dont you especially if you happen to be a woman inspector a last ray of hope lit for an instant the superintendents darkening face whats this there was a struggle of some kind then a struggle said roger with fine disgust no man an apache dance the police had gone finally and roger was shaking his head at ronald stratton in the study as it was sunday evening the party was not changing and the rest were having their cocktails in the drawing room roger however had taken his host down to the study to tell him what he thought of him really ronald you shouldnt have lost your temper with the superintendent you know he chided rather unhappily youve made an enemy of the man now and it simply doesnt do to put the police at enmity especially in such a delicate case as this roger added with meaning i suppose so ronald admitted but i simply couldnt help it i cant stand people trying to bully me tchah said roger you surely dont think it can have done any harm ronald asked i hope not sincerely but the trouble was you see that i had to back you up to a certain extent with the result that i treated the man as an opponent instead of as a possible ally but does that matter i suppose not really yes i suppose everything is all right now you dont sound very certain roger said ronald stratton not without anxiety one never can be quite certain with the police roger replied rubbing it in still i think they havent many doubts left about suicide now at least i dont see how they can have but for all that added roger thoughtfully it wouldnt be a bad idea to strengthen the case for it a little more still if we can as how well just an idea that occurred to me weve got plenty of evidence that mrs stratton was chatting about suicide most of the evening but if the police still are suspicious they may be pleased to consider all our evidence tainted cant you produce something that cant be questioned on that point a letter for instance the record of the written word is so much more convincing you see than the mere report of the spoken one i see the idea ronald nodded but im afraid shes never written to me on those lines but she might have to celia run and ask your sister roger suggested ronald ran no he reported celia hasnt got any letters like that but what about david ring him up and ask him said roger ronald rang up his brother david it transpired could produce nothing but thought that if any such letters existed they might have been written to a certain janet aldersley lives in westerford ronald explained enas particular friend and confidante about the brutality and general iniquities of her unworthy husband get out the car roger said briskly theres half an hour yet before dinner well go and see her right you are agreed ronald impressed miss aldersley lived in a large house on the farther side of westerford ronald was able to arrange an interview with her without disturbing the aldersley parents she was tearful and much impressed by the idea that she might be of help roger explained the object of the visit if you had any such letters he said smoothly it would help to shorten the proceedings at the inquest i fancy and any way in which we can do that will of course help too to lessen the scandal miss aldersley its too dreadful sobbed miss aldersley who was fair and fluffy and of a type to be impressed by her late friends histrionics poor poor ena how could she ever have done such a thing yes but has she ever written to you of it in her letters roger asked patiently oh yes often poor darling but i never thought she would really ever do such a thing oh i shall never forgive myself never do you think i could possibly have prevented it you dont mr sheringham do you roger was tactful and set about obtaining possession of the letters miss aldersley convinced at last that she would only be serving her dead friends best interests by handing them over agreed without much difficulty and went off to find them roger carried them away with him in triumph dont take them to the police he said as he gave them to ronald in the car a minute later i dont trust them take them round to the coroner yourself directly after dinner hell probably be quite glad of the chance of a private word with you too as he knows you personally on such small details roger told himself with some satisfaction is the unassailable case built but calling in on colin that night for a last word before going to bed roger found that a certain uneasiness still remained with him weve got our stories all pat he said sitting on the bed and watching colin brush his hair but we must allow for the unexpected i dont think the police are likely now to ask for an adjournment tomorrow but after ronalds attitude if they have by any remote chance got something up their sleeves for us theyll have been keeping it darker than ever colin looked round from his dressing table but what could they have up their sleeves man goodness knows but i wish now id played that superintendent a little more tactfully ah well we must just sit tight and know nothing thats all if only that david doesnt let us all down chapter xiv inquest on a vile body the coroner shuffled his papers well gentlemen that being so well proceed to hear the evidence mr stratton will you mr david stratton i should have said yes now mr stratton i quite realize that this is a very painful occasion for you very painful indeed you may be sure that we wont trouble you more than necessary but it is my duty to ask you a few questions now let me see yes perhaps the best thing would be for you to tell us exactly what led up to this distressing event yes roger held his breath he need not have been alarmed david gave his evidence clearly and without faltering he spoke in much the same abrupt almost jerky tones as those with which he had first answered the questions of inspector crane but now they appeared nothing but a cloak for nervousness the coroner was as kind to him as possible and led him in a way which roger considered might have given a suspicious superintendent of police some pain after telling his story david was asked a few questions about his own movements but only it seemed with the object of finding out why he had not followed his wife out of the ballroom and whether had he done so shortly afterwards it would not have been possible to avert the tragedy to which david frankly replied that his wife very often behaved in an odd way and he had no anticipation at all that this performance in particular might have serious consequences as for ringing up the police station later he had learned a long time ago from dr chalmers that his wife could not be held to be always strictly accountable for her actions and being worried over her disappearance had thought it best to take this precaution he had never done so before because the occasion had never arisen altogether roger thought admiringly david could not have carried greater conviction had he been innocent yes clucked the elderly little coroner quite so this is very distressing for you mr stratton i know but i am bound to ask you with regard to what you say about your wifes behaviour at times david gave instances shortly and with obvious reluctance mrs stratton had been subject to profound fits of depression she was accustomed occasionally in company to drink for effect though it was impossible to call her a drunkard she often lost her temper over trifles and would then rave and storm in a quite unbalanced way she would worry for days over the most insignificant things and so on when at last david was released roger felt that the worst was over and evidently the police had not asked for an adjournment so perhaps no surprises might be expected after all ronald stratton followed his brother and he too gave nothing away confirming davids account of enas behaviour at the party and her loss of temper over their horseplay which ronald manfully admitted to have been mistaken with so touchy a subject he told of the anxiety about her disappearance which had resulted in the prolonged search and of the finding of the body he spoke with sincerity and frankness and obviously created an excellent impression on the jury questioned by the coroner he not only agreed with davids estimate of the dead womans mental instability but conveyed the impression without actually saying so that david had been loyally minimizing this lack of balance which in reality was a great deal more pronounced than he had suggested he added further examples of her strange behaviour celia stratton confirmed this and added that when staying with david she had frequently been distressed to hear his wife shrieking at him in their bedroom till all hours of the morning like a mad woman like a mad woman repeated the coroner deprecatingly youre sure that isnt too strong an expression miss stratton not in the least celia retorted firmly if youd heard her youd understand she used almost to yowl one might say as if shed completely lost control of herself dear me said the coroner sadly very painful indeed roger privately thought that celia had overdone it a trifle but there was no doubt that the idea must be getting home to the jury that ena stratton had been anything but normal as celia was about to leave the stand the coroner added one more question if you realized that your sister in law was really so seriously unbalanced as this i wonder you did not advise your brother to consult an alienist about her miss stratton but i did celia retorted indignantly of course i did my elder brother and i both wanted him to do so but he said hed already consulted dr chalmers who had advised him that though his wife was unbalanced to some extent it couldnt be considered pronounced enough to warrant sending her to a home just yet though that might come later i see i see hastily agreed the coroner yes we can hear all about that from dr chalmers himself yes roger smiled and blessed the ways of coroners courts in a court of law governed by the rules of evidence celias last statement would not have been allowed even to reach completion and it was a useful one but not perhaps roger reflected for dr chalmers who stood a chance of getting hauled over the coals for negligence roger also noticed with considerable interest that so far not a word had been said about chairs he himself was called next asked to do so he described glibly enough the part he had played in the scene that followed the discovery of the body in consequence of a communication made to me by mr williamson i called mr ronald stratton quietly out of the next room and accompanied him up to the roof followed by mr williamson yes just a moment mr sheringham what was this communication that mr williamson made to you he told me that he had found mrs stratton amplified roger who had thought he had achieved rather nicely the official phraseology he continued his story and i should like to say mr coroner he said unctuously that i take full responsibility for the cutting down of the body before the police arrived of course quite so yes you had naturally to make certain that life was extinct of course yes mr sheringham and then roger went on not a word was said about chairs quite so your experience of which we have all of course heard was of great service we can be sure that everything was done in a perfectly regular and proper manner yes now mr sheringham you have heard the evidence that has been given regarding the state of mrs strattons mind did you yourself notice anything unusual in her behaviour yes my attention had been called to mrs stratton earlier in the evening in consequence of overhearing a remark made by mr williamson to mr ronald stratton roger paused provocatively i think you may tell us what the remark was mr sheringham we are not bound by the strict laws of evidence here you know mr williamson said is your sister in law mad ronald laughter in court ah said the coroner not without a smile himself indeed that is very interesting we will hear from mr williamson himself about that and that caused you to observe mrs stratton closely mr sheringham it did with the result that i considered that mr williamsons question though put in a somewhat exaggerated form was not without foundation what did you see that led you to that conclusion i noticed then that mrs stratton was evidently suffering from a mild form of exhibitionism she wished to be attracting notice all the time roger cited the climbing on the beam and the apache dance a reference to which he had been anxious to make and added a reference to his conversation with mrs stratton on the roof in the course of which she had threatened suicide im afraid however that i attached no importance to this threat i put it down as being part of her general desire to impress are you still of this opinion no i think now that i was mistaken not so much from what did actually happen later as that i believe now that mrs stratton was actually more unbalanced than i suspected and so was ready to carry her mania of being important to still greater lengths you think then that she would even carry it to the length of suicide in sufficiently picturesque circumstances said roger grimly yes i do he was allowed to stand down still not a word about chairs roger was really surprised he had expected without fail a question or two regarding the position of the chair when the body was being cut down or at the very least its presence but the questions had not come his uneasiness began to return were the police keeping something up their sleeves after all concerning that chair mr williamson was the next witness and roger regarded him with an apprehensive eye he had had no time that morning to rehearse mr williamson again in his part and beyond a hurried injunction to refer to mrs lefroy if his memory failed him in any detail of the chair wiping had spoken no more to him about it since the previous evening and it was quite too much to expect that mr williamson also would be allowed to get away with it in silence roger remembered now that mr williamsons reply to this injunction had been a little curious what had he said something about it being all right he had had it out with lilian roger felt still more apprehensive what on earth had mr williamson meant by that roger had been careless in not finding out at once perhaps devastatingly careless had mrs williamson got hold of her husband and undone all the good work by informing him that he had never wiped a chair for mrs lefroy at all but how for that matter could mrs williamson possibly know that he had not in the meantime mr williamsons evidence had been proceeding how did i find the body eh well you see we were all looking and i wondered if anyone had looked on the roof so i went up there and then i found her you see but what called your attention to her i understand that other people had already searched on the roof oh well i dont suppose theyd bumped into her thats what i did you see i bumped into her eh yes and she seemed a bit heavy for a straw figure and that said mr williamson also achieving the correct phraseology aroused my suspicions the coroner took him briefly through the resulting alarm and the attempt to render first aid and then reverting to the question to ronald stratton which mr sheringham had overheard asked mr williamson what had prompted it well id just been talking to her you see said mr williamson uneasily i mean shed just been talking to me and what had been the nature of the conversation why shed been talking about her soul explained mr williamson his slight diffidence giving place to indignation eh popping down double whiskies nineteen to the dozen and talking about her soul and whether it wouldnt be better to put her head in a gas oven and finish it all off what well under cover of the resulting laughter roger who was sitting between ronald stratton and colin whispered to the latter that was a good touch he couldnt have done that better if wed rehearsed him carried conviction lets hope he says his real lesson as well colin whispered back the coroner quelling the laughter indulgently questioned mr williamson further about the conversation and gently underlined the undoubted fact that mrs stratton had been contemplating suicide even before the scene in the ballroom hes made up his mind all right ronald stratton whispered happily to roger i thought he had last night then at last came the series of questions which roger had been awaiting now tell me mr williamson when you went back to guard the roof after the body had been taken downstairs did anyone join you up there yes thats right said mr williamson affably mrs lefroy did yes and what happened what happened well i told her you know and showed her the gallows and the end of the rope and all that yes and then eh oh she came over queer is that what you mean she felt a bit faint i suppose women do sometimes explained mr williamson with kindness yes quite understandable and when mrs lefroy felt faint well she pulled up a chair or something and i wiped it for her with my handkerchief said mr williamson bravely yes why did you do that because she asked me to hadnt any idea i oughtnt to have done it mumbled mr williamson contritely very sorry and all that it didnt occur to you that it was the chair on which mrs stratton might have stood no im afraid it didnt eh never occurred to me im afraid no well perhaps you mustnt be blamed very much for that in the circumstances though its a safe rule not to touch anything at all in the vicinity of any sudden death eh oh i see no yes i mean in any case where was this chair when you saw mrs lefroy pick it up where was it repeated mr williamson vaguely oh somewhere in the middle of the roof you know roger did not alter his position only a slight tightening of the muscles all over his body evidenced the emotion that was filling him he felt as if the eyes of everyone in court were staring at him and not by look or movement must he give himself away colin was less sensitive in a voice which roger shudderingly felt must be raucously audible all over the court he whispered ach the madman thats just torn it mr williamson it seemed had not learned his lesson after all mrs lefroy and celia were sitting together on the other side of the court celia had insisted that it would be unwise for mrs lefroy and ronald to sit together roger now cursed the decision for he was unable to lean across ronald and whisper new instructions all he could do was to try frantically to catch mrs lefroys eye but mrs lefroys eye refused to be caught she was looking intently at mr williamson with an expression of nothing but intelligent interest roger could only hope desperately that the interest was intelligent enough if mrs lefroy did not contradict mr williamsons ghastly blunder and sustain her contradiction then everything must be up with the case for suicide roger hardly heard the few questions which remained for mr williamson to answer though he did notice in a dull way that the coroner not only refrained from any sort of comment regarding the position of the chair but asked nothing more about it at all roger would much rather that he had probed silence was too ominous it could only mean that the coroner had been primed on the point by the police and the inquest would be adjourned after all and yet the odd thing was roger now remembered that the superintendent had not asked mr williamson anything about the position of the chair either all he had appeared to be concerned about yesterday in the ballroom was the wiping of it the position which was far the more important matter had simply not been mentioned what the devil were the police up to and yet roger in all fairness could hardly blame mr williamson it had been impossible to impress on him yesterday that the chair had been lying under the gallows except by inference and more or less casually but roger had mentioned it even if casually so many times that he was sure it had sunk in well it had not sunk in and now everything depended on mrs lefroy she at any rate would have the intelligence to realize what after all had only been hinted to her too mrs lefroy called a voice from somewhere roger held his breath the coroner looked at his notes superintendent jamieson who had a chair just behind him came forward and whispered something in his ear the coroner nodded yes now mrs lefroy will you tell me what happened after mr williamson had shown you where the body had been found mrs lefroy had given very brief confirmation of the main events of the evening but not having spoken once during the whole party to ena stratton had been unable to help in more personal matters yes certainly she said in a calm clear voice and went on to perjure herself gallantly on behalf of her fiances brother it was a great shock to me and i felt very upset i felt faint and wanted to sit down there was a chair lying on the roof near and i picked it up i was wearing white velvet gloves and i saw that the chair had marked them i thought it might be smuts on the roof i was wearing a white satin dress so i asked mr williamson to wipe the chair for me before i sat down on it and he did so i understand now that the chair shouldnt have been touched but i didnt think of that at the time yes you heard no doubt the remark i made to mr williamson on that point it might in a different case be very serious indeed you know yes i see that now agreed mrs lefroy contritely and this chair that you picked up it was lying on its side then yes it was lying on its side on the roof whereabouts on the roof i should think said mrs lefroy brightly somewhere about the middle of the roof oh my heaven groaned roger inwardly to his immortal soul and buried his head in his hands if youre called whispered roger feverishly to colin say the chair was under the gallows when you came up on the roof never mind about the explaining say that i will not colin whispered back and have us all landed for perjury and heaven knows what no i will not mr nicolson came the voice of doom but your efforts at first aid elicited no response no none no and then i went down to keep the women in the ball room so that they shouldnt see the body as mr stratton and mr sheringham carried it downstairs yes exactly an admirable precaution now when you went up to the roof mr nicolson did you notice a chair lying there yes where was it it was about in a line between the gallows and the door onto the roof but perhaps rather nearer the gallows than the door i see did anything in particular cause you to look at it or did you just casually notice it i didnt notice it at first i stumbled over it thats how i remember it being there oh indeed you stumbled over it yes as a matter of fact i barked my shin on it really is that so perhaps you would show me the place im a medical man myself you know and oh but its nothing colin came round the table and solemnly pulled up his trouser leg the coroner as solemnly examined the slight scar thus displayed i see yes nothing very serious as you say still its advisable always to treat a wound with proper care however slight it may appear yes this chair then how far would you estimate its distance from the gallows about twelve to fifteen feet at last the coroner came out in the open was it too far in your opinion from the gallows for mrs stratton to have kicked it there when she er if she launched herself into eternity yes thank you mr nicolson that is all eh whats that what the doctors want yes very well very well ill take the medical evidence next dr let me see yes dr chalmers first please colin sat down again quite calmly next to roger i suppose you know roger whispered savagely that youve hanged david stratton nothing more nor less than hanged him the evidence of all three doctors was flawless dr chalmers and dr mitchell both agreed that death must have taken place very soon after mrs stratton left the ballroom perhaps within a few minutes almost certainly not more than half an hour dr bryce had no doubt at all that the bruises on the body could have been caused and he appeared to take it for granted that they had been caused by the very violent apache dance in which he understood mrs stratton had indulged with mr ronald stratton it was quite evident to roger listening moodily that the three doctors had had a conference last night at which the ideas he himself had been at pains to plant in the mind of dr mitchell had borne unanimous fruit lovely words and phrases such as ego mania alcoholic depression acute melancholia suicidal subject post mortem staining filled the admiring courtroom mrs stratton had been as mad as a hatter and the doctors did not hesitate to say so unfortunately however they were equally firmly agreed that it would have been totally impossible to certify her or put her under restraint in any way except with her own consent and mad though she had been she had not been as mad as that not a single awkward note marred the excellent doctors discourse but roger found small solace in his foresight little good all that was now when williamson mrs lefroy and colin between them had taken his beautiful case for suicide and torn it into little shreds under his nose well he had done his best for david stratton the man had deserved a second chance and roger had given him one anything that happened now must be his own responsibility the coroner was mumbling something one more witness before we go on to the police evidence with which i shall conclude this inquiry mrs yes mrs williamson please roger looked up he had not expected mrs williamson to be called she had played so small a part in the proceedings what could they want her for just confirmatory evidence about the party no doubt though goodness knew they had had enough of that one would have thought already i do not propose to ask you any questions about the earlier part of the evening mrs williamson i think we are quite clear on that i want you to tell the jury just one thing did you go up on mr strattons roof at a certain time that night yes roger stiffened my heavens he thought appalled she saw him do it what time was that just after dr chalmers and dr mitchell had gone roger looked at colin what on earth he whispered colin shrugged his shoulders yes that would be just about an hour after mrs stratten had left the ballroom would it not i think so yes yes did you go up for any particular reason no i just wanted to get away from people for a bit i wanted to be alone in the night air yes yes of course very understandable now will you explain very carefully what you did on the roof mrs williamson if you please roger and colin again exchanged glances of surprise i stood for a minute or two enjoying the cool air and then i climbed up the ladder onto the upper roof i yes just one minute please mrs williamson i think i had better explain to you gentlemen we shall get it in evidence later from superintendent jamieson but i think i had better explain to you now that mr strattons roof is rather a peculiar one apart from the large flat portion with which we have been concerned so far there is another and smaller flat part formed by roofing in the space between two gables which run across the end of the large flat portion there is a small flight of iron steps fixed close to the door out onto the roof by which access to this upper part may be obtained and it is that staircase to which the witness is referring yes mrs williamson i climbed up the staircase onto the upper roof and stood there for a moment or two looking at the lights of london in the distance which i could just see from there the night was so beautiful that i thought i would take a chair up there and sit for a few minutes alone i didnt wish to be disturbed and i thought no one would be likely to find me up there i went down the stairs again to get a chair and saw one lying under the gallows i picked it up and was on my way back to the staircase when i heard my husband calling so i put the chair down and went in again yes do you remember where you put the chair down it must have been between the gallows and the iron staircase but i dont remember exactly where the iron staircase being next to the door into the house the point is gentlemen that we have to establish that the chair which we have heard from three witnesses was lying in the middle of the roof was actually the chair which mrs williamson tells us she moved from underneath the gallows and that explains why it was not in that position later yes mrs williamson you say that you put the chair down did you put it down carefully or did you drop it i put it down carelessly and i heard it fall over behind me but i didnt wait to pick it up exactly now we know from the medical evidence that mrs stratton must have been dead when you picked the chair up from close beside her you did not realize that no said mrs williamson with an unfeigned shudder you did not in fact know then that she was missing at all no you said that the chair was lying under the gallows can you amplify that at all was it under one beam of the gallows for instance no so far as i remember it was just about under the middle of the triangle in your opinion could mrs stratton have thrust it there in the event of her having made use of it for the purpose of hanging herself oh yes easily thank you mrs williamson that is all roger was clutching colins arm in a frenzied hold colin do you realize it was suicide she did do it after all he whispered excitedly under the hum which accompanied mrs williamson back to her seat weve had all our trouble for nothing i never did believe it was that poor wee david returned colin stolidly the verdict never actually had been in question the coroners summing up was brief and kind missing an opportunity which would have brought joy to many of his tribe he did not find it his duty to deliver a lecture to ronald stratton on the morbid compliment which that gentleman had thought fit to pay his distinguished guest though he did feel bound to point out that the matter of suggestion on an unbalanced impressionable mind could not be disregarded having got that off his chest he proceeded to sum up the evidence in such a way as to indicate his own opinion quite unmistakably and suggest that in such a simple case any other opinion was impossible as indeed on the evidence that had been heard it was the mentality of the dead woman only underlined the obvious conclusion after all gentlemen the coroner concluded all you have to do is to satisfy yourselves first as to whether mrs stratton died from the effects of strangulation and if so whether that was brought about entirely by her own unaided effort if you are satisfied on those two points there is practically speaking only one verdict you can return the jury returned it chapter xv last glimpses roger and colin were walking back from westerford to sedge park for lunch there would have been room for them in the williamsons car but after a short but fervent conversation outside the courtroom roger had decided that he had a great deal of emotion to walk off he had also decided that colin should help him to walk it off she told the police yesterday morning roger was declaiming happened to go up on the roof to see what that husband of hers had been up to and told the superintendent himself but did she think of saying a word about it to me oh dear no why the dickens should she colin asked reasonably roger however was in no mood for reason well she might at least have mentioned it to ronald or somebody didnt think it was of the slightest importance my religious aunt come now roger dont take it to heart yes but think what terrible bloomers we might have made it was only by the grace of heaven that i didnt speak up this morning and burst out with the chair being under the gallows all the time we were cutting the body down i should certainly have said so if id been asked then youd have committed perjury colin pointed out with equanimity no i shouldnt hows that because i didnt take any oath as you or anyone else could have seen if youd been using your eyes nor it may interest you to know did mrs lefroy ach dont quibble man it isnt a quibble still we neednt go into that now the point is that if lilian williamson had only mentioned that one enormous fact ronald wouldnt have thought his brother a murderer i should have been spared a great deal of unnecessary work and many consciences would have been saved some nasty hard knocks not yours at any rate roger you cant knock something that isnt there and it was suicide after all well im glad really and whats more the police have known it perfectly well ever since yesterday morning yes and all their fuss was simply due to your wiping of that chair which we see now to have been as unnecessary as it was officious the less you say about my reason for wiping the chair the better i did catch you napping that time at any rate roger yes you did roger admitted handsomely almost as badly as i thought id caught my supposed murderer but my goodness for real officiousness commend me to that inspector fancy wanting to play about with insufflators in such a proved case of suicide just like a child with a toy i see now by the way that when ronald and i were on the roof the next morning and he was pretending to be so worried about the position of the chair that was just a blind hed put the insufflator over it already and of course had gone all excited about the result and wanted to hold us off till hed told the grim news to his superintendent who realized that though the cause of death might not be really in doubt thered been some hanky panky and meant to get to the bottom of it exactly and proceeded to give us all a man size dose of alarm and despondency well i suppose he thought it was his duty so he did its lucky said colin thoughtfully that i didnt listen to you when you wanted me to say the chair was under the gallows from the beginning as it turns out roger said coldly it is and its lucky that all that rigmarole you made up about agatha coming over queer and osbert doing the sir walter raleigh act with his handkerchief didnt lead to something pretty serious roger no doubt now said roger still more coldly it is and its lucky colin meditated further that osbert had the sense to mention it to lilian in their bedroom last night and get the muddle straightened out and speak of it to mrs lefroy this morning so that she was able to make her version square with theirs agathas a grand woman she saw the point at once and i suppose its lucky said roger quite frigidly that none of them thought of mentioning it to me colin considered this well that did prevent any further complications didnt it roger he looked hopefully at his companion but roger had frozen himself into an arctic silence in any case there was not much that he could say in the drawing room celia stratton agatha lefroy and lilian williamson were twittering excitedly my dear i could simply never face it again it was too dreadful came over quite queer i did as soon as i sat down again my dear you were marvellous my dear was my hat really straight it felt as if it had slipped all down over one ear my dear you looked perfectly all right and so terribly composed anyhow thats where your hat ought to have been my dear did i sound the most ghastly idiot my dear you were wonderful did i my dear you my dear in the study ronald and david stratton were lapping up a much needed glass of sherry well cheer oh david cheer oh thank goodness thats over yes feeling ok top hole everything in the garden lovely absolutely well thank heaven its all settled and no doubt about suicide after all after all i believe sheringham had some kind of cockeyed idea at one time that youd done it done what strung ena up i wondered if youd gathered oh thats what he was driving at i did wonder he was going all out to do the noble and save you from the gallows decent of him if he really thought that dam silly idea though oh i dont know id often thought of something like that but i should never have had the guts well she saved you the trouble have another spot thanks i will cheer oh three cheers in the garden mr williamson wrestled with a problem in ethics could a fellow be said to have committed perjury when he had sworn in perfect good faith to a thing which he couldnt remember but which someone else had remembered for him or couldnt he mr williamson was quite worried about it in his surgery dr chalmers took down the jar of chloroform water and filled up the medicine bottle in his hand it was annoying that the coroner should have kept them hanging about so long on just the day that his dispenser was away with a bad cold it had put him badly behindhand with his list well the inquest had all gone off very nicely dr chalmers had never anticipated that it might not but it was pleasant to have got it over the post mortem had been rather horrible but that could not be helped well it had been a good job neatly done dr chalmers had never for one moment regretted it but he was a little surprised that he should not have had a single qualm either of conscience or alarm he had always understood that murderers went slinking about the place starting violently when anyone addressed them dr chalmers on the other hand had only felt rather pleased with himself he would never have thought himself capable of such an admirable deed and found some satisfaction in the knowledge that he had been but of course there had never been the faintest risk he replaced the stopper in the chloroform water jar and put the jar back on the shelf corked and labelled the medicine bottle and wrapped it up neatly in a piece of white paper phil came a long suffering voice from down the passage hullo arent you coming in to lunch today at all coming dear dr chalmers went in to lunch of which he proceeded to partake with a hearty appetite dr chalmers was not an imaginative man at half past six that evening mike armstrong presented himself in the tiny sitting room of margot strattons tiny flat in bloomsbury hullo darling said margot with enthusiasm hullo had a good day not bad i brought an evening paper theres a paragraph about the inquest on ena oh let me see it where mike armstrong indicated the paragraph margot read it quickly through suicide during temporary insanity well thats all right she said with obvious relief not so much of the temporary no margot dropped the paper onto her knees and stared at her fiance that means its all finished yes theyre quite satisfied i mean theyre sure it was suicide well obviously youre certain they wont be making any further inquiries shouldnt think so why should they margot did not answer directly instead she said darling i didnt tell you but i nearly died when that man came round here last night that inspector bloke why he said it was only a routine inquiry theyre bound to interview all the people who were there i know but i was afraid hed want me to give evidence today well there wasnt any evidence you could give that wasnt covered already by other peoples wasnt there what do you mean darling if i dont tell someone ill burst you can keep a secret cant you i hope so yes i know you can well ena didnt commit suicide at all what you see i know she didnt how do you know will you swear never to breathe a word of this to anyone yes well phil chalmers tried to kill her what i happen to know he did how why because she was going to split to the kp about ronald and agatha and because shes been giving david such a hell of a time lately but how do you know all this darling darling ill tell you you know when i was looking for you just before the chalmers went home well i went up on the roof yes darling you will keep quiet about this wont you of course well i stood just outside the door and called at first i thought there was no one there then i heard someone saying margot in a choky sort of voice i looked round and still couldnt see anyone and then i saw ena at least i didnt recognize her at first but it was ena my dear where do you think she was cant imagine my dear hanging on the rope actually hanging there what said mike incredulously my dear girl she couldnt possibly have spoken if shed been hanging but she wasnt hanging by her neck shed got hold of the rope above her head and pulled herself up to take the weight off her neck she was clinging on the rope my dear it sounds awful to say it but she really was just like a monkey on a string good lord i started running towards her of course but she called out to me still in the choky voice to bring the chair i looked round and there was a chair lying on the roof close to the door so i took that with me and put it underneath her and she let herself down onto it well im blessed thats what i was nearly dying about when that man was here you see i thought someone must remember how she was able to pull herself up onto that beam in the drawing room and see that of course she could pull herself up on the rope too but luckily no one seems to have thought of it good lord well what happened well she stood there with the rope still round her neck puffing and panting for a bit and then she began to let fly let fly my dear she was simply livid with rage i mean i suppose she was frightened too but mostly it was rage the things she was going to do apparently we were all in it ronald david agatha celia everyone quite apart from phil she seemed to think thered been a regular conspiracy to kill her and phil had been sent up to do it anyhow she was going to ring up the police that instant and give phil in charge for attempted murder and stop ronald and agatha getting married and make david wish hed never been born and heaven only knew what not else my dear in a way of course it was terribly funny though she wouldnt have seen that of course i mean the way she was standing there breathing out fire and slaughter with the rope still round her neck she was far too frenzied to do more than loosen it a bit or else she thought she made a fine impressive picture like that the lamb and the slaughter you know but i cant think how she hadnt choked already before she could catch hold of the rope at all oh well you see it was rather thick and stiff she said something about that something about her fine brother in law having made a miscalculation and if the rope hadnt been too thick to make a quickly running noose shed have been a dead woman already well what happened then well i stood it for a bit till i began to feel damned sorry id come along at all david had been rather pouring his heart out to me you see during the charades and heaven knows i hated the woman enough before that for myself besides id like to do ronald a good turn and it would have been a jolly good turn if id gone straight down again instead of giving her that chair to stand on she said herself she couldnt have lasted for another half minute so so i cut into the tirade and said she must be talking nonsense phil would never have done such a thing that made her more angry still and she said that phil jolly well had done such a thing shed been talking to him and hed dared her to stand on the chair and put her head in the noose and when she did it he just pulled the chair away from underneath her and now she was going down to ring up the police and give him in charge for attempted murder and that would be that so yes margot hesitated i like phil dont you yes hes a good sort yes and darling you would love me whatever you knew id done wouldnt you i expect so sure you would positive what did you do margot coughed in a rather deprecatory way well darling she said simply i pulled the chair away again
