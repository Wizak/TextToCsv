prologue california it was a long way for a man to travel not only the miles from san diego to the cliffs outside of monterey felipe thought but the years so many years once he had been young enough to walk confidently along the rocks to climb even to race defying the fates celebrating the rush of wind the crash of waves the dizzying heights the rocks had bloomed for him in spring once there had been flowers to pick for seraphina then and he could remember with the clear vision of age looking back to youth how she had laughed and clutched the tough little wildflowers to her breast as if they were precious roses plucked from a welltended bush his eyes were weak now and his limbs were frail but not his memory a strong vital memory in an old body was his penance whatever joy he had found in his life had been tainted always with the sound of seraphinas laughter with the trust in her dark eyes with her young uncompromising love in the more than forty years since he had lost her and the pan of himself that was innocence he had learned to accept his own failings he had been a coward running from battle rather than facing the horrors of war hiding among the dead rather than lifting a sword but he had been young and such things had to be forgiven in the young he had allowed his friends and family to believe him dead slain like a warrior even a hero it had been shame and pride that caused him to do so small things pride and shame life was made up of so many small blocks but he could never forget that it was that shame and that pride that cost seraphina her life weary he sat on a rock to listen to listen to the roar of water battling rock far below to listen to the piercing cry of gulls the rush of wind through winter grass and the air was chilled as he closed his eyes and opened his heart to listen for seraphina she would always be young a lovely darkeyed girl who had never had the chance to grow old as he was old now she hadnt waited but in despair and grief had thrown herself into the sea for love of him he thought now for reckless youth that hadnt lived long enough to know that nothing lasts forever believing him dead she had died hurling herself and her future onto the rocks he had mourned her god knew he had mourned her but he hadnt been able to follow her into the sea instead he had traveled south given up his name and his home and made new ones he had found love again not the sweet first blush of love that he had had with seraphina but something solid and strong built on those small blocks of trust and understanding and on needs both quiet and violent and he had done his best he had children and grandchildren he had a life with all the joys and sorrows that make a man he had survived to love a woman to raise a family to plant gardens he was content with what had grown from him but he had never forgotten the girl he had loved and killed he had never forgotten their dream of a future or the sweet innocent way she had given herself to him when they had loved in secret both of them so young so fresh they dreamed of the life they would have together the home they would build with her dowry the children they would make but war came and he left her to prove himself a man and proved himself a coward instead she had hidden her bride gift the symbol of hope that a young girl treasures to keep it out of american hands felipe had no doubt where she had hidden it he had understood his seraphina her logic her sentiment her strengths and weaknesses though it had meant that he was penniless when he left monterey he had not taken the gold and jewels seraphina had secreted now with the dreams of age that had turned his hair to silver that had dimmed his eyes and lived in his aching bones he prayed that it would be found one day by lovers or dreamers if god was just he would allow seraphina to choose whatever the church preached felipe refused to believe god would condemn a grieving child for the sin of suicide no she would be as he had left her more than forty years ago on these very cliffs forever young and beautiful and full of hope he knew he would not return to this place his time of penance was almost at an end he hoped when he saw his seraphina again she would smile at him and forgive a young mans foolish pride he rose bending in the wind leaning on his cane to keep his feet under him and left the cliffs to seraphina there was a storm brewing marching across the sea a summer storm full of power and light and wild wind in that eerie luminescent light laura templeton sat content on the rock summer storms were the best they would have to go in soon back to templeton house but for now she and her two closest friends would wait and watch she was sixteen a delicately built girl with quiet gray eyes and bright blond hair and as full of energy as any storm i wish we could get in the car and drive right into it margo sullivan laughed the wind was fitful and growing stronger right into it not with you behind the wheel kate powell sneered youve only had your license a week and you already have a rep as a lunatic youre just jealous because itll be months before you can drive because it was true kate shrugged her short black hair fluttered in the wind she took a deep gulp of air loving the way it thickened and churned at least im saving up for a car instead of cutting out pictures of ferraris and jaguars if youre going to dream margo said frowning at a minute chip in the coral polish on her nails dream big ill have a ferrari one day or a porsche or whatever i want her summerblue eyes narrowed with determination i wont settle for some secondhand junker like you would laura let them argue she could have defused the sniping but she understood it was simply part of the friendship and she didnt care about cars not that she didnt enjoy the spiffy little convertible her parents had given her for her sixteenth birthday but one car was the same as another to her she realized it was easier in her position she was the daughter of thomas and susan templeton of the templeton hotel empire her home loomed on the hill behind her stunning under the churning gray sky it was more than the stone and wood and glass that composed it more than the turrets and balconies and lush gardens more than the fleet of servants who kept it shining it was home but she had been raised to understand the responsibilities of privilege within her was a great love of beauty and symmetry and a kindness aligned with that was a need to live up to templeton standards to deserve all shed been given by birthright not only the wealth which even at sixteen she understood but also the love of her family her friends she knew margo always fretted at limitations though they had grown up together at templeton house as close as sisters margo was the daughter of the housekeeper kate had come to templeton house when her parents had been killed an eightyearold orphan she was cherished absorbed into the family as much a part of the templetons as laura and her older brother josh laura and margo and kate were as close as perhaps closer than sisters who shared blood but laura never forgot that the templeton responsibility was hers and one day she thought she would fall in love marry and have children she would carry on the templeton tradition the man who came for her who swept her up in his arms who made her belong to him would be everything shed ever wanted together they would build a life create a home carve out a future as polished and perfect as templeton house as she pictured it dreams budded in her heart delicate color bloomed on her cheeks while the wind tossed her blond curls around them lauras dreaming again margo commented her grin flashed transforming her striking face to stunning got seraphina on the brain again kate asked hmm no she hadnt been thinking of seraphina but she did now i wonder how often she came here dreaming of the life she wanted with felipe she died in a storm like the one thats coming i know she did margo lifted her face to the sky with lightning flashing the wind howling suicides drama enough by itself kate plucked a wildflower twirled the stubby stem between her fingers if it had been a perfect day with blue skies and sunshine the results would have been the same i wonder what it is to feel that lost laura murmured if we ever find her dowry we should build a shrine or something to remember her by im spending my share on clothes jewelry and travel margo stretched her arms up tucked them behind her head and itll be gone in a year less kate predicted im going to invest mine in blue chips boring predictable kate margo turned her head smiled at laura what about you what will you do when we find it and we will find it one day i dont know what would her mother do she wondered her father i dont know she repeated ill have to wait and see she looked back toward the sea where the curtain of rain was inching closer thats what seraphina didnt do she didnt wait and see and the sound of the rising wind was like a woman weeping lightning jagged a flashing pitchfork of brilliant white through the heavy sky the blasting boom of answering thunder shook the air laura threw back her head and smiled here it comes she thought the power the danger the glory she wanted it deep inside her most secret heart she wanted it all then came the squeal of brakes the angry pulse of gritty rock and roll and an impatient shout jesus christ are you all nuts joshua templeton leaned out of his car window scowling at the trio get the hell in the car its not raining yet laura stood she eyed josh first he was her senior by four years and at the moment he looked so much like their father at his crankiest that she wanted to laugh but shed seen who was in the car with him she wasnt certain how she knew that michael fury was as dangerous as any summer storm but she was sure of it it was more than ann sullivans mutterings about hoods and troublemakers though to be sure margos mother had definite opinions on this particular friend of joshs maybe it was because his dark hair was just a little too long and too wild or because of the little white scar just above his left eyebrow which josh said michael had gotten in a fight maybe it was his looks for they were dark and dangerous and just a little mean like a greedy angels she thought as her heart fluttered uncomfortably grinning all the way to hell but she thought it was his eyes so startlingly blue they were in that face so intense and direct and intrusive when he looked at her no she didnt like the way he looked at her get in the damn car impatience shimmered around josh in waves mom had a fit when she realized you were out here one of you gets hit by lightning itll be my ass and its such a cute one margo added always ready to flirt hoping to make josh jealous she opened the door on michaels side itll be a tight fit mind if i sit on your lap michael his gaze shifted from laura he grinned at margo a quick flash of teeth in a tanned hollowcheeked face make yourself at home sugar his voice was deep a little rough and he accepted the weight of a willing female with practiced ease i didnt know you were back michael kate slipped into the backseat where she thought sourly there was plenty of room for three on leave he flicked a glance at her then looked back at laura who still hesitated at the car door i ship out again in a couple days the merchant marine margo toyed with his hair it sounds so dangerous and exciting do you have a woman in every port im working on it as the first fat drops of rain splatted the windshield he raised a brow at laura want to sit on my lap too sugar dignity was something else shed learned at an early age not sparing him a reply laura got into the backseat with kate the minute the door was closed josh sent the car streaking across the road and up the hill toward home when her eyes met michaels in the rearview mirror laura deliberately looked away then back back toward the cliffs and her place of comfortable dreams chapter one contents prev next on the day of her eighteenth birthday laura was in love she knew she was lucky to be so certain of her feelings and her future and the man who would share them both with her his name was peter ridgeway and he was everything she had ever dreamed of he was tall and handsome with golden good looks and a charming smile he was a man who understood beauty and music and the responsibilities of career since he had been promoted in the templeton organization and transferred to the california branch he had courted her in a fashion designed to win her romantic heart there had been roses delivered in glossy white boxes quiet dinners at restaurants with flickering candlelight endless conversations about art and literature and silent looks that said so much more than words they had taken walks in the garden in the moonlight long drives along the coast her fall into love had not taken long yet it had been a gentle tumble with no scrapes or bruises very much she thought like sliding slowly down a silklined tunnel into waiting arms perhaps at twentyseven he was a bit older than her parents might have liked and she a bit younger but he was so flawless so perfect laura couldnt see how the years could matter no boy of her own age had peter ridgeways polish his knowledge or his quiet patience and she was so much in love he had hinted at marriage gently she understood that this was to give her time to consider if only she knew how to let him know she had already considered already decided he was the man she would spend her life with but a man like peter laura thought needed to be the one to make the moves the decisions there was time she assured herself all the time in the world and tonight at the party to celebrate her eighteenth birthday he would be there she would dance with him and in the pale blue dress shed chosen because it matched his eyes she would feel like a princess more she would feel like a woman she dressed slowly wanting to savor every moment of preparation it was all going to be different now she thought her room had been the same when shed opened her eyes that morning the walls were still papered with those tiny pink rosebuds that had grown there for so many years the winter sunlight still tilted through her windows filtering through lacy curtains as it had done on so many other january mornings but everything was different because she was different she studied her room with a womans eyes now she appreciated the elegant lines of the mahogany bureau the glossy chippendale that had been her grandmothers she touched the pretty silver grooming set a birthday gift from margo studied the colorful frivolous perfume bottles shed begun to collect in adolescence there was the bed she had slept in dreamed in since childhood the high fourposter again chippendale with its fanciful canopy of breton lace the terrace doors that led to her balcony were open to invite the sounds and scents of evening inside the window seat where she could curl up and dream about the cliffs was cozy with pillows a fire burned sedately in the hearth of rosegrained marble atop the mantel were silverframed photos the delicate silver candlesticks with the slim white tapers she loved to burn at night and the dresden bud vase that held the single white rose peter had sent that morning there was the desk where she had studied all the way through high school where she would continue to study through what was left of her senior year odd she mused tracing a hand over it she didnt feel like a high school student she felt so much older than her contemporaries so much wiser so much more sure of where she was going this was the room of her childhood she thought of her youth and of her heart as templeton house was the home of her heart though she knew she would never love any place as much she was prepared even eager to build a new home with the man she loved at last she turned and looked at herself in the cheval glass and smiled shed been right about the dress she decided simple clean lines suited her small frame the scoop neckline the long tapered sleeves the straight column that skimmed down to flirt with her ankles the effect was classic dignified and perfect for a woman who met peter ridgeways standards she might have preferred that her hair be straight and flowing but since it insisted on curling frivolously shed swept it up it added maturity she thought she would never be bold and sexy like margo or casually intriguing like kate so she would settle for mature and dignified after all those were qualities that peter found appealing she so badly wanted to be perfect for him tonight especially tonight reverently she picked up the earrings that had been her parents birthday gift the diamonds and sapphires winked flirtatiously back at her she was smiling at them when her door burst open i am not putting that crap all over my face flushed and flustered kate continued her argument with margo as both of them strode inside you have enough on yours for both of us you said laura would be the judge margo reminded her then stopped with an experts eye she studied her friend you look fabulous dignified sex really are you sure the idea of being sexy was so thrilling laura turned back to the mirror all she saw was herself a small young woman with anxious gray eyes and hair that wouldnt quite stay in place absolutely every guy at the party is going to want you and be afraid to ask kate snorted and plopped onto lauras bed they wont be afraid to ask you pal youre a prime example of truth in advertising margo merely smirked and ran a hand over her hip the lipstickred dress dipped teasingly low at the bodice and clung to every generous curve if youve got it which you dont flaunt it which is why you need the blusher the eye shadow the mascara the oh christ she looks lovely margo always the peacemaker laura stepped between them she smiled at kate spread out on the bed her angular frame intriguing in thin white wool that covered her from throat to ankle like a wood nymph she laughed when kate groaned but you could use a little more color see triumphant margo whipped out her makeup bag sit up and let a master do her work i was counting on you complaining all the way kate suffered the indignity of margos brushes and tubes im only doing this because its your birthday and i appreciate it its going to be a clear night margo busily defined kates cheekbones the bands already setting up and the kitchens in chaos mums rushing around fussing with the floral arrangements as though its a royal reception i should go help laura began youre the guest of honor kate kept her eyes closed in selfdefense as margo dusted shadow on her lids aunt susie has everything under control including uncle tommy hes outside playing the sax laughing laura sat on the bed beside kate he always said his secret fantasy was to play tenor sax in some smoky club hed have played for a while margo said as she carefully smudged liner under kates big doe eyes then the templeton would have come out and hed have bought the club ladies josh loitered in the doorway a small florists box in his hands i dont mean to interrupt a female ritual but as everyones slightly insane im playing delivery boy the way he looked in his tux shot heat straight through margos loins she sent him a sultry look whats your usual tip never draw to an inside straight he struggled not to let his gaze dip to her cleavage and cursed every man who would be offered a glimpse of those milky white curves looks like more flowers for the birthday girl thanks laura rose to take the box and kissed him thats my tip you look wonderful he caught her hand grown up im starting to miss my annoying little sister ill do my best to annoy you as often as possible she opened the box sighed and forgot everything else from peter she murmured josh set his teeth it wouldnt be fair to say that she was already annoying him in her choice of men some guys think single roses are classy id rather have dozens margo stated and her eyes met joshs in perfect agreement and understanding its lovely laura murmured as she slipped it into the vase with its mate just like the one he sent this morning by nine templeton house was overflowing with people and sound groups of guests spilled out of brightly lit rooms onto heated terraces others wandered the gardens strolling down bricked paths to admire the blooms and the fountains all lit by the white ball of a winters moon and the charm of fairy lights margo had been right the night was clear a black sky stabbed by countless diamondbright stars under it templeton house stood awash in lights the music pulsed inviting couples to dance huge tables elegantly clad in white linen groaned under the weight of food prepared by a fleet of caterers waiters trained by templeton hotels standards wandered discreetly among the guests carrying silver trays filled with flutes of champagne and tiny delicacies for sampling half a dozen open bars were set up to serve mixed or soft drinks steam rose off the swimming pool in misty fingers while dozens of white water lilies floated on the surface on terraces under silky awnings over the lawns dozens of tables were draped in white linen centered with a trio of white tapers ringed by glossy gardenias indoors there were more waiters more food more music more flowers for those who wanted the warmth and relative quiet two uniformed maids upstairs stood ready to assist any lady who might wish to freshen up or fix a hem no reception ever held at any templeton hotel around the world was more carefully planned or executed than the celebration of laura templetons eighteenth birthday she would never forget that night the way the lights flashed and glowed the way the music seemed to fill the air mating with the scent of flowers she knew her duties and she chatted and danced with friends of her parents and with her contemporaries though she wanted only peter she mixed and mingled as was expected of her when she danced with her father she pressed her cheek against his its a wonderful party thank you he sighed realizing she smelled like a woman soft elegant part of me wishes you were still three years old bouncing on my knee thomas drew her back to smile at her he was a striking man his bronzed hair lightly touched with silver the eyes he had passed on to both of his children crinkled at the corners with life and laughter youve grown up on me laura i couldnt help it she smiled back at him no i suppose you couldnt now im standing here aware that a dozen young men are aiming arrows at my back hoping ill keel over so they can dance with you id rather dance with you than anyone but when peter glided by with susan templeton thomas saw his daughters eyes go soft and dreamy how could he have predicted he thought when he brought the man out to california that ridgeway would take his little girl away when the music ended thomas had to admire the smooth skill with which peter changed partners and circled away with laura you shouldnt look at the man as though youd like to flog him tommy susan murmured shes just a girl she knows what she wants shes always seemed to know she sighed herself apparently its peter ridgeway thomas looked into his wifes eyes they were wise always had been wise she might be small and delicateframed like her daughter and perhaps she gave the illusion of fragility but he knew just how strong she was what do you think of him hes competent she said slowly hes well bred well mannered god knows hes attractive her soft mouth hardened and i wish he was a thousand miles away from her thats a mother talking she admitted one whos afraid shes losing her little girl we could transfer him to europe he warmed to the idea no tokyo or sydney laughing she patted her husbands cheek the way laura looks at him shed follow him better to keep him close struggling to accept she shrugged her shoulders she could have fallen for one of joshs wilder friends or a gigolo a fortune hunter an excon he laughed himself laura never susan merely raised an eyebrow a man wouldnt understand she knew romantic natures like lauras most usually were drawn to the wild well tommy well just have to see where it goes and be there for her arent you going to dance with me margo slid into joshs arms fit there before he had a chance to agree or evade or would you rather just stand there brooding i wasnt brooding i was thinking youre worried about laura even as her fingers skimmed flirtatiously up the nape of his neck margo shot a concerned glance toward laura shes mad for him and bound and determined to marry him shes too young to be thinking of marriage shes been thinking of marriage since she was four margo muttered now shes found what she thinks is the man of her dreams no ones going to stop her i could kill him josh considered then we could hide the body she chuckled smiled into his eyes kate and i would be happy to help you toss his lifeless corpse off the cliffs but hell josh maybe hes right for her hes attentive intelligent apparently patient in certain hormonal areas dont start that joshs eyes went dark i dont want to think about it rest assured your little sister will walk down the aisle when the time comes in blushingbride white she blew out a breath wondering why any woman would consider marrying a man before she knew if he was her mate in bed they have a lot in common really and who are two jaded cynics like us to judge we love her josh said simply yeah we do but things change and before much longer were all going to be moving in our own directions youve already started she pointed out mister harvard law and kates chafing at the bit for college laura for marriage what are you chafing for duchess everything and then some her smile turned sultry she might have pushed the flirtation a bit farther but kate swung up and pried them apart sexual rituals later she muttered look theyre going off she scowled in lauras direction watching her walk away hand in hand with peter maybe we should go after them do something such as but understanding margo draped an arm over kates narrow shoulders whatever it wont make any difference im not going to stand around and watch then disgusted kate peered up at josh lets go sit in the south garden for a while josh can steal us some champagne youre under age he said primly right like youve never done it before she smiled winningly just a glass each to toast laura maybe itll bring her luck and what she wants one glass then margo frowned noting the way he scanned the crowd looking for cops no i thought michael might show after all mick kate angled her head i thought he was down in central america or somewhere playing soldier of fortune he is was josh corrected hes back at least for a while i was hoping hed take me up on the invitation then he shrugged hes not much for this kind of thing one glass he repeated tapping a finger on kates nose and you didnt get it from me of course not after tucking her arm through margos kate wandered toward the gaily lighted gardens we might as well drink to her if we cant stop her well drink to her margo agreed and well be there whatever happens so many stars laura breathed in the night as she and peter walked across the gently sloping lawn i cant imagine a more perfect evening much more perfect now that i have a moment alone with you flushing she smiled at him im sorry ive been so busy ive hardly had a moment to talk with you be alone with you you have duties i understand a templeton would never neglect her guests not ordinarily no but it is my birthday her hand felt so warm and sheltered in his she wished they could walk forever down to the cliffs so she could share that most intimate place with him i should have some leeway then lets take advantage of that he guided her toward the fanciful white shape of the gazebo from there the sounds of the party became muted background and the moonlight filtered through the latticelike lace scents from the flowers perfumed the air it was precisely the setting hed wanted oldfashioned and romantic like the woman he intended to have drawing her into his arms he kissed her she came so willingly he thought so innocently that lovely mouth parting for his those delicate arms winding around him it stirred him this youth combined with dignity eagerness flushed with innocence he could have her he knew he had the skill and the experience but he was a man who prided himself on control and he drew her gently back he wouldnt soil the perfection or rush into the physical he wanted his wife untouched even by himself i havent told you enough how lovely you look tonight thank you she treasured those warm liquid pulls of anticipation i wanted to for you he smiled and held her tenderly letting her head rest against his heart she was so perfect for him he thought young lovely well bred malleable through the slats he spotted margo flashy in her clinging red dress laughing bawdily at some joke even though his glands stirred his sensibilities were offended the housekeepers daughter every mans wet dream his gaze shifted to kate the prickly ward with more brains than style it amazed him that laura felt this childish attachment for those two but he was sure it would fade in time she was after all sensible with a dignity admirable in one so young once she fully understood her place in society and her place with him she could be gently weaned from inappropriate attachments he had no doubt she was in love with him she had so little experience in coyness or deception her parents might not completely approve but he was confident that their devotion to their daughter would sway them in his favor they would find no fault with him personally or professionally he was certain he did his job and did it well he would make a suitable soninlaw with laura beside him with the templeton name he would have everything he wanted everything he deserved the proper wife the unshakable position in society sons wealth and success we havent known each other long he began it feels like forever over her head he smiled she was so sweetly romantic only a few months laura and im nearly ten years older than you are she only pressed closer what does it matter i should give you more time god youre still in high school only for a few more months her heart beat wildly with anticipation as she lifted her head im not a child peter no youre not i know what i want ive always known he believed her and he also knew what he wanted had always known that too he mused they had in common still i told myself i would wait he brought her hands to his lips watched her eyes another year at least she knew this was what she had dreamed of had waited for i dont want you to wait she whispered i love you peter i love you laura too much to wait even another hour much less another year he eased her down onto the padded bench her hands trembled with all her heart she absorbed every aspect of the moment the sound of music in the distance that carried over the clear night air in quiet notes the scent of nightblooming jasmine and hints of the sea the way the shadows and lights played through the sheltering lattice he got down on one knee as shed known he would his face was so beautiful in the delicate dreamy light it broke her heart her eyes were swimming with tears when he took a small blackvelvet box from his pocket opened it the tears made the light that glinted off the diamond refract into rainbows will you marry me laura she knew what every woman felt at this one shining moment of her life and held out her hand yes chapter two contents prev next twelve years later when a woman turned thirty laura supposed it was a time for reflection for taking stock for not only shuddering because middle age was certainly creeping closer and closer around that blind corner but for looking back over her accomplishments she was trying to but the fact was when she awoke that morning in january on her thirtieth birthday to gray skies and unrelenting rain the weather perfectly mirrored her mood she was thirty years old and divorced she had lost the lions share of her personal wealth through her own naiveté and was struggling mightily to fulfill her responsibilities to her family home raise two daughters alone hold down two parttime jobs neither of which she had prepared herself for and still be a templeton crowding the minus side was the failure to hold her marriage together the personal and somewhat embarrassing fact that she had slept with only one man in her life worry that her children were being penalized by her lack and fear that the house of cards she was rebuilding so carefully would tumble at the first brisk wind her life the unrelenting reality of it bore little resemblance to the one she had dreamed of was it any wonder she wanted to huddle in bed and pull the covers over her head instead she prepared to do what she always did get up face the day and try to somehow get through the complicated mess shed made out of her life there were people depending on her before she could toss the covers aside there was a soft knock at the door ann sullivan poked her head in first then smiled happy birthday miss laura the templetons longtime housekeeper stepped inside the room carrying a fully loaded breakfast tray accented with a vase of michaelmas daisies breakfast in bed scrambling to reorganize her schedule which had room for a quick cup of coffee at best laura sat back i feel like a queen it isnt every day a woman turns thirty lauras attempt at a smile wobbled tell me about it now dont you start that nonsense brisk and efficient ann settled the tray over lauras lap shed seen thirty herself and forty and lord help her shed just run smack into fifty and because she understood just how those decades affected a woman she brushed lauras sigh aside she had been fretting after this girl as well as her own and miss kate besides for more than twenty years she knew just how to handle them ann went to rekindle the fire in the hearth not only to chase away the january chill but to add light and cheer youre a beautiful young woman with the best of her life ahead of her and thirty years of it behind her ann methodically pushed the right buttons and nothing to show for it but two beautiful children a thriving business a lovely home and family and friends who adore you ouch laura thought im feeling sorry for myself she tried the smile again pathetic and typical thank you annie this is lovely drink some coffee as the fire caught crackling briskly ann poured the coffee herself then patted lauras hand you know what you need a day off a full day just for yourself to do exactly as you choose it was a fine fantasy and one that not so many years before she would have been able to indulge but now she had the girls to ready for school a morning in her office at templeton monterey and an afternoon at pretenses the shop she and margo and kate had started together then it was a quick dash to take the girls to their dance class time out to go over the bills and to pay them then there was homework to oversee as well as dealing with any and all of the myriad problems her daughters might have encountered during the day and she needed to carve out time to check on old joe the gardener she was worried about him but didnt want him to know it youre not listening miss laura at the faintly censorious tone laura pulled herself back im sorry the girls need to get up for school theyre up as a matter of fact pleased with her surprise ann walked to the door at the signal the room filled with people and noise mama the girls came first rushing in to jump on the bed and rattle plates on the tray at seven and ten they werent babies any longer but she cuddled them just the same kayla the younger was always ready for a hug but allison had been growing distant laura knew the extended embrace from her elder daughter was one of the best gifts she would receive that day annie said we could all come and start your birthday off right kayla bounced her smoky gray eyes bright with excitement and everybodys here so they are with an arm around each girl laura grinned at the crowd margo was already passing her threemonthold son to his grandmother so she could supervise as josh opened a bottle of champagne kate slipped away from her husband to help herself to one of the croissants on lauras tray so how does it feel champ kate asked with her mouth full the big threeoh it was feeling lousy until a minute ago mimosas she raised a brow at margo you betcha and no she said anticipating ali straight oj for you and your sister its a special occasion ali complained so youre going to drink your oj in a champagne flute with a flourish she passed juice to the girls for a toast she added then hooked an arm through her husbands right josh to laura templeton he began a woman of many talents which includes looking pretty great for a kid sister on the morning of her thirtieth birthday and if anyone brought a camera in here laura said pushing back her tumbled hair ill kill them i knew i forgot something kate shook her head then shrugged well lets get to the first gift byron byron de witt kates husband of six weeks and the executive director of templeton california stepped forward he touched his glass lightly to lauras and grinned ms templeton if i see you anywhere on hotel property before midnight tonight ill be forced to pull rank and fire you but i have two accounts i have to not today you dont consider your office closed somehow conventions and special events will have to limp along without you for twentyfour hours i appreciate the thought byron but all right he sighed if you insist on going over my head mr templeton enjoying himself josh joined ranks with byron as executive vice president templeton im ordering you to take the day off and if youve got some idea about going over my head ive already talked to mom and dad theyll be calling you later fine when she discovered she was getting ready to pout she shrugged instead itll give me a chance to nope reading laura well kate shook her head youre not setting foot in the shop today oh come on this is just silly i can lie in bed margo continued walk the cliffs read a book get a facial over the sheets she grabbed lauras foot waggled it pick up a sailor and remembering the girls she backtracked go for a sail mrs williamson is planning an elaborate birthday feast for you tonight to which we have all invited ourselves at that time if youve been a good girl

a contemplative sip of her mimosa all right ill be lazy and if i do something foolish itll be your fault all of you always willing to take the credit margo took j t back as he began to fuss hes wet she discovered and laughing handed him to his father and its your turn josh well be back at seven sharp oh and if you decide on that sailor ill want to hear every detail gotta go kate announced see you tonight they went out as quickly and as noisily as they had come in leaving laura alone with a bottle of champagne and a cooling breakfast she was so lucky she thought as she settled back against the pillows she had family and friends who loved her she had two beautiful daughters and a home she had always called her own then why she wondered as her eyes swam with sudden tears did she feel so useless the trouble with having free time laura decided was that it reminded her of the days when most of her free time had been eaten up by committees some she had joined because she enjoyed them the people the projects the causes others she knew shed involved herself with because of pressure from peter she had for too many years found it easier to bend than to stand and when she had rediscovered her backbone she had also discovered that the man she had married didnt love her or the children it had been the templeton name he had married he had never wanted the life she dreamed of sometime between alis birth and kaylas he dropped even the pretense of loving her still she stuck with it maintained the illusion of marriage and family and the pretense was all hers until the day she walked in on that most pathetic of clichés her husband in bed with another woman thinking of it now laura crossed the beautifully tended lawn strolled through the south gardens and into the grove beside the old stables the rain had subsided to a mist that merged with the swirl of fog crawling along the ground it was she thought like walking through a cool thin river she rarely walked here rarely had time yet she had always loved the play of sunlight or shadow through the trees the scent of the forest the rustling of small animals there had been times during her youth when she imagined it was a fairytale woods and she was the enchanted princess searching for the one true love who would rescue her from the spell cast upon her a harmless fantasy she thought now for a young girl but perhaps she had wanted that fairytale ending too badly believed in it too strongly as she had believed in peter he had crushed her quite literally he had crushed her heart with simple neglect with casual disinterest then he had scattered the pieces that were left with betrayal at last he had eradicated even the dust when he had taken not only her money but the childrens too for that she would never forgive or forget and that laura thought as she wandered a path under an arch of lazily dripping branches made her bitter she wanted to swallow the taste of that bitterness once and for all to get beyond it fully and move ahead perhaps she decided her thirtieth birthday was the time to really begin it made sense didnt it peter had proposed to her on her birthday twelve years before on a starry night she remembered raising her face to the misting rain shed been so sure then so positive that she knew what she wanted what she needed now was the time to reevaluate her marriage was over but her life wasnt in the past two years shed taken quite a few steps to prove that did she mind the work shed taken on to rebuild her life and her personal finances not the work itself she decided stepping over a fallen log and going deeper into the forest her position with templeton hotels was a responsibility a legacy that shed neglected too long she would damn well earn her keep and the shop she smiled to herself as her boots squished on the soggy path she loved pretenses loved working with margo and kate she enjoyed the customers the stock and the sense of accomplishment the three of them had built something there for themselves for each other how could she resent the hours and the effort that she put into raising her girls seeing that they had a happy healthy life they were her heart whatever it took to make up for the loss of the home she had somehow helped break she would try to do kayla she thought her little kayla so resilient so easy to please a loving happy child was kayla but allison poor ali had needed her fathers love so desperately the divorce was hardest on her and nothing laura did seemed to help her adjust she was doing better now laura thought better than she had been during those first months even the first year but she had pulled in and back and was only rarely spontaneous with her affections as she had been and wary of her mother laura thought with a sigh still blaming her mother for a father who had no interest in his daughters laura sat on a stump closed her eyes let the faint breeze that was the music of the forest surround her she would handle it she promised herself she would handle all of it the work the rush the worry the children no one was more surprised than she herself that she was handling it well but how she wondered how in gods name would she continue to handle the loneliness later she snipped deadheads out of the garden did some pruning hauled away the debris old joe simply couldnt keep up any longer and young joe his grandson couldnt afford more than a few hours a week in between his college courses to add his help since it would cut too much into her budget and old joes pride to hire an assistant laura had convinced joe that she wanted to take on some of the gardening tasks it was partially true she had always loved the gardens of templeton house the flowers the shrubs the vines as a child she had often dogged joe nagging him to teach her to show her and he would pull a pack of cherry life savers out of his pocket thumb one out for her and demonstrate the proper way to train a creeper to deal with aphids to prune a tea rose she had adored him his weathered face old even then his slow thoughtful voice his big patient hands he had come to work in the gardens of templeton house as a boy in her grandparents day after sixty years of service he had a right to his pension to spend his days tending his own garden to a life sitting in the sunshine and laura understood it would break his heart if she offered it so she picked up the slack under the guise of wanting a hobby when her schedule allowed and often when it didnt she would stand with joe and discuss perennials and bonemeal and mulch today as afternoon faded to dusk she took stock the gardens of templeton house looked as they should in winter quiet waiting the hardiest blooms splashes of defiant color her parents had given the house into her hands for tending and for cherishing laura did both she stepped out onto the skirt of the pool nodded in approval she maintained the pool herself it was after all her indulgence whatever the weather if she could squeeze in a few laps she did so shed taught her children to swim in that pool as her father had taught her the water sparkled a delicate blue thanks to some of her recent dickering with the pump and filter the mermaid lived beneath a mosaic fantasy of flowing red hair and glossy green tail her girls loved to dive down and touch that smiling serene face even as she had out of habit she checked the glass tables for smudges the cushions of the chairs and lounges for dampness or dust ann would have already done so but laura didnt turn toward the house until she was certain everything was perfect satisfied she walked down the stone path and chose the kitchen door scents assaulted her made her taste buds yearn mrs williamson ample of hip and bosom stood at the stove as she had done for all of lauras memory leg of lamb laura said and sighed apple chutney curried potatoes turning mrs williamson smiled smugly she was well into her seventies her hair was the hard glossy black of a bowling ball and approximately the same shape but her face was soft full of folds and wrinkles and as sweet as her own cream centers your nose is as good as ever miss laura or your memory is its what you always want for your birthday no one roasts a lamb like you mrs williamson because she knew the game laura wandered the spacious kitchen making her poking about obvious i dont see a cake maybe i forgot to bake one laura expressed the expected dismay oh mrs williamson and maybe i didnt she chuckled gestured with her wooden spoon now off you go i cant have you around pestering me while im cooking get yourself cleaned up youre carrying garden dirt yes maam at the kitchen door laura turned back it wouldnt be a black forest cake would it double chocolate just you wait and see scat laura waited until she was well down the hallway before she chuckled it would be a black forest cake mrs williamson might be a tad forgetful these days and her hearing wasnt what it had been but vital matters such as lauras traditional birthday meal would be remembered in every detail she hummed to herself as she climbed the stairs to bathe and change for dinner her mood had lifted but it plummeted quickly when she heard the sounds of a sibling argument in full swing because youre stupid thats why alis voice was shrill and bitter because you dont understand anything and i hate you i am not stupid there were tears trembling on the surface of kaylas retort and i hate you more well this is pleasant determined to lose neither her temper nor her perspective laura paused in the doorway of alls room the tableau seemed innocent enough in a girls pretty mintandwhite room dolls from around the world wearing their countries traditional dress ringed the shelves that flanked the wide window books ranging from sweet valley high to jane eyre filled a case a jewelry box with a twirling ballerina stood open on the dresser her daughters faced each other from either side of the canopy bed like mortal enemies over embattled soil i dont want her in my room her fists clenched ali whirled to face her mother this is my room and i dont want her in it i just came in to show her the picture i drew with trembling lips kayla held it out it was a clever crayon sketch of a firebreathing dragon and a young silverclad knight with a raised sword the natural youthful talent in it reminded laura that she needed to arrange for kayla to have drawing lessons its wonderful kayla she said it was ugly never ashamed of tears kayla let them fall she said it was ugly and stupid and that i had to knock before i came into her room ali dragons arent real and theyre ugly ali thrust her chin out challenging and she cant just come into my room if i dont want her youre entitled to your privacy laura said carefully but youre not entitled to be mean to your sister kayla laura crouched down brushed tears off her daughters cheeks its a wonderful picture we can frame it if you like tears dried up we can absolutely and we can hang it in your room unless youd let me hang it in mine the smile bloomed brilliantly you can have it id like that very much why dont you go back to your room and sign it for me just like a real artist and kayla laura rose kept a hand on kaylas shoulder if ali wants you to knock on her door then thats what youll do mutiny flared briefly then she has to knock on mine too thats fair go on now i want to talk to ali after sending her sister a smug look kayla sailed out she wouldnt leave when i told her to ali began shes always running in here whenever she wants and youre older laura said quietly trying to understand there are privileges that go along with that ali but there are also responsibilities i dont expect the two of you never to fight josh and i fought margo and kate and i fought but you hurt her i just wanted her to go away i wanted to be alone i dont care about her stupid picture of a stupid dragon theres more going on here laura thought studying her daughters miserable face than sibling sniping she sat on the edge of the bed so that her eyes were level with alis tell me whats wrong honey you always take her side laura bit back a sigh thats not true determined she took alis hand pulled her closer and thats not whats bothering you there was a war going on inside this little girl laura realized as she watched alis eyes swim with all her heart laura wanted to find the right way to make peace it doesnt matter it wont make any difference tears came closer to the surface you wont do anything about it it hurt but then this recent distrust from ali always hurt why dont you tell me then well see i cant do anything about it if i dont know what it is theyre going to have a fatherdaughter dinner at school the words burst out full of anger and pain theyre all going to bring their dads oh no peace here laura admitted and touched her daughters cheek im sorry ali thats hard uncle josh will go with you its not the same no its not the same i want it to be the same ali said in a furious whisper why cant you make it be the same i cant there was relief when ali went unresisting into her arms and there was grief why dont you make him come back why dont you do something to make him come back now there was guilt to layer on top of grief theres nothing i can do you dont want him to come back with her eyes bright and hot ali jerked back you told him to go away and you dont want him to come back this was a thin and shaky line to travel your father and i are divorced ali thats not going to change the fact that we cant and dont want to live together anymore doesnt have anything to do with you and kayla then why doesnt he ever come tears poured out again but they were hot now and angry other kids have parents that dont live together but their dads come and they go places together the line got shakier your fathers very busy and hes living in palm springs now lies laura thought pitiful lies im sure once hes more settled hell spend more time with you when did he ever he doesnt come because he doesnt want to see you ali turned away its because of you laura closed her eyes what good would it be to deny it to defend herself and leave her child vulnerable if it is ill do what i can to make it easier for him and for you on legs that werent quite steady laura rose there are things i cant change i cant fix and i cant stop you from blaming me for it fighting to control both grief and temper laura took a slow breath i dont want you to be unhappy ali i love you i love you and kayla more than anything in the world alis shoulders slumped will you ask him if he could come to the dinner its next month on a saturday yes ill ask shame eked through the anger and misery she didnt have to look at her mothers face to know she would see hurt im sorry mama so am i ill tell kayla im sorry too she draws really good and i i cant you have other talents gently laura turned ali around cupped her shoulders you dance so beautifully and you play the piano so much better than i did at your age better than i do now you never play anymore there were a lot of things she didnt do anymore how about a duet tonight well play kayla can sing she sounds like a bullfrog i know and when ali looked up they grinned at each other another crisis averted laura decided as she settled down with her family after dinner there was a cheery fire blazing in the hearth and rich creamy cake to be devoured the curtains in the parlor were opened to a starry night and the lights inside glowed warm birthday presents had been unwrapped opened and admired the baby was sleeping upstairs josh and byron were puffing on cigars and her daughters fences mended for the moment were at the piano kaylas booming frog of a voice competed with alis skillful playing then she went for the chanel bag margo was saying comfortably curled on the sofa as she talked shop it took her more than an hour and she just kept piling up stock three suits an evening gown your white dior laura four pairs of shoes count them four six blouses three sweaters two silk slacks and that was before she started on the jewelry it was a redletter day kate propped her bare feet on the louis xiv coffee table i had a hunch when the woman pulled up in a white stretch limo shed come up from la because a friend of hers had told her about pretenses kate sipped herbal tea hardly missing the punch of coffee im telling you she went on this woman was a pro she said shes buying a country home and shes going to come back and choose some of the furnishings and whatnots from the shop turns out shes the wife of some hotshot producer and shes going to tell all her friends about this clever little secondhand shop in monterey thats wonderful so wonderful laura could almost accept not being in on the kill its making me wonder if we shouldnt think about expanding sooner maybe in la rather than carmel hold it hotshot kate eyed margo narrowly were not talking seriously about another branch until weve been in business two full years then i run some figures do some projections always the accountant margo muttered you bet your ass so what did you do with your day off laura oh a little gardening a little bill paying closet cleaning moping is that jt with a mothers superhearing margo tuned in to the sounds whispering out of the baby monitor beside her id better check on him no let me laura rose quickly please you get to have him all the time i want to play sure but if hes margo trailed off glancing toward the two young girls at the piano i guess you know what to do i think i have a pretty good idea aware that margo might change her mind laura hurried out it was amazing and gratifying to see the way her impulsive glamorous friend had taken to motherhood even two short years before no one would have believed margo sullivan supermodel the rage of europe would be settled down in her hometown running a secondhand shop and raising a family margo certainly wouldnt have believed it herself laura mused but fate had dealt her a tough hand rather than fold and run shed stuck and with determination and flair had turned fate on its ear now she had josh and john thomas and a thriving business she had a home she loved laura hoped that somehow someday she could deal fate the same blow there he is laura cooed as she approached the antique crib that she and ann had hauled out of storage theres the darling oh what a handsome boy you are john thomas templeton truer words were never spoken hed had a rich gene pool to choose from and hed chosen well golden hair grew thick around a glorious little face round with babyhood it was with his mothers stunning blue eyes his fathers wellsculpted mouth his fretful whimpering stopped the moment she lifted him and the feeling one that perhaps only a woman understands soared through her here was baby beginnings beauty there sweetheart were you lonely she walked him as much to pleasure herself as to soothe shed wanted more children she knew it was selfish when she had two such beautiful daughters but oh shed wanted more children now she had a nephew to spoil and she intended to do so lavishly kate and byron would have children laura mused as she laid j t on the changing table there would be more babies to cuddle she changed him powdered him tickled him to make him giggle and kick his legs he grinned at her wrapped a fist around a curl and tugged laura went with the pull to nuzzle his neck bring back memories josh asked as he stepped inside the nursery does it ever when annie and i were putting this room together for his visits we wallowed in memories she lifted j t high over her head where he could gurgle in delight both my babies slept in that crib so did you and i he ran a hand over the curved rungs before moving to his son joshs fingers itched to hold him but he held back allowed laura to cuddle the baby everyone whos been there says it but i cant stop myself the years go so fast josh treasure every second of it you did he touched her hair you are and have been the most incredible mother ive admired you for that youre going to make me sloppy she murmured and buried her face in the sweet curve of jts neck i figure you and i had the best possible examples to follow weve been lucky laura to have people like mom and dad for parents dont i know it i know theyre in the middle of negotiating the construction of the new hotel on bimini but they called today just to wish me happy birthday and dad told the story of how he drove mom through the worst winter storm in the history of central california when she went into labor with you of course she lifted her head and grinned he loves telling that story rain floods mud slides lightning all but an appearance of the angel of doom and the seven plagues of egypt but i got her there josh quoted his father with fortyfive minutes to spare he stroked his sons hair not everybodys as lucky do you remember michael fury images of a dark dangerous man with hot eyes who could forget michael fury yes you used to hang around with him and look for girls and trouble he went into the merchant marines or something he went into a lot of things there were some problems at home an unpleasant divorce well two actually his mother got married for the third time when he was about twentyfive this one seems to have stuck anyway he came back to the area a few weeks ago oh really i didnt know you and michael never ran in the same circles josh said dryly the thing is he took over the old place where he grew up his mother and stepfather relocated in boca and he bought the property from them hes raising horses now horses hmm not terribly interested she began to walk the baby again josh would get to his point eventually she knew sometimes he was such a lawyer caging the meaning with words those storms we had a couple weeks ago oh bad ones she remembered almost as bad as the fateful night of laura templetons birth yeah more mud slides one of them destroyed michaels place oh im sorry she stopped walking and tuned in im really sorry was he hurt no he managed to get himself and his stock out but the house is a loss its going to take some time to rebuild if thats what he wants to do meanwhile hell need temporary lodgings for himself and his horses something he could rent you know for the short term and i was thinking the stables and the grooms apartment above them arent being used alarm came first josh just hear me out i know mom and dad were always a little well wary of him to say the least hes an old friend josh returned and a good one hes also handy no ones done any maintenance or repairs on that building in years not since he broke off cleared his throat not since i sold off the horses laura finished because peter didnt care for them or the amount of time i put in with them the point is the building should be looked after right now its just sitting there empty you could use the rent since you refuse to dip into templeton capital to run this place im not going over that ground again fine he recognized that set to her mouth and didnt bother the rent from a building youre not using would help you out right yes but he held up a hand he would cut through the logic and practicalities first you could use someone around here in the short term to do some heavy work to put the stables back in shape thats something you simply cant do yourself thats true but now josh thought for the clincher and i have an old friend whose home has been washed out from under him id consider it a personal favor low blow she muttered theyre always the most effective knowing hed scored he gave her hair a quick affectionate tug look it should work out for everyone but give it a couple of weeks if its not working ill find an alternative all right but if he starts having drunken poker parties or orgies well try to keep them discreet josh finished and grinned thanks he kissed her and took the baby hes a good man laura one you can count on in tight squeezes laura wrinkled her nose at his back as he carried j t out of the room i dont intend to count on michael fury particularly in a tight squeeze chapter three contents prev next the last place michael fury had expected to take up residence however temporarily was on the great templeton estate oh hed visited there often enough in the past under the subtly watchful eyes of thomas and susan templeton and the not so subtly watchful eye of ann sullivan he was well aware that the templeton housekeeper had considered him a mongrel let loose among her purebreds and he assumed that shed been worried about his intentions toward her daughter she could have rested easy there as lip smackingly gorgeous as margo was and always had been she and michael had never been more than casual friends maybe hed kissed her a couple of times how was a redblooded man supposed to resist that mouth but that had been the beginning and end of it shed been for josh even that long ago and despite the shortsightedness of youth hed realized that michael fury didnt poach on a pal despite their different backgrounds they had been friends real friends michael didnt consider many people real friends he would and had gone to the wall for josh and he knew he could depend on the same still he would never have asked for the favor and would likely have refused it but for his horses he didnt want them boarded any longer than necessary in a public facility hed gotten sentimental over them and he wasnt ashamed of it in the last few years theyd been one of the few constants in his life hed tried a number of things hed drifted he liked to drift joining the merchant marine had been an escape hed reveled in it hed seen a lot of the world and he liked some of it it had been cars for a time he still had an affection for them liked to drive full out hed had some success on the race circuit in europe but it hadnt satisfied him in the long term in between the sea and the cars there had been a brief stint as a mercenary during which hed learned too much about killing and warring for profit and maybe hed been afraid he was too good at it afraid it would satisfy him too well it had fattened his wallet but scarred his heart hed been married once also only briefly and could claim no success from that experience either it was during his stuntman stage that he fell for horses hed learned that craft gained a reputation broken several bones he jumped out of buildings rioted in staged bar fights was shot off roofs set on fire and he tumbled off of countless horses michael fury knew how to take a fall but he wasnt able to roll when he fell in love with horses so he bought them and bred them and trained them he had put down a sick horse and labored through the birth of a foal though he knew the odds were long he thought hed found what hed been looking for it seemed like fate when his stepfather called telling michael that he and michaels mother were going to sell the property in the hills though he had no sentiment for it michael heard himself offering to buy it it was good horse country so hed come back and nature had delivered a hard backhanded slap in welcome he didnt give a good damn about the house but his horses he would have died saving them and hed come dangerously close as those acres of mud tumbled down there he was filthy exhausted alone looking at what had been his next start the oozing rubble of it there had been a time when he would have simply cut his losses and moved on but this time he was sticking now josh had offered him a hand and weighing his pride against his horses michael had accepted as he swung up the drive toward templeton house he hoped he wasnt gambling on the wrong roll of the dice hed always admired the place you couldnt help it so he stopped in the middle of the drive got out and took a long look he stood in the mild winter air a rangy man with an athletes disciplined body a brawlers ready stance he was dressed in black his most usual attire because it saved him from thinking when he reached for clothes the snug black jeans and sweater under a scarred leather bomber jacket gave him the look of a desperado he would have said it wasnt far from the truth his black hair danced in the breeze it was longer than practical sleek and thick by nature when he was working he often pulled it back in a stubby ponytail he hated the barber and would have suffered torments of hell going to what they called a stylist hed forgotten to shave hed meant to but he got involved with the horses the stubble only added to the dangerous appeal of a rawboned face his mouth was surprisingly soft many women could testify to its skill and generosity but whatever softness was there was often overlooked when the observer was pinned by hard eyes the color of ball lightning over them his brows were arched the left one marred by a faint white scar he had others on his body from car wrecks fights his stunt work hed learned to live with them just as he lived with the scars inside as he studied the glinting stone the spearing towers and glinting glass of templeton house he smiled christ what a place he thought a castle for modern royalty here comes michael fury he thought and what the hell are you going to do about it he chuckled to himself as he drove up the winding lane cutting through rolling lawns accented by stately old trees shrubs waiting to burst into bloom he didnt imagine that the reigning princess was too happy about his impending stay josh must have done some fast talking to persuade his proper society sister to open even the stables for the likes of michael fury theyd both get used to it he imagined it wasnt for long and he was sure they could manage to stay out of each others way just as they had in the past for laura carving out this hour in the middle of the day was problematic but necessary she had sent the maid jenny to do what she could about cleaning the grooms apartment above the stables god knew it was a mess of dust and debris and spiderwebs mice laura thought shuddering as she hauled up a bucket of soapy water she couldnt expect the girl to perform miracles and there just hadnt been enough time it hadnt been possible to ask anns help at the mere mention of michael furys name the housekeeper had sniffed and gone stonefaced so laura had decided the final work fell to her she wasnt about to welcome anyone into her home or a part thereof and not have it spic and span an extended lunch hour away from her duties at pretenses a quick change of clothes and now she thought a great deal of elbow grease the state of the bathroom in the apartment had shocked young jenny speechless small wonder with her hair pulled back her sleeves rolled up laura climbed into the tub and began to attack the worst of the grime when her guest tenant whatever the hell he was arrived the following day at least he wouldnt find scum on the tiles as far as the stables themselves went shed decided after one look that they fell into michael furys territory while she worked she rattled through her head for the rest of her days schedule she could get back to pretenses by three close out by sixthirty a quick dash to pick up the girls from piano lessons damn it shed forgotten to look into finding a good drawing instructor for kayla dinner at seventhirty a check to make certain both girls were prepared for whatever tests and assignments were coming up was it spelling for kayla tomorrow or math for ali was it both good god she hated going back to school fractions were killing her puffing a bit as her muscles sang she swiped soap and grit over her cheek she really did have to go over that report on the cosmeticians convention next month she could do that in bed once the girls were down and ali needed new ballet shoes they would see to that tomorrow well thats quite a sight michael stepped into the narrow doorway and was treated to the appealing view of a pretty female butt straining against faded denim a butt that he assumed belonged to some nubile templeton maid if this is among the amenities i should be paying a hell of a lot more rent yelping laura sprang up rapped her head on the shower nozzle and slopped filthy water over her feet it was a tossup as to who was more surprised michael hadnt realized until that moment that hed carried an image of laura in his head perfect perfectly lovely gold and rose and white like a glossy picture of a princess in a book of fairy tales but the woman facing him now eyes huge and darkly gray had wet dirt smeared on her cheeks her hair was a mess and her teaserving hands held a scrub brush he recovered first a man whod lived on the edge had to have quick reflexes and he grinned widely as he leaned on the doorjamb laura templeton that is you in there isnt it i wasnt we werent expecting you until tomorrow ah yes he thought the voice hadnt changed cool cultured quietly sexy i always like to get the lay of the land the front door was wide open i was airing the apartment well then its nice to see you again laura i dont know when ive had someone quite so attractive scrub out my john humiliated knowing her cheeks were hot she nodded as josh probably told you we havent been using the building i wasnt able to spare the staff to put things to rights so quickly it surprised him that she knew which end of a scrub brush was which you dont have to bother for me i can handle it myself now that he took a close look he could also see for himself that she was just as lovely underneath the grime as ever delicate features soft mouth the aristocratic hint of cheekbone and those dreamy stormcolored eyes had he forgotten how small she was five two maybe three and slim as a fairy with hair the color of gold in dim sunlight subtle again with the richness but not the flash she remembered he had often stared just as he was doing now saying nothing just looking looking until she wanted to squirm im sorry about your home hmm he lifted a brow the scarred one drawing her eyes to his oh it was just a house i can always build another i appreciate you providing a place for me and my horses when he offered a hand she took it automatically his was hard rough with calluses and held on to hers even when she tried to slip away his lips curved again you going to stay standing in the tub sugar no she cleared her throat allowed him to help her out ill show you around she began then her eyes went cool when he remained where he was ill show you around she repeated thanks he shifted enjoyed the waft of scent again subtle that she carried with her josh would have told you this was the grooms apartment her voice was clear again the polite hostess its selfsufficient i think full kitchen she gestured toward an alcove off the main room where jenny had dutifully cleaned the white stove the stainless steel sink the simple white countertops thats fine i dont do a lot of cooking josh mentioned that youd lost your furniture so we brought over a few things she waited hands folded at her waist as he wandered about the room the sofa had been in the attic and could have used recovering but it was a good solid duncan phyfe some templeton or guest in the past had scarred the sheridan coffee table with a careless cigarette but it was functional shed added lamps simple brass ones that she felt suited a masculine taste an easy chair other occasional tables even a vase of winter windflowers she was too much the innkeepers daughter not to have put thought and effort into her temporary inn youve gone to some trouble which surprised and humbled him i figured on roughing it for a few months its not exactly templeton paris she unbent enough to smile the bedrooms through there she gestured toward a short corridor its not terribly large but i went with instinct on the bed i know josh likes room to ah she trailed off when michael grinned room she finished so we stuffed a queen size in there we had the iron head and footboards in storage ive always liked them theres not much of a closet but i dont have much well then at a loss she wandered toward the front window the view she said and left it at that yeah he joined her intrigued by the way her head fit neatly below his chin he could see the cliffs the azure sea beyond the splits of rock islands and the fuming water that charged them you used to spend a lot of time out there i still do still looking for treasure of course what was the name of the girl who tossed herself off the cliff seraphina right seraphina a romantic little tale a sad one same thing josh used to laugh about you and margo and kate haunting those cliffs and looking for seraphinas lost dowry but i figured he secretly wanted to find it himself we look every sunday now margo and kate and i and my daughters that brought him up short hed forgotten for a moment that this small delicate woman had given birth to two children youve got kids of your own girls yes chin lifted she turned back daughters my daughters something here he mused and wondered which button hed pushed how old are they she hadnt expected him to ask even out of politeness and she softened all over again alis ten kaylas seven you got started early girls that age usually go for horses they can come by and see mine whenever they like more of the unexpected thats kind of you michael i dont want them to get in your way i like kids he said it so simply that she believed him then ill warn you theyre both eager to see them and i suppose youre eager to see the stables out of habit she glanced at her watch and winced got an appointment actually yes i do if you dont mind taking the rest of the tour on your own i really have to change to get her hair done he imagined or her nails or to make her fiftyminute hour with some society shrink sure i left the keys in the kitchen she continued juggling details there isnt a phone i didnt know if you wanted one theres a jack somewhere if you need anything you ill be fine he slipped a check out of his pocket and handed it to her rent oh she slipped it into her own pocket sorry that she couldnt welcome one of her brothers old friends as a guest but the rent would go a long way toward new ballet shoes and drawing lessons thank you welcome to templeton house michael she went to the door and down the steps he walked to the side window and watched her cross the rolling lawn toward templeton house and there i was laura muttered standing in the bathtub she sighed grateful for a lull in the customer flow in pretenses so that she could vent to her friends wearing rags holding a scrub brush stop laughing in a minute kate promised holding a hand to her aching stomach im perfecting the image in my mind first the elegant laura templeton caught fighting pesky bathtub ring ring hell its more like bathtub plague and maybe ill think its funny in a year or two but right now its mortifying he just stood there grinning at me mmm margo touched her tongue to her top lip and if memory serves michael fury had one hell of a grin is he as wickedly dangerously handsome as ever i didnt notice laura sniffed and gave her attention to rubbing a fingerprint off the glass display case liar margo leaned closer come on laura tell i suppose he looked a bit like a twentiethcentury version of heathcliff dark brooding potentially violent and rough around the edges her shoulders shrugged again if that sort of thing appeals to you it wouldnt make me look the other way margo decided josh said he was a mercenary for a while a mercenary shed forgotten that and remembering now nodded figures and i ran into him once in france when he was racing cars margo tilted her head as she brought the memory back we had an interesting evening together laura lifted a brow oh really interesting margo repeated and left it at that then it was stunt work in hollywood and now its horses i wonder if hell stick around this time i know josh hopes he does at least the situation has pushed me into getting the stables in shape wanting busy work laura moved to the shelves and began to tidy glassware ive neglected them too long in fact i may think about getting a horse myself once i can manage it the girls might like that so what kind of horses does he raise breed own whatever kate wondered i didnt ask i just showed him around the apartment gave him the keys i suppose hes competent josh seems to think so and if his rent check doesnt bounce ill assume hes reliable i cant imagine id want any more out of a tenant horses take a lot of time and work which meant laura thought she couldnt even consider having them again for at least a decade hell be busy i doubt well see much of him the door opened for a pair of customers recognizing them as regulars laura smiled stepped forward ill take them she murmured to her partners good to see you mrs myers mrs lomax what can i show you today as laura led the customers into the wardrobe room margo considered shes trying not to be interested hmm laura she had the look of a woman whos been intrigued by a man and is trying not to be after a moments thought margo smiled broadly good and why would that be good its time she had a little distraction in her life a little male distraction and do you ever think of any other kind of distraction kate amused margo patted her friends hand from a woman newly married to a certified hunk thats a very stupid question lauras never let herself cut loose when it comes to men i think michael fury might just be the perfect thirtieth birthday present hes a man margo not a pair of earrings oh but darling i think he might look wonderful on her so to speak and i dont suppose it occurs to you that they might not be interested in each other in a sexual way wait kate held up a hand i forgot who i was talking to dont be snide margo tapped her fingers on the counter youve got a man and a woman both unattached as far as we know both attractive josh has put them in close proximity though i doubt it was his intention hes created a very interesting situation when you put it like that concerned kate glanced toward the wardrobe room look i always liked mick but he was a wild child we could have a lamb and wolf situation here i certainly hope youre right every woman needs at least one close encounter with a wolf but they were talking about laura after all ill have to invite michael over for dinner check him out myself and i suppose well have to bow to your greater judgment and experience naturally the door jangled open again back to work partner in the wardrobe room laura was patiently showing their selection of cashmere sweaters if she had been aware of the direction her friends were taking she would have been both amused and appalled men in general simply werent of interest to her she didnt hate them her experience with peter hadnt turned her into a shrew made her frigid or narrowed her vision so that she considered men the enemy too many good men had touched her life for that she had her father as a prime example her brother was another and over the past months she had come to love byron de witt family was one thing intimate even casual relationships were another she didnt have the time inclination or energy for one in the two years since she had ended her marriage she had been struggling to rebuild her life on all levels her children her home her work for templeton and pretenses while her customers debated their selections she eased back to give them room musing on the events that had led to starting the shop it had been an impulse a step shed taken for margo as much as for herself margos career and finances had been in ruins when she returned to monterey from europe the idea of liquidating her possessions and creating an intriguing space in which to sell them had been a risk but it had paid off from the first moment not just in dollars laura thought as she wandered back into the main showroom in pride in confidence in friendship and fun when they bought the building it was an empty space dusty scarred smelly their vision their effort had turned it into the remarkable now the glass of the wide display window sparkled in the sunlight and teased passersby with clever hints of what was offered inside a sassy cocktail dress in emerald with the nostalgic touch of peacock feathers at the shoulder was draped over the elegant chair of a womans vanity colorful bottles stood on the glossy surface along with a jeweled collar one of the drawers was open so that glittery rhinestones and shimmering silks spilled out there was a lamp shaped like a swan a single crystal flute beside an empty bottle of champagne a mans cuff links and carelessly tossed formal black tie mingled with the womans trinkets a pair of red spike heels was artfully positioned to give the impression that their owner had just stepped out of them the little vignettes in the display were usually margos domain but laura had designed this one and was proud of it as she was of the shop as a whole throughout the spacious showroom was scattered the unique the fanciful the warm rose walls complemented glass shelves filled with treasures porcelain boxes silver services goldringed stemware a velvet settee the third theyd had to stock provided customers a chance to sit enjoy a cup of tea a glass of champagne gilded tightwinder stairs spiraled up toward the open balcony that ringed the room and led to the boudoir where negligees peignoirs and other night apparel were displayed in a gorgeous rosewood armoire everything was for sale from the rococo bed to the smallest silver trinket box and nothing was duplicated the shop had quite literally saved all three of them and though she wouldnt have thought it possible it had brought them even closer together as she hovered outside the wardrobe room she watched margo show a customer a sapphire bracelet from the display kate discussed the origins of an art nouveau lamp with another a new customer studied an opal snuff bottle while her companion perused the selection of evening bags mozart was playing on the stereo softly through the window laura caught glimpses of the busy traffic on cannery row cars chugged or streamed or jockeyed for position people strolled by on the sidewalk a man passed with a young boy giggling from his perch on daddys shoulders a couple arm in arm stopped to admire the display and moments later came inside ms templeton pulling herself back from her reverie laura turned to the wardrobe room yes mrs myers did you find something you like the woman smiled held out her choice i never leave pretenses disappointed the glow of pride was swift and satisfying laura accepted the cashmere were here to see that you never do chapter four contents prev next pretty good digs right boy michael groomed max his pride and joy while the enormous buffcolored tennessee walker snorted in agreement the templeton horse palace was a far cry from the simple working stables that michael had built in the hills then watched collapse under walls of mud not that it had looked much like a palace when he stepped inside that first afternoon when he ran into laura then it bore more than a slight resemblance to some fairytale cottage long under a wicked spell deserted by all who had once inhabited it he had to grin at the thought and at the fact that everything about the templeton estate made him think of fairy tales with golden edges what he found in the stables was dust disuse and disrepair it had taken him the best part of a week to ready the building no easy task for one man and a single pair of hands but he wasnt willing to move his horses in until their temporary home had been cleaned and organized to his specifications on the other hand for that week hed had to endure the public stables the painfully high fee for boarding and the fact that his own lodgings were miles away from his stock but the results were well worth the investment of a few sixteenhour muscleaching days it was a good solid building with the stylish touches that the templetons were known for the loose boxes had plenty of space and light and air a more important feature to michael than the intricately laid brick flooring the decorative tiles around the mangers or the ornate ironwork above them with its center stylized t in polished brass though he did consider the fancy work a nice touch the layout was practical with the tack room at one end of the block the feed room at the other though he was baffled by the obvious neglect and disuse he put his back into it and dug in to correct the situation he hauled and hammered swept and scrubbed until every stall met his stringent standards for his babies he thought of them as such secretly hed had fresh hay and straw delivered that morning and had been grateful that the boy who delivered it had been willing to make a few extra dollars by helping michael store the bales now each stall was deeply bedded with wheat straw expensive and difficult to come by but these were his babies after all some tools and some ingenuity had put the automatic drinking bowls back in working order he oiled hinges on stall doors replaced hooks that had rusted away since hed lost all of his supplies in the mud he had to restock grain electrolytes vitamins medicines hed managed to salvage some tack some tools every piece had been cleaned and polished and what couldnt be saved had been or would shortly be replaced his fifteen horses were housed as royally as he could manage but as yet he hadnt done more than sleep in the upstairs apartment youve come up in the world max you might not know it but you are now a tenant of the templeton estate that is one big fucking deal pal take my word for it he slapped the horse affectionately on the flank and pulled a carrot out of the pouch tied at his waist ive already started designing your new place dont worry maybe well add a few of the fancier touches ourselves this time around but in the meantime you cant do much better than this max took the carrot politely and the dark eye he turned to michael was filled with patience wisdom and michael liked to think affection as well he stepped out of the stall latched the bottom half of the door with its foot bolt then moved down the block the floor might have been fancy enough for a garden party but it sloped perfectly his boot heels clicked in anticipation a chestnut head poked over the adjoining stall door looking for me baby this was his sweetheart as kind and gentle a mare as he had ever worked with hed bought her as a foal and now she was heavily pregnant and had been assigned to the foaling stall he called her darling hows it going today youre going to be happy here he stepped inside and ran his hands over her enormous sides like an expectant father he was filled with anticipation and concern she was small barely fourteen hands and he worried about how she would fare when her time came darling liked to have her belly rubbed and she blew appreciatively when michael obliged her so beautiful he cupped her face in his hands as a man might hold the face of a cherished woman youre the most beautiful thing ive ever owned pleased with the attention she blew again then lowered her head to nibble at his pouch chuckling he took out an apple she preferred them to carrots here you go darling youre eating for two he heard the voices young excited almost piping and stepped out of the stall mama said were not supposed to bother him were not going to bother him well just look come on kayla dont you want to see the horses yeah but what if hes in there what if he yells at us then well just run away but well get to see the horses first amused wondering if laura had painted him as an ogre or a recluse michael stepped out of the shadows of the stables and into the sunlight if hed been a poetic man he would have said hed encountered two angels they thought they were looking into the face of the devil himself he was all in black with shadows behind him the hard handsome face was unsmiling and dark with stubble his hair reached almost to his shoulders and he had a black bandanna tied around his forehead like a wild indian or a pirate he seemed big huge dangerous her heart jittering ali put a hand on kaylas shoulder both to protect her sister and to steady herself we live here she stammered we can be here he couldnt resist playing it out a little is that so well i live here and i dont look kindly on trespassers you wouldnt be horse thieves would you we have to hang horse thieves shocked appalled terrified ali could only shake her head vigorously but kayla stepped forward fascinated you have pretty eyes she said dimpling into a smile are you really a troublemaking hoodlum annie said so all ali could do was whisper her sisters name in mortification and fear ah he thought ann sullivan sowing his youthful reputation ahead of him i used to be i gave it up christ the kid was a picture he thought a heart melter your names kayla and you have your mothers eyes uhhuh and thats ali shes ten im seven and a half and i lost a tooth she grinned widely to show him the accomplishment cool have you looked for it she giggled no the tooth fairy has it she took it up into the sky to make a star out of it do you have all your teeth last time i checked youre mr fury mama says we have to call you that i like your name its like a storybook person a villain maybe she twinkled at him can we see your horses mr fury we wont steal them or hurt them or anything i think theyd like to see you he offered a hand which kayla took without hesitation come on ali he said casually i wont yell at you unless you deserve it biting her lip ali followed them into the stables oh she jolted back then giggled at herself when max stuck his huge head over the stall door hes so big hes so pretty she started to reach out then stuck her hand behind her back you can pet him michael told her the older girl was a little shy he decided and pretty as a picture in a book he doesnt bite unless you deserve it to demonstrate he hauled kayla up on his hip go ahead meet max hes a southern gentleman our uncle is a southern gentleman kayla announced but he doesnt look like max delighted she stroked the soft cheek smooth she murmured hello max hello not one to be outmatched by her kid sister ali stepped forward again and touched maxs other cheek does he let you ride him and everything yep max and i have fought wild indians together been wild indians together robbed stagecoaches jumped ravines looking down into two pairs of wide eyes he grinned max is a hollywood star really enchanted kayla touched one velvet ear giggling when it flicked under her fingers really ill show you his press clippings later come meet darling shes going to have a baby soon aunt margo just had one kayla chattered gaily as they made the new acquaintance his name is john thomas but we call him j t do horses have babies the same way people have them pretty much michael murmured and skirted the issue by distracting the girls with the mare they met jack the dignified gelding and lulu a frisky mare then zip the fastest horse so michael claimed in the west why do you have so many suspicion of the man couldnt hold out against delight with horses with shyness outmatched by curiosity ali dogged michaels every move and peppered him with questions i train them i buy them sell them sell them the very idea had kaylas lip poking out all but max and darling i wont sell them ever but the others will go to people wholl appreciate their talents and take good care of them they all have a destiny now jack here hes going to make someone a good saddle horse hell ride forever if you ask him and rash hell be a hell of a stunt pony when im finished with him you mean hell do tricks yeah michael grinned at kayla hes already got a few up his sleeve but max now max knows them all want a show really can we itll cost you how much kayla demanded i have money in my bank not money michael said as he led them back to max if you like the show you have to come back and work it off what kind of work ali wanted to know well talk about it come on max michael took a bridle and slipped it on youve got a couple of ladies to impress here at five max was a veteran performer he highstepped it outside pleased to have an audience michael led him to the small paddock beside the building you girls stay at the fence there this could get hairy take your bows max max gracefully bent his front legs and lowered himself when the girls erupted with applause michael could have sworn that max grinned up he ordered using voice and hand signals michael took max through his routine the big horse reared pawed the air let out a high whinny he pranced sidestepped danced circled then when michael swung up onto his bare back he repeated the routine with variations now heres his weve been walking in the desert for three days without water routine at the signal max drooped his head fell limply and he plodded along as though each step would be his last now look out rattlesnake max leapt back bunched up cowered god almighty the posse shot my horse right out from under me dead horse max for his finale max wheeled cantered to the left and dropped to the ground michael tumbled off rolled as he got to his feet he caught sight of laura racing in skinny little heels across the yard oh god are you all right how did it happen oh your horse though he started to speak michael found himself too involved in watching that nifty length of bare leg as she vaulted the fence in her neat little ladys suit max lay dead hardly flicking an eye when laura knelt at his head poor thing poor thing is it his leg whos your vet at the sight of the horse lying with his big head nestled in the lap of lauras pretty blue skirt michael tucked his tongue in his cheek looks like its curtains for old max dont say that laura snapped back he might have just bruised something but what if he hadnt she pushed back the hair that curled flirtatiously at her jaw girls go back to the house now but mama dont argue she couldnt bear the idea of either of them witnessing what might have to be done laura michael began why are you just standing there worry and temper warred in her eyes why arent you doing something the poor thing is suffering and youre just standing there dont you care about your own horse yes maam i do max cut on cue and to lauras astonishment the big horse rolled again then got to his feet it was a trick mama kayla laughed gaily at the shared joke while michael pulled laura up max does tricks he was playing dead like a dog does isnt he wonderful isnt he smart yes under a ragged cloak of dignity laura brushed off her skirt hes certainly talented sorry a wise man knew when to smother a grin michael rarely chose to be wise id have warned you if id seen you coming then you were off and running he scratched his cheek seemed a lot more worried about my horse than about me i could have broken my neck the horse was down laura said primly you werent but everything faded into admiration as max bent his head to her oh he is beautiful arent you gorgeous arent you clever max has been in tots of movies ali moved closer so has mr fury oh stunts michael explained he took a carrot out of his pouch handed it to laura give him that hes your slave for life who could resist as she offered the treat she spoke slowly didnt i tell you girls not to pester mr fury yes but he said we werent kayla smiled hopefully up at michael standing on the rail of the fence she lifted her arms confident because you werent he hauled her up fit her so naturally on his hip that laura frowned i like the company he said to laura so do the horses they get tired of looking at me all day the kids are welcome to come by anytime if theyre in my way ill tell them to kaylas delight and lauras momentary horror he plunked kayla onto maxs wide back its high look how high up i am im trying not to laura said her hand automatically going to the bridle hes a stunt horse not a saddle pony gentle as a lamb michael assured her then lifted ali over the fence and put her behind her sister hell carry the three of you if you want hes also strong as a bull no thank you her heart settled as she looked into maxs eyes they were indeed gentle im not exactly dressed for it so i noticed you look good ms templeton and you looked damned good climbing over the fence she looked back into michaels eyes gentle no indeed she thought but just as compelling i imagine i made quite a picture you dont know the half of it sugar she stepped back okay girls partys over you need to wash up for dinner ali started to complain stopped herself she didnt want to risk being told she couldnt come back can mr fury come to dinner oh discomfort and manners manners always won of course michael youre welcome to come and if hed ever received a cooler and less enthusiastic invitation he couldnt remember thanks but i have plans im heading over to joshs to meet his son well then she reached up lifted kayla then ali to the ground well get out of your way there were a couple of things i wanted to run by you if youve got a minute of course her feet were killing her all she wanted was to take off those damn heels and sit down girls tell annie ill be in shortly thank you mr fury her mothers daughter to the core ali offered a hand youre welcome thanks mr fury for showing us the horses and the tricks and everything i want to tell annie kayla started to race off but stopped at the fence mr fury yes maam she giggled at that then sobered can you teach dogs too if you had a puppy or somebody did could you teach him tricks like max i expect i could if he was a good dog she smiled again wistfully then hurried away behind her sister she wants a dog laura murmured i didnt know she never said she asked years ago but peter damn it i should have realized intrigued michael watched the varied emotions play over her face and the weightiest was guilt do you always beat yourself up this way i should have known shes my child i should have known she wanted a puppy suddenly tired she dragged her hands through her hair so get her one her chin set i will im sorry shaking off the guilt she looked back at michael what did you need oh i need a lot of things casually he draped an arm around maxs neck a hot meal a fast car the love of a good woman but what we both need is a couple of mousers excuse me you need some barn cats laura you got rodents oh god she shuddered once blew out a breath i should have realized that too we used to keep some when we had horses but peter she broke off shut her eyes no she was not traveling down that road again ill be making a trip to the pound it seems ill get a couple of cats youre going to get your kid a dog from the pound and why not no reason he led max toward the fence figured you for the purebred type thats all thats the way some people are about horses they want arabians thoroughbreds ive got me one of the prettiest fillies you could want in that stable shes smart as a whip and quick as a snake shes what youd call a mongrel though always liked mongrels myself i prefer character above lineage good for you in an absentminded movement he bent down plucked a struggling buttercup out of its patch of grass and handed it to her id say youve got both in those girls of yours theyre beauties heartbreakers the little ones already wrapped her fist around mine and she knows it you surprise me she stared down at the sunny yellow flower in her hand baffled despite fatigue and aching feet she followed him into the stables you dont strike me as a man whod take to children little girls mongrels are full of surprises i didnt mean i know you didnt he settled max in his stall latched the door the little ones got your eyes smoke and storms alis got your mouth soft and wanting to be stubborn he grinned then you breed good laura i suppose i should thank you though no ones ever put it quite that way before and i appreciate your entertaining them but i dont want you to feel obligated i dont i said i like them i meant it besides they owe me for the show me and max dont work for free i could use some help around here help mucking out hauling hay unless youve got a problem with your progeny shoveling manure shed shoved plenty herself in her day no itll be good for them automatically she lifted a hand to stroke maxs nose youve worked a minor miracle here she noted glancing down the spotless building ive got a strong back and plenty of ambition for making something out of this saddle horses trick ponies jumpers ive got a way with them if max is any example id say youve got a major way with them were you really a mercenary among other things including the troublemaking hoodlum mrs sullivan claims i am oh she rolled her eyes at max cleared her throat i expect annies remembering the boy who gave josh his first cigarette one of my lesser crimes i quit six months ago myself easier than worrying about setting fire to the hay or dying of lung cancer you gotta die of something she turned just as he reached up to slip the bridle off max their bodies bumped as much out of curiosity as to steady her he took her arms soft fragile as hed imagined and as he shifted just a little the gentle swell of her breasts pressed against him her eyes had whipped to his at first contact they stayed there as her heart hammered i always wondered what kind of handful youd be he smiled let his hands run up and down those pretty arms never had the opportunity to find out before of course you were too young for me back then youve caught up close enough now excuse me that was her voice calm and cool she was able to manage that though everything inside her was hot and unsteady youre not in my way easily he lifted a hand to toy with a curl that flirted with her cheek then youre in mine she didnt know how to handle men had never had to really but she was smart enough to know that now she needed a crash course im not interested in flirtations me either she borrowed a page from margos book made her eyes bored michael im sure scores of women would be flattered if i had the time i might be flattered myself but i dont have the time my children are waiting to have their dinner youve got that down he acknowledged lady of the manor you were born for it he stepped back if you find yourself with time on your hands you know where to find me give my best to josh and margo she said as she set out on watery legs for the house sure hey sugar bristling only a little at the term she looked back the mousers dont come bringing me some furry little kittens i want big hungry toms ill see what i can do im sure you will he murmured as she walked away christ what a package he said to max amused at himself michael rubbed the heel of his hand against his heart it had yet to settle down for him shes the type that makes a man feel like a big hungry torn and clumsy with it shaking his head michael headed upstairs to wash off the stable dirt so margos a mommy michael grinned at his hostess who failed to look the least bit maternal in a peachtoned jumpsuit that clung glamorously to every curve im a great mommy she kissed both his cheeks european fashion i love being a mommy drawing back she took a long look and wasnt disappointed whats it been michael six years seven longer i was trying to tear up the european circuit and you were taking the continent by storm those were the days she said lightly and tucking her arm through his led him inside great place he wasnt surprised by the elegance of the california spanish but he was by its coziness kate turned us on to it you remember kate powell sure they strolled out of the tiled foyer into a spacious room with a blazing fire and twin sofas in deep maroon hows she doing i heard shes married now still a newlywed youd like byron i think well have to have a party when youre settled introduce you around im not much of a partier these days a small one then what can i get you to drink she glided behind a deeply carved bar josh will be right down he had a meeting run over got a beer i think we can manage that from the small cold box under the bar she chose a bottle so its horses now it seems to be he watched her open the bottle pour beer smoothly into a pilsner on the third finger of her left hand diamonds and gold flashed her hair was more gold soft flowing waves of it and there were more diamonds at her ears still he saw that it was her eyes that shined the brightest you look good margo happy its nice to see you happy a little surprised she glanced up really you never seemed to be really quite there apparently you were right she set the glass on the bar and pried the silver wine saver off a bottle of champagne but ive gotten there a wife a mommy and a shopkeeper he lifted his glass in a toast whod have thought it and doing a marvelous job at all three after pouring herself a flute of champagne she toasted herself in turn youll have to come by pretenses michael were on cannery row ill come see your shop you come see my horses thats a deal im sorry about your house he shrugged his shoulders no big deal i didnt like it anyway i was more pissed off about the stables id barely gotten them finished when i lost them still its just wood and nails i can buy more it must have been horrible ive seen film of mud slides and the aftermath of some i cant imagine being in the middle of it you dont want to he still had moments when the image of driving rain thundering earth and wicked winds flashed into his mind and the panic that came with the flash that he wouldnt be quick enough strong enough smart enough to save what mattered to him anyway im working on the plans for rebuilding got a contractor lined up its mostly just time and money im sure youll be comfortable at templeton house until youve rebuilt its hard not to be i met lauras kids today beautiful kids the older ones reserving judgment on me but kayla he chuckled she just moves right in theyre wonderful girls lauras done a terrific job there she hasnt changed much more than you might think the divorce was hard on her terribly hard but shes got that strong templeton core you never met peter ridgeway did you nope trust me margo said and drank deeply hes a bastard sugar you hate him ill hate him too laughing she took his hand its good to have you back michael moving in on my wife already fury josh came in an owleyed baby on his hip my kid and ill fight you for her i think he could take me curious michael set his beer aside and walked over to study j t the baby studied him right back then reached out and grabbed a handful of michaels hair come here slugger even as margo opened her mouth dozens of maternal warnings on her tongue michael nipped j t neatly out of joshs arms and settled him on his own hip the natural move made margos eyes blink in surprise then narrow with speculation enjoying the stranger j t gurgled great job harvard michael gave j t a quick nuzzle congratulations thanks josh grinned at his wife i had a little help chapter five contents prev next laura did bring home a fuzzy little kitten in fact she brought home two and a pair of lean sharpeyed toms and a bigfooted puppy with a spotted coat and an eager tongue the small zoo in her car caused her a bit of trouble but gave her a great deal of pleasure she drove home with cats meowing bitterly in their boxes kittens sleeping on the car mat and an adoring puppy sprawled in her lap wait until the girls get a load of you already in love she stroked the puppys head and i guess if they fight over you ill just have to go back and pick up a brother or sister for you laughing she turned into the drive at templeton house so foolish she realized not to have done this before old habits she mused peter hadnt wanted pets so there had been no pets but peter had been gone nearly two years and that was two years too long not to have made some simple adjustments after parking the car she glanced around at her menagerie and blew out a breath how the hell am i going to manage to get you all inside she had a leash for the pup which she attached to his brandnew collar she held out no hope that he would understand the purpose for a brief moment she considered laying on the horn until someone came out to give her a hand which she assumed would send her new petting zoo into a frenzy so shed deal with it herself you first she decided and opened the door the puppy cowered sniffed at the empty space on the other side of her lap then gathering his courage he jumped if she hadnt been laughing so hard she would have held on to the leash but the pup landed in a sprawl and looked so surprised that she roared with laughter and the leather slid out of her hands he was off and running oh damn it still laughing she sprang out of the car come back here you idiot instead he raced in circles then cut through old joes pampered bed of narcissus yapping joyously all the way oh thats going to be a problem she realized wincing she walked around the car to retrieve the sleepy kittens in the back the toms continued to complain at the top of their lungs all right all right give me a minute here inspired she tucked a kitten in each of her jacket pockets then hauled out the cat boxes you two are michaels problem following the excited barks she headed toward the stables the sight that greeted her when she stepped through the arbor of wisteria was worth every moment of annoyance in the far yard her daughters were kneeling on the ground embracing and being embraced by a wildly enthusiastic spotted mutt she took the picture in her mind slipped it into her heart look mama kayla was already shouting as laura started toward them come quick and look at the little puppy he must be lost he doesnt look lost to me he has a leash ali giggled a sound laura could never hear often enough as he scrambled into her lap maybe he ran away from home i dont think so he is home hes ours ali simply stared but we cant have pets with a smile laura adjusted her boxes he doesnt seem to agree with you do you mean it kayla rose the expression of stunned joy on her face carved itself into lauras heart do you mean he can be our puppy and we can keep him forever thats exactly what i mean mama in one leap kayla had her arms wrapped around her mothers waist she clung hard fierce mama thank you ill take such good care of him youll see i know you will honey she looked over at ali who remained still staring we all will he needs a good home and lots of love well give him that wont we ali inner conflict held her back her father had said pets were a nuisance messy they shed hair all over the rug but the puppy was sniffing at her leg wagging his tail and trying to jump into her arms well take good care of him she said solemnly she started to step forward stopped her mouth went lax in shock mama your pockets are moving oh with a laugh laura set her boxes down reached in and plucked out two furry balls one silken gray and the other sassy orange from her pockets what have we here kittens kayla squealed grabbed kittens we have kittens too look ali we have everything theyre so tiny gently cautiously ali took the mewling gray mama theyre so tiny theyre just babies just over six weeks old every bit as much in love as her daughters were laura stroked a fingertip down the sleepy gray they needed a home too its really all right half afraid to hope ali looked up into her mothers eyes its really all right for us to keep them all its really all right more tuning in to the sounds coming from the cardboard boxes kayla pounced no those arent ours those are barn cats for michael ill take them to him desperate to share her fabulous news with anyone who would listen kayla handed her kitten to ali and hefted both boxes by the straps grunting a little she headed toward the stables come on cats come on ill take you home do they have names hmm absently laura stroked her daughters hair then made herself look away from the comical picture of kayla bobbling along with two boxes full of impatient felines and a puppy racing around her legs in clumsy bigfooted circles they will have when we pick them out can i name one myself pick out the name all by myself for the little gray kitten ali lifted it to her cheek of course you can what name would you like is it a boy or a girl its i dont know laura realized i forgot to ask its probably on one of the papers i filled out with one arm around alis shoulders she walked after kayla the puppys a boy and both big cats are boys because thats what michael wanted because he likes boys better uhoh no honey i guess he figured tomcats would be meaner and he wanted mousers her eyes went huge hes going to let them eat mice baby im afraid thats what cats do ali pressed the little ball of fluff to her cheek mine wont kaylas voice was already echoing in high excited chirps accented by the yaps of the pup who had raced inside the stables with her when laura stepped in and her eyes adjusted to the dim light she saw michael and kayla crouched together on the brick floor taking stock of templeton houses new mutt looks like a good dog to me michael stated giving the pup an energetic scratch between the ears so you can teach him tricks right mr fury how to sit and play dead and shake i expect the pup sniffed curiously at one of the cat boxes and was rewarded with a spitting hiss yelping he streaked away and cringed behind lauras legs hes already learned something with a grin michael opened the first box dont mess with a cornered torn no honey michael took kaylas hand before she could reach in to pet the cat i doubt hes in a friendly mood at the moment dont like being cooped up there do you big guy lets get you and your pal out he opened the other box then drew kayla back well just let them get the lay of the land once theyve catted around some theyll settle in his eyes skimmed over laura lingered then moved on whatcha got there ali kittens alis hands and heart were full of them already mama brought us kittens too fuzzy little kitties as he walked to them he ran his tongue around his teeth cute mama said i could name the gray one myself then i get to name the orange one staking her claim kayla took the orange kitten out of alis hand and nuzzled it against her cheek dont i mama fair enough well have a naming marathon after dinner well just get out of mr furys way cant we show the kittens to max cant we sure you can michael winked at kayla hes a real softie when the girls raced off the pup at their heels michael shook his head what the hell have you done laura made my girls very happy she pushed back her hair and saved five lives in the bargain do you have a problem with kittens and puppies nope the cats had leaped out of their boxes and were slinking around growling softly michael reached over and stroked the nose of his sober gelding you ever do anything halfway ive been known to she unbent enough to smile i couldnt stop myself if youd seen the girls faces when i told them that silly little dog was theirs ill never forget it with the same absent affection hed shown the gelding michael stroked her cheek he didnt know if he was amused or annoyed when she jerked like a spring you need some training yourself excuse me you shy easy i appreciate you picking up the cats for me he said before she could think of a response no trouble the whole lot of them need to go to the vet shots neutering ouch in a kneejerk male reaction he winced yeah i guess thats the deal its the responsible choice and its required when you adopt from the shelter i have all the paperwork except i what well i didnt think to ask about the sex of the kittens i dont know if they told me it started to get complicated and confusing and i think ive heard that its difficult to tell with young kittens it took an effort but he kept his eyes solemn ive always heard you shake em if they dont rattle theyre female it took her a moment then she broke into easy appreciative laughter ill be sure to try it when the girls arent around there you are i dont suppose ive heard you laugh like that more than a half a dozen times since ive known you you were always being too dignified when i was around im sure youre mistaken sugar i dont make many mistakes when it comes to women no i dont imagine you would to give herself a moment to make her retreat yes damn it a dignified retreat she turned to the gelding this is a handsome horse hes smart quietnatured jack at his name the horse pricked his ears soberly he turned his head to michael how old are you jack in response the horse stomped a foot four times what do you think of the lady here jack rolled his eyes toward laura and let out a quiet and undeniably roguish whinny charmed laura laughed again how do you get him to do that jack he understands every word you say want to take the lady for a ride jack the response was a decisive nod see michael turned his own swift and undeniably roguish grin on laura want a ride lady i god she would love one love to feel a horse beneath her again let it have its head let herself lose hers id enjoy that but i dont have the time she offered michael a polite distant smile ill take a rain check cash it in whenever you like too used to thoroughbreds he assumed and shrugged hed take jack over some finicky purebred any day thank you id better get my motley crew inside that is if annie lets us inside shes a tough nut mrs sullivan shes family laura corrected but i should have warned her before i started a small zoo that small zoo is going to keep you up most of the night ill manage she managed but it wasnt a walk in the park the puppy whimpered and whined and despite kaylas lavish love was satisfied with nothing less than lauras bed she knew it was a mistake but she couldnt bring herself to banish him when he cuddled so hopefully against her side the kittens mewed fretted cried and eventually were comforted by each other and the hot water bottle that an already doting annie provided as a result laura was grittyeyed and foggybrained the next morning she fumbled at the keyboard in her office at the hotel cursed herself then focused on the file for an upcoming writers convention twelve hundred people checking in at approximately the same time certainly on the same day were going to present a challenge then there were the hospitality suites banquet and seminar rooms audio equipment pitchers of water requests for coffee services catering demands cartons of books were already arriving by the truckload she appreciated the spirit of the planned book signing for literacy as well as the headaches it was going to cause her and her staff composing a memo onehanded she picked up her ringing phone at the sound of the conference coordinators voice she straggled not to wince yes melissa its laura templeton how can i help you today and tomorrow and for the rest of my natural life she thought as the woman requested more additions more changes just a few more little adjustments naturally if the weathers inclement and were unable to hold your welcoming party at poolside well provide you with an alternate space the garden ballroom is lovely we often hold wedding receptions there its still available for that date she listened rubbed fingers against her temple no im not able to do that melissa but if we do book the ballroom well provide another alternate i realize were talking more than a thousand people well accommodate you she continued to listen made notes that somehow became mindless doodles yes im looking forward to seeing you again too ill be in touch taking one breath one moment to clear her mind again she got back to her memo laura she didnt groan but she wanted to byron did we have a meeting no he stepped in seemed to fill her small office with his size arent you taking lunch lunch it cant be noon no it cant he said mildly as she looked at her watch its half past noon the morning got away from me im due at the shop in an hour i have to finish this is there something urgent eyeing her he closed the door at his back take a break i really cant i need take a break he repeated thats an order to ensure that she obeyed it he sat down now ms templeton lets talk about delegating byron i do delegate its just that fitz is running ragged over the milhousedrury wedding reception and robyns swamped the pharmaceutical convention and a kid with chicken pox and and it all comes down to you he finished you look exhausted honey she pouted are you speaking as my brotherinlaw or as executive director both if youre not going to take care of yourself i am taking care of myself she smothered a smile byrons stand on health and fitness was well known i just didnt get much sleep last night i went to the pound yesterday he brightened as shed known he would hed adopted two dogs the year before yeah what did you get a puppy and two kittens the girls are in ecstasy and this morning i caught annie carrying the pup like he was a newborn baby and telling him that good dogs mustnt piddle on the bokhara rug start stocking up on newspaper well have to come over and check out your new additions come by tonight he raised an eyebrow before or after the country club dance the valentines day dance she shut her eyes i forgot no getting out of it laura youre a templeton youre expected i know i know there went the long indulgent bathandearlytobed night shed been fantasizing about ill be there i would have remembered if you hadnt kate and margo would have reminded you look why dont you let your partners handle the shop this afternoon go take a nap jt is having his checkup this afternoon i cant leave kate on her own were inundated with the valentines day sale which reminds me understanding she smiled its only the tenth byron you still have time to pick up that wellthoughtout loving gift and no matter what kate says dont buy her computer software flowers always work for me and no one had sent her flowers she thought in too long to remember when her mind drifted to a tiny yellow wildflower she pulled it back and called herself an idiot shes not getting that new calculator shes been hinting for either he rose do you want a lift to the club tonight so went the life of a single woman laura mused always tagging along with couples no thanks ill see you there im not the country club type josh as if someone had already forced him into a suit michael rolled his shoulders id consider it a favor scowling michael measured out grain i hate it when you do that and id be able to introduce you to a lot of potential horse owners i happen to know someone who has an impressive stud you did say you have a mare ready to breed yeah shes ready and he wanted the right sire for her so youll give me his name and ill talk to him i dont have to go to some lame dance and im the last person your sister wants taking her to some lame dance its not like a date so margo had said when shed drilled the request into his head its just that lauras feeling like a third wheel at these things i didnt realize it myself but margo pointed it out and josh thought as he watched michael divvy up grains had made him feel like a lower form of life then i realized how often laura either skips going to events or cuts out early it would be nice for her to have an escort thats all a woman like your sister ought to have a platoon of likely escorts lined up and waiting and all with the proper pedigree michael thought yeah well she doesnt seem interested in swimming with the sharks in the dating pool was he supposed to do something about that too josh wondered and nearly shuddered she knows you mick shed be comfortable with you and it would give you the chance to make some contacts everybodys happy im not happy when i have to wear a tie he glanced over his shoulder and grinned not like you harvard in your fancy italian suit get the hell out of my barn come on mick its just one night out of your fascinating and funfilled life well hit the game room play some billiards tell some lies there was that michael considered and the alternative was a sandwich and an evening hunkered over his drawings for his projected house i can still bury your ass at pool ill lend you a tie fuck you one of the cats streaked by pounced in a blur of black there was a short squeal christ thats disgusting thats life harvard michael moved back to deal with darlings meal measuring the additives necessary for her condition you really know what youre doing around here dont you apparently we all have our niche josh mused over how many niches michael had already found and rejected yet he had a feeling this one was different theyd known each other too long and too well for josh to miss the easy contentment in his friends moves a contentment he thought that had never quite been there before this is the one isnt it michael glanced over he didnt need to explain not to josh he only needed to say one word yeah if i know you you want to make something big out of it he yearned to in my own time josh took his waiting while michael fed the expectant mother checked her haynet babied her monterey riding academy the owners are friends of the family so theyll be at the club tonight kate was their accountant when she was with bittle and associates they do a lot of buying and selling so do their students ambition michael admitted was always a trap youre a slick son of a bitch harvard you always were josh merely grinned we all have our niche laura might not go for this little arrangement of yours i can handle laura josh said confidently and checked his watch ive got enough time to slip by the shop and do just that before my last meeting today the dance is at nine ill tell her youll pick her up at eightthirty wearing a tie if you dont make this worth my while pal ill have to kick your ass he brushed grain dust from his hands i wont enjoy it but ill have to do it understood satisfied with the outcome of his mission josh headed for the door ah you do know the way to the club dont you appreciating the sarcasm michael tilted his head maybe i will enjoy it after all she was furious livid and trapped theyd ganged up on her laura fumed as she yanked the pearl gray miska cocktail dress out of her closet josh and margo and kate cornering her at pretenses and all but presenting her with a fait accompli michael fury was escorting her to the country club dance the arrangement would suit everyone they wouldnt have to worry about her driving there and back alone or about her feeling awkward at an event designed for couples michael would gain an entree and make contacts in the horse world oh yeah it suited everyone just fine everyone but herself it was humiliating she thought as she jerked the zipper up a thirtyyearold woman being fixed up by her big brother worse now michael knew that she was the pathetic divorcee who couldnt get her own date as if she wanted one in the first place or the last place or any place at all for that matter which i dont she told the dog who had come into her room to watch her every move with adoring eyes i dont even want to go to the damn country club tonight im tired sympathetically he wiggled his butt as she stormed over to the closet for shoes and a beaded jacket she didnt need to hang on to a mans arm to feel complete she didnt need to hang on to anything anyone why couldnt she just crawl into bed and read a book she wondered eat popcorn and watch an old movie on tv until she fell asleep with the set still on why did she have to dress up go out in public and be laura templeton she stopped sighed because she was laura templeton that was something she couldnt forget laura templeton had responsibilities she had an image to maintain so she told herself as she picked up her lipstick and applied it skillfully she would maintain it she would get through the evening say the right things to the right people she would be as polite and friendly to michael as necessary and when the whole blasted thing was over she would fall facedown on her bed and forget it until the next time she checked her hair god she needed a trim and when was she going to fit that in she turned for her bag and watched in mild horror as the pup wet on her aubusson oh bongo he grinned up at her and sat in his own pee it was only a small rebellion but michael didnt wear a tie he figured that with laura templeton at his side they wouldnt boot him out for wearing a black turtleneck under his jacket he parked between the island of spring bulbs and the grand front entrance and if hed been wearing a tie he would have tugged at it nerves they amazed him disgusted him but no matter how much he wanted to deny it he felt like some pimplyfaced teenager on a first date ignoring the sky dusted with icy stars the sheen of silvering moonlight the scent of sea and flowers he walked to the door like a man taking his last mile in shackles how the hell had he let himself get talked into this hed never used the front door at templeton house as a boy if he came by for josh or came along with him he used the side or rear the entrance was so damned imposing grandly tall recessed and framed in tile the knocker was a huge brass affair in the shape of a stylized t over his head hung an antique carriage light it didnt make him feel welcome nor did ann sullivan when she opened the door to his knock she stood tightlipped in her starched black dress he noted first that the years sat lightly on her she was a lovely woman if you looked past the jaundiced eye margo had come by her looks naturally mr fury the faint hint of ireland in her voice might have been charming if it hadnt been so damning because for reasons he couldnt name hed always wanted her approval she put his back up his smile was insolent his voice matched it mrs sullivan its been a while it has she returned clearly telling him it hadnt been nearly long enough youre to come in he accepted the grudging invitation and stepped into the soaring foyer the ivory and peacockblue tiles were the same he noted as was the gorgeously ornate chandelier that sprinkled light the place was welcoming even if its doyenne wasnt it was full of cozy scents rich color warming light ill tell miss laura youre here but as she turned to do so laura came down the wide curving steps though michael would tell himself later that he was a fool his heart stopped the lights caught the fussy beads of her jacket and shot color beneath was a simple dress the color of moondust there were jewels at her ears sapphires and diamonds framing the face that her sweptback hair accented she looked so perfect so lovely with one ringless hand trailing along the glossy banister she might have stepped out of a painting im sorry to keep you waiting her voice was cool betraying none of her panic at the way those eyes of his bored into her or her fluster at having to mop up after the dog just got here he said equally cool then some of the absurdity struck him here he was michael fury holding out a hand for a princess i wasnt supposed to bring like a corsage or something was i she managed a small smile of her own its not the prom amen to that you be careful miss laura ann shot a warning look at michael and you drive responsibly boyo it isnt one of your races annie the dogs in with the girls but dont you worry she gestured toward the door thinking philosophically that the sooner they were gone the sooner shed have her girl back ill take care of him and them try to enjoy yourself and ill try to bring her back in one piece michael added for the hell of it as he opened the door see that you do ann muttered and began to worry the moment the door closed its nice of you to drive me to the club she would put things on the proper footing laura determined and keep them there you dont have to feel obliged to entertain me once were there hed been planning to say pretty much the same thing himself but he resented her saying it first he opened her door leaned on it who are you pissed off at laura me or the world in general im not angry with you or anyone gracefully she slipped into the passenger seat of his porsche im simply explaining matters so that we get through the evening comfortably and here you said you liked mongrels she blinked i dont know what you mean right he resisted barely slamming the door the evening he thought as he rounded the hood was off to a flying start chapter six contents prev next it could have been worse michael supposed he could have been back in some central american jungle sweating bullets and dodging them he could have had his skull bashed in as he had once when a stunt gag went wrong instead he was standing in a room with people he didnt know and didnt care to know hed rather have had his skull bashed in he thought the room itself was overly cute with its glossy red hearts hanging from swatches of paper lace the flowers were nice he supposed he didnt have any objection to flowers but he thought they carried the obsessive red and white theme too far all of the pinkdraped tables were centered with a grouping of white tapers ringed by a halo of fluffy red and white carnations at least he thought they were carnations and the music he decided it represented the widest culture clash with its mild strings and discreet piano all played by middleaged men in white suits give him blues or honest rock any day but there was a spiffy view of the coastline through a wall of windows the drama of it the war of fretful waves against meanedged rocks provided an interesting contrast to the quiet undeniably stuffy group inside the polished overheated club the women had decked themselves out absolutely dripping bangles and beads and other jewelry he noted they wore layers of perfumes and silks and lace overdone in his estimation like the decor he preferred lauras simple and feminine choice it was class he supposed that set her apart simple class that came straight through the blood and bone he might have mentioned it to her but she had drifted away quickly making as he termed it her templeton rounds most of the men were in tuxes a little fact that josh had conveniently neglected to mention not that michael minded he wouldnt have worn one anyway if hed had one to wear still it gave him another bone to pick with his old friend if the slippery son of a bitch ever showed up on the bright side he had a cold beer in his hand the finger food spread out artistically on buffet tables looked delicate but it tasted fine hed already enjoyed a mild flirtation with a woman who mistook him for some hollywood young gun michael hadnt bothered to disabuse her he was considering wandering about maybe taking a turn outside in the fresh air or checking out one of the other rooms he might find that pool table and a few suckers to fleece then laura moved back to him im sorry there were a few people i needed to speak with in a gesture that was both absentminded and automatic she accepted a glass of champagne from a roving waiter murmured her thanks no problem but it was she thought her problem shed had some time to think about it i am sorry michael i was annoyed with josh for maneuvering me into this evening and i took it out on you when he didnt respond she drummed up a smile so what were you and kitty bennett talking about who oh the ditzy brunette with all the teeth laura choked on her champagne shed never heard the chair of the monterey arts council described just that way or quite that accurately yes she dug my last flick did she he decided to be friendly smiled not braveheart though i had a couple of nice stunts in it she thought i was the director of some art house film something about foot fetishes mmhmm and you discussed the metaphoric twists on our sexobsessed society along with the multiple layers of symbolism representing moral decay he started to feel better something like that she thinks im brilliant and underrated i think i might be getting a grant congratulations of course she really only wanted my body well an artist must make sacrifices ah theres byron and kate michael glanced over his brows rose in surprise as he saw the streamlined brunette in slinky black the gamine face all sloecolored eyes and the closecropped dark hair tipped him off though the girl he remembered had been skinny coltish a borderline nerd thats kate kate powell she works out now laura muttered shes gotten obsessive about it so dont get her started that her trainer michael muttered back measuring the broadshouldered longlimbed man beside her and husband hes also my boss byron she held out a hand as the couple maneuvered through the crowd toward them a quick kiss and she turned to kate margo was right as usual the karan suits you byron de witt michael fury nice to meet you kates been telling me stories and i didnt even need to exaggerate grinning she stepped forward and gave michael a quick friendly hug her arms might have been lean michael noted but they were tough enjoying her he drew her back katie powell looking good because shed always enjoyed him as well she wiggled her brows same goes mick can i get drinks for anyone byron asked in a voice that reminded michael of mint juleps and magnolia ill have what lauras having kate decided michael bass ale that ought to go down just fine byron decided i think ill join you excuse me a minute its the southern kate said watching him walk toward the bar with a proprietary and satisfied gleam in her eye hes just a gentleman it doesnt look like its just the dress that suits you michael commented its not kate turned back smiled warmly and unlike the dress which goes back into stock tomorrow hes all mine so how the hell are you michael fury and when do we get to see your horses it was so easy for kate laura thought as she listened to make the appropriate comments shed fallen right into casual conversation with michael didnt she feel any of those oh she hated to use the term vibes but it was the only word that came to her dark restless dangerous vibes it made her jittery to stand next to him to encounter a brush of his arm against hers to catch that gleam in his hot blue eyes it helped when josh and margo arrived there was more conversation and laughter byron fell into an easy discussion of horses with michael apparently byrons family owned several before the topic switched to cars another interest the men shared byron had arranged to take a look at michaels stock it wasnt difficult to ease away again and draw margo with her so margo began are you enjoying yourself you and michael are getting some speculative looks nothing could have been better designed to set laura off she could see it now perfectly and wondered how shed missed the master plan her temper hitched but she controlled it is that part of your little plot to give the country club set an eyeful of poor laura and her escort when the escort looks like michael margo waved an impatient hand oh lighten up laura its only one evening out of your life and why shouldnt you spend part of it with a goodlooking man god knows youve been hiding out long enough hiding out there was that hitch again is that what you call it dont regretting her choice of words margo put a hand on lauras arm i just meant that youve been so focused on work and responsibility you havent let yourself have much fun so have some ask him to dance take a walk whatever before he and byron bond like siamese twins over engine talk i dont want to dance or take a walk with michael laura said evenly now she felt pathetic the homely younger sister the neglected wallflower the pitiable exwife and im relieved that hes found something to salvage his evening hes been miserably bored then you havent been doing your job have you irritated herself margo inclined her head it wouldnt hurt you to be friendly to the man laura in fact it would be good for you and everyone in close proximity to you if you had a nice hot bout of sex with him and popped your own frustration cork lauras calm gray eyes turned to steel oh really i hadnt realized that those in close proximity were so affected by my lifestyle hey recognizing the signs of a battle in progress kate sidled up are we fighting lauras peeved because we made her come here with michael tonight i like mick kate chose an olive from her tiny plate and popped it into her mouth whats the problem im peeved laura returned emphasizing the word because margo apparently thinks i should jump into bed with him so that she and my other friends dont have to put up with my sexual frustration kate glanced around to where michael and byron and josh stood couldnt hurt she said with a shrug if i wasnt a happily married woman id consider it myself thats nice for you isnt it for both of you happily married women christ i hope i wasnt ever so smug training overcame temper just enough that she managed to walk away instead of stalking wrong buttons kate muttered we definitely pushed the wrong buttons its past time some of them were pushed but margo sighed before sipping her wine i dont mind making her angry but i didnt mean to make her unhappy i just hoped that shed enjoy herself let michael entertain her and eventually screw her brains out kate chuckled youre a considerate friend margo hell are we smug im afraid so a few minutes in the ladies lounge cooled laura off she sat on one of the dainty padded stools at the long mirrored counter and meticulously reapplied her lipstick was she frustrated was she becoming difficult to be around she didnt like to think so what she was was busy focused committed to her family and work what was so wrong with that then she sighed propped her elbows on the counter her head in the vee of her hands no it was she who had blown a simple evening out of proportion she admitted because she hadnt had a simple evening in too long and because she could admit privately she didnt know how to behave with a man especially one like michael fury shed been seventeen when she fell in love with peter eighteen when she married him her dating record beforehand had been brief and uncomplicated shed been married for ten years and had indulged in no flirtations much less affairs the men she knew were relatives or old family friends they were casual acquaintances the husbands of women she knew or business contacts she was thirty years old she thought miserably and she didnt know how to date even when it wasnt a bona fide date when the door to the lounge opened she straightened quickly and took out her comb hi laura judy her smile warmed judy prentice was a friend and a regular customer at pretenses its good to see you you look wonderful holding my own always ready for a chat or a quick gossip judy sat down beside her did you see maddie greene she had a boob job last month she simply couldnt be overly dignified with judy it was a little hard to miss her with those twin soldiers well watch yourself i made the polite comment when she brought it up i think i said something about them looking very perky she grinned when laura snorted next thing i knew shed dragged me in here and stripped to the waist to show them off up close my dear and much too personal oh god thanks for the warning i have to admit theyre beauties speaking of which judy set down her jeweled compact i didnt recognize that incredibly gorgeous specimen youre with tonight is he from around here hes an old friend judy rolled her eyes we should all have such old friends hes just moved back to the area a little thought leaked through your daughter takes riding lessons doesnt she judy shes horse crazy i went through the same stage but it seems to be sticking with mandy michael raises horses trains them hes working out of templeton house for the moment until he can rebuild his property was destroyed in those mud slides oh god werent they horrible another friend of mine watched her house slide down a cliff just going going gone heartbreaking judy dabbed perfume at her wrists why do we live in california i hear its the weather laura said dryly in any case you might want to contact michael if you decide to get mandy a mount of her own actually we are considering it her birthdays coming up and theres nothing shed like better than her own horse lips pursed in thought judy replaced her perfume thanks for the tip ill talk to my husband about it meanwhile good luck with your old friend laura left the lounge in better spirits the evening was wearing on she was getting through it the least she could do was make an effort to enjoy what was left of it cooled off she jumped a little muffled an oath must the man sneak up behind her im sorry you looked ready to chew steel when you marched off to the ladies room michael handed her a fresh glass of champagne maybe it was indigestion i ran into a friend in there you women have little summit meetings in the john dont you isnt that why you usually go inside in packs actually we play poker and smoke cigars but my point is this friend of mine has a daughter and shes very keen on riding theyre considering buying her a horse i gave judy your name i hope you dont mind hey anytime you want to toss business my way feel free i like your brotherinlaw it showed i expected the two of you to have a secret handshake by now is that a subtle way of telling me i was ignoring you no she said it too quickly and then tried to backtrack not at all im glad you and byron hit it off she spotted him on the dance floor with kate and her eyes warmed theyre so happy together theyve only been married a couple of months but with some people you can just tell that the way they look at each other isnt going to change your romantic sides showing she didnt take offense im allowed to have one then i guess i should ask you to dance she looked up at him what the hell she decided then i guess i should accept before he could take her hand he saw her smile fade and freeze her color drain to white the hand that had lifted to take his fell to her side whats the problem she only took a quiet shaky breath hello peter candy laura michael shifted his hand instinctively moving to the small of lauras back to support her this must be the ex he realized with the perky cateyed redhead clinging to his arm he supposed this would be lauras type tall and golden distinguished perfectly presented in a tailored tux diamonds winking discreetly at his cuffs i didnt realize you were in town laura managed she knew though conversations continued that attention was focusing on the little tableau when i spoke to you about allisons school supper you indicated youd be away my plans changed a bit but im still not able to attend he said it formally as if declining an invitation to a polo match its very important to her peter just a few hours and my plans are important to me his gaze flicked to michael lingered in speculation i dont believe i know your escort michael fury and michael didnt offer a hand of course i thought i recognized you candy litchfields voice bubbled up michael is an old friend of josh templetons darling you ran away to sea or something didnt you or something michael said sparing her a glance her type had always grated on him overly bright overly vicious i dont remember you the statement had been calculated to deflate and annoy he usually hit his mark she bristled a little then purred well after all we didnt run in the same circles did we your mother was a waitress wasnt she thats right at templeton resort and my father ran off with a redhead i dont think she was related to you i shouldnt think so after sneering down her nose she looked back at laura now dont nag peter laura weve been so incredibly pressed weve hardly had time to catch our breath since we got in this morning weve been in st thomas how lovely for you but the fact is that these pesky domestic details do require some communication if youd she trailed off as her gaze lighted on the ring candy was displaying on the hand she deliberately fluttered against peters chest the stone was as big as a hens egg sitting atop a platinum tiffany setting satisfied that shed finally shifted lauras attention where she wanted it candy giggled oh dear youve found us out peter and i want to make the announcement quietly but im sure i can trust you to be discreet and miserable she hoped shed detested laura for more years than she cared to count and now she savored her moment of triumph every muscle in her stomach twisted as laura looked into peters eyes oh they were amused coolly amused congratulations im sure youll be very happy together i have no doubt of it candace was perfect for him he thought perfect for this new stage of his life just as laura had been perfect for another stage were planning a small ceremony in may in palm springs not too small candy pouted prettily but her eyes were gleaming as they stayed locked on lauras face mays such a lovely month for a wedding dont you think something charming and alfresco would be nice but not too small or informal after all a bride needs to show off a bit and youd know all about that lauras hands were threatening to tremble it couldnt be permitted are you planning on telling the girls about your marriage peter or is that up to me ill leave that to you im sure theyll be delighted candy purred as she slid a glass off the tray of a nearby waiter mine are little charles is very fond of peter and adrianna is thrilled with the prospect of a wedding how nice for you laura said stiffly but then charles and adrianna must be used to your weddings by now dont be snide laura peters voice was cool and mild it never suited you youll have to excuse us now we need to mingle steady michael murmured as they slipped away that bitch how am i going to tolerate that bitch being stepmother to my babies how am i going to stand it it surprised him that that would be her first thought then he realized it shouldnt have theyre bright girls laura and she doesnt strike me as the maternal type i cant stay here before she could dash he took a firm hold on her arm the way he drew her to him made it seem as if they were sharing secrets you run out now its going to look like retreat thats not what you want i cant stay here there was panic swirling inside her along with a bubbling brew of fury how could he do this how could he do this to them odd he thought that she couldnt see that both peter and candy had done it to her very deliberately and very well if im any judge everybody in this room is wondering just how laura templeton is going to handle this little meeting with her ex and his kewpie doll i think we should have that dance he was right of course he was exactly pathetically right however hurt however shocked there was still pride she wouldnt allow candy to snicker over her retreat okay she walked with him to the dance floor as if she wanted nothing more than a quiet turn the music was soft some moody number from the forties it was designed to be romantic she thought instead it rang in her ears like a battle cry shes not going to get her pinching little ringers on my babies laura said between her teeth i dont imagine shed get past you to pinch anyone if that was her goal it wouldnt hurt if you looked at me he slipped his arms around her found they fit well discovered her steps matched his smoothly maybe even smiled they only came here to slap at me neither one of them gave a single thought to the children shes a mother herself michael how can she not care about the children too much in love with herself stop worrying about it she isnt going to make time in her social calendar to play stepmama smile he murmured touching a hand lightly to her cheek you can make everybody believe youre only thinking about me and what were going to do when we leave here thatll burn their ass he was right again and she made her lips curve im sorry you got caught in the cross fire hell its just a flesh wound he was rewarded by a quick honest laugh youre nicer than i remembered michael and im a mess you look pretty neat and tidy to me you always did weve got them wondering now he bent his head so that his cheek brushed hers his mouth close to her ear just who is that guy laura templetons wrapped around how long has this been going on she was beginning to wonder the same thing herself not everyones that interested in my business his breath blew warm against her ear come on sugar you fascinate them cool composed laura its been poor laura for a little too long now her voice was tight again poor laura whose husband cheated on her with his secretary poor laura wholl have to hold her head up now that her ex is marrying her former cochair of the garden club jesus you played with that irritating little redhead he shook his head im disappointed in you tell you what now that theyre wondering why dont we give them something to talk about over brunch tomorrow his mouth slid around grazed her cheek before she could jolt from the shock of that it was fixed warmly on hers the kiss was long and slow her head reeled once and the hand on his shoulder flexed open and dug in he eased back barely an inch so that the only thing she could see was his eyes lets try that again he said softly i think youll get the hang of it she would have protested she wasnt the kind of woman who indulged in smoldering kisses in public or in smoldering kisses in private for that matter but his mouth was on hers again clever persuasive hot and she was swept along the rich male taste the firm knowing lips the confident exploration of tongue and rough scrape of teeth no one had kissed her like that before as if her mouth was the source of all pleasure something hummed in her throat that might have been shock but was more likely wonder as he had wondered what would she taste like feel like be like what he found was a banquet of contrasts heat filtered through cool armor shyness fluttering under composure she was trembling erotic little shivers that shot need straight to his loins and that reminded him that no matter how much he might enjoy the experiment they werent alone in a place where they could analyze the results that ought to do it he murmured it sure as hell convinced me she could do nothing but stare up at him somehow they were still dancing she knew her feet however disassociated they seemed from the rest of her were moving sugar struggling to keep it light when he would have been happier devouring her in a couple of quick bites he lifted her hand nipped at the knuckles you keep looking at me that way theyre going to have more to talk about than a couple of kisses she tore her gaze away stared determinedly over his shoulder you caught me off guard that makes two of us we can leave now if you want nobodys going to think its a retreat yes she kept her back stiff fighting to ignore the familiar and enticing way his hand continued to stroke it id like to go home she didnt speak again until they stood on the wide veranda of the entrance to the clubhouse one of the eager valets rushed off to fetch michaels car and they remained there sheltered with the lights and music behind them and the night moonswept and shadowed in front should i thank you jesus he rammed his hands into his pockets she was about as approachable now as polished marble did it seem like i was making a sacrifice ive given some thought to kissing you and if you want to step off that goddamn pedestal again for a minute youll admit you knew id given some thought to it im not trying to make you angry just a happy accident then laura he turned to her not completely sure of his next move then swore as the valet zipped his car up to the base of the stairs thats a beauty sir the boy said then beamed at the tip michael all but threw at him thank you sir drive safely calmer once he had the car racing away from the club michael took a breath look sugar you took a hard knock in there im sorry for it if you ask me that jerk you made the mistake of marrying isnt worth a minute of your time she wasnt asking him was she laura thought nastily im not concerned about me its the girls parents get divorced its a fact of life fathers take off and ignore their kids another fact thats very easy to say when you dont have children to concern you a shadow crossed his face no i dont have any children ive been one who lived through divorce and neglect though you get through it she shut her eyes shed forgotten that his father had left him and his mother im sorry but that doesnt make it right allison needs his attention and his disinterest hurts her what about you are you still in love with him no god no candys welcome to him shes just not welcome to my girls i dont see them giving her more than the patented templeton dismissal that small polite smile we dont do that oh sugar yes you do she shifted and aimed a steady glance at him do you know why you call womensugar michael that way when you roll off one in the middle of the night you dont have to remember annoying little details like her name his mouth twitched into something between a grimace and a smile close enough i guarantee ill remember yours laura if youre considering letting me roll off of you tonight she wasnt sure if she was shocked outraged or amused but she did know that most of the sting from peter had faded thats an incredibly flattering offer michael i dont know when ive had one quite so honest he suggested crude she finished im afraid ill have to decline up to you how about a walk on the cliffs instead on impulse he swung the car to the shoulder they speared magnetic moonkissed and entirely too romantic because she could envision herself walking them with him their hands clasped she shook her head im not wearing the right shoes for cliff walking then well just sit here a minute i dont think i have something to say to you nerves began to hum again she clasped her hands in her lap she was parked on a dark road in the moonlight something she hadnt done in too many years to count all right youre a beautiful desirable woman when her head snapped around and he saw her eyes wide and confused he nearly laughed i guess thats something you hear all the time it certainly wasnt which left her at a loss as to how to respond im flattered you think so i want you now there was panic fizzing up like champagne in a shaken bottle i dont what do you expect me to say to that god despite the shoes she wrenched open the door and stepped out into the night i didnt ask you to say anything im telling you he came up beside her and turned her to face him its probably a mistake but im telling you anyway i have memories of you i didnt realize how many until i saw you again and they just popped out of my head i used to think about you damned inconvenient and embarrassing to be thinking about you the way i was when you were the kid sister of my best friend josh would have kicked my ass for what i was thinking and id have had to let him im no good at this she moved back retreating quickly im no good at this sort of thing youll have to stop not till im finished i never stop until im finished keep backing up that way sugar laura he corrected himself as he grabbed her arm youre going to break an ankle i dont mind you being afraid of me id be surprised if you werent his grin flashed hell id be insulted just hold still a minute he held both of her hands at her sides and moved in im not going to hurt you he murmured as his mouth lowered this time it didnt hurt devastation came too quickly for pain he simply undid her with one soft lazy kiss then with another harder impatient until that reckless relentless mouth against hers chipped away at the wall of restraint and she knew that marriage hadnt prepared her for this kind of desire the kind that curled like raw ragged fists in the gut and twisted in angry frustration when she gave he wanted more he wanted her there atop the windy cliff with the moon spotlighting them and the violent thrust of the waves matching the way he imagined thrusting into her and he knew greed could be his undoing i want you to think about it he told her the horses taught me patience so ive got a small store where youre concerned it seems only fair to let you know that i want you it doesnt have anything to do with saving your face in front of the country club set or with making your idiot exhusband steam a little it has to do with you and me and its unlikely when its done that youll have to ask whether you should thank me i have children laughter he discovered could relieve even a great amount of tension christ almighty youve got great children laura but this is between you and me i let go of me and let me breathe will you she jerked away rubbing her hands through hair that the wind had tossed into curling confusion however shaken she was she felt the simplest way out was honesty i dont have any experience with affairs her voice was composed again but her hands continued to twist together i was married for ten years and i was faithful youve been divorced how long when she didnt respond he stared then he began to see what she was telling him thered only been one man which made her former husband even more of a fool in michaels opinion is that supposed to make me less attracted to you you know what it makes me laura it makes me want to toss you over my shoulder and find out if i still know how to pleasure a woman in a parked car he saw her glance toward his porsche and for a moment he was sure there was speculation in her eyes sugar id be willing to give it a shot when he stepped forward she risked a wrenched ankle and evaded him dont just dont she turned and stared out over the sea where waves slashed white against speared fingers of rocks it was a long fall she thought reckless jumps were always followed by long falls and she had never taken one i dont know how im going to react to this i dont know what im going to want to do about it think about it he suggested im going to be around for quite a while you want to neck in the car or do you want me to take you home now she smiled how could she help it another of those intriguing offers of yours ill take the ride home thanks your loss sugar chapter seven contents prev next and then mrs hannah said that everyone whod finished all their assignments could have extra time on the computer i picked the art studio so i got to draw a picture and print it out and everything then she put it on the board because she said it was excellent while kayla chattered about her school day michael continued to water brush his mares mane kayla had fallen into the habit of visiting him and hed discovered that if a day passed without her poking her head into the stables he felt deprived her mother on the other hand was keeping her distance he hadnt seen her in three days since the night of the country club dance mamas going to get me drawing lessons and thatll be fun because i like to draw pictures i can draw you one if you want id like that he sent her a quick smile what would you draw for me a surprise she beamed at him big people didnt always really listen kayla knew mr fury always listened even when he was busy do you have time to teach bongo a trick i might michael tapped the dampened water brush in his palm as he studied the pup who was currently sprawled on the brick eyeing one of the cats ive got to put this lady through her paces first though got somebody coming by to look at her kaylas bottom lip poked out as she reached up to smooth the mares glossy flank to buy her maybe understanding he crouched down she needs a good home like bongo did youre a good home he didnt think this called for an explanation of business the profitandloss ledgers that often made him crosseyed so he kept it simple i cant keep them all honey what i do is take good care of them while theyre here and look for people wholl take care of them when theyre not and your moms the one who found these people you know mrs prentice shes nice kayla gnawed on her lip as she considered she did like mrs prentice she had a fun laugh her daughter rides horses mandys fourteen and has a boyfriend does she amused michael tousled kaylas hair if they like the lady here and she likes them shell be their horse do you think mandy would take good care of her i guess so lets take her out to the paddock you and me ill get her blanket ill get it while kayla raced off he made a final check of his lady she was a pretty chestnut hack her coat gleaming now from his meticulous work with brush and currycomb her eyes were clear intelligent her heart strong her hooves healthy and smartly presented with a coating of oil at fifteen hands she was a good size well lined a cooperative wellbehaved animal who would bring him a good profit on his investment he was he knew as he stroked her neck going to miss the hell out of her together he and kayla saddled the mare with kayla watching every move carefully she hoped that one day mr fury would let her hook the cinches but she didnt want to ask yet wheres ali today oh shes in her room she has to clean it and finish all her homework she cant come outside today because shes being punished what did she do she had another fight with mama with the dog at her heels kayla skipped along beside michael as he led the mare out shes mad because our dads marrying mrs litchfield and hes not going to go to the fatherdaughter supper at school she says its mamas fault how does she figure that i dont know kayla shrugged her shoulders shes silly uncle josh is going to the supper and hes more fun anyway our dad doesnt like us the careless tone caused michael to stop glance down doesnt he no but thats okay because she trailed off bit her lip its bad what is darling she looked behind her toward the house then back into michaels eyes i dont like him either im glad he went away and that hes not coming back but dont tell mama now there was alarm and beneath it a silvery rush of defense honey he crouched down taking her little shoulders carefully in his hands he didnt hurt you did he he didnt hit you or your sister even the thought of it churned in his gut like acid or your mom no she seemed so baffled by the idea michael relaxed again but he never listens and he never plays and he made mama cry so i dont like him but dont tell i wont michael made an x over his heart then touched the finger to her lips how anyone particularly a father could not adore this fascinating child was beyond him how about a ride her eyes went huge hopeful can i can i really well lets see he picked her up set her on the saddle we have to see if the lady likes girls right he said as he adjusted the stirrups this heres an english saddle because thats what mandy uses take a rein in each hand no like this sugar he said and adjusted her grip thats the way patiently he explained the proper way to guide the mare while kayla listened in solemneyed concentration now heels down good knees in back straight with a hand on the bridle he led the mare into a sedate walk hows it feel up there miss ridgeway she giggled bounced im riding the horse now draw back on the left rein easy now the way i showed you see how nice she turns shes a good girl he had work to do calls to make and he forgot all of it for the next twenty minutes he indulged himself teaching kayla the basics hopping up behind her once to take the mare into a quick circling canter that had the child shrieking with delight the day might have been overcast more rain threatening but here was sunshine when he plucked her off and her arms wound tight around his neck in a hug he felt for the first time in his life like a hero can i do it again sometime mr fury sure you can with easy affection and trust she wrapped her legs around his waist grinning at him when mama gets home shell be so surprised i rode the horse all by myself and steered her and everything you sure did and now we know she likes girls shell like mandy so shell be happy im going to tell annie right now how i rode the horse thanks mr fury she wiggled down and raced off the pup scrambling after michael watched her stroking the mares neck youve done it now fury he murmured gone and fallen in love with that pretty little blonde he looked into his mares eyes kissed her sighed not supposed to fall for what you cant keep two hours later he repeated the warning to himself the prentices had fallen for the mare at first sight had barely bothered to dicker over his asking price now he had a check in his pocket and the lady was no longer his with mixed feelings he approached templeton house hed made a sale and that was part of his business the mare he had no doubt was going to be pampered and adored for the rest of her life and it was a sure bet that the prentices would spread the word that michael fury had good stock for sale he had laura to thank for it and he intended to do so the duty call would give him the opportunity to see her again to gauge how she reacted to him out of habit and a little fear instilled by the thought of encountering ann sullivan he wiped his feet outside the kitchen door his knock was answered by a harried call to come in when he did fear turned to pleasure mrs williamson was exactly as he remembered broad back to the room big capable hands stirring something wonderful on the huge sixburner stove the bowl of black hair atop her head wouldnt have stirred in an earthquake the room smelled of spices and flowers and the mouthwatering aroma of whatever she had in the oven got any cookies around this place she turned wooden spoon in one hand her wide face creased into a huge welcoming smile shed always had a soft spot for lost boys and bad ones well if it isnt michael fury himself i wondered when youd come knocking on my door ready to marry me now i might just be she sent him a saucy wink youve grown up handsome enough because with her hed always felt at home he crossed the room took one of her big hands in his and brought it to his lips name the time and place oh youre a one from anyone else the sound that bubbled out would have been called a giggle sit down there boy and tell me all about your adventures as she always had always would when one of her children came to visit she took cookies out of the bin arranged them on a plate selling horses now are we yes maam just did he patted his pocket while she poured his coffee thats fine then and you havent found a woman to suit you in all your travels ive been holding out for you he bit into a cookie rolled his eyes dramatically nobody bakes like you mrs williamson why should i settle for less than the best she laughed again and gave him a vigorous slap on the back that nearly sent him headfirst into his coffee oh youre a bad one michael so they always said you still do those apple pies the ones that bring tears of joy to a mans eyes if you behave yourself i might just send you one over she went back to her stove and her stirring our little kaylas been spending a lot of time down at the stables lately im going to marry her if you keep turning me down shes an angel isnt she she let loose a windy sigh allison too darling girl sweet as you please and bright as buttons on a new suit miss lauras done a fine job there and by herself too he never paid any mind to them when you want information michael mused as he took another cookie go to the source mrs williamson was a fount of inside information he isnt very popular around here i take it she sniffed loudly and why should he be id like to know fussy stiffnecked too good to say how do you do never gave a minute of his valuable time to those beautiful girls either and fooling around with his secretary and god knows who else on the side she pressed a hand to her heart as it swelled with outrage i shouldnt speak of it not my place but he knew shed speak of it plenty with a little prompting so ridgeway wouldnt make father of the year hah he wouldnt make father of the minute and as for husband well he treated our miss laura more like an accessory than a wife prissy about the staff too with his highfalutin ideas michael ran his tongue around his teeth laura stayed married to him for a long time she takes her promises and her duties seriously that girl was raised right near to broke her heart when she filed for divorce not that it wasnt the proper thing to do or that any of us regretted it for a blink good riddance i say and i said so straight out to mrs sullivan now hes going to be marrying that redheaded cat well they deserve each other i say to emphasize her sentiments she rapped her spoon on the edge of the pan letting the sound ring i bet ridgeway never got any cookies in your kitchen hah as if hed have lowered himself to come inside the room master of the house my eye my hearing may not be what it was but i hear what i need to hear so dont think i didnt know he tried to make miss laura pension me off so he could hire himself some fancy frenchman to cook his meals but she wouldnt do it her face softened as she turned back our miss laura knows about loyalty and about whats right shes a templeton and so are her girls whatever their name might be legal she stopped narrowed her eyes there youve done it got me blabbing and havent told me a thing you havent changed there michael fury nothing much to tell she still brewed the best coffee in central california he thought as he sipped and the templeton kitchen despite its grandeur and shine was still one of the coziest spots on earth been there done that now im back she could just imagine where hed been and what hed done still she saw in him what shed always seen a dark broodyeyed boy brimming with potential back where you belong you ask me been out gallivanting long enough seems like he agreed and took another cookie going to make your mark this time around are you thats the plan you come on down to the stables while im here mrs williamson he grinned wickedly ill give you a ride she threw back her head exploding with laughter just as the door swung open ann sullivan stepped inside the instant she spotted michael lounging at the table with cookies and coffee her mouth tightened i see youre entertaining mrs williamson the boy just dropped in to visit theyd worked together too long for mrs williamson to miss the icy disapproval or to pay any heed to it coffee mrs sullivan no thank you miss laura is in the solarium and would like some the door burst open behind her and kayla rushed in mama said to hi instantly distracted she ran toward michael jumped in his lap did you come to see us i came to talk mrs williamson out of some cookies and i needed to see your mom for a minute shes in the solarium you can go see her i drew your picture do you want to see you bet i do he kissed the tip of her nose grinned what is it a surprise eager she scrambled down im going to go get it im going to tell ali you came dont go away ann stood where she was as kayla bolted out if shed been blind she would have been able to recognize the easy affection between man and girl a considering look came into her eye she was far from ready to soften but she would consider you can go on to the solarium if you remember the way she said stiffly ill bring the coffee fine thanks he rose equally stiff until he turned to mrs williamson thanks for the cookies and that offer still holds get on with you he got on he remembered the way to the solarium the fact was he realized he remembered everything about templeton house walking down the polished hallway glancing into elegant rooms was like stepping back in time his time his youth this was a constant he thought the soaring ceilings and ornate moldings the carefully selected and lovingly tended furnishings the sweep of the stairway in the main hall the bowl of flowers set just so on a credenza candlesticks with their tapers burned down to varying heights in the parlor he noticed the quiet fire sizzling the hearth was lapis he remembered josh had told him that had explained to him about the deep blue stone there was a large crystal compote on the piano a floorspanning faded rug over the waxed wood flowers everywhere he observed fresh and dewy from garden or greenhouse not just hothouse roses but simple daisies sunny tulips their scents were subtle an elemental part of the air he knew the templetons had entertained with lavish parties in this house he had even been permitted to attend a few people as glamorous as gods had wandered through the rooms under the arching doorways spilled out onto flowerdecked terraces the house he had grown up in could fit into a single wing of this one with room to spare but it hadnt been the space that awed him or not as much not nearly as much as the beauty of it the way it stood looking out over cliffs and hills and banks of flowers the way the tower speared up into the sky and the windows gleamed with light day or night and the rooms inside streaming into other rooms with an openness a welcoming that hed never been able to analyze of permanence a statement that hed always understood said family mattered at least to the templetons despite its grandeur templeton house was a home and that he had never had shaking himself he moved through the short breezeway that led to the solarium there would be lush greenery there flowers in profusion padded chairs and lounges glass tables colorful mats the rain that had just started to mist would patter on the glass walls and you would see the fog rise over the cliffs it was exactly as he remembered the glass walls swirled with fog and rain lending the room a magical kind of intimacy a single lamp was lit casting a soft gold light music something with weeping violins that he didnt recognize spilled like tears from hidden speakers and there was laura curled on the pastel cushions of a highbacked wicker lounge sleeping perhaps it was the atmosphere the light the fog the music the flowers that made him feel as though he were stepping into a spellbound bower he was rarely a fanciful man but the sight of her sleeping there made him think of enchanted princesses castles and the magic of a kiss he bent over her brushed the hair from her cheek and laid his lips on hers she woke slowly as an enchanted princess should her lashes fluttered a faint flush rose to her cheeks the sound that sighed through her lips to his was soft lovely doesnt seem like a hundred years he murmured her eyes stayed on his heavy clouded unfocused michael now either we live happily ever after or i turn into a frog i can never keep the stories straight she lifted a hand to his face real she thought she wasnt dreaming as reality began to seep in her color deepened and she hastened to sit up i fell asleep i figured that one out and there were shadows under her eyes he hated knowing that worry over her daughter gave her restless nights long day yes concern for allison had given her some bad moments at three am but so had the man who was studying her now then there had been her convention duties at the hotel a glitch in a shipment at the shop and a headachy session of sentence diagramming in the homework division im sorry the words slid down her throat as his mouth cruised over hers again you made me think of fairy tales when i walked in here beauty sleeping thats sleeping beauty i know his lips curved i didnt have a close acquaintance with fairy tales but i think i caught the disney version somewhere lets see if ive got it right when he would have kissed her again she sprang to her feet im awake too awake she thought as her heart hummed in her throat too alive too needy i guess thats the best we can do for the moment i was in the kitchen charming mrs williamson out of her cookies i actually came by to see you but im weak no one can hold fast against her cookies well aware that she must look rumpled she tried to smooth her hair dont i like it mussed you never seem to be mussed you ought to catch me after convincing the girls it really is bedtime now but she made herself stop fussing kayla said that judy prentice was coming by this evening she did with her husband and her daughter who by the way is quite a horsewoman they bought a good mare i think theyll work out well together pleased for him she said oh thats wonderful michael congratulations he plucked a creamy white hibiscus from the bush beside the lounge and handed it to her i came by to thank you absurdly touched violently nervous she stared at the blossom i didnt do anything but mention your name but youre welcome judy knows a lot of the horse set im sure shell pass your name along im counting on it id like to take you to dinner she shifted away a full inch what im flush he said patting his pocket and i owe you no you dont it was just id like to take you to dinner laura id like to take you period but i think well have to do this along more conventional lines youve been avoiding me no i havent really or hardly at all ive been busy he imagined her social calendar was full enough committees ladies luncheons the jobs shed taken to fill her time i wouldnt imagine a templeton would scare off so easy it was exactly the right switch to pull it isnt a matter of scaring off i have a great deal to do then take another rain check you let me know when you can squeeze me in when he started to rise she touched his hand i dont mean to sound ungracious you he smiled thinly never i wasnt expecting you to move on you he suggested last time i checked i still had blood in my veins if youre not interested just say so i can probably take a no i dont know what i am but its not disinterested she resisted barely tracing the hibiscus along her cheek and i dont think im prepared to deal with that gleam you just got in your eye in fact i know im not im going to change the subject she drew a deep breath willing to accept the embarrassment of having him grin at her kayla told me youve been teaching her to ride is there a problem with that i guess i should have asked you no she dragged her hand through her hair again no theres no problem im very grateful that youd take the time and trouble i dont want her pestering you michael she doesnt pester me in fact im thinking about giving it ten or fifteen years and asking her to marry me her smile came fast and warm shes so easy to fall for shes so open and loving shes full of you mr fury this and mr fury that shes certain youre going to turn bongo into some sort of dog genius ill have to work on that thats what i wanted to discuss with you id like to compensate you for your time with kayla i stop he said it quietly the steel of temper a sharp edge beneath im not a servant i didnt mean that horrified that shed insulted him she rose again i only meant that if youre going to be taking so much of your time to its my time and ill use it as i please i dont want your damn money im not for hire as a friend for your kids or as a temporary father substitute or whatever the hell you have in mind now she went pale very pale of course not im sorry christ dont give me that wounded look you make me feel as though i kicked a puppy frustrated he jammed his hands in his pockets compensate him for christs sake the way you compensate a waiter for good service he should have expected it just leave it alone he spun away to stare out at the swirling fog keeping her face blank ann stepped inside with the coffee tray not by a flicker of the eye did she reveal shed heard a great deal of that last exchange your coffee miss laura the girls are on their way down if they hadnt been ann might have smothered conscience and eavesdropped a bit longer oh thank you annie she put a smile on her face kept it there as her children came in i believe kayla has something for you michael kayla held the picture behind her back as she approached if you like it you can hang it on your wall well lets see he took the heavy drawing paper from her stared damn kaylas face dropped comically automatically laura put a hand on her shoulder to comfort you dont like it kaylas head drooped i shouldnt have drawn it so fast but i wanted to do it while i remembered everything no its great when he looked up from the drawing his smile was huge i was surprised just like you said id be it looks just like the lady kayla just exactly like her really with her tongue caught between her teeth kayla peeked over to critique her own work usually i draw things i see in books or that are right there but i thought if you had to sell her you could have a picture so youd always remember her its beautiful and nothing like the childish drawing hed expected shed captured the mares springy gait in the movement the proud head he supposed a trained eye could find room for improvement things like perspective and range that he knew nothing of all he knew was that he was impressed and touched its my first original templeton if anyone noticed he hadnt used her legal name there was no comment kayla merely preened and slipped a hand into his ill draw you more if you want id like that a lot he scooted her onto his knee and looked at allison the older girl stared down at her feet obviously miserable you finish cleaning your room blondie her head came up and so did her color she eyed her sister and her sisters big mouth with disdain yes sir good i figured once you were off the breadandwater routine you might want to catch up with kayla here on the riding lessons her mouth fell open before she remembered her manners id like to learn to ride though it cost her she turned to her mother may i i think that would be a wonderful idea i may have to brush up myself before the two of you get ahead of me she laid a hand on alis shoulder the stiffness faded reluctantly but it faded thank you michael well see what we can do to meld our schedules mines flexible after a quick bounce he set kayla on her feet and rose but right now ive got to get back your coffee laura began ill take a rain check his smile spread slowly you know about redeeming rain checks dont you laura yes how did a mother handle sexual flutters with her two daughters looking on laura didnt have a clue thank you for coming by my pleasure ill see you out ali said with great dignity to his credit michael nodded gravely thank you ill go too mr fury do you think you can teach bongo to shake uncle byrons dogs can shake alone laura sat again as her daughters bright voice echoed away experimentally she pressed a hand to her stomach yes it was churning and to her heart yes it was pounding how did a woman with absolutely no point of reference go about redeeming a rain check for an affair she had absolutely no clue about that either chapter eight contents prev next the sun tore away the clouds and fog and the chill of coastal winter while reports of a midwest ice storm hit the news monterey enjoyed soft blue skies and a breeze that held teasing hints of spring on the cliffs the wind was rougher whipped in from the sea and tasting as laura always thought of adventure and romance the winter grass rustled and the waves roared fuming water like froth from a bottle of champagne once a young girl had died there through her own will an old man had grieved there through his own memories and somewhere gold hidden for more than a century waited to be found laura enjoyed the company and the leisure as much as the search nearly every sunday she and her friends and her daughters came here with the shadow of templeton house behind them to look for seraphinas dowry we could buy a horse when we find it couldnt we kayla looked up from her enthusiastic scraping with a garden spade from mr fury i know how to take care of a horse now he showed us you have to feed them and water them and brush them and clean out their feet hooves ali put in feeling superior you pick out their hooves and you have to exercise them too and muck out their stalls have you been mucking out ali ali shrugged her shoulders hoping the new earrings in her pierced ears showed off to their best advantage mr fury says its part of the job you dont just get on and ride you have to take care of them yes you do the fatherdaughter supper was behind them and ali had survived it laura touched alis hair when i was a girl and we had horses i mucked out my share of stalls i never minded couldnt we have some shed tried not to ask ali wasnt quite willing to forgive her mother for letting her father go away and marry some other woman mr furys going to build his own stables and house when he goes away hell take the horses well talk about it you say that when you mean no ali rose from her crouch i say that laura returned praying for patience when i mean well talk about it right now mr furys renting the stables and there isnt really time for another horse hed sell us one of his if you wanted if you really wanted ali turned her back and went over to where margo and kate ran the metal detector shes still mad because hes getting married soon kayla said hmm you know mama hes marrying mrs litchfield ill talk to her again though she could think of nothing left to say on the matter are you mad baby no i dont care if he marries her i dont know why he wants to when she has that mean smile and when she laughs it hurts my ears with an effort laura muffled a laugh of her own leave it to kayla she thought to sum up candy in such accurate terms people get married because they love each other or so shed once believed laura mused as she looked out to sea so shed once dreamed are you going to be in love with someone and get married i dont know dreams change laura reminded herself you cant plan these things i heard mrs williamson tell annie that mrs litchfield planned to catch dad in her trap and how he deserved it ah she cleared her throat she just meant that they were going to be happy together i guess kayla thought no such thing but was wise enough to let it pass im going to get some lemonade from the thermos do you want some that would be nice laura rose as well and wandered over to her friends im not skimming damn it blowing hair out of her face margo continued to run the detector im doing it the way i always do halfassed kate rolled her eyes as ali giggled sorry shes been hanging around the gym too much margo told ali picking up bad language along with locker room sweat youve got too much jewelry on kate complained youre going to send the thing into convulsions bitch and moan margo winced herself sorry ali here why dont you wear my bracelet a while can i thrilled ali watched her glamorous aunt transfer the heavy gold links then held up her arm watching the sun bounce off them its so beautiful it glitters whats the point in wearing it if it doesnt glitter she winked and flicked a finger at alis earlobe those are pretty mama got them for me i got an a on my science report she glanced toward her mother and her smile bloomed hesitantly she said i worked hard and deserved a reward you did and you did laura confirmed would you mind helping kayla get lemonade i think were all dry all right she took a step stopped would you like a sandwich it was an apology laura realized and though she wasnt hungry she smiled that would be terrific why dont you and kayla spread out the blanket and well take a break for lunch laura murmured as her daughter picked her way around rocks shes trying its hard for her to accept if i had the prospect of candy cane as my stepmother id find it more than hard kate muttered margo merely lifted one elegant shoulder candys too much in love with candy to give them the time of day and the girls are smart enough not to give her any more than that back i suppose it would be easier if they liked her a little then laura sighed and gave in and its probably selfish of me to be glad they dont but im glad they dont anyone want to take bets on how long the peter and candy show runs my take is a little dizzy kate sat down abruptly on a rock there it goes again are you all right kate had a history of ulcers and now laura leapt to her side is it a flareup no kate took easy breaths waiting for the world to settle yes there was the sky nicely blue and back in its proper place you know what i think im pregnant pregnant with a thud margo set the detector aside and crouched in front of kate how late are you have you taken a test late enough kate closed her eyes tried to analyze what she was feeling i bought one of those instant things at the drugstore i havent used it because im afraid itll say im not youre using it first thing tomorrow margo ordered and she cupped kates face in her hand to take a long look morning sickness not really a little queasy when i first get up but it passes she shifted her eyes the two of you stop looking at me with those smug knowing grins not a chance laura sat beside her what does byron say i havent mentioned it in case im wrong i dont want to be wrong she said shakily i know weve only been married a few months and we have all the time in the world but i dont want to be wrong another sure sign laura declared unstable and heightened emotions then she heard a voice slow deep and male and admitted that pregnancy wasnt the only cause of unstable and heightened emotions lust was definitely right up there in the running with her hand still on kates shoulder she got to her feet is this club for women only depends margo went to automatic purr on the man want to help us look for treasure michael you all would be pretty ticked if i got lucky and found it first shot after all the time youve put in he has a point kate reached up to pat lauras hand signaling that she was fine now anyway men just dont get seraphinas dowry do they mick seems to me if shed had one shed have been better off doing something with it instead of burying it somewhere and taking a header off a cliff see her point made kate rose im going to check out lunch rumor is mrs williamson made potato salad ill give you a hand enjoying the tension that had leapt into the air margo decided to let it hum she sent michael a quick wink before following kate id gone upstairs to make some calls michael began before laura could retreat looked out the window and saw five pretty girls scattered over the cliffs it was hard to think about going back to work without getting a closer look we try to spend a few hours out here every sunday so far weve found two coins or rather margo found one and kate found one the girls and i are batting zero is it important to you finding gold the hunts important and the mood she shifted her gaze to the sea the possibilities i imagine her there that young girl standing on the edge of the cliff thinking she had nothing left to live for theres always something to live for yes there is she did retreat the few bare steps the rocks allowed when he lifted a hand to her face i should help with lunch youre welcome to have some if you like i wanted to talk to you about the girls if you have a minute oh the wariness in her eyes became concern if theyre getting in your way laura he said patiently do you really think youre the only one who can appreciate their company no of course not annoyed with herself logic hampered by rampaging emotions she dropped her hands to her sides what is it ive been giving them a few pointers in the saddle kayla he glanced back grinning as he watched the little blond head bob shes a pistol shed be doing bareback jumps if i let her please laura shuddered my heart kid wants to gallop full out in the worst way wants everything full out you gotta admire that but she listens she learns im crazy about her laura blinked against surprise and sunlight she shes full of mr fury and his horses every time she comes back from the stables determined to relax she sat on the rock and barely jolted when he joined her shes starting to lose interest in her dance lessons i dont want to mess with your plans no smiling now laura shook her head she only wanted them because ali had them thats kayla always determined to keep up there were tiny blue flowers fighting out of a crack in the rock toward the sun in an absentminded move michael plucked one and offered it did you get her that drawing instructor surprise again flitted into her eyes how odd that he should remember those little family details as a matter of fact i did find someone she glanced down at the bloom in her hand wishing she could take those habitual offer of flowers as casually as he did shell start next week kids got real talent me the only way i can draw is with a ruler about ali shes going through a difficult time shes not as flexible as kayla or as resilient shes so easily bruised shell come around he took her hand playing with her fingers the riding lessons i dont know how far you want me to push it with a sigh laura studied her older girl sitting so ladylike on the ground beside margo if she isnt cooperating theres no reason for you to push anything laura shes a natural excuse me the kid sits a horse like shes been doing it all her life shes got this kind of baffling grace and she listens to me as if what im saying is etched in stone its scary if you want to pursue this for her you might want to look for someone with more experience in teaching than i have staggered laura stared at him she never says anything kayla comes back talking a mile a minute and ali just shrugs and says it was fine kaylas a bullet alis a song shell sing when shes ready how could he know her children so well she wondered how could he see inside and understand their hearts so well so quickly she trusts you laura said slowly trust isnt easy for ali these days if you dont mind id like you to stick with it she needs something so badly right now and i dont seem to have whatever it is annoyed he cupped a hand under her chin and turned her face to his youre wrong you have exactly what it is shes only blaming you because she knows youll take it youll be there he dropped his hand resisted getting up to pace he wasnt a damn shrink but anyone with eyes could see the woman needed something i went through a period when i blamed my mother for a lot of things but i never said it to her because i didnt know if shed take it i didnt know if shed be there perhaps that was how he saw she mused how he understood maybe its easier for you to understand her i never had anyone let me down my mother and father were are as steady as this rock never faltered never wavered never failed and she had done all of those laura thought faltered wavered failed it wasnt a simple matter to regain balance after youd been rocked then again he said watching her face maybe she blames you because you blame you get a grip laura youve never been married she shot back yeah i was six months he lifted a brow as he rose and i didnt fuck it up alone ill keep working with the kids he continued when she said nothing but ive got a condition hed been married her mind swung there back tried to keep up all right what is it stop hiding in the house come down and see what theyre doing amused at both of them he took the flower from her tucked it in her hair im not going to jump you in front of your children i havent been hiding and i never assumed your behavior in front of them would be inappropriate christ its fascinating to watch you click into that ladyofthemanor mode i dont know whether to pull my forelock or jump you after all cool as snowmelt she inclined her head id prefer you do neither now that weve spoken i certainly will come down and check on the girls progress i appreciate your bringing me up to date yes maam ms templeton sarcasm suits you michael he grabbed her arm before she could stride past him so do you he said it softly his face close to hers by christ so do you you want to be careful playing princess to peasant with me laura puts my back up makes me want to prove something you dont have anything to prove to me now let go of my arm when im finished he preferred her like this the challenge of her encased in ice the wounded woman made him feel weak and clumsy and eager to soothe let me remind you who youre dealing with in case youve forgotten he continued i like to break rules and if someone puts up a barrier i like to step over it just for the hell of it when im pushed i push back harder and meaner she didnt doubt it any of it the man who faced her now looked capable of anything sins crimes atrocities when she had time to think she would analyze what warped part of her was attracted to just that facet of him for now escape would have to substitute for valor i appreciate the reminder dont let me keep you from your work you wont in a rapid shift of mood that left her baffled he brought her clenched fist to his lips watching her he pried it open pressed his mouth to the palm dont forget sugar youre still holding that rain check he strolled off pausing long enough at the picnic blanket to steal a sandwich and make the girls giggle when there was enough distance and she was sure the heat had died from her cheeks she went over to join her family mr fury kissed your hand mama kayla announced just like in the movies he was just being funny laura took a glass of lemonade to ease her dry throat he was telling me how well both of you are doing with the riding lessons though her stomach was still jumping she casually chose a slice of apple i think hes enjoying them as much as you are theyre all right though she pretended disinterest ali studied her mother from under her lashes the hand kiss hadnt looked at all funny to her and her mother had a flower in her hair michael seems to think both of you are doing more than just all right you ought to get back into riding yourself laura delighted with the progress margo nibbled on a cube of cheese no that palm buss hadnt looked funny it had looked perfect ill think about it because she wanted to watch michael climb the hill back to templeton house she looked deliberately west out to sea she couldnt sleep being bonetired didnt seem to make any difference laura wanted to believe that it was because the night was so clear so full of stars that it would be a shame to waste it but she knew it was the dreams that kept her from bed she had begun to dream of him and the content the detail of the content both shocked and amazed her she could with concentration control her thoughts during the day but how could she control what snuck into her dreams they were so sexual erotic was too tame too formal a word for what went on in her head during sleep she should have been able to accept them laugh at them even share them with her friends but she could do none of those things quite simply she mused as she wandered the silent garden because she had done none of those things that her subconscious created that rough sweaty elemental sex was a far cry from the dreams of her girlhood except for those few scattered and shocking dreams shed had about michael as a girl those had been hormonal aberrations laura assured herself not wishes and they were best forgotten in any case most of her dreams had been soft lovely when shed imagined love in all its forms to be tender and sweet thered been no ripping of fabric no bruising hands or frantic cries of release in her innocent fantasies and none she thought with a grimace in the reality of her marriage peter had never torn her clothes dragged her to the ground driven her to screams he had long ago been tender almost sweet then he had been disinterested she would take the blame for that for being too inhibited too naive too rigid perhaps to inspire in him unthinking lust it was easier to accept and perhaps to start to forgive his faithlessness now that she understood those darker needs now that those darker needs had been awakened in her but dreaming of wild sex and acting on such dreams were still two different matters she slipped her hands into the pockets of her jacket breathed in the night and hoped to cool her thoughts before bed she would not go to michael whether it was cowardice or wisdom she would not go to him he was beyond her scope she decided as she walked through the arbor and studied the dark stables with the swirl of fog at their base he was both too dangerous and too unpredictable for a woman with her responsibilities and despite the years he had been joshs friend she didnt know him certainly didnt understand him couldnt risk him so she would be what she had been raised to be a strong woman who understood and met her obligations she would fill her life with what she had been so fortunate to be given children home family friends work she needed nothing else not even in dreams she saw the lights flash on in the apartment above the stables like a voyeur caught spying she slipped back into the shadows did he dream too she wondered of her did those dreams make him restless and achy and confused even as she wondered she saw him come bursting out of the door hair flying his boots echoed hard on the steps as he raced down them and into the stables she stood where she was a moment longer unsure but something was wrong a man like michael fury didnt run in a panic for nothing he was a tenant of templeton house she reminded herself and she was a templeton selfpreservation could never hold out against duty laura ran across the lawn with the moonlight chasing her there were lights on inside the stable now laura shielded her eyes against the glare but she didnt see him she hesitated again wondering if she should leave then she heard his voice the words low and unintelligible but the concern in them was clear she walked down the wide brick aisle and looked into the open foaling stall he was kneeling beside a horse his hair falling forward like a black wing to curtain his face his dark tshirt was rumpled and revealed arms toughly muscled and the faint shine of a thin scar above his left elbow she saw his hands wide tanned gently stroking the bulge of the mares heaving sides she had a moment to think that no woman on the brink of childbirth could ever want for more loving comfort then she was inside kneeling with him shes going to foal there sweetheart instinctively she went to the mares head its all right always in the middle of the night michael blew his hair out of his eyes i heard her upstairs guess ive been listening for her have you called the vet shouldnt need him last time he checked her out he said it should go smooth in an impatient move he tugged a bandanna out of his back pocket what are you doing here i was in the garden its all right baby she murmured shifting the mares head onto her lap i saw your lights go on and then you ran down here i was afraid something was wrong shell be fine but it was darlings first and he was as nervous as an expectant daddy pacing a waiting room go on to bed this sort of thing isnt usually complicated but its plenty messy she lifted both brows and the amusement in the eyes under them was clear and bright really i wouldnt know anything about that as ive only been through childbirth twice myself and when the stork arrived he was very neat and polite her attention shot back to the mare as a new contraction began all right now all right well get through this honey he doesnt know anything does he she murmured as the mare rolled painfilled eyes toward lauras hes just a man let him try it yeah let him try it once then well see what he has to say guess ive been told torn between worry and laughter michael rubbed his chin should i go outside and pace boil water buy cigars you could go make some coffee this could take a while i can handle this laura ive done it before you dont have to stay im staying she said simply and id like some coffee okay when he rose she noted that hed taken the time to zip his jeans but not to button them with twelve hundred pounds of horse in labor between them it was no time to have her mouth watering she looked back a little blindly at the mare i take mine black please ill be right back he paused at the stall door thanks i can use the help and the company shes special i know her lips softened into a smile as she looked up at him i can see that dont worry papa youll be handing out cigars by morning oh michael whats her name darling embarrassment didnt suit him but he shrugged shes darling yes she is laura continued to smile as his boot heels clicked on the bricks and so she murmured much to my surprise are you chapter nine contents prev next it wasnt precisely the way hed imagined spending the night with her when he allowed himself to think of it and he allowed himself often the circumstances were quite different yet here they were sweaty exhausted and united she had more stamina than hed given her credit for theyd been at it nearly four hours the mare rising to pace lying down again sweating as she moved from the first to the second stage of her labor laura hadnt wilted and while the coffee was beginning to jangle his nerves laura was calm as a lake why dont you take a walk she suggested she sat comfortably on the hay her arms circling her knees her gaze on the mothertobe im fine his brow creased as he wiped down the mare since hed tied his hair back laura could see his eyes perfectly youre a wreck fury okay okay he knew it he didnt care to have it pointed out to him though his eyes darkened moodily when they shifted to laura ive done this dozens of times not with her you havent shes holding up better than you are hell with it he decided and eased back a moment to stretch his back ill never understand why something this basic takes so damn long how do you stand it a woman in this position doesnt have much choice laura said dryly and you just focus everything on whats happening to your body inside your body nothing else exists wars famines earthquakes hell theyre nothing compared to this guess not he struggled to relax to remind himself that nature generally knew what she was doing first time i went through a foaling i thought of my mother figured i should have cut her more slack id rather have my tongue pulled out than go through this actually its more like having your bottom lip pulled out and over your head until it reaches the nape of your neck she laughed as he went white thanks for the visual it would do him good to talk she decided and until the mares water broke they had time your mother moved to florida didnt she yeah her and frank thats the guy she married about ten years ago you like him its hard not to like frank he just goes with the flow and manages to turn the current in his direction without making waves theyre good for each other up to him her taste in men sucked the divorce was hard on you no it was hard on her idly he picked up a shaft of hay spun it through his fingers then to lauras amusement he handed it to her as he had the flowers i dont suppose its ever easy divorce i dont see why something doesnt work it doesnt work my father cheated on her from the getgo never troubled to hide it she just wouldnt let go never could figure that either theres nothing mysterious about wanting to hold a marriage together there is when its a sham he wouldnt come home a couple nights running then hed show up shed rant and throw things and hed just shrug and plop down in front of the tv then one day he didnt come back at all ever we never saw him again michael im sorry i didnt realize though her hands continued to soothe the mare her attention was on him didnt matter to me or not much he shrugged but she was miserable and pissed and that made it hard to be around her i didnt spend much time at home for a couple of years hung out with josh drove mrs sullivan crazy thinking i was going to corrupt him she remembered him remembered well now that she allowed herself to those brooding dangerous eyes and her reaction to them my parents always liked you they were cool it was an eyeopener watching them you what went on in templeton house whole different world for a cliff rat like me and the world he was describing was different for her your mother married again she hooked up with lado when i was about sixteen i hated the son of a bitch i always figured she picked him because he was the opposite of the old man he was sloppy and mean and jealous gave her lots of attention michael muttered and his eyes were dark with memory lots of it he used to knock her around god he hit her she always denied it id come home and shed have a black eye or a split lip and make up some lame excuse about tripping or walking into a door i let it go you were just a child no i wasnt his eyes stormy now latched onto hers i was never a child by the time i was sixteen id already seen and done more than you will in your lifetime sugar it suited me fine did it she kept her eyes level or did it keep you from feeling helpless he nodded maybe both but the fact is mrs sullivan always had the right idea i was a bad companion and if josh hadnt been who and what he was we both would have ended up in juvie or worse fact is hes the reason i didnt im sure hed appreciate the testimony but id think you had something to do with that yourself for the first time in months he had a strong nagging urge for tobacco even patted his pocket before remembering that that part of his life was over you know why i took the hitch with the merchant marine no well ill tell you one night i came home been drinking a little me and josh and a couple of others down at the cliffs we were eighteen and stupid and id copped a sixpack from lado so i walked into the house feeling a nice comfy buzz and there he was that big fat bastard using his fists on my mother because she hadnt kept his supper warm or some such shit i wasnt going to let him get away with it figured it was my job to look out for her so i took him on absently he brushed a finger over the scar above his eye lauras glance flickered at the movement then held steady he outweighed me but i was young and fast and id already had my share of dirty fights i beat the hell out of him and i kept beating the hell out of him even when he was down and bleeding and unconscious and i couldnt feel my own hands pounding into his face id have killed him laura thats a fact id have beat him until he was dead and i wouldnt have looked back she couldnt envision it wasnt equipped to but she thought she could understand it you were protecting your mother started out that way but then i just wanted him dead i wanted to make him dead that was inside me i would have finished him if she hadnt stopped me and while i was kneeling over him while she was holding a hand to her face where it was bleeding and bruised she told me to get out michael she told me i had no right to interfere she said a lot of things along those lines so i got out and left her with him she didnt mean it how could a mother any mother turn on her own child it was impossible to absorb she was upset and afraid and hurt she did mean it laura at that moment she meant every word later she changed her mind she got rid of him and pulled herself together she got together with frank but by then i was gone and ive never really been back do you know where i went that night i left home no i went to templeton house i dont know why it was just there mrs williamson was in the kitchen she fussed over me cleaned me up she talked to me and she listened to me she fed me cookies on a long breath he rubbed his hands over his face he hadnt realized so much of that night was still inside him she probably saved my life i dont know what i would have done if she hadnt been there she told me i had to make something out of myself not that i had a choice or that here were my options just boy youve got to make something out of yourself shes always had a soft spot for you michael and he deserved one she thought now he deserved comfort and care and understanding poor lost boy she was the first woman i ever loved he plucked up another shaft of hay and to kill the urge for a cigarette chewed the tip if hed had a glimmer of lauras description of him he wouldnt have been amused hed have been appalled maybe the last woman he added she told me to go over to the stables and she went up and got josh he and i sat in this place and talked all night all fucking night every time i talked about doing something crazy hed steer me back with that cool lawyer logic of his the next day i signed up i stayed here in the stables until i shipped out here you stayed here josh never said anything about it maybe he understood client confidentiality even then he always understood friendship mrs williamson brought me food she and josh were the only ones i ever wrote to while i was gone she was the one who sent me word that my mother had kicked lado out i guess mrs williamson went to see her i never asked he shook it off grinned you know her cookies were my claim to fame on ship once a month this box would come full of them once i was losing my shirt in a poker game and anted up her what do you call them snickerdoodles walked away flush shed like hearing that taking the chance she reached over the mares neck and touched his hand anyone mrs williamson takes under her wing deserves it she recognizes fools and she doesnt suffer them youre a good man michael he studied her saw his advantage in her eyes i could let you think that and get you into bed quicker then he smiled im not a good man laura but im an honest one i told you what ive only told two other people in my life because i figure you ought to know what youre getting into ive already decided for a variety of reasons that im not getting into anything youll change your mind he shifted winked cockily they all do and the horses water broke in a gush that soaked the bedding zero hour he snapped nerves jangled keep to her head laura jolted back the fatigue the almost dreamlike state shed drifted into while he was talking now burst into an adrenaline rush the first flood of fluid didnt alarm her it was a natural process just as the mares plaintive whinnies were part of the whole a process she had shared in and one though the mares eyes rolled in fear and pain that laura knew she longed to experience again laura buckled down to the task at hand following michaels terse orders without question and issuing some of her own here it comes hold steady darling almost over he knelt in blood and birth fluid laboring as hard as his mare and those long thin forelegs appeared ive got to give her a hand here turn it some where was the damn head you got her yes ive got her sweat dripped into her eyes do it shes exhausted its coming he got a grip on the slippery gleaming limbs and reached inside the birth canal to rotate and ease there lying along the forelegs was the head come on darling just a little more just a little more oh god now there were tears mixed with the sweat on lauras face as the foal slid out there he is once the foals shoulders were clear michael cleaned the membrane away from the nose the foal was wet still attached by the umbilical cord though michael wanted to pull it clear see for himself he waited with laura as the foal struggled free of the birth sac and the cord broke as nature intended for a while there was no sound in the stall but the mares steadying breathing and her first soft delighted whinny as she understood she had a child hes beautiful laura murmured just beautiful she grinning michael swiped at the sweat on his face we got ourselves a girl here laura a beautiful girl god bless you darling look what you did she looked and with a mothers instinct climbed to her feet and began to clean her baby its lovely every time laura murmured easing back so as not to interfere with the bonding youre not disappointed she asked michael no stud shes got four legs and a tail doesnt she and her mothers coloring apparently youre not she laughed delighted with the look of stunned joy on his face and held out a formal hand congratulations papa the hell with that riding high he yanked her into his lap and crushed his mouth to hers instantly breathless and dizzy and weak they were covered with sweat and blood punchy from a night without sleep the hay beneath them was filthy the air thick and ripe and they were locked together like hope and glory hed meant it only to share with her that heady exuberance to thank her in his way for being a part of the moment but he sank into her into the need into the heat into those silky limbs that clung as though she were suspended over a cliff and he was her only salvation he was murmuring something a jumble of the wild and reckless thoughts that jammed into his head his hand streaked up her hip closed possessively over her breast she bucked arched moaned steady he used the same patient soothing tone he had with the laboring mare but his teeth nipped at her jaw scraped over the rampaging pulse in her throat and made the quiet order impossible i cant cant breathe cant think cant let go michael dazed she pressed her face against his throat i cant he could he thought as the ache spread viciously he could and more but hed chosen his time and place poorly shed stood by him through the night he reminded himself taking advantage of her now as he was only proved that even an honest man could lack integrity i wasnt angling for a roll in the hay he kept it light whatever it cost him relax careful to keep his hands gentle he shifted her look our little girls growing up already the hands laura clenched in her lap slowly loosened as she watched the foal struggle to her feet after a few comical spills she gained them have you laura wiped her palms hard on the knees of her slacks to ease the tingling have you chosen a name for her no he tortured himself a little by sniffing her hair why dont you shes yours michael the three of us brought her into the world together what do you want to call her she leaned back against him and smiled the foal had already learned how to suckle i had a mare when i was a girl her name was lulu lulu he chuckled and buried his face in her hair her eyes closed as he nuzzled and her heart tilted i rode her over the hills and into dreams lulu it is he got to his feet pulled laura to hers youre pale he brushed a thumb over her cheek almost expecting it to pass through like a mist the closer it got toward morning the more fragile you looked and the more i wanted to touch you im not going to be able to give you what you want you havent got a clue what i want if you did you wouldnt have let me within a mile of templeton house but since both of us are too tired for me to explain it now youd better go get some sleep ill help you clean up no i can handle it im not that tired laura and youre too damn tempting go away all right then she stepped out of the stall and looked back he stretched a long lean male wearing black with snug jeans unbuttoned at the waist everything that was female in her stirred and yearned michael yeah his eyes were heavy she noted exhausted but they still focused on her in a way that made her blood tingle no ones ever wanted me the way you seem to i dont know how i feel or what to do about that those exhausted eyes went hot thats not the kind of statement designed to make me want you less quick as a snake and deadly he reached out and snagged her by the shirt front his free hand circled her throat squeezed lightly as his mouth came down hard on hers when he let her go she stumbled back her eyes clouded with arousal and panic go away laura he repeated youre not safe here she walked blindly out of the stables into the white flash of morning her bones felt bruised her mind battered lifting an unsteady hand she brushed her fingertips over her swollen mouth felt him there tasted him there even as she walked toward templeton house she looked back over her shoulder and wondered if she wanted to be safe after all she always had been hadnt she and her life hadnt been a rousing success so far then again she had the unsettling feeling that she was thinking with her glands not with her head god knew thats what she felt like now one enormous pulsating gland that was a new experience and she wasnt sure if she wanted to explore it further before she could decide she stepped into the kitchen and all hell broke loose miss laura my god ann leapt at her while laura goggled in shock she was embraced fiercely yanked back patted down and shoved into a chair at the kitchen table what did he do to you that monster that spawn of the devil where are you hurt my baby eyes wild ann smoothed lauras tousled hair patted her pale cheeks i knew thered be trouble with the likes of him around but never did i imagine ill kill him kill him with my bare hands see if i dont what who shes in shock mrs williamson the poor lamb fetch the brandy now mrs sullivan calm yourself calm myself calm myself would you look at what hes done to our miss laura after wiping her hands on her apron the cook bustled over from the stove what happened darling i was just ill tell you what happened ann interrupted the light of vengeance swordbright in her eyes that man happened thats what anyone can see she tried to fight him off oh hell pay he will when i get through with michael fury there wont be anything left to scrape off the bottom of a shoe michael maybe it was fatigue laura thought hazily hadnt she just left michael what did he do her lips in a thin grim line ann sat took lauras hands in hers now dont be ashamed and dont worry none of it was your fault all right laura said slowly what wasnt my fault sweetheart obviously the poor girl was trying to block out the horror of it ann thought lets get your clothes off and see how bad things are im praying thats his blood on your clothes blood laura glanced down looked at the mess of her cotton shirt and slacks oh lord and it began to come clear oh lord she said again and let out a long wild laugh the brandy mrs williamson fetch the brandy no no no fighting for control laura grabbed ann before the housekeeper could spring up to exact revenge its not my blood annie or michaels either the foal she hiccupped managed to get a grip on herself i helped michael birth a foal last night well then satisfied mrs williamson went back to her cooking a foal suspicion still gleamed in anns eyes you were down at the stables birthing a foal yes a filly a beauty she sighed and was tempted to lay her head on the table and drift off every drop of adrenaline had drained leaving only floaty exhaustion its a messy job annie i suppose michael and i both look like weve been in some sort of bar fight oh shaken and mortified ann rose ill get you some coffee then ive had about all the coffee my system can take for the next couple of years she sobered then took anns hands again annie im surprised at you michael wouldnt hurt me ive told her the boys got gold in him mrs williamson put in but will she listen i know a rogue when i see one this rogue laura said quietly spent the night worrying over a horse hes taking his own time to teach my children to ride hes kind to them and attentive and from what ive seen of the stables and his stock he works harder than two men ann remembered the way little kayla had run to him and his easy response but she set her jaw she knew what she knew a leopard doesnt change his spots i say maybe not but a man can remake himself if hes given the chance however you feel about him he is for the moment part of templeton house dragging herself to her feet laura rubbed her hands over her gritty eyes now i need a shower and a little when she dropped her hands her gaze fell on the clock over the stove oh my god seventhirty how can it be seventhirty ive got a nine oclock meeting the girls are they up dont you worry about the girls ann told her ill see that theyre dressed and taken to school this morning you just cancel that meeting miss laura and go to bed cant its important ill make sure theyre getting dressed and grab a quick shower i can drop them at school on my way to work see that they have their breakfast please annie and yours missy but laura was already at a dash just coffee thanks i dont have time taken on too much mrs williamson clucked as she whipped up batter for waffles keeps this up shes going to drop flat on her face before much longer you mark my words and she wouldnt mind it if a certain young rogue caught her when she did she wouldnt mind it one little bit shouldnt have been up all night worrying over someone elses business mrs sullivan youre a fine woman but youre as stubborn as six mules when it conies to certain matters and while you mark my words ill wager a months pay youll be eating your own soon enough well see about that wont we miffed ann poured coffee for laura and prepared to take it upstairs that boy is trouble if he is mrs williamson said placidly its the kind of trouble a smart girl dreams of having wish id had more of that sort of trouble in my life as ann sailed out streaming dignity behind her mrs williamson hummed a bright tune it wasnt that she didnt believe thered been a foal born in the night it was simply that ann sullivan preferred to see with her own eyes she marched to the stables grudgingly carrying the basket of muffins mrs williamson had pressed on her if she had her way michael fury wouldnt be eating from the templeton house kitchen for long she looked up at the apartment first frowning a bit as she noticed the fresh paint on the trim just trying to ingratiate himself that was all she thought making himself handy and agreeable until he could wreak havoc well he could pull the wool over everyones eyes but hers she strode into the stables something she had avoided doing since michaels arrival surprise came first the place was tidy as a drawing room and smelled not at all unpleasant of hay and horses she jolted when max poked his head out and bumped her shoulder in greeting lord save us youre big as a house but his mild eyes made her smile and checking over her shoulder first to make certain she was unobserved she stroked his silky nose what a pretty boy you are are you the one who does all the tricks the girls are forever talking about hes one of them when michael stepped out of the foaling stall down the block ann dropped her hand and cursed herself for not looking around more carefully want to try him out thank you no stiff as a lance she moved forward mrs williamson sent you some muffins yeah he took the basket chose one steam poured out when he bit in he could have whimpered in gratitude the woman is a goddess he said with his mouth full i dont think youre playing red riding hood delivering goodies to the wolf mrs sullivan a lot you know about fairy tales she was waylaid by the wolf an innocent girl on her way to her grandmothers i stand corrected because she put his back up every bit as much as he put up hers he went back into the stall to finish medicating the lactating mare and her foal thats a finelooking horse she is they are had a long night didnt you darling the stall didnt look like the site of a long messy birth the straw was clean as a whistle and both mother and child were well groomed since it had been only an hour since laura had stumbled into the kitchen it seemed the boy hadnt been wasting his time youve had one as well mr fury from what im told im surprised youre not snoring in your bed i hope to be as soon as i finish up here the horses need to be fed and watered first because he knew it would annoy her he grinned over his shoulder want to give me a hand i have my own duties to see to youll keep your own house and he was apparently keeping it well she admitted tidy habits earned anns respect but apparently you had no problem imposing on miss laura and keeping her up through the night satisfied that mother and child were settled he moved out skirted around anns rigid form and began to deal with the feed no i didnt the girl needs her sleep well shes getting it now shes on her way to monterey the scoop paused grain dribbled as he turned back to her thats ridiculous she was up all night she had an appointment this morning she was exhausted i know it she was surprised that he did and that he seemed so annoyed stupid he thrust the scoop back into the grain bin she could get her hair or her nails done later get her hair done her nails disgusted ann slapped her hands on her hips if thats what you think miss laura is about youre stupid and ive never thought otherwise shes gone to work you baboon at the hotel and this afternoon shes going to work at the shop then if shes able to stand after you kept her up all night with your horse shell tend her children then shell she owns the damn hotel he shot back and the damn shop and i imagine both could stand if she took a lousy day off she takes her obligations seriously and shes got children to raise doesnt she tuition to pay for clothes and food to buy bills to pay templetons dont work for paychecks laura templeton does do you think shed live off her family do you think that even after that heartless bastard took all her money shed go crying to her parents what are you talking about took all her money as if you didnt know now she sneered as if all of big sur and monterey and down to carmel dont know that that man all but emptied all their bank accounts and the stocks and bonds and properties before the divorce ridgeway his eyes flashed dark sharp swords tilted for battle why isnt he dead ann sucked in a breath on this at least she could agree even with a rogue but she had said more than shed intended it isnt my place to gossip with a stablehand im not a stablehand and youve never let your place stop you when it comes to me why did they let ridgeway get away with it josh could have stopped it the templetons could have crucified him its miss lauras business and her choice ann folded her hands and closed her lips it doesnt add up he took the grain to max who was waiting patiently shes got to have family money to wade in shes got that house and servants nobody lives like that and worries about pennies ann made a derisive sound miss lauras financial business is none of yours michael fury but if youve been thinking to soften her into letting loose of some of her money in your direction youll have to look elsewhere she recognized black fury in a man when she saw it and also the rigid control that prevented it from spewing out shed expected the first but never the second so warned he said and went back to feeding his horses she started to speak again had that been hurt beneath the boiling temper no she refused to believe it of a man like him still she bit her lip wondering how her words would taste if she was wrong and did indeed have to eat them ill leave you to your business when she left he continued to measure grain precisely then the scoop flew out of his hands smashed against the stable wall with enough force to snap its handle off in the stalls several of the horses stirred nervously max stopped eating long enough to look out and study his master fuck me michael murmured and rubbed his hands over his face ive got enough to do goddamn woman should be in bed he picked up the scoop threw it again then went to find a new one chapter ten contents prev next by two in the afternoon laura had entered a new phase of exhaustion it was almost pleasant the way she seemed to float just an inch or so off the ground and the way the air around her seemed rather soft and fluid shed handled her meeting with the conference chair for the writers convention had briefed her staff one last time for the influx of guests that would be arriving over the following two days and had checked and rechecked the details with the banquet manager maintenance and shipping catering room service and housekeeping at one shed fueled herself with coffee and a candy bar and headed out to pretenses the one bright spot in the day had been kates semihysterical call just as laura was racing out of the shower that morning its pink it turned pink im pregnant byron put me down did you hear laura im going to have a baby shed heard and theyd laughed together wept a little now kate was wandering in a dream state around the shop how about guinevere if its a girl kate wondered byrons family has this tradition of choosing names from literature guinevere was a weakmoraled round heel margo commented she boffed her husbands best friend but if thats the kind of thing you want ive always liked ariel laura put in from the tempest ariel de witt kate took a notebook out of her pocket and jotted it down names were a serious matter she thought and had to be considered from all angles had to sound right look right feel right hmmm this one definitely had potential not bad she pocketed her reading glasses as she looked at laura lauras nodding off again im not caught she jerked her lolling head up struggled to focus what the hell had they been talking about names she said quickly as though it was a pop quiz girl names for the baby out of literature hester juliet delilah and your prize for the correct answer is a complete home entertainment center kate arched a brow would you like to move on to round two and try for the trip to honolulu very funny laura resisted rubbing at her eyes like a cranky child i rather like juliet well put it before our distinguished panel of judges laura take five before you fall on your face and if anyone knows the consequences of overextending herself margo put in its our pregnant pal with the dopey look in her eyes why dont you go in the back and catch a quick nap as she studied laura margo polished glassware spending the night with michaels bound to sap a womans energy laura winced and looked around to see if there were any customers within hearing distance i told you we were birthing a foal not tearing up the sheets which only proves youve got your priorities skewed kate i think that customers ready for a little push margo nodded toward a man contemplating snuffboxes hes got his eye on you she added when kate walked away the customer michael laura michael if you dont have yours right back on him you need to visit your optometrist i dont have time for all right maybe ive looked margo set down a waterford water glass and turned away progress she thought at long last and are you ready for a little push laura blew out a breath he wants to he wants me surprise surprise no i mean he said it just like that how do you respond to something like that there are a variety of ways lets see i believe ive tried them all margo tapped a finger on her cheek which of margos ploys would you prefer im not looking for a ploy because her knees kept disappearing on her laura sat down on the stool behind the counter margo ive slept with one man in my life i was married to him for ten years i dont have any ploys or ways or answers no ploys maybe and good for you but every woman has ways and i think you have answers try this question are you attracted to him yes but the answer is yes margo interrupted and kept one eye on a pair of customers contemplating the jewelry in the display along the side wall you are a responsible unattached adult female who is attracted to an attractive unattached adult male that works fine if youre a rabbit it can work fine for people too laura there arent any guarantees you certainly know that yes you could be hurt you could also be happy or you could just get your oil checked snorting laura shook her head sex has always been easier for you than me i wont argue that but im not particularly proud of it i didnt mean i know you didnt ive slept with more than one man some of them were married to someone else sometimes it meant something sometimes it didnt she could shrug it off now without regret or recriminations because she understood that everything shed ever done had carried her toward where she was now josh is the only one who really mattered because you love each other laura said quietly were not talking about love between michael and me its just plain lust and whats wrong with that i can usually figure out whats wrong with it until he puts his hands on me or kisses me as far as margo could see that was an excellent sign and then then i just want and ive never wanted like that everythings too hot too fast she shifted uneasily even thinking about it stirred something inside her its not comfortable hallelujah with a chuckle margo leaned closer surprise yourself laura go down to the stables some night and jump him right thats just what i planned really margo i could use some sensible advice here sensibles for retirement plans miss one of the customers signaled could i see this pin please of course taking up the keys margo moved away oh dont you adore art deco thats a fabulous piece i found it at an estate sale in los angeles they said it once belonged to marlene dietrich laura scanned the shop stifled a yawn they were busy she noted but not overwhelmed maybe she could sneak in a quick catnap she slid off the stool wandered toward a customer to ask if she needed help prayed the answer would be no and then the door opened peter she stopped in her tracks i called your office at the hotel they indicated i would find you here yes this is one of my regular afternoons at pretenses interesting he hadnt been in before had purposely stifled his curiosity about his exwifes little venture into shopkeeping now that he was here he took a slow measuring study candys description of the shop as a jumble of secondhand junk hadnt been quite accurate then again understanding his fiancées feelings toward laura and her partners he hadnt expected it to be still neither had he expected to find the place charming peopled with welltodo clientele as well as the tourist trade he hadnt expected to be intrigued by the displays and more than a little envious of the merchandise well she recognized the appraisal what do you think its different isnt it certainly a change of pace for you he looked at her again still cool and lovely he mused odd hed never have believed laura or either of her friends had the brains the wherewithal or the imagination to create something so appealing so successful its not a change of pace any longer she refused to allow the way he studied her and hers to upset her it is the pace i suppose youre enjoying the distraction its a business peter not a distraction why should she expect him to understand pretenses hed never understood his wife perhaps she thought he would deal much more comfortably with the new wife hed chosen i doubt you came in to pick up a gift for candy she doesnt care for our stock as a rule no i came to speak with you he looked around again noted the twisting staircase the open balcony then he spotted margo watching him with a cold look of calculated dislike he certainly didnt have to tolerate silent abuse from the daughter of a servant do you have an office a private office we can use we use most of our space for merchandise there was an office of course but she wasnt willing to speak with him in the shop it was hers it was not to be soiled with personal problems why dont we take a walk outside margo ill be back shortly if thats what you want margo smiled thinly at peter be sure to give our best to your fiancée peter kate and i were just saying how delighted we are youve found your match im sure candace will find your sentiments entertaining laura merely shook her head at margo to forestall another pithier comment i wont be long she opened the door herself waited for peter to step through onto the veranda he didnt care for cannery row or what he considered its carnival atmosphere it was crowded noisy inconvenient this is hardly private laura she smiled at the people strolling on the sidewalk the busy families the snarled traffic nothings so private as a crowd without asking him what he preferred she moved to the curb to wait for a break in traffic we find the location quite a plus we lure in a lot of browsers who come to the wharf or wander down after a tour of the aquarium idly brushing her hair back as the breeze teased it she started across the street wanting to be closer to the sea and of course its pleasant being able to take a break now and again and come out to watch the water feed the gulls youll hardly keep a business afloat by daydreaming over the sea were managing she leaned on an iron rail skimmed her glance over waves and boats gulls fluttered and sent a young girl into excited laughter when they landed one by one on her knee as she sat with a bag of crackers what do you want peter to discuss allison and kayla all right she turned to him leaned back allison is doing very well in school her grades are exceptional im sure youd approve kaylas having a little trouble with math but were working on it thats hardly what i excuse me im not finished she knew he wasnt interested but she was revved ali played clara in the nutcracker production put on by her ballet class last december she was beautiful and she cried afterward because her father hadnt come as hed told her he would i explained that i had a conflict yes you did kayla played one of the mice and she didnt care particularly whether you were there or not i believe ali will continue the dance lessons and should be en pointe in another year kaylas losing interest but her drawing is improving every day theyre also taking riding lessons now from michael fury hes very impressed with both of them kayla had the sniffles a few weeks ago but they didnt slow her down for long oh and ive gotten them a puppy and two kittens he waited a beat are you done theres quite a bit more actually theyre active growing children but that should cover the high points for now i came here hoping to have a calm and civilized discussion not to be treated to one of your diatribes laura that wasnt even close to a diatribe peter but i can oblige you he shifted irritated when someone bumped his shoulder candy and i are to be married in just over eight weeks in palm springs allison and kayla should attend is this a demand or an invitation people will expect the children to be there candy is making arrangements for her children to attend her au pair will bring them down the day before the ceremony allison and kayla can travel with them how civilized she thought and how cold you want them delivered by candys au pair and returned the same way i suppose its sensible and its convenient and it wont infringe on your time at all she held up a hand before he could speak im sorry im tired and apparently shorttempered im sure the girls would appreciate being included if youd call tonight i have plans i hardly see the necessity of running through the details again she turned away looked once more out to sea she could and would bury her own resentments and try once again to give her daughter what she needed peter ali is very hurt very confused and very afraid you so rarely come to see them or call she feels abandoned weve been over this before laura and he considered himself infinitely patient for listening to it all again you wanted the divorce now its done settled theres been adequate time for her to adjust i have my own life to think about and do you ever think of the children he sighed checked his rolex he could spare ten minutes more and no longer you always expected more than i found manageable in that area theyre not an area theyre children she whirled around stopped herself from spewing out all the resentment the bitterness and simply looked at his face so handsome she thought so cool so composed so perfect you dont love them do you peter you never did simply because i refuse to dote on them to spoil them as youve chosen to do doesnt mean i dont understand my responsibilities thats not what i asked surprised at herself she laid a hand on his arm peter its just the two of us here weve neither of us anything to lose at this point so lets be honest lets put this in its place so that we can stop going over the same ground again and again and accomplishing nothing its you who insists on going over the same ground he reminded her all right i keep going over it arguments were useless and she admitted just too tiring i want to understand i need to its no longer a matter of what you did or didnt feel for me or i for you theyre children our children help me understand why you dont want them for a moment he stared down at the hand on his arm delicate hed always found that delicacy appealing the fact that there was steel under it had been both disconcerting and disappointing and perhaps if they cleared up this matter she would stop her constant requests that he flex his schedule to meet her expectations im not father material laura i dont consider that a flaw simply a fact all right though her heart ached she nodded ill accept that but peter you are a father your definition of that term and mine are essentially different my responsibilities are met he said stiffly you receive the child support payments every month and they were banked she thought into the college funds that he had emptied before the divorce is that it a financial burden an obligation thats all there is for you im not a doting parent and never have been i thought once that i would do better with sons that i wanted them he spread his elegant hands the simple truth is that it doesnt matter now we didnt have sons and i dont want more children candys are well tended polite and dont require my attention i dont believe allison and kayla require it either theyre being raised well and comfortably in a good home like poodles she thought as pity stirred the answer is you dont love them i dont feel the connection youd like me to he angled his head to look down at her lets both be honest laura theyre more templeton than ridgeway more yours than mine thats always been true it didnt have to be she murmured theyre so beautiful miracles im so sorry you cant take what they would give you and i would say that all of us are better off the way things stand i was angry initially when you insisted on divorce angry that it cost me the position i had earned at templeton but over the past few months ive come to see that it was inevitable i enjoy the challenge of running my own hotel and frankly candace is more the kind of woman who suits my needs and my nature then i hope youre happy really she shuddered out a breath do you really want the girls at the wedding peter or is it for form if they choose not to attend its a simple matter to make the proper excuses all right ill talk to them leave it up to them ill expect to hear from you by the end of the week if were done i have an appointment shortly he glanced back across the street with the air somewhat cleared between them he chose to be magnanimous your shop is very impressive laura i hope its successful for you thank you peter she said when he turned to leave her people milled around them but they didnt matter she remembered a magical night with moonglow drifting through the gazebo and the scent of flowers and the promise of a dream did you ever love me i have to know i also have my life to think about he looked at her standing with the sea at her back the sun glinting off her hair her skin pale and fragile until the words were out of his mouth hed had no plans to tell her the truth no no i didnt love you but i wanted you a heart could break again she realized as she nodded and turned back to the sea it could break again and again and again the minute she walked back into the shop kate pounced upstairs what dizzy with fatigue and grief laura let herself be hauled up the winding steps upstairs and into bed but were open the boudoir is closed for the rest of the day in the boudoir kate pushed her onto the slippery satin quilt on the big bed and knelt to pry off her shoes you get in turn it off i dont want you thinking about anything anything especially whatever that creep said to upset you odd laura mused her vision was all gray at the edges like a screen narrowing he never loved them kate he told me he never loved my babies he never loved me dont think about it in sympathy kates eyes began to swim dont worry go to sleep i feel so sorry for him so sorry for all of us im so tired i know i know honey lie down fussy as a mother hen over a sick chick she smoothed the covers over her friend sleep she sat on the side of the bed took lauras hand i used to dream about the way things would be so perfect so lovely shh kate murmured even as lauras voice trailed off dream about something else find a new dream is she out margo said from the doorway yeah kate sniffled and wiped her cheek and thought of the child inside her of the man shed loved and married who already cherished it and her i hate peter fucking ridgeway stand in line margo stepped in to lay a hand on kates shoulder when she walked back in she looked so broken i could kill him for putting that look in her eyes stand in line kate echoed shell be all right well make sure of it lauras mind was still fuzzy with fatigue when she returned home she thought briefly about a long steaming bath cool smooth sheets and oblivion but she needed her children and needed them badly she found them as shed expected to at the stables bongo greeted her first racing forward with his tongue lolling out in a grin he skidded to a halt at her feet promptly sat his rump down and lifted a paw whats this charmed she crouched down to shake trick dog michaels been playing with you what else can you do huh can you lie down he flopped down into the prone position instantly looking up for approval and the expected biscuit can you roll over play dead were still working on that michael strolled over and to bongos relief offered him a biscuit youve always got to pay for the show he said to laura the girls must be thrilled theyre teaching him the rollover hes making progress but his eyes were on lauras and the shadows under them you just getting back um i came down to see the girls and to get a look at the foal hows she doing shes doing great which is more than i can say for you the frustration and annoyance hed pent up all day spewed out in rough words are you crazy going to work a full day on no sleep you might have nodded off behind the wheel and killed yourself on highway i had meetings thats bullshit laura just bullshit whats going on around here whats this crap about you letting ridgeway walk with your money and you holding down two jobs to pay the bills be quiet she glanced anxiously over his shoulder relieved that the girls werent in sight or earshot i dont know who youve been talking to but its none of their business or yours i dont want the girls hearing any of this its my business when you lose a nights sleep helping me out then come out here looking as though i could knock you over with a careless breath he yanked her to her feet i figured you were out playing all day at the shop diddling at an office and getting your hair done well you were wrong werent you and it isnt your concern one way or the other now where are the girls he vibrated with impotence with the rage of not being able to help or hinder with a shrug he turned on his heel in the paddock alone visions of calamities raced through her head even as she dashed toward the stables when she saw them in the paddock fear turned to shock her daughters were happily riding in circles on a pair of patient quarter horses i havent got them jumping through flaming hoops yet or doing flips michael said dryly the woman he thought was an open book thats next week arent they great annoyance with him vanished as she gripped his arm and watched alis trotting she posts so well already i told you she was a natural kayla he called out heels down her little boots adjusted immediately and like the pup she looked over for approval mama look mama i can ride you sure can thrilled laura moved to the fence hooked one foot on the bottom rung you both look fabulous her head high ali trotted over and drew her mount to a polite stop this is tess shes three mr fury says shes a very good jumper and that hell teach me shes beautiful ali you look beautiful on her thats why i want her i can buy her with my own money i can take it out of my savings her eyes tilted down in challenge its my money had been laura thought wearily peter had taken it along with the college fund and she hadnt nearly begun to replace the loss a horse is a very big responsibility ali its not just the buying its the keeping we have the stables shed thought about this dreamed about this for days i can feed her and pay for the hay with my allowance please mama now a headache brewed nastily in the fog of fatigue ali i cant think about this right now lets wait and then ill ask my father ali jerked her chin up even as her lips trembled ill call him and ask him you can certainly call him but he doesnt have anything to do with this you had a horse when you were a girl you had anything you wanted but you always tell me to wait you never understand when somethings important you never understand fine all right im not going to fight with you now because she was going to break could already feel the first fissures forming laura turned and walked away get off the horse ali when her stormy eyes came to his michael reached over for the bridle dismount now i havent finished my lesson yeah you have now youre going to get another one the minute she hit the ground he wrapped the reins around the fence rail then plucked the girl up and sat her beside them so his gaze was level with hers do you think you have the right to talk to your mother that way she doesnt listen no you dont listen and you dont see but i listened and you want to know what i heard he jerked her chin up when it drooped i heard a spoiled ungrateful brat sassing her mother her teary eyes went wide with shock im not a brat you just gave a damned good imitation you think you can snap your fingers and get whatever you want or have a tantrum if it doesnt happen or doesnt happen quick enough to suit you its my money ali said hotly she doesnt have any right to wrong shes got all the rights your mother just came home from working her butt off so that you can have a nice home and food on the table so you can have your lessons and your fancy school ive always lived here she doesnt have to work she just goes away every day open your eyes something he admitted he should have done himself youre old enough and smart enough to see what shes going through tears began to leak now she divorced him she made him go away i guess she did that just to make you miserable you dont understand nobody understands bull i understand just fine which is why im not tanning your hide you cant spank me he leaned closer wanna bet the very idea was so shocking so unbelievable that she closed her mouth tight good choice he said and nodded this horse isnt for sale to you but mr fury and youre not welcome in the stables until youve apologized to your mother if i ever see you sass her again you will get your hide tanned he lifted her off the fence and set her down on her feet again ali fisted her hands at her sides you cant make me do anything youre just a tenant whos bigger placidly he stepped over the fence to tend the waiting horse and right now ms ridgeway youre standing on my property i hate you it came out on a choked sob but was nonetheless passionate i hate everyone she streaked away while michael stroked the mare yeah i know how that feels too you yelled at her wincing he looked over to see kayla still astride her eyes huge and fascinated hed forgotten he had an audience nobody ever yells at her mama has a couple of times but she always says shes sorry after im not sorry she deserved it would you really spank her gray eyes glittered would you spank me if i was bad there was such a poignant wistfulness to the question that michael gave up he plucked her out of the saddle held her hard id whale the tar out of you he gave her bottom a light pat you wouldnt sit down for a week she squeezed harder i love you mr fury hell what had he done i love you too which was he realized with some amusement the first time hed said those words to a female in all of his life i was pretty hard on her he murmured as the picture of alis unhappy face swam into his mind and guilt seeped into his heart i know where shell go she always goes there when shes mad he should leave bad enough alone he told himself he should stay out of it he should shit lets go see chapter eleven contents prev next with anger and shame snapping at her heart ali raced over the lawn through the arbor of wisteria nobody understood her nobody cared those thoughts drummed a miserable beat in her head as she whipped down the stone path through banks of hibiscus and nightblooming jasmine she didnt care either she didnt care about anything or anyone nothing could make her care she burst through arching yews into a sundappled alcove with marble benches and a central fountain shaped like spearing calla lilies her headlong rush halted with a skid of her boots on brick and with shock it was her spot where she came when she needed to be alone to think to plan to sulk she hadnt known her mother came here too the cliffs were her mothers special place yet her mother was here sitting on a marble bench weeping shed never seen her mother cry not like this not with her hands covering her face her shoulders heaving not such violent helpless hopeless tears staggered she stared watching the woman she had always believed invincible sobbing as though the well of grief would never run dry because of me ali thought as her own breath hitched because of me mama lauras head shot up she sprang off the bench fought for control lost breaking she sank down again too tired too bruised too shattered to fight i dont know what to do anymore i just dont know what to do i cant take anymore panic shame emotions she didnt understand spurted so high so fast that ali was across the bricks and wrapped around her mother before shed thought to move im sorry mama im sorry im sorry under the arch kayla gripped michaels hand mamas crying mamas crying so hard i know it destroyed him to see it to hear it to know there was nothing he could do to stop it itll be all right baby he lifted kayla up let her press her face into his shoulder they just need to get it out thats all lets leave them alone i dont want her to cry kayla sniffled against him as he carried her away neither do i but sometimes it helps she leaned back sure that he would hold her do you ever cry sometimes i do stupid man things instead say bad words break things does it make you feel better mostly can we go break something now he grinned at her lord what a character sure lets go find something good to break but i get to say all the bad words in the alcove laura held her daughter close rocked her comforting as always brought comfort its all right ali its all right dont hate me i could never hate you no matter what she tilted her daughters tearstreaked face up her baby she thought swamped with love and guilt and sorrow her firstborn her treasure i love you allison i love you so much and nothing could ever change that you stopped loving daddy lauras heart shuddered again why did it have to be so hard yes i did but thats different ali i know its hard to understand but its so very different i know why he went away ali struggled to steady her jaw she had made her mother cry and nothing she knew nothing she had ever done could be worse it was my fault no with firm hands laura cupped alis face no it was not your fault it was he didnt like me i tried to be good i wanted to be i wanted him to stay and to love us but he didnt want me so he went away why hadnt she seen this laura wondered why hadnt the family counselor why hadnt anyone seen it ali thats not true people get divorced its sad and its sorry but it happens your father and i got divorced because of him and because of me you know i dont lie to you ali yes you do stunned laura jerked back ali you dont lie exactly but you make excuses and thats the same she bit her lip terrified that her mother would cry again but she had to say it you always made excuses for him youd say he wanted to come to the recital but he had an important meeting he wanted to go with us to the movies or the zoo or anyplace but he had work but it wasnt true he didnt want to go he didnt want to go with me oh dear god how could protecting your child cause so much damage it wasnt because of you not because of you ali or because of kayla i promise you thats not true he doesnt love me how could she answer what was right praying that whatever words she chose would be best she stroked alis tumbled hair it might be hard for you to understand this but some people arent cut out to be parents maybe theyd like to be or they want to be but they just cant your father never meant to hurt you or kayla ali shook her head slowly he doesnt love me she said it quietly or kayla or you if he doesnt love you in the way you wish he did it isnt your fault its nothing you did nothing you are or arent its not his fault either because youre making excuses again laura drew back shut her eyes all right allison no excuses are you sorry you had me lauras eyes flashed open what sorry oh allison this part at least was easy as breathing do you know when i was a girl hardly older than you i used to dream that i would fall in love one day and get married id have a home and beautiful children to fill it id watch them grow her lips curved now as she stroked the hair away from her daughters damp cheeks not all of that dream worked out the way i thought it would but the best part did the best part of the dream and the best part of my life is you and its kayla nothing in the world could be truer than that ali knuckled a tear from her cheek i didnt mean those things i said i know i said them because i knew you would never go away no matter what youd never go away thats right smiling laura flicked a finger down alis cheek youre stuck with me i felt bad and i wanted it to be your fault she had to swallow before she could speak again did he go to bed with another woman just when you thought it was safe laura thought with a jolt where did you hear a thing like that at school the flush rose up into alis cheeks but she kept her eyes steady some of the older girls talked about it thats nothing you or the older girls should be talking about alis mouth firmed he did she nodded and leaving a small lovely part of her childhood on the bench rose that was wrong he hurt you and you made him go away there were a lot of reasons i asked for a divorce ali tread carefully laura warned herself even as her heart was breaking to see that tooadult look in her babys eyes none of them is appropriate for you or your friends to discuss im talking to you mama ali said so simply that laura had no response it wasnt my fault she continued it wasnt your fault either it was his fault no it wasnt your fault but two people make a marriage ali and two people break it no ali thought studying her mother not always did you go to bed with another man no of course not laura stopped herself appalled that she was discussing her sex life with a tenyearold allison that question is completely inappropriate cheating is inappropriate too weary again laura rubbed her brow youre too young to judge ali does that mean its all right to cheat sometimes trapped trapped by the unbending logic and admirable values of a tenyearold girl all right no its not he took our money too didnt he oh good god laura rose gossip isnt attractive and its irrelevant she understood now ali thought understood the titters from other girls the murmured conversations of adults and all the pitying glances thats why you had to go to work money is not an issue here she refused to let it be i went to work because i

her speech all worked out and she was very proud of it she thought it was mature dignified and clever she was certain that mr fury would nod wisely impressed after she was done she stopped for a moment to watch the horses hed let out into the paddock he would be cleaning the stalls then she tried not to pout as she watched tess and thought about what it was like to ride her and brush her and feed her apples her mother might have evaded the subject of money but ali knew with her new wisdom that buying and keeping a horse would strain the budget besides she didnt intend to ask mr fury for anything he had yelled at her scolded her threatened to spank her that was simply not permitted and all the pitying glances thats why you had to go to work money is not an issue here she refused to

didnt intend to ask mr fury for anything he had yelled at her scolded her threatened to spank her that was simply not permitted head high she walked into the stables all the smells shed begun to love were there hay and grain and horse and leather she remembered the way hed shown her to saddlesoap the tack how to curry a horse how he had put her in the saddle for the first time and praised her she bit her lip none of that mattered hed insulted her she heard the sounds of the shovel and she walked to the end of the row where michael was filling a wheelbarrow with soiled straw and manure excuse me mr fury her voice had a royal ring that she would have been surprised to know closely echoed her mothers he looked behind him took in the slight young girl in the tidy blue dress and trendy italian sneakers youre out early thoughtful he leaned on his shovel no school today i dont have to leave for a little while she glanced at her watch folded her hands the gestures were so like lauras he had to fight back a smile something you want to say yes sir i want to apologize for being rude and for causing a family scene in front of you little miss dignity he thought your chins trembling apology accepted he said simply and bent to his work he was supposed to apologize now it was after all the proper way to close a misunderstanding when he didnt her brows drew together i think you were also rude i dont he dumped the last load propped up his shovel then gripped the handles of the wheelbarrow better move aside youll get your dress dirty you raised your voice you called me names he cocked his head and your point is youre supposed to say youre sorry he released the handles brushed his hands over his jeans im not sorry you deserved it im not a brat all her dignity crumbled as did her face i didnt mean the things i said i didnt mean to make her cry she understands she doesnt hate me i know she understands she loves you a kid who has a mother like that in her corners got everything pushing it aways pretty stupid ill never do it again i know better now i know lots of things better now she knuckled a tear away you can spank me if you want and i wont tell i dont want you to hate me michael crouched down gave her a long steady look come here trembling terrified at her images of humiliation and pain she stepped forward when he grabbed her she muffled a cry of alarm then was dazzled to find herself being hugged youre a standup gal blondie he smelled of the horses i am swallowing prides hell i know you did a good job full of wonder she held on tight it was like granddad or uncle josh or uncle byron but different just a little different youre not mad at me anymore no you mad at me she shook her head and let the words tumble out i want to ride the horses please i want to come back and help you and feed them and brush them i told mama i was sorry and i wont sass her anymore dont make me stay away how am i supposed to get things done around here without you and tess has already been missing you she sniffed eased back has she really maybe youve got time to say hi to her before you take off for school but you want to get rid of these he took out a bandanna ali experiencing the thrill of having her tears dried by a man for the first time fell headlong in love will you still give me riding lessons and teach me how to jump im counting on it he held out a hand friends yes sir michael my friends call me michael hed never been inside templeton monterey though michael had grown up just up the coast it wasnt so odd hed never had a need for a hotel in the area and if he had templeton would have been beyond his touch hed been to the resort after all his mother had worked there so he knew what to expect then again he mused as he passed the uniformed doorman you usually got more than you expected from templeton the lobby was enormous sprawling with conversation and waiting areas tucked away behind potted palms and greenery to offer the cozy and the private the bar long and wide with generous chairs and gleaming tables was up a short flight of stairs and separated by a trio of brass rails those who wanted a little lift could enjoy their cocktail and watch the people come and go there were plenty of them michael noted they were six deep at checkin flooding the long mahogany counter while clerks hustled to assign rooms two waitresses worked the waiting crowd and passed out glasses of fizzing water the noise was huge wherever they stood sat or wandered they talked primarily women he observed some of them dressed for business others drooping from travel and all he thought studying the heaped luggage carts with enough suitcases for a sixmonth stay as he maneuvered out of the way two women streaked toward each other over the shining tile and met with squeals and embraces several others were eyeing him not that he particularly minded being ogled but being so completely outnumbered he chose discretion as the better part of valor and contemplated retreat then he saw her and there might not have been another woman in the room she carried a clipboard tucked atop a fat file her hair was pinned up smoothed somehow into a neat professional twist she wore a simple black suit that even one with a fashionimpaired eye could see was painfully expensive for his own pleasure he let his gaze wander down to her legs and gave thanks to whatever sadist had convinced women to wear those skinny high heels though she was deep in conversation with the conference chair and frantically sorting out details in her head laura felt a flush of heat a tingle at her back she shifted struggled to ignore it and at last glanced over her shoulder in the midst of all those women many of whom where rolling their eyes behind his back he stood with his thumbs tucked in the front pocket of his jeans smiling at her ms templeton laura hmm oh yes melissa im going to check on that right away the conference chair was as busy as harried as laura she was also as human and she felt a quick tug as she looked across the room my my grinning she blew out a breath you sure do grow them fine in monterey apparently if youll excuse me a minute tucking her clipboard under her arm she hurried toward michael welcome to bedlam did you come by to see byron i had no idea corporate executives were so sexy he lifted a hand flicked it over a glittering heart pin on her lapel cute all the staff are wearing them its a romance writers convention no kidding intrigued he surveyed the crowd met several pairs of equally intrigued female eyes these women write those books with all that steam romance novels are an enormous industry that accounts for more than forty percent of the paperback market and provides enjoyment and entertainment for millions while focusing on love commitment and hope she reached around to rub the back of her neck dont get me started used to read because i liked a story now ive become an advocate byrons in the penthouse the elevators i didnt come to see byron though i might swing by i came to see you oh she turned her wrist to glance at her watch im awfully pressed just now is it important i went by your shop first quite a place it had impressed him as the hotel impressed him with its style and charm you had a crowd there too yes were doing well she tried to imagine him taking a turn around pretenses not quite the bull in the china shop she decided more like the wolf among the lambs did anything catch your eye the dress in the front window had its points his eyes slid down her would have had more with a woman in it i dont know much about doodads and glitters kate fasttalked me into some blue horse ah the aquamarine mare its lovely he jerked a shoulder i dont know what the hell im supposed to do with it or how she managed to con me out of three bills for that little statue laura laughed shes good but im sorry you had to run around looking for me and now ive i like looking at you he eased forward michael she backed up bumped into a shamelessly eavesdropping guest i really have to get into my office fine ill go with you no its this way she began when he took her arm i really dont have time i do im meeting another breeder in a couple hours he saw the glass door with executive offices printed on it is it always so noisy around here no checkin for a convention livens things up considerably it wasnt much more sedate behind the desk phones were ringing boxes were stacked people whizzed by laura turned into a small office with a central desk piled with tidy stacks of paper the fax machine was humming away spitting out an enormous stream christ how do you work in here feeling immediately hemmed in he rolled his shoulders how do you breathe in here its more than adequate and the limited space demands efficiency she tore off the fax and skimmed it as she picked up her phone sit down if you like im sorry i have to finish this after punching in numbers she cradled the phone between her neck and shoulder to keep her hands free karen yes ive got it right here it looks fine they need to set up their registration desk an hour earlier yes i know but theyve had to readjust their estimate on walkins yes i know marks handling that but he doesnt answer his page no i dont think hes gone over the wall chuckling she set the fax aside and picked up a memo uhhuh thats on my list dont worry if you could just my life for you no ill buy the bottle when its over thanks i want to hell ive got another call coming through ill check with you later michael took his seat rested his ankle on his knee and watched her work who would have thought it he mused the cool pampered princess up to her elbows in details swinging from phone to computer and back like a veteran soldier flanking the enemy depending on the topic her voice was warm chilly brisk or persuasive and she never missed a beat actually her heart missed quite a few every time she looked over and saw him sitting there black denim and worn boots and dark windblown hair eyes that watched everything michael you dont before she could finish even begin to nudge him along a skinny man with a quick smile poked his head in the door sorry laura mark ive been paging you for an hour i know i was trapped i swear it im on my way to deal with conference registration setup but theres a small crisis in the gold ballroom they want you of course they do she rose michael i need to see what this is about lets go dont you have something to do he made her nervous matching her pace as she strode back into the lobby im having fun watching you a guys entitled to an hour off now and again as they climbed a flight of wide carpeted steps he looked around curiously ive never been in here before hell of a place i didnt realize i wish i could show you around but she shrugged her shoulders you can take a tour on your own but i wouldnt recommend using the elevators weve got about eight hundred checking in today and theyll be jammed jammed into an elevator with women who write romance he shook his head i can think of worse things the secondfloor meetingroom level was as spacious as the lobby as elegantly appointed and nearly as crowded enormous chandeliers were brilliantly lit shooting light onto brass and silver dripping it on pots of flowering begonias in snowy white and blood red along one wall heavy drapes were open to a spectacular view of the bay laura marched toward a bank of six doors topped with an ornate brass plate identifying the gold ballroom you have to admire the templetons what they know how to build a hotel because she appreciated the statement she stopped for a moment it is wonderful isnt it its one of my favorites though i cant think of any that dont have some special aspect the one in rome rising above the spanish steps there are views from the windows that break your heart templeton new york has this lovely courtyard you never expect to find something that quiet in the middle of manhattan you take a step off madison avenue and the world changes there are fairy lights in the trees a little fountain and in london she trailed off shook her head thats something else you shouldnt get me started on i always figured youd take it for granted misconceptions he murmured as they walked toward the ballroom again theres a lot more i dont know about you than i do templetons dont take anything for granted and because she didnt she stepped inside the ballroom prepared for anything it was chaos half the tables for the evenings mass literacy signing were set up half were still stacked and waiting mountains of boxes lined the walls even the thought of what it would take to unpack them and distribute the books to the right spot made her eyes cross that at least was not her job laura it was melissa again her wireframed glasses sliding down her nose as she all but leapt across the carpet and into lauras arms im so glad youre here we still havent been able to locate shipments for six authors and an entire shipment from one of the publishers is lost somewhere in the bowels of the hotel ill put a trace on them dont worry yes but and ill go down to shipping and receiving myself her smile was meant to be reassuring and not weary if necessary ill brave the bowels personally and find the books i cant tell you what that means to me you have no idea what its like to have to tell an author she doesnt have any books to sign it doesnt matter if it was flood pestilence or armageddon shes going to jump you then well see that theyre here even if we have to send someone out to raid the bookstores melissa blew the hair out of her eyes ive worked four nationals and six regional conferences youre the best ive ever worked with and im not saying that just because my life is in your hands relieved she shifted her gaze to michael smiled winningly hello im melissa manning when im not insane michael are you a writer yes i am even maybe particularly when im insane got a book i can buy she blinked her eyes lighting with delight behind the lenses of her glasses as a matter of fact i happen to have one in my briefcase which you can have would you like me to sign it for you thatd be great just give me a minute that was very sweet laura murmured when melissa dashed off for her briefcase i like to read and i might learn something he shifted slid a hand down her arm until it linked with his how about dinner tonight maybe a drive maybe some wild unbridled sex as usual an interesting offer it was humiliating to have to clear her throat but she had no choice im working here tonight now thats insane amused melissa strolled back and handed michael her book youre a stronger woman than i laura choosing work over hot unbridled sex michael grinned im going to like your book i hope you will count on it excuse me a minute he tugged laura into his arms lowered his head and kissed her until every ounce of blood in her head drained to her feet and tingled he let her go and nipped lightly at her chin youre still holding the rain check sugar nice to meet you melissa yeah staring after him melissa rubbed a hand over her heart i believe in quality descriptive and wellcrafted writing she began and all i can think of to say now is wow she blew out a breath wow yeah laura made an effort to find the top of her head it had to be spinning somewhere close by i um its okay take a minute im going to book on those checks for you right away melissa tucked her tongue in her cheek appreciate it excuse me as laura struggled not to stagger to the door melissa indulged in a long sigh god i love this business chapter twelve contents prev next it was after ten when laura turned up the drive to templeton house she had the good solid tired of accomplishing a job well the kind of tired she realized as she let herself in the house that didnt yearn for sleep still she reminded herself she had another full day coming up starting in just over nine hours what she needed was a nice hot bath and bed after checking in on her daughters and finding them both deeply asleep she drew that bath filled it lavishly with fragrant salts and bubbles and sank in with a long sigh she stretched out gazed up through the tiny skylight over the tub and dreamed over the stars her life was clicking back into gear she thought she had her daughter back there were bound to be some bumps along the way and she would negotiate them but everything had been so blissfully normal that morning on the drive to school her family was in order her parents busily enjoying their lives and their work josh and margo doting on their new baby kate and byron anticipating theirs her job at the hotel was fulfilling and made her feel part of the templeton team again and the shop she smiled and smoothed frothy bubbles down her leg the shop was an exciting unexpected fantasy that brought so much pleasure so many surprises as busy as shed been throughout the day shed missed swinging in ringing up sales talking to customers just being with kate and margo she would manage a few hours the next afternoon barring any calamity then again shed begun to enjoy even to anticipate certain kinds of calamity they offered her the challenge of finding the right answer the satisfaction of knowing that she could find the solution inside herself like a book she mused a whole new chapter of her life was opening up she was going to enjoy it she let the water drain stepped out of the deep oversized tub toweled off slowly and creamed her skin dreamily after removing the pins from her hair and placing them in the little silver box where she kept them she brushed until the curls bounced and shone it wasnt until she was dressing again and caught herself humming that she fully realized she wasnt going to bed or not alone shocked she stared at the reflection in the mirror the woman there simply dressed in silk slacks and blouse stared back shed been preparing for a man she realized the bath the lotions the scents shed been preparing for michael but now she was thinking again and she wasnt sure she could go through with it he wanted her but he didnt know her he didnt know what she wanted needed she wasnt certain herself so how could he be she didnt know how to offer herself to a man not in reality in dreams perhaps where everything was slow and misty but in the clear dark where there were movements and consequences she wasnt sure once she had offered herself to another man in another life and it hadnt been enough to do so again and fail again would destroy her coward she thought closing her eyes was she going to remain alone and celibate for the rest of her life because she hadnt succeeded as a wife and therefore as a lover if he wanted her she wanted to be taken tonight she wanted him to give her no choice tonight she rushed downstairs quickly before she could change her mind and the night was thrilling windswept full of sound and scent she ran through it as women had for centuries toward fate toward a man and lost her nerve at the base of the steps his lights were on she had only to climb up that one short flight of wooden stairs and knock on the door he would know and would take she would she promised herself as she crossed her hands over her speeding heart as soon as she had composed herself as soon as the giddiness faded a little she went into the stables instead moving down the line of drowsy horses she hadnt seen the foal since its birth she reminded herself she only wanted to look to admire then she would go up and knock at the stall door she studied the mother and child the foal lay curled on the hay the mare standing slacklegged beside her i miss having a baby who needs me she murmured they trust you to take care of them its the most incredible feeling isnt it knowing that came from you she indulged herself another moment stroking the mares head when it was offered then she turned and he was there all in black he was like a shadow that became real in a blink she stepped back i was i hadnt seen the foal since i didnt mean to disturb you youve been disturbing me for a long time longer than i realized his gaze holding hers he stepped forward i saw you running across the lawn in the starlight you looked like something out of a dream but youre not are you no she retreated again nerves shattered i should go i she couldnt take her eyes off his as he came closer boxed her against the stall door i should go pretty laura templeton he murmured you always look so polished so perfect nothing out of place he skimmed a finger over the soft lapel of her blouse dipped a finger in the vee and watched her eyes go dark makes a man like me want to muss you up get right under that polish and find out just who the hell you are he closed his hands over her breasts calloused hands over thin silk felt her shudder who the hell are you laura why are you here her heart was pounding against his palm so violently that she wondered it didnt simply leap out into his hand i came to see the foal liar he pressed her back against the wood and when the door gave she would have stumbled if he hadnt held her i bet he never mussed you up did he always polite always the gentleman you wont get that from me i she was panicked now thrilled terrified her gaze darted from his as hay crackled under her feet the stall was empty but for them she was alone with him trapped i dont know how to do this i do i can make you stay or i can make you run i wonder which itll be but you came to me so itll be my way he fisted his hands on the opening of her blouse shredded it in one quick shocking yank stay or run his eyes were dark demanding focused on hers cool air shivered over her bare skin if you stay youre mine my way stay or run he gripped her hair yanked her head back and watched her waited stay he murmured then crushed his mouth to hers and ravished speed and desperation she was pummeled by both as he dragged her down into the hay and branded her lips her throat her breasts she cried out when his teeth closed over her lancing heat from breast to loins until her body was a bucking writhing mass of sensation the asking was over she knew the choice was made now he would take as he had in the dreams that haunted her at night rough and fast and mercilessly and she wanted that the painful spin out of control the hard tough impatient hands scraping her skin the relentless almost brutal mouth feeding on her she found his flesh hot smooth the hay beneath her was prickly abrading her skin and adding one more reeling sensation the sound of her clothes tearing under his frantic hands hands that streaked back to squeeze and probe and possess was unreasonably erotic she could hear herself cry out hear her own short harsh panting each gasp of shock and pleasure helpless as a raft on a stormtossed sea she rolled thrashed and gave herself over to fate every time her hands gripped him those neat ladys nails biting in his blood swam each time she whimpered moaned his pulses whipped the first time her body convulsed and his name his name burst like a sob through her lips his head reeled he could see every fresh shock in her eyes those clouded gray storms that widened unfocused closed on a throaty moan no one had given her this of that he could be sure no one had taken her where he would take her of all the things shed been given all the places shed traveled in her privileged life this was new though some part of him deeply buried hurt that this was all he could offer he would make it enough for tonight for tonight and as long as it lasted he would and could be to her what no one had ever been he could feel every dark flash of new pleasure sing through her body and explode inside his own he could hear her shocked gasps and swallow them he could take more still more and make her arch violently against him in desperate greed and that delicate ivory skin so smooth so fragrant dewed with the clean sweat of good sex his hands so strong so quick so powerful they cupped her bruised destroyed her own were lost in his hair dragging him down until his mouth found hers again until she could answer that hard vicious kiss with one of her own his body was so tight so relentlessly male muscles bunching under her hands ridges of old scars sliding under her questing fingers his skin was hot burning and bloomed damp when she bit desperately at his shoulder the air was ripe thick and tasted of him on each gulping breath she took whatever he did to her she welcomed whatever he demanded she gave he lifted her hips high and his eyes burned into hers with one violent thrust he was inside her hilt deep the hands shed gripped on his arms slid limply to the hay as her body simply erupted stay with me laura his fingers dug into her flesh and he began to move stay with me what choice did she have she was locked trapped steeped her breathing was slow now shallow her vision misted at the edges but she moved with him stroke now for stroke he shuddered when she came when she closed around him like a damp fist and he fought a vicious war with himself not to follow not yet there was more even as the blood roared like the sea in his head he wanted more and so he dragged her up until her legs locked around him until her body flowed back so fluidly it might have been made of water worked her until her new frenzy was met matched until her head dropped on his shoulder then and then only he buried his face in her hair and let himself fall his weight pinned her to the floor it was an odd and drugging feeling having a mans full weight on her again and it was a triumphant feeling to know that he was incapable of moving that he was as dazed as sated as she she didnt have to doubt it shed seen his eyes felt his hands heard the gritty groan sound in his throat he had been caught trembling on that stunning moment when he had lost himself and come inside her there in the darkened stables with the sweet smell of hay and horses her clothes in tatters and her blood singing she felt like a woman again not like a mother a friend a responsible member of society like a woman she didnt want to fumble now to begin stuttering out foolish truths that it had never been this way before that she hadnt known it could be better she thought for both of them to keep it light so she smiled found the strength to lift her hand and stroke his hair looks like i redeemed that rain check his chuckle tickled her throat what was your name again sugar gathering his reserves he rolled lazily over pulling her with him until she was sprawled on his chest her smile was both smug and sleepy there was hay in her hair god youre pretty such a pretty little thing the proper laura templeton with the surprising and flexible steam engine of a body whod have thought it she certainly hadnt and she raised a brow i cant say that i or it has ever been described quite that way before her lips quirked i think i like it since youre in such a good mood why dont you tell me now why you came here tonight to see the foal fastidiously she picked hay out of his hair then shifted her gaze back to his on the way to you you knew id come i was counting on it if you hadnt id have had to breach the castle walls and drag you out i dont know how much longer i could have done without you michael moved she laid her hand on his cheek would you have ravished me sugar i did ravish you its the first time anyone has she waited a beat watched her own finger trace down his throat i hope it wont be the last i wasnt looking for one quick romp in the hay satisfied with that she nodded smoothed his hair again then ill come back she lowered her mouth to his lingered over it i should go now he merely shifted their positions pinned her again laura you dont really think im going to turn you loose tonight she felt the quick hitching thrill of being overpowered you arent no that roughpalmed hand slid up closed over her breast and his mouth became busy at her throat she arched under him shuddered out a sigh good still she hadnt meant to stay until morning hadnt meant to fall into twilight sleep in a pile of hay with her body curled around his hadnt realized she would awake fully aroused with his mouth on hers and his hands his hands michael and when her eyes fluttered open he slid slow and deep inside her moved inside her with long lazy strokes that had dreams misting over reality he watched her face that lovely flush from sleep and sex that warmed her cheeks the eyes smoky and dazed the mouth swollen from his that trembled on each breath they would look at each other now in the light see as they took each other up with a rhythm soft and silky hay motes fluttered in the fragile light of morning danced in the quiet air night birds gave way to the lark in the stables horses began to stir cats stretched and hunted up sunbeams and her hands reached for him cupped his face guided his mouth once again to hers as they gently slid over michael she said again i cant keep my hands off you i dont want you to but hed seen bruises on that delicate skin as shed slept i was rough with you last night did i forget to thank you for it he lifted his head grinned i guess screaming my name ten or twelve times was thanks enough well then she pushed his hair back from his face and her eyes were sober i dont ever want to be treated like some fragile piece of glass not ever again so if i want to break out the cuffs and whips youre game her mouth fell open in speechless shock i i im kidding christ what a package she was he thought on a roar of laughter and all his on a spurt of delight he got to his feet and picked her up at least until weve established trust you dont really i mean i dont think i could or would like when he laughed so hard he nearly dropped her she lifted her chin i dont care to be the butt of your sick joke it wasnt that sick and sugar youve got a firstclass butt he planted a loud smacking kiss on her mouth but since i doubt you want to stroll back to the house showing it off lets go get you some clothes id appreciate it if you would what are you doing she all but squeaked it as he carried her out of the stall taking you upstairs to get you something to put on you cant just cart me outside this way im naked were naked michael i mean it oh my god sunlight and cool morning air slapped her as he stepped through the stable door its early he said easily no ones around yet were naked it was all she could say as he started up the stairs were standing outside naked looks like its going to be a hell of a day too you got anything on for tonight i didnt he understand that they were standing on his little porch in the full light of day buck naked get me inside chilly im working on it he shifted her and managed the doorknob the insult she fumed the insensitivity the outrageousness of it put me down sure he set her obligingly on her feet and waited for the show to begin she didnt disappoint him are you out of your mind what if one of the girls had looked out the window and seen us its not even six in the morning do they usually stare out the window at dawn with binoculars of course not thats hardly the point i wont be hauled around that way because you in your warped brain find it amusing now get me a shirt he ran his tongue around his teeth as he considered her even with hay in her hair and flushed head to toe with embarrassment and temper she managed to be dignified it was fascinating sugar youre getting me stirred up again and i dont think we have time for another round you peasant barbarian with an effort she reined in it was impossible to have a reasonable argument under the circumstances id like to borrow some clothes please what the hell itll only take a few minutes michael she jerked back stunned when she saw the intention in his eyes michael i will not be dragged to the floor kissed into mindless submission driven to bonesplitting climax oh god she fisted her hands on the rug and let herself be ravished it took more than a few minutes so that laura found herself sneaking like a thief into her own house if she could just get upstairs she thought easing open a side door and creeping into the parlor into her room her children would be waking for school any minute her children wincing carrying her shoes she tiptoed into the hall was she out of her mind how could she possibly explain herself if miss laura if the worst happened laura thought fatalistically and turned to face a shocked ann sullivan annie i was just ah out early walking very slowly ann continued down the stairs she had been widowed for more than twentyfive years but she knew the look of a woman whod spent the night in a mans arms youre wearing a mans shirt she said stiffly and theres hay in your hair ah clearing her throat laura reached up and plucked out a bent shaft yes thats true i was out as i said and youve never been able to lie your way out of an open door ann stopped at the base of the stairs facing down her quarry very much like a mother about to lecture a reckless child with a mixture of amusement and apprehension laura recognized the signs annie youve been down at the stables rolling around in the hay with that sharpeyed womanizing michael fury yes ive been down at the stables laura said shrugging on her cloak of dignity yes ive been with michael and im a grown woman with the sense of a peanut what were you thinking of ann continued poking out a finger a woman like you wrestling in a hayloft with the likes of him because where she loved she had patience lauras voice was calm i imagine you know very well what i was thinking of whatever you think of him or of my sense the fact remains that im thirty years old annie he wanted me i wanted him and in all of my life all of it no one has ever ever made me feel the way he did a moments pleasure for a moments pleasure laura nodded if that was all it amounted to she swore she would go to her grave grateful i was married ten years and never knew what it was like to be pleasured or i hope to pleasure a man like that and im sorry you disapprove anns face pokered up its not my place to disapprove oh dont give me that dignifiedhousekeepertomistress routine annie its years too late with a sigh she laid a hand over the rigid one with which ann gripped the newel post i know how much you care i know that everything you say you say out of concern and love but even that cant change the way i feel or what i need and you think you need michael fury no i know i do i havent decided what to do about it or where i want to go from here but i do know that i fully intend to have a great many moments of pleasure whatever the cost yes for once in my life the hell with the cost i need to shower she started up the stairs paused turned i dont want you going down there badgering michael over this annie that is not your place or anyone elses ann inclined her head kept it lowered until she heard laura close the door to her room perhaps it wasnt her place to speak to michael fury but she knew her duty and she would do it without hesitation she walked down the hall and into the library the call to france wouldnt take long then they would see she thought brooding out the window they would see id like to speak with mr or mrs templeton if you please its ann sullivan the housekeeper of templeton house in the stables in the hay all night in the secondfloor kitchen of pretenses kate swiveled on the stool and gaped the tenminute afternoon break was a great deal more interesting than shed expected you why is that so shocking ignoring her tea laura drummed her fingers on the counter im human arent i not some sort of windup doll pal it sounds like you were pretty wound up to me and im not shocked exactly i mean i wouldnt have imagined bouncing on the hay was your style but hey whatever works she grinned and sampled one of the cookies laura had picked up at the bakery and i take it that it worked just fine mollified laura took a cookie herself i she said smugly was an animal with a snort kate raised one of lauras arms over their heads way to go champ so now about the details i cant well maybe no the gleam in her eye matched kates no come on just one detail then one little detail of lauras wild night she laughed shook her head nibbled on her lip god knew she could tell kate or margo anything and it had been so rare lately for her to be able to share something so wonderful and reckless fastidiously she brushed crumbs off the counter he ripped my clothes off metaphorically or literally literally just tore them to shreds just she pressed a hand to her stomach god god kate echoed fanning a hand in front of her face thats it laura scooted off the stool and dumped her cold tea into the sink i cant do this it feels like high school pal youve graduated and your cap and gown are in tatters congratulations she cocked her head as laura rinsed out her cup she knew the woman who carefully washed out china as well as she knew herself are you in love with him laura watched the water run and drain i dont know love this kind of love isnt as simple as i once thought it was im afraid i could be and i dont want to complicate everything you once told me that love just happened couldnt be planned kate pointed out i found out you were right with care she set the cup to drain shed already given kates question a great deal of thought knowing it would be asked by those who cared the most if it does happen ill deal with it theres so much more to him than i ever imagined and every time i see one of those pieces i didnt know was there fall into place im more involved laura dried her hands and turned back to kate im not going to get dreamyeyed this time around or want more than someones capable of giving im just going to enjoy it is that going to work for you the way i feel this afternoon its working perfectly feeling loose she stretched her arms high absolutely perfectly glad to see you two are enjoying yourselves margo stepped into the doorway and scowled one of you was supposed to relieve me remember i unlike my feckless partners havent had a break in four hours sorry laura dropped her arms ill go no ill go kate hopped off the stool itll give you a chance to fill margo in fill me in on what michael screwed lauras brains out last night in a horse stall gracefully margo fluffed her hair while laura flushed really ripped her clothes off kate added as she headed out the door ill leave laura to fill in the details on a long hum margo settled herself on one of the padded ice cream chairs crossed her long shapely legs pour me some tea would you laura im whipped automatically laura poured a cup brought it to the table want a cookie dont mind if i do margo debated them selected nibbled now sit your butt down and start filling in those details and dont worry about being too specific chapter thirteen contents prev next whistling between his teeth michael sent zip into a raging gallop bursting out of the woods into the sun like a flaming fire the little demon could run michael thought hed be sorry to lose him but the offer that had come in that morning closed the deal in a matter of hours the speedy little colt would be on his way to utah going to have some fun with the fillies up there kid and breed some champs and the asking price meant that michael could close the deal hed been negotiating for a particularly finelooking palomino mare and her doeeyed foal the mare was ornery he mused had twice tried to kick him and her handler during the inspection michael liked her the better for it and for the fact that shed bred such a tough little foal a foal he was already planning to raise for stud couple more years michael thought the new colt would cover twenty mares and at four his full complement of sixty theyd do fine together he decided that snippy palomino mare and the energetic little buckskin shed birthed would help him start a new phase of his business within two years he projected fury ranch was going to mean something something more than livelihood and survival it was going to mean quality and that michael thought as zip tore around the stables was something hed lived most of his life without it would have been impossible and worse embarrassing for him to explain to anyone that he had always wanted quality not just for what he had or what he built but for what he was hed always wanted to come from something to be something and he had come from nothing that hed had to face couldnt be changed nor could he change the fact that it left a sore spot inside him that was never really eased hed gone years telling himself it didnt matter what his parents had been how hed grown up or how hed lived but it did matter now more than ever he knew it mattered there was a woman in his life who shouldnt have been there sooner or later he had no doubt shed see that for herself the insult of it and the inevitability made him push the colt for more speed not for a minute would he have admitted that he was racing away rather than toward nor would he admit even to himself that his emotions had been in turmoil from the moment hed stepped inside the stables last night and found her as if she was meant to be there with him for him as if he could take and hold maybe even deserve something as lovely and fine and vital as laura and be for her what she could be for him the hell with that michael told himself squinting into the sunlight as the colt flew over the ground no way he was going to start fashioning pretty little dreams about a life with laura if he was one thing he was a realist his time with her was temporary and he would damn well pack as much into it as he could while it lasted he was already into the run the colt bunched for the leap when michael spotted the figure loitering at the paddock they sailed over the fence spewed up dirt and dust thats a hell of a horse byron called out as michael trotted to him he is bending michael slapped zips neck then dismounted sold him today guy in utah after uncinching the saddle michael hung it over the fence wants to breed for speed hell get it byron leaned over patted the colts sleek throat isnt even winded nope hell tire his rider out first im surprised youre not using him for stud yourself hes prime yeah hes prime but i have more foundation to build before i add a stud couple more years he thought picturing the foal again and well both be ready right now its horse trading and building on the investment youve got a good start that walker there byron gestured what are you asking max michael glanced around watched the horse swish his tail id sell my own mother first he held up his hand and max walked over glad to see me max max peeled back his lips so his teeth showed and split the air with a horsey laugh give us a kiss then max nibbled affectionately on michaels chin and being nobodys fool snuffed at his pockets true love is never enough want one a kiss from your horse or a carrot whichever ill pass on both thanks but he stroked maxs mane as the horse crunched the carrot you got some finelooking stock here you in the market i told myself i wasnt especially with the baby coming he looked longingly at the mare nursing her foal shit this takes me back michael picked up a dandy brush and began to groom zip what are you about twoten twelve byron said absently twotwelve that bay gelding with the two front socks hed carry you byron studied the bay noted the lines the flashy white blaze handsome bastard isnt he good saddle horse well mannered but no pussy needs a firm hand the right hand michael tucked his tongue in his cheek as he continued to work make you a good deal seeing as youre related to josh and married to one of my favorite people i didnt come by to horsetrade no placidly michael leaned against zip lifted a hoof to pick it out why then i was in the neighborhood more or less and thought you might want to come by on saturday night poker im usually up for a game then he paused narrowed his eyes this isnt going to be one of those enlightened evenings with women asking if a straight beats a flush kate would knock you on your ass for that comment but byron grinned no its purely sexist men only then im in thanks maybe ill win that bay from you keep dreaming de witt good heart room he murmured about sixteen hands isnt he michael smothered a grin continued to clean his mounts hooves about just turned four his sire was a walker his dam a darkeyed floozy from baton rouge shit he was sunk you stable yep here for now then at my place when its finished should be ready to start construction in a couple weeks lets take a closer look in his saville row suit and magli shoes byron climbed into the paddock ive heard you southern boys are cardsharps and horse thieves michael commented as they strolled companionably toward the bay you heard right how long was she going to make him wait michael paced the floor contemplated the bottle of wine on the counter it made him scratch his head hed actually gone out and bought wine not his usual style but hed figured sex in a horse stall wasnt lauras usual either the least he could do was offer her a civilized drink before he jumped her again which was just what he wanted to do if she ever got there of course she was coming hed reminded himself of that half a dozen times over the last hour the way it had been between them the night before she had to be just as eager for a repeat performance shed have thought of him during the day countless times the way hed thought of her the way he would have sworn hed smelled her every time he took a breath the way hed caught himself going off into some brainless trance because he could see her face in his head or hear her voice or want her just want her when had he ever wanted anything like this once hed wanted escape and hed gotten it hed wanted danger and risk and reckless adventure and hed gotten that too and when hed wanted peace a life he could look at with some measure of pride hed gone out and gotten that as well but did he have laura was she going to slip silkily through his fingers before hed gotten a good grip or before hed figured out what the hell to do with her about her she was out of his league and knowing it pissed him off made him determined to drag her to equal ground sex was a great equalizer and he had her there for now furious with himself for niggling at what shouldnt have been a problem he poured a glass of the wine he sniffed it shrugged downed it when in rome fury but he set the glass aside and began to pace again prowling back and forth across the length of the room like a cat prowling the confines of a cage hed caught a glimpse of ann that afternoon when he supervised the transfer of the colt from the bullets she shot out of her eyes he had the feeling that laura hadnt managed to get past her that morning it made him grin to think of it the elegant lady of the house sneaking in at dawn in a baggy shirt and jeans caught by the everpresent coldeyed housekeeper maybe sullivan had locked laura in his grin vanished as the idea popped into his head maybe she had laura trapped inside refusing to let her out maybe she was and maybe he should get a grip on himself he decided the hell with it he headed for the door he was going after her when he yanked it open laura jumped back a full step pressed a hand to her throat you scared the life out of me sorry i was about to rescue you from the dungeon oh she smiled puzzled were you but you seemed to have managed it on your own i couldnt come any sooner weve been having a little chaos my parents have decided to come out for a quick visit theyll be here in a couple of days and the girls were so excited i had a hard time getting them to bed then we had to you dont have to explain to me just come here he pulled her close and released a portion of frustrated need in one rough kiss pressing her back against the doorjamb he fisted his hands in her hair and released more the same she thought wrapping herself around him the same heat the same rash the same wonder when she could breathe again she kept her clenched hands on his shirt i thought what but she shook her head nothing smiling she lifted her hands to frame his face hello michael hello laura he circled her inside closed the door with his boot i was going to offer you some wine oh thank you that would be nice but its going to have to wait he swung her into his arms oh thats even nicer he did bring her a glass when she was sitting on his rumpled bed wearing his shirt not having what he considered her misplaced sense of modesty he sat across from her naked knee to knee im kind of celebrating he told her and tapped the glasses together she felt so loose she was certain she could slide right into the sheets what are you kind of celebrating i sold two horses today one to your brotherinlaw byron surprised she sipped recognized the rich tang of a good templeton chardonnay funny kate never mentioned that they were buying a horse i guess he hadnt told her yet oh uhoh does kate have a problem with horses no but its quite a commitment im surprised they didnt discuss it first im sure she will be too id say he can handle her its not a matter of handling one way or the other marriage is a partnership and decisions require discussion and mutual agreement and what are you grinning at you look cute sitting there all mussed up from sex and lecturing me on relationship ethics i wasnt lecturing she took a small cool sip from her glass i was simply stating dont you believe in relationship ethics yep his hand wandered up her thigh but i figure like in any partnership sometimes one end makes a decision on its own and ethics get bent a little i like this little birthmark way up here his fingers skimmed high on her thigh over a small crescent shape looks like a moon sexier than a tattoo youre trying to distract me doesnt take much effort but he trailed his finger back down to her knee i dont want to see the guy get popped by his wife he fell for the horse and maybe i gave him a little push he moved his shoulders if kate has a problem we can lose the deal laura tilted her head and then in your opinion kate would be a shrew and byron a milquetoast i was thinking wuss actually amused he straightened her leg so that he could lift her knee and kiss it did you always talk everything over nice and civilized with ridgeway no that was part of the problem i did what i was told and behaved like a proper dutiful and spineless wife sorry annoyed with himself for the need to pry open that door to her life he gave her knee a quick squeeze bad question no it wasnt she shifted a little leaning back on the pillows propped on the iron headboard i learned from it i learned i wont ever be spineless again or ineffectual or quietly desperate she tapped her fingers against the glass as she put into words what had been in her heart what he did i let him do which makes it as much my fault as his im only sorry it took finding him in bed with another woman to force me to fix my life youre happy now yes and grateful she smiled again grateful to you too his thumb skimmed around to rub the back of her knee for for helping me realize i have a sex drive appreciating her he leaned up nipping her lips with his as he set his glass on the table beside the bed you had problems with that im not having them now maybe i should check just to be sure but before she could circle him into her arms he slipped back i think ill start down here he murmured and lifted her foot youre not going to oh her head fell back as his teeth and tongue went to work they do reflexology in the spa at the resort she murmured as he bombarded all manner of tiny sensitive nerves it never felt like this youre not going to start fantasizing that im viktor the massage boy are you she laughed moaned shuddered no the realitys just jesus she dropped her glass splattering wine over herself and the sheets oh im sorry let me no you dont he gave her a gentle shove that sent her weakly back onto the pillows just stay where you are until i finish he scraped his teeth over her ankle things were a little rushed before i think i skimmed over some of the finer points he pressed the heel of his hand lightly against her had her hips rising i suggest you hang on sugar im going to take you for a long hard ride it was like being assaulted on all sides inside and out mind and body she could do nothing but absorb react experience he worked his way up as if she were a meal to be savored course by course the lights he left burning blazed too bright burned her eyes even when she closed them the air breezy through the open windows was suddenly too thick so that each breath she took was a gasp her skin no longer cool pulsed with the beat of blood beneath and with the skim of hands and mouth the long muscles in her thighs quivered as he cruised over them and the sheets rustled at the bunch and flex of her hands shed never been tasted this way touched this way as if she were everything and all things and his mouth closed over her suddenly greedy rough and focused on that core of wet heat until she flew up like an arrow with the sharp edge of her own pleasure stabbing her he was mad for her now wild to see her pinned on the jagged peak of her own ecstasy her head was flung back her eyes blind her hands wrapped around the iron posts of the bed as if only that desperate grip kept her anchored and he was mad to drive her farther he used his hands until she bucked against him in frantic pleading rhythm watched her watched her until his name sobbed out of her until her hands lost their grip until her body went pliant as pooled wax she lay still wrecked unable to do more than moan when he lifted her enough to slip the shirt away from her shoulders youre beautiful ms templeton gold he touched his hand to her hair rose and her breast she trembled under his touch michael she opened heavy eyes saw the room spin i cant cant you gently now he lowered his head flicked his tongue over her nipple i wonder i know you didnt you havent she reached for him knowing she would find him hard and ready let me some other time he smiled though his blood had leaped when her fingers closed around him ill take a rain check lets just see if we can finish this the oldfashioned way this time he closed his mouth over her breast and sent the ache echoing down you do things inside me her breath began to hitch again that curl of new need began to spread and ache and throb you have no idea what you do inside me it was building again impossibly strong she could have wept he feasted on her breasts teeth and tongue hungry for the flavor of her that fragile and floral taste hed come to crave he took her hands wrapping them around the posts again keeping his clamped over hers the thought ran through her reeling head that they were both trapped both locked in both prisoners of this accepting she lifted her mouth to his linking there as well and met his fast desperate thrust then it was only blind speed blazing heat gasps and the animals song of flesh against flesh harder deeper until he was buried in her until still linked hands mouths sex they plunged later when blood had cooled and the air was quiet again she shifted his arm curled around her held i thought you were asleep she murmured was i have to go i cant sneak in the house at dawn every morning carrying my shoes little while more he was still half asleep and his voice was thick with it i wanna hold you her heart melted gently she brushed the hair back from his face wild untamed hair she thought devils hair dark and seductive only a little while she rested her head on his shoulder her hand on his heart but he was already asleep again so she lay there for a little while feeling his heart beat mrs williamson slid a stack of pancakes under michaels nose it seemed the least he could do was eat them she watched him take the first bite her arms folded over her breasts the best he said when i get my place back together im going to miss sneaking over here and having you feed me sure you dont want to marry me and come along you keep asking you might get surprised she topped off his coffee the boy had always had a raging appetite she reflected for all manner of things did you finish up that casserole i sent down i ate it bowl and all absently he reached down to scratch the kitten that wound hopefully through his legs and the pie and those cookies he grabbed her hand nibbling on it while she clucked at him if you were to see your way to making one of those chocolate cakes the one with the cream and the cherries black forest miss lauras favorite it is apparently they shared the same taste out of bed as well she probably wouldnt miss a piece or two of it well see about it she skimmed her hand through his hair tugged on the ponytail you need a decent haircut man your age wearing your hair like a hippie the last hippie emigrated to greenland in theres a small commune there where they still make love beads oh youre a smart one you are eat your breakfast ive got to see that those children are fed before they go off to school and miss laura she continued bustling back to the stove eats like a sparrow never takes the time to sit down and start the day with a decent meal just coffee she tells me well you cant fuel a body on coffee lauras body seemed fueled fine to him but he didnt think it wise to mention it mrs williamson might be fond of him but he didnt imagine shed approve of him luring the mistress into hot sweaty bouts of sex shes going to make herself sick like miss katie did last year michael stopped brooding looked up kate was sick an ulcer even the idea of it insulted her mrs williamson stopped flipping pancakes to turn around to him can you imagine that overdoing undereating overworrying until she was flat on her back well we took care of that right enough shes okay now she looks great fit and fine and expecting too kates pregnant the grin split michaels face no shit he winced when she sent him a narrowed look he remembered she didnt care for such language in her kitchen sorry well overlook it this time shes got herself healthy and happy our kate that man she married wont let her get away with that kind of nonsense theres a sensible man one who knows how to take care of a woman they look good together classy michael thought frowning down at his plate but then byron had grown up in southern comfort and kate was in every way that mattered a templeton they fit he added that they do its a good feeling to see miss kate happy and miss margo so nice and settled and whats miss laura got but those two angels to raise on her own she gestured with her spatula stopped for a breath its a good thing her parents are coming back for a time theres no one in the world straightens out a tangle like mr and mrs t when the door opened she closed her mouth not wanting to be taken for gossiping mrs williamson i oh hello michael laura looked as fresh as a rosebud in her neat pale yellow suit not at all like the woman who had sobbed out his name the night before unless you looked at the eyes hello laura mrs williamson took pity on a starving man blueberry pancakes the girls will be in heaven sit down miss laura and have a plate now no i cant just coffee please i was looking for annie she accepted the cup mrs williamson handed her ive got to go in early theres a problem at the office she looked at her watch i should be in the car already i cant find annie and i need to see if she can run the girls to school shes gone its her day for the farmers market oh laura pressed her fingers to her eyes i forgot then ill have to ill run them in busily rearranging her schedule laura blinked at him what ill run them to school i couldnt impose but its no problem and i dont think you have time to argue about it go on to work i think i can get two girls to school without permanent damage i didnt mean he was right she admitted with another glance at her watch she didnt have time to argue i appreciate it thanks its hornbecker academy if you take south to i know where it is he interrupted same place you went yes shed had no idea hed known where she went to school much less remembered it i really appreciate this michael im so late she set the coffee aside then stood flustered when he took her hand relax the hotels not going to collapse if youre late for a meeting no but my department might ali has to turn in her english composition this morning she has it i checked but you might want to remind her and kayla should go over her spelling words on the drive in she has a test ali can help her i said ill handle it yes but if youd make sure they take umbrellas ive set them out it may rain now he rose and forgetting he had an audience took her face in his hands and kissed her go away i she glanced over to where mrs williamson was by all appearances busy humming over her pancakes im going but they need to be reminded to feed the dog sometimes out because she apparently needed a boost he pulled her to the door go nag somebody else when she opened her mouth again he gave her a friendly slap on the butt to send her along how does anyone start a morning like that he wondered then turned and found mrs williamson eyeing him soberly he cursed but was wise enough to do it only mentally is it like that around here every day ignoring his question she stepped forward walked around him he thought he had a pretty good idea of what she was seeing a man who came in the back door because he didnt belong at the front one she stopped faced him pursed her lips i wondered if you had your eye on anything else around here besides my cooking because she had a way of making him want to shuffle his feet he tucked his hands in his pockets so so good she gave his cheek a brisk pat and was amused by the surprise on his face the boy she thought had never had a clue of his own worth so good for both of you and about time i say first time in her life that girls had a real man humbled speechless he shook his head when he found his voice again he took her hands mrs williamson you slay me i will if you break her heart but in the meantime you should be good for each other now sit down and finish your breakfast before its cold if youre going to handle those girls yourself this morning you need your fuel i love you i really do her face creased in a wide smile i know that boy i love you right back now sit down and eat theyll be down in a minute and chattering like magpies chapter fourteen contents prev next michael fury had jumped off buildings fought in jungles weathered a typhoon at sea raced cars at high speed and at one time or another broken several major bones in his body hed been in bar fights spent the night in a cell where the artwork on the walls ran to anatomically exaggerated etchings of female organs he had killed men and loved women and he had he realized led a sheltered life he had never faced the perils and predicaments of getting two girls out of the house on a school day what do you mean you cant wear those shoes they dont go with my outfit his eyes narrowed as he studied alis floral skirt and pink sweater hadnt she been wearing some green thing a minute ago thats what you said the last time and it looks fine to me theyre just shoes in the way of every female since eve strapped on a fig leaf ali rolled her eyes theyre the wrong shoes i have to change them well hurry up jesus he muttered as she dashed back upstairs leaving kayla tugging on his hand i forgot how to spell bedlam allison she giggled at that no really is it lam or lem a he was pretty sure spelling homework wasnt exactly his strong point and if they didnt get moving he was going to be late meeting his contractor the backup with building permits had already put him behind now allison and her shoes allison im walking out the door with or without you in ten seconds sometimes mama says that too kayla informed him but she never does i will come on he tugged kayla to the door you cant go without her eyes wide kayla trotted beside him to his car mamas going to be mad if you do were going in the car come on how will ali get to school she can walk michael said grimly in whatever shoes shes picked out this time hed solved the crisis of kaylas broken barrette hadnt he and her hair looked okay to him tied back with the rubber band hed pulled out of his own hair he hadnt panicked when ali claimed to have misplaced her book bag but had found it himself under the kitchen table where shed dumped it during her breakfast hed remained the calm mediator when the two girls had fallen into a minor catfight over whose turn it was to feed the pets and he had not faltered when bongo had expressed his sorrow that his young mistresses were leaving him by peeing in the foyer no he had stood strong through all of that michael thought as he gunned the engine but he knew when he was being dicked around and he wasnt taking it impatience turned to smugness when he saw ali flying out of the house indignation flashed in her eyes as she pulled open the car door you were going without me thats right blondie get in not wanting him to see under the circumstances that the nickname delighted her she angled her chin theres only two seats where am i supposed to sit beside your sister but in now at the snapped order she moved fast squeezing beside kayla pouting dramatically when michael reached over to tug the seat belt around both of them she announced i dont think this is legal it was her best ladyofthemanor voice michael realized her mothers voice call a cop he muttered and started down the drive for the next fifteen minutes he was treated to a run of complaints shes pushing me shes taking all the room shes sitting on my skirt the muscle behind his eye began to twitch how did anyone anyone tolerate this every morning of their life i need to go over my words kayla wailed im having a test michael alis pushing her elbow in me again ali get a grip he blew away the hair that thanks to his gift to kayla danced in his eyes theres not enough room ali informed him loftily shes taking up the whole seat i am not you are too i am at the snarl issuing from the man beside them both girls lapsed into momentary silence satisfied michael took a calming breath what are the spelling words i cant remember i have them written down in my notebook the wail inched back into her voice if i dont get a hundred i dont get to play on the computer at free time so get the notebook out this as he should have known caused more complaints youre stepping all over my shoes youre getting them dirty kayla im going to i dont want to hear about those shoes blondie the twitch was back double time not a word about the shoes here are my words triumphant kayla waved the notebook conking him on the head in her enthusiasm well study them or something no ali reads them and i spell them and i have to use each one in a sentence i dont want to read them michael sent ali a narrow look want to walk oh all right with little grace she snatched the notebook theyre just baby words they are not youre just mad because tod likes marcie better than you he does not and i dont care anyway and you didnt learn your words because you were too busy drawing dumb pictures they are not dumb youre dumb because cut it out right now if i have to stop this car appalled he trailed off had he just said what he thought hed said dear christ he was forced to take several calming breaths allison just read the words im going to she sniffed peered down her nose at kaylas carefully written list committed committed she parroted the letters then bit her lip she fumbled for the sentence looked hopefully at michael michael fury innocently volunteering to drive two young girls to school has now been committed to an institution for the permanently insane it made ali laugh hes just being silly dont bet on it kid but he racked his brain to come up with an alternative the witness pointed accusingly at the man who had committed the crime hows that okay they ran through the rest with michael nearly crosseyed by the time he pulled through the gates of the academy his ancient porsche merged with shining mercedes sedate lincolns and snappy fourwheeldrives scram he said unhooking the seat belt im late youre supposed to say have a good day kayla reminded him yeah well have one then later michael she rolled her eyes now kiss us goodbye she pursed her lips planted one on him amused he peered over at ali ali doesnt want to kiss me shes still mad at me i am not she sniffed then graciously leaned over kayla and touched her lips to his cheek thank you for driving us to school it was my education he told her then watched them scurry up the granite steps with hordes of other children jesus laura he rested his aching head on the steering wheel how do you get through that every day without drinking heavy she could have told him it was all a matter of planning discipline and priorities and prayers for patience at the end of this particular day because the first three had crumbled in her hands she was doing a lot of praying could she have anticipated that two women from rival romance magazines would start a fistfight in the lobby she didnt think so could she have guessed that after their efforts to dispel the hairpulling teethsnapping namecalling furor two of her bell people would require stitches she doubted it she could have after the event predicted the arrival of the press the cameras the questions and the necessity for her to answer questions but she didnt have to like it things hadnt gone that much more smoothly when shed arrived late at pretenses to find kate in an uproar because margo had delved into her sacrosanct spreadsheets then there had been the customer who instead of watching the three children shed herded into the shop with her loitered in the wardrobe room while they ran rampant the result was a broken vase fingersmudged counters and frazzled nerves the woman left in a huff after being asked to watch her children and pay for the damages life was no more simple when she returned home ready to whimper and found herself faced with an upcoming science project the request to volunteer to chaperone a field trip to the aquarium and that parental terror long division it didnt perk up her mood to discover that bongo had expressed his adoration for her by burrowing into her closet and chewing three shoes each from a different pair and her parents were arriving the next day all right laura scrubbed her hands over her face after shed changed into slacks she would handle it homework was done bongo chastised and it was unlikely that templeton would be sued because a couple of women went ballistic in the lobby still she needed some air which would give her an opportunity to make certain that old joe had the garden up to speed that the paths had been swept and since shed forgotten to ask ann to see that the pool was vacuumed and readied for her mothers visit she would see to that herself rolling up her sleeves as she went she passed alis room she stopped a moment and smiled she heard both of her daughters inside chattering away over some recent movie heartthrob who wasnt yet old enough to shave they were giggling nothing could be really wrong with the world when her daughters were giggling she slipped out the side door knowing that ann would lecture her to leave the landscaping and pool to old joe and his grandson but laura knew that young joe was cramming for his final exams and it would take her ten well twenty minutes to put things right besides she enjoyed the mindless task of manually vacuuming the pool it gave her a chance to dream in the garden which she noted with pleasure was blooming beautifully old joes bursitis must have been behaving itself hed put in new beds of annuals filling in among the perennials with splashes of color and sweeps of shape the paths were swept clean the mulch damp from watering and raked smooth looks like were in business she said to the pup who trotted along with her shed had to forgive him for the shoe incident when he looked so ashamed and contritely licked her face now you sit and behave yourself willing to make amends bongo plopped on the skirt of the pool watching her over his shaggy paws out of eyes dazed with love of course laura thought if shed remembered to pick up a new droid the pool would be cleaned automatically all she had to do was remember to write it down when she went back in the house otherwise she was going to have to break down and buy one of those electronic pads like kate kept in her pocket at all times but it wasnt a problem to unwind the hoses from their tidy box in the pool shed or slip the attachments together she went about it mechanically daydreaming she would settle the kids for the night it was so good to have ali smile and mean it at their goodnight hug perhaps ali was disillusioned about her father but she felt better about herself that was what mattered most then she would go over the household accounts with annie laura mused things were looking up there as well her dual incomes and the interest on the investments kate had made for her were holding them above water by lauras calculations in another six months or so they might actually be able to swim a few laps so she wouldnt sell any more of her jewelry unless absolutely necessary she wouldnt have to duck and dodge questions from her parents or josh and maybe just maybe shed be able to juggle funds to buy that horse for ali after all shed take a close look at her own books later or tomorrow she mused thinking of michael she wanted to go to him again tonight to forget everything but being feeling he did that for her made her feel like the center of the universe when he made love to her shed always dreamed of a man who would think of nothing but her when she was in his arms who would lose himself in her as she lost herself in him of knowing that he was so focused on her when he touched her that there was room for nothing else in his mind or heart oh she did wish she knew his heart that was her problem she admitted running the pole smoothly through the water she wanted that foolishly romantic love shed dreamed of as a girl seraphinas love she thought with a quiet laugh the kind a woman would die for well she couldnt afford to be dewyeyed enough to hurl herself off a cliff for anyone she had children to raise a house to run and a career a surprisingly interesting career to maintain so she would happily settle for whatever she and michael had between them and be grateful for it more than grateful she thought tonight in bed when he put his hands on her again those impatient roughpalmed hands that took whatever they wanted and made her wild with need the way he murmured her name softly deeply when he slid into her to mate what the hell are you doing the pole nearly slipped out of her hands at the sharp tone her head jerked up and there was her lover scowling standing spreadlegged hands in his pockets with his hair loose and flowing fighting against a reckless urge to leap on him and tear in she tilted her head why im mixing a soufflé what does it look like why the hell are you doing that yourself he was beside her in two angry strides pulling the pole away dont you have servants to do this actually no i let the pool boy go a couple of years ago when i learned that candy was using him for her personal maintenance as well as her pool i found it awkward he wasnt going to smile or even smirk coming across her like this seeing her laboring over some ridiculous menial chore after putting in a full day burned him then hire another one im afraid it doesnt fit into the scheme of things just now in any case im perfectly capable of doing it myself taking a closer look she brushed at his hair you seem a little frazzled michael rough day hed been in a pisser of a mood since his contractor had estimated it would be six months before the rebuilding was completed there had been a lot of blahblah about permits inspections zoning but the upshot was that he was going to be lauras tenant for a great deal longer than hed anticipated he didnt want to be her tenant to hand over a rent check every month it wasnt the money he thought fuming it was the it was awkward ive had better he nudged her aside and began to run the vacuum himself but were not talking about me you cant raise two kids hold down two jobs and deal with this sort of nonsense too why dont you just close the damn pool because i enjoy swimming and there are a lot of women who do a great deal more than i do and manage very well theyre not you which said it all in his mind no they dont have a beautiful home that no one would ever take from them and they dont necessarily have a job that theyre in no danger of jeopardizing if they need to flex their schedule insulted she fought with him over the pole i am not the pampered princess you seem to think im a she hissed tugged capable intelligent woman who can run her life very well im sick and tired of people patting me on the head and saying poor laura behind my back she yanked swore i am not poor laura and i can clean my own goddamn pool give me back the stupid pole no it had calmed him considerably to see her temper flare it wasnt much of one as far as he could see but there was potential in those stormy eyes flushed cheeks gritted teeth keep messing with me sugar and ill toss you in its a little cool for a dip this evening fine do it yourself youre a man after all and men are so much more capable of doing mindless chores but i didnt ask for your help nor do i need it nor do i need your sterling advice or your unsolicited criticism on how i handle my life thats telling me he said equably my hands are starting to shake her eyes narrowed into slits you too could be taking a dip interesting he thought did she actually have a physical temper in there is that so you want to try to take me down if i did youd be treading water in oh no bongo no insults paled when she caught sight of the pup busily digging up the newly planted pansies stop that stop that right now she dashed across the pool skirt snatched up the pup and frowned at his dirt and mulchsmeared nose how could you didnt i tell you no its bad youre not to dig in the flowers when she set him down to survey the damage bongo cheerfully leaped into the mess and began digging again i said no stop it why dont you listen to me because he knows youre a pushover bongo at michaels voice the pup lifted his head and grinned sheepishly michael could almost hear the sentiment well gee mick just having a little fun here michael snapped his finger pointed and bongo padded out shook himself and sat politely torn between disgust and admiration laura hissed between her teeth how do you get him to do that its a gift thats just great disgust won she dragged her hands through her hair i cant control a fivepound puppy just takes practice and patience well i dont have time to practice now she was down on her knees in a flash salvaging bedding plants and im out of patience old joe is going to kill me for this laura though it seemed obvious to point it out michael crouched and pointed it out anyway he works for you a lot you know she muttered desperately smoothing upturned mulch with her bare hands if i so much as sniff an undesignated rose in his garden he she broke off scowling dont just sit there help me i thought you didnt need any help shut up michael she brushed a hand over her cheek smeared it with garden dirt just shut up and save these pansies before bongo and i both end up in the pound since you ask so nice he shoved roots back into soil and heard her let out a long keening moan not like that for lords sake youre not planting redwoods have a little delicacy sorry its my first day on the job he shook his head as she shifted and knelt in the dirt in a way that was sure to send her trim pastel slacks into the rag heap and all he thought to save the sensibilities of an ancient gardener you run scared of the rest of your staff too damn right most of them have been here longer than i have this could work her hands coated now with black soil smoothed and patted youll hardly be able to tell when im done here but who am i fooling he can tell if you pluck a spray of crabgrass which is fine as long as youve asked first its looking fine to me like youd know a pansy from a geranium she muttered now youre getting nasty youve got something casually he swiped his hand over her cheek adding a fresh layer of dirt there and here you need a little to even out the look i suppose you think thats funny struggling for dignity she brushed at her face and only succeeded in making it worse no he picked up a handful of damp pine mulch and dropped it onto her hair thats funny a pity i dont have your raucous sense of humor but let me try she rubbed both of her filthy hands over his shirt there im dying from laughter now he glanced down at his shirt hed just washed the damn thing now youve done it he said quietly the tone warned her not to inch back not to bother with reason and excuses but to run she sprang to her feet sending the dog into frantically joyful barks she managed two sprinting yards before he snagged her around the waist and lifted her off her feet you started it she managed between choked laughs uhhuh so im obliged to finish it ill have your shirt cleaned whoops she watched the world revolve as he flipped her over into his arms why mr fury youre so masterful so strong so what are you doing amusement turned to panic as she caught a glimpse of his direction and realized his intention michael this isnt funny now just my raucous sense of humor again he told her as he strode toward the edge of the pool dont now i mean it michael in selfdefense she locked her arms around his neck im covered with dirt and its chilly and ive just cleaned the pool just look at the way it sparkles too controlling her frantic wiggling he toed off his shoes looks so pretty in the twilight doesnt it i will make you pay she vowed i swear i will make you pay if you dare hold your breath he suggested and jumped in but she was shrieking when she hit the water swallowed it came up choking you fool you idiot you she swallowed more when he pushed her head under what he hadnt counted on was that laura templeton had been captain of her swim team had won a drawer full of medals and had more than once successfully defended herself against a big brothers bullying while he treaded water and roared with laughter she nipped fluidly between his legs grabbed hold where a man was most vulnerable and squeezed she could hear the muffled echo of his yelp smiled grimly and yanked downward streaking away she broke the surface and waited smugly for him to wheeze out breaths and flail toward the side now that she said slicking back her dripping hair was funny he had his breath back mostly and eyed her narrowly want to fight dirty sugar this is my element michael youre in over your head think so hed done more than a few water stunts in his day he pushed off the side and pursued she was faster than hed given her credit for and slicker he knew when he was being taunted the way she nipped just out of reach in a dive for the bottom the fluidity with which she changed direction and dodged they surfaced again watching each other over the lapping water wet jeans are constricting she cocked her head if you need an excuse she snagged one of her shoes as it floated by sighed four pair in one day has to be a record philosophically she planted her feet and stood the water streamed off her glued the thin material of her blouse to the high full curve of breast to the narrow torso and subtle flare of hip in the shadowed light her dripping hair curled wildly and glowed like wet gold now you are playing dirty he murmured pouring the water out of her shoe she looked over at him her hand remained aloft her eyes on his as he slowly skimmed through the water toward her as he stood he slid his hands over her thighs hips sides and left them molded to her breasts michael the shoe dropped out of her hand and plopped into the water we cant im just going to kiss you his hands slipped wetly to her back down to cup her bottom as he eased back until they were floating again and touch you and drive us both a little crazy oh her head was already spinning as his teeth caught her lip tugged well if thats all she wrapped herself around him let him take her through the cool water it was her mouth that grew hungrier more avid seeking his over and over again going deeper with tongues tangling breath clashing need pounded through him with anvil shocks she was destroying him her legs gripped hard so that her tight little body molded to his her hips moving seductively so that sex rubbed sex laura but she answered with an impatient moan tunneling her hands through his hair savaging his throat his loins began to throb like a wound hold on a minute i want you her voice was thick the words hot against his skin i want you i want you we cant do this here could they his mind went blank when her mouth fit to his again he sank with her so that the water surrounded them her hair floated out like the mermaid who watched them from the bottom he wanted to keep sinking sinking just like this with his mouth hard on hers sink into a world where air didnt matter light didnt matter where there was nothing but her and this churning sweet ache of need when they surfaced again he shook his head trying to clear it then kicked once to keep them afloat no it wasnt a word hed expected to say to a woman under the circumstances and it came out weak as he pressed her head onto his shoulder youd better give me a minute she floated with him dizzy with desire dazed with triumph i seduced you sugar you damn near killed me she threw her head back and laughed i seduced you she repeated her face glowing i didnt know i could its liberating you come on over to my place tonight and you can be as liberated as you want right now keep your hands off me she linked her hands behind his neck easing back so that she could see his face in the falling light you wanted to tear my clothes off again im still thinking about it so behave yourself i wanted to tear yours off too i wonder what that would feel like to just rip away at your clothes and bite you sometimes i just want to sink my teeth into your shut up in defense he cupped her head and pulled it to his shoulder again i think ive created a monster i dont know about that but you sure hit the switch i like it she laughed again and arched back so that she was floating from the waist up lets come back here tonight when everyones asleep and go skinnydipping and make love in the water then well go for a walk on the cliffs and make love there just like seraphina and felipe she rose up again water streaming from her lets do something crazy he was about to do something crazy just then when he caught the sound of footsteps on the path and movement subtly he hoped he changed his grip hoping he wasnt holding any inappropriate part of the daughter of the house laura susan templetons brows shot up into her spiky bangs she didnt consider herself to be a woman who was easily surprised but it certainly rocked her to see her daughter clinging to a man in the pool with the look of a woman who had recently been thoroughly aroused still on her face mom shock came first then the heat in her cheeks from embarrassment she wiggled but michael held firm neither of them knew if it was out of stubbornness or habit youre here yes i am but you were supposed to be here tomorrow we finished up our business a little early she spoke smoothly but then she was a smooth woman small and delicately built like her daughter she looked young and chic in her valentino traveling suit her dark blond hair capped gamine style around a sharp interested face we thought she said with a faint edge of amusement that wed surprise you i think we succeeded yes i was just we were how was the trip laura ended lamely fine manners polished to a high sheen susan stepped forward smiled its michael isnt it michael fury yeah with a jerk of his head he tossed his wet hair back nice to see you again mrs templeton chapter fifteen contents prev next if id known you were coming in this evening id have held dinner called the rest of the family composed now and dry laura sat beside her father in the parlor we ate on the plane thomas patted her hand he was thanks to his wifes discretion blissfully unaware of what his daughter had been doing in the pool an hour earlier and well see everyone tomorrow i swear those girls have grown a foot since christmas it seems like laura sipped brandy her mother was upstairs putting the girls to bed at her insistence it postponed the questions laura knew didnt eliminate them theyre so excited that youre here we didnt think youd be back until summer got to see our katie girl he told her only one of the reasons he mused but it would do well enough imagine our little kate having a baby shes glowing i know its a cliché but she really is she and byron go around beaming all the time oh and wait until you see j t oh dad hes so perfect hes sitting up now and he laughs all the time those wonderful belly laughs i could just eat him up she curled her legs up studied him over the rim of her snifter and how are you fit and fine it was no less than true he was a handsome man one who didnt take his health for granted and disciplined himself with exercise and interests he wasnt one who took his business or his success for granted he watched over things with a shrewd and focused eye nor did he take his family for granted he kept them close in heart and mind the result was a firm body still lanky in his fifties a face that had lived well and accepted the lines and dents of time with gratitude his eyes were smoke like his daughters and the silver in his hair glinted richly in the lamplight you dont look fit and fine she said and smiled when his brow knit you look dashing and you look happy it relieved him but he worried at the cause was it as annie had prophesied darkly a transitory state attributable to michael fury or was his little girl finally finding her feet again youre taking some time for yourself again im enjoying myself it wasnt quite the answer but it was truth ali and i have resolved some things shes happier so im happier i love my work my sisters keep giving me new babies to play with with a sigh she leaned her head on his shoulder i havent felt quite so content in a long time your mother and i worry about you i know and i wont bother to tell you not to but i will tell you im fine better than fine we heard that peters to be married again her teeth went on edge to candace litchfield word travels laura murmured people are more than pleased to spread that sort of news are you all right with it i was upset initially she admitted remembering that hammer blow to the midsection when theyd made the announcement that night at the club a kneejerk reaction really it was mostly the idea of candy being stepmother to my babies and worry about how the girls would handle it and he said quietly his hand over hers and now that its all settled in it just doesnt matter she turned her hand under his squeezed really doesnt matter at all the girls have adjusted theyll go to the wedding in may because its the right thing for them to do they dont particularly care for candy but theyll be polite then theyll come home she added and well get on with our lives theyre good girls thomas agreed good sharp girls i know its not easy for them but they have you so its you im concerned with theres no need in fact ive come to the conclusion that peter and candy are perfectly suited i couldnt be more happy for them he waited a beat ran his tongue around his teeth thats nasty yes she sighed lavishly it is i like it thats my girl now lets talk about something much more interesting she sat back again grinning let me tell you about the impromptu boxing match in the lobby today when susan came back in it was to the roar of her husbands laughter and the rich undertone of her daughters she stood for a minute enjoying the scene she could count every week every month that had passed since she had seen her little girl laugh that freely gnawing her lip she considered if michael fury had anything to do with it she owed him whatever annie might think as a woman she understood and appreciated the need of another woman to have at least once at least briefly a dangerous man in her life as a mother well they would see tommy your granddaughters want a kiss good night he was up like a shot ill have to give them one then and no more than one story susan murmured to him as he passed no matter how much you want to play he pinched her cheek winked and walked on that should keep him busy for an hour susan glided over to the liquor cabinet poured herself a brandy and will give you time to tell me about michael fury her mother laura thought rarely circled around a point if she could zero right in josh must have told you about the mud slides how michael lost his house yes i know the background laura her daughter susan thought could evade like a champ hes raising horses now and renting the stables for a time hes got wonderful horses laura leapt on the ploy youll have to see for yourself several are trained for stunts its fascinating hes teaching the girls to ride you know theyre crazy about him and are you crazy about him its been good for the girls to be around a man who pays attention to them patient susan reached down to pet bongo only one of the changes she mused as the dog vibrated with pleasure under her hand i was asking about you laura how you feel about him im very fond of him hes been helpful and kind are you sure you dont want me to get you something to eat some fruit and cheese no i dont want fruit and cheese susan reached over to still her daughters nervous hand are you in love with him i dont know laura leveled her breath and met her mothers gaze im sleeping with him im sorry if you disapprove its not for me to disapprove over something that personal at this point in your life but there was a pang youre being careful of course hes very attractive yes he is and nothing like peter no laura agreed nothing at all like peter is that why youre attracted to him because hes the antithesis of your exhusband im not using peter as a yardstick restless she rose maybe i was to some extent its difficult not to compare when youve only been with two men im not sleeping with michael to prove anything to anyone but because its he makes me i want him and he wants me will that be enough for you laura i dont know its enough for now she turned away paced to the fire it was quiet tonight just a warm glow and a subtle hiss i failed before i wanted it to be perfect i wanted to be perfect maybe i wanted to be you oh honey its not your fault laura said quickly when her mother got to her feet please dont think i mean that its only that i grew up seeing you how you were how you are so competent and wise and flawless im not flawless laura no one is you were to me you are you never faltered never stumbled never let me down i stumbled she crossed the room took her daughters hands countless times i had your father to help me get my balance and he had you to help him thats what i always wanted dreamed of the kind of marriage and life and family you made and im not foolish enough to think it didnt take effort and mistakes and sleepless nights to make it but you did i didnt you make me angry when you blame yourself laura shook her head i dont completely but i know im not blameless either i set my sights impossibly high every time i had to readjust them lower them it was harder i dont ever want to do that again if you set your sights too low you can miss a great deal maybe but im not pushing for more here than what i have part of me will always want what you and dad have not only for myself but for my children but if its not in the cards im through crying over it im going to give them the best life i can and make the best one for myself too right now michaels an important part of it does he know how important laura shrugged her shoulders its often difficult to tell how much michael knows but i know this peter didnt love me not ever laura no its true and i can live with that in fact she discovered it was easier to live with than she had imagined but i loved him and i married him and stayed with him for ten years both of us and certainly the children would have been better off if i hadnt been so determined to make it work if i had just accepted the failure and let go i think youre wrong susan said quietly by doing everything you could do to hold your marriage and your family together you can look back and know you did your best maybe and perhaps one day she would look back with michael i dont have to carry the burden of making something work or of living with the illusion that i have a man who loves me and wants what i want and im happier than ive been in too long to remember then im happy for you and will keep my own counsel susan thought for now lets go rescue your father she said tucking her arm through lauras before those girls have him wrapped around their fingers so tight he bounces the year thomas templeton married susan conroy he added the tower suite as his innovation for templeton house the house had already stood a hundred years with nearly every generation of his family toying with or expanding the original design he had built it out of fancy and a love for the romantic he had made love with his wife there countless nights conceived both of their children within the charming rounded walls in the big rococo bed although susan often said josh had been made on the bokhara rug in front of the fire he never disputed her on such matters now with flames simmering in the adams fireplace a bottle of templeton champagne chilled in a silver bucket and moonlight filtering in through the high windows he curled with his wife of thirtysix years on that same rug i think youre trying to seduce me he offered her a glass brimming with frothy wine youre such a sharp woman susie and smart enough to let you smiling she touched a hand to his face tommy how could so many years have gone by you look the same he pressed his lips to her palm just as lovely just as fresh now it takes me hours to maintain the illusion its no illusion he nestled her head on his shoulder watched the fire leap as a log gave way to the heat do you remember the first night we slept here you carried me up the steps up every single one and when you brought me in here you had flowers everywhere gardens of them roses strewn over the bed wine chilling the candles lighted you cried you overwhelmed me you often did and do still she tilted her face up brushed her lips over his jaw i knew i was the luckiest woman in the world to have you to be loved the way you loved me and to be wanted the way you wanted me she shut her eyes turned her face against his throat oh tommy tell me whats troubling you its laura isnt it i cant bear to see her hurt i can stand anything but that even though i know that children have to go their own way fight their own battles it breaks my heart i can still remember the day she was born the way she curled into my arms so small and precious and you think michael fury is going to break her heart i dont know i wish i did she rose walked to the window that looked out over the cliffs cliffs she knew that laura had haunted since childhood its knowing shes already had it broken that kills me inside i spoke with her tonight when you were up with the girls and i realized as she talked to me that as hard as shes worked to rebuild her life part of her is still so vulnerable so raw so exposed she believes shes failed tommy failed my ass incensed he sprang up peter ridgeway failed in every way possible and did we fail by not preventing could we have stopped her it was a question hed asked himself dozens of times over the last few years could we have no susan said after a long moment we might have postponed it we might have persuaded her to wait a few months a year but she was in love she wanted what we have thats what she said to me tonight tommy she wanted what we have when he laid a hand on her shoulder she reached back gripped tight i hate that she couldnt have it that she was denied the security and excitement and beauty of it now she doesnt believe she ever will have it shes a young woman susie a lovely and loving young woman shell fall in love again she already has shes in love with michael tommy she hasnt admitted it to herself yet she protects herself by thinking of it as sex please he winced its not easy to think of my little girl that way it made her laugh and turn to him your little girl is in the middle of a hot affair with joshs rebellious young friend should i get the gun so she laughed again embraced him oh tommy here we are with no way to stop it again nothing to do but wait and hope i could have a little talk with him you could i could but nothing we say is going to change lauras mind or her heart hes gorgeous intrigued thomas eased her back frowned into her eyes is that so absolutely devastatingly dangerously gorgeous sexy as sin her lips trembled at the corners as his frown deepened and he still has that thehellwithit look in his eye the one that makes every woman still breathing think shes the one person on earth who could make him care is that what you think flattered she patted his cheek i think i admire her taste and as a woman her luck as a mother im terrified of him maybe i will have a chat with him soon then he blew out a breath damn it susie ive always liked the boy so have i there was always something rawly honest about him and whatever annie thinks he wasnt and isnt a hoodlum what he is is basic and do we want our daughter involved with a basic man who ran off to sea at eighteen and has done any number of things not discussed in polite company she winced the same thought had passed through her head that sounds so snobbish it sounds like parental concern to me it doesnt matter if shes three or thirty its still our job to worry about her and men like michael come and go on their own whim she murmured they arent looking for roots laura would wither without them and from what she said the girls are attached to him how will it affect them to have another man walk out of their lives she burrowed against him theres nothing we can do but be there for them then thats what well do we watched margo and kate find the way through their problems laura will get through and they have each other she shifted so that they could look out toward the cliffs together the three of them are always there for each other that shop of theirs has worked magic for them whatever happens laura has them and the pride in what theyve built together but im greedy tommy she took his hand laid it on her heart i want her to have her dream i want her to have what we have i want to believe that shell stand at the window look toward the sea with a mans arms around her a man who loves her and will stand by her a man who can make her feel the way you make me feel she cupped his face in her hands so im going to believe it and if shes got any of me inside her shell fight for what she wants the way i fought for you you ignored me he reminded her wouldnt give me the time of day her smile bloomed slowly and it worked didnt it perfectly then one day i let you find me by calculated accident alone in the rose garden at the club and i let you kiss me like this she lifted her mouth drew the kiss out warm and slow and tommy templeton never seeing the punch went down for the count you always were sneaky susie he swung her up into his arms and made her laugh and i got exactly what i wanted just she murmured as he lowered her to the rug the way im going to get exactly what i want right now laura saw the lights in the tower room as she walked toward the cliffs and for a moment she stood watching the silhouette of her parents embracing it was a lovely sight stirred her heart and her envy they fit so perfectly together she thought turning back toward the song of the sea their rhythms their styles their goals their needs shed learned the hard way that what her parents had what they worked for and preserved wasnt a given but a rarity to be celebrated her new perspective only brought her more admiration for them she walked the cliffs alone something she hadnt done for weeks she wanted michael the low hum of desire was constant and thrilling but she wouldnt go to him tonight nor she believed did he expect her they had parted awkwardly she undeniably embarrassed at having been caught frolicking in the pool by her own mother he obviously uncomfortable she thought they both would need time to adjust the light was strong glowing with the clouds chased away to clear skies by a stiff westerly wind as familiar with the cliffs as with her own parlor laura picked her way down easily negotiating rocks and a path slippery with pebbles until she came to a favored ledge there she sat letting the wind whip at her face and the sea thunder in her ears and there listening for the whisper of ghosts thinking of lost love she was content from his window michael watched her go down the slope the long loose jacket she wore streaming out behind her like a cloak romantic mysterious he pressed his hand to the glass as if he could touch her then drew it back irritated with himself she wasnt coming to him small wonder he thought hooking his thumbs in his pockets as he watched her climb down rocks as gracefully as a fawn her parents were back and with them he expected came a reminder of the difference in their positions laura templeton may have been working for a living she may have scrubbed a few bathtubs but she was still laura templeton and he was still michael fury from the wrong side of the hill shed be busy now he supposed entertaining scheduling dinner parties during her parents stay those fancy flowerbedecked exclusive affairs that templeton house was renowned for there would be lunch at the club quick rounds of tennis erudite conversations over coffee and brandy the ritual was more foreign to him than greek and he had no desire to learn either so if she was going to brush him off what was the difference with a shrug he turned away from the window and stripped off his shirt he could lure her back into the sack another time or two if he wanted sex was nothing more than a weakness he could exploit hers to satisfy his own he heaved the shirt aside frustrated that it wasnt something hard and breakable goddamn it he wanted her now here with him who the hell did she think she was who the hell did he think he was eyes grim he pulled off his boots and threw them both against the wall where they at least made a satisfying thud he knew exactly who he was and so he thought did she laura templeton was going to find herself hardpressed to shake him loose until he was damn good and ready he wasnt finished with her yet not by a long shot she could have tonight he thought stripping off his jeans hed let her have tonight all quiet and safe because her nights werent going to stay quiet and they werent going to stay safe he dropped naked to the bed and glared at the ceiling and he would have her right back where he wanted her the hell with her parents her fancy friends and her perfect pedigree shed taken on a mongrel now shed have to deal with him from her perch on the ledge laura stretched her arms up cool damp air caressed her skin where the sleeves of her jacket fell down to her elbows she thought of how michael caressed that skin rough and demanding one moment then the next with surprising and devastating tenderness he had so many moods she thought so many needs he had in such a short time awakened so many moods so many needs in her no she was no sleeping beauty she reflected but she felt as though shed been sleeping for decades waiting for him to find her and he had she realized theyd found each other so why was she sitting here alone trying to reorganize her schedule for the next day and the day after that tomorrow would come anyway she could be with him right now shed go to him laura closed her eyes tight wished if his lights were still on when she stood and looked back she would go to him and he would be there waiting wanting she stood holding her breath and turned and let it out again as she saw nothing but night and the deeper silhouettes of darkened buildings he hadnt waited she brushed the chill from her arms calling it foolish it wasnt rejection it only meant he was tired and had gone to bed and she should do that herself there were dozens of things that needed to be done the next day that would be done better after a good nights sleep and they werent bound to spend every night together thered been no promises between them none at all she thought furious that her eyes stung as she turned back to the sea no promises no plans no soft words was that what she wanted still after she should have known better what weakness was this in her that craved those words those promises those plans couldnt she be content with what was and not always dream about what could be it didnt matter what shed told herself she realized as she sat down again it didnt matter what shed told her mother or margo or kate or what shed told michael it had all been lies she who was famous for being a pathetically poor liar had pulled this one off beautifully she was in love with him she was so stupidly in love with him and no one had a clue part of her had already seen them together tomorrow a year from tomorrow ten years lovers partners family more children a home a life shed lied to him to everyone including herself and now as it was with lies she would have to continue to spin them and live them to make the first of them hold it wouldnt be fair to him otherwise for he hadnt lied he had wanted her and she had no doubt that he cared for her he cared for her children was willing to offer a hand to help he gave her his body had awakened hers and had offered her a friendship that she valued and still she wasnt satisfied selfish she wondered or just foolish it hardly mattered she had created the illusion and would continue it or lose him when it was over whenever it ended she wouldnt regret it or curse god shed go on because life was long and precious and deserved the best she could give it when the time came and she had no choice but to live without him shed remember what it had been like to feel again and to love and shed be grateful steadier now she braced a hand on the ground to push herself up her fingers closed over the disk as if theyd known it was there waiting for her with her heart drumming loud as the waves below she lifted it up turned it under the stream of the moonlight it glinted dully the single gold coin untouched she thought with a shiver unseen for a hundred and fifty years since a young girl desperate had hidden it away to save for her lover this the symbol of the dream the promise and the loss lay cool in the center of her palm seraphina she murmured and her breath caught as she closed her fingers over the coin as she felt the wild need of a reckless young girl laura curled into a ball on the ledge high over the violent waves and wept chapter sixteen contents prev next the sorrel colt was bright pretty and stubborn as a fleabitten mule michael was working hard to prove that he was even more stubborn by god youll do it you little bastard you know how as if to say that was hardly the point the colt tossed his head rolled his eyes in michaels direction and stood firm theyd been dealing with each other for just over six months and both of them wanted to be in charge you think youve got these fancy digs and three squares to stand around posing michael slapped the bat in his hand and the colts ears flickered you even think about kicking me again and youll be eating dirt he stepped forward the colt danced back michaels eyes narrowed dangerously hold vibrating the colt did so pawing the ground in challenge as michael approached you and me michael said gripping the bridle as the colt began to swing around to get a good shot with his back leg were going to go a round dont you dare strike that animal both michael and the colt looked up in annoyance at the sharp order and saw the trim form swinging through the paddock gate you should be ashamed of yourself fired up susan grabbed the colts bridle and stepped between the horse and the bat i dont care if he belongs to you or not i wont have an animal mistreated on my property as if realizing that sympathy was on his side the colt lowered his head and nuzzled susans shoulder suck up michael muttered look mrs templeton i is this the way you treat your horses clubbing them when they dont behave as youd like you brute color flashed into her cheeks reminding michael of laura if you dare to raise a hand to one of these animals while im around ill personally kick your butt off templeton property and halfway to hell yes he could see now where laura got those licks of temper hed caught a few glimpses of and he could have sworn the colt was smirking at him mrs templeton then ill have you arrested she barreled on there are laws against cruelty to animals laws created to deal with insensitive brutes like you and if you ever dare to mistreat this sweet horse theres not a sweet bone in his body michael interrupted resisting the urge to rub the thigh that still sang from its rude encounter with a hoof and i wasnt going to use this to beat sense into his hard head though its tempting shed seen the look in his eye and the bat in his hand threw up her chin i suppose you were going to play baseball with him no maam it might be funny years later when he didnt ache everywhere were not playing at anything here and if you want to take a good look youll see the only one with bruises on him in this paddock is me she did look noted that although the coat was gleaming with a healthy layer of sweat the horse was unharmed in fact he was magnificent and the look in his eye wasnt fear she realized it was if such a thing were possible humor michael on the other hand was filthy and there was the telltale outline of a hoofprint on the leg of his jeans if you threaten him with a bat his only recourse is to strike out i would think youd mrs templeton patience was wearing thin and going ragged around the edges does this little bastard look threatened to you right now all hes doing is gloating it appeared that he was susan admitted making another close study of the colts eyes then explain why if youd just let loose of him before he sees i can be slapped around by a woman half my weight and i completely lose the upper hand here along with six months work id appreciate it she did loosen her grip on the bridle but warily im warning you michael if you dare to hurt him ill do more than slap you around i believe it michael muttered as she took a single step back would you move back to the fence please bastard still has a problem with control charming name with her arms folded susan took a few more steps in retreat and stayed poised ready to leap youve got me in it now havent you with a firm hand michael took the bridle pulled the colts head down until their eyes were level make me look like an idiot pal and i might just mistake your face for a spalding got that the colt snorted then jerked his head clear when michael released it michael shifted his grip on the bat curling fingers around tip and base then lifted it after a humming war of wills the colt reared up pawed the air up heedless of striking hooves michael stepped under them stay up there bastard nobodyll feed you if you kill me shifting the bat again he grabbed a handful of mane and swung up onto the nearly vertical back at the quick and easy grace of the move the fluidity with which man and horse merged susan sighed in admiration and again when michael turned the mount in a half circle the pressure of michaels knees brought the horse down stay back michael ordered susan without looking at her this is the part were having trouble with he brought bastard into a rear again rolled off and under the dancing hooves dont you step on me michael muttered as he felt the ground shake dont you step on me you son of a shit a hoof caught him in the hip just a graze but it was the principle of the thing he was on his feet again staring the horse down you did that on purpose youre going to do it again till you get it right limping only a little michael picked up the discarded bat and went through the entire routine again and again when they were both winded and hed managed to complete the drill without breaking anything michael limping a bit more went over to the bag hed slung over the fence and took out an apple the colt followed him pushed his head against michaels back dont try to make up im only giving you this because im not on my way to the hospital the colt nudged him again then tried to eat michaels hair cut it out you are such an ass kisser here the apple he offered was taken eagerly and you have revolting manners he added when bits of apple flew i owe you an apology michael stopped rubbing his bruised butt and looked at susan in his concentration hed forgotten she was still there no problem maybe i was thinking about bashing him one no you werent she stepped over ran a hand over the colts smooth neck youre in love with him i hate the bastard dont know why i ever took him on umhmm she smiled absently brushed some of the paddock dirt off the sleeve of michaels shirt he certainly looks illkept illused illfed too embarrassed now michael shrugged hes an investment a good stunt horse earns good money im sure she simply couldnt stand it now she broke into excited questions how in the world did you teach him to do that how do you keep him from trampling you arent you worried how long have you been working with him rolling his aching shoulders michael settled on the last question not long enough hes smart but hes got some rough edges then he grinned you had me quaking mrs templeton i figured you were going to grab the bat out of my hands and go to work on me with it i might have she caressed the colt i cant stand to see something abused cant say i care for it myself there was this wrangler on a set a while back he had this terrific horse sweetnatured generous but the wrangler was never satisfied always pushing for more working that horse to exhaustion and never giving anything back it was bad enough to see him breaking that horses heart and his spirit but then he started using a whip and his fists and whatever else came in handy michael paused to shovel the hair out of his eyes squint at the sun he got himself a bad rep nobody wanted to hire him or work with him anymore they all said it was too damn bad cause that horse was a rare one why wasnt something done theres politics the network the wranglerd been in the game a long time i was pretty new at it then and i never did care much for politics i talked him into selling me that horse made a pretty decent stake working with him you talked the wrangler into selling michael looked back at her more or less did you use the whip or just your fists i dont care for whips and max the walker i bought he cant stand the sight of them he nipped the bag away before the colt could investigate the contents you out for a walk this morning mrs templeton i could use that for an excuse but i imagine we both know i wanted to speak with you yeah i figured you or your husband would come down and hed prepped himself for it youre going to have to talk while i work my stock need some exercise all right she went with him as he walked out of the paddock and into the stables laura tells me youre giving the girls riding lessons just a few basics ive got some quiet saddle ponies i was treated to a dissertation on mr fury and his horses over breakfast this morning youve made quite an impression on my granddaughters let me help you she said taking the bridle of one of the horses hed begun to lead out and youve made an impression on my daughter as well shes a beautiful woman yes she is and shes been through hell in many ways its made her stronger but shes vulnerable michael and more easily bruised than either you or she might realize you want me to promise not to hurt her he stepped back as the horses trotted into the paddock i cant do that no you wouldnt do that as i recall even as a boy you were careful not to make promises you dont make you dont break he said simply and went back to the stables you had a difficult childhood she began then broke off raising her eyebrows when his head whipped around i dont believe in blaming what is on what was iimagine you had a dandy childhood is that responsible for everything you are she nodded slowly as he led out the next horses well put she murmured no i wouldnt like to think so but it did give me a solid foundation to build on and mines shaky though hed told himself he wouldnt allow it the bitterness came through you dont have to tell me where i come from mrs templeton i know she stopped him by reaching up closing her hand over his that wasnt a criticism im not blind michael and i dont like to think im narrowminded either i can see youre building something here and i know why you left your childhood behind before anyone should have to when he said nothing she smiled and let him go i know what goes on in my own house michael and i know what goes on in the lives of my childrens friends if your back needs to go up because i felt sorry for that boy then so be it my heart broke for you you wasted your sympathy i dont think so but as you said thats what was now is what is you never cross the wire in the marathon of parenthood michael you never finish the race and take a victory lap laura is a grown woman free to make her own choices and live her own life but that doesnt stop me from worrying or wondering or hoping she chooses well he knew what she was telling him had expected it and youve got to wonder considering things if shes choosing well this time she nodded slowly yes i wont say that sex doesnt last it can and does if youre lucky but it isnt enough by itself hed expected to be warned away but he wasnt ready to be pushed if youve come down here to ask me to stay away from her youre wasting your time i wont do it she measured him id be disappointed in you if you would what im asking you to do is be kind she looked away to where the horses pranced just be kind you want a promise ill give you one ill never treat her the way ridgeway did i wont cheat or lie or take anything from her she doesnt want to give me and i wont leave her feeling like a failure susans gaze came back and sharpened it was the words yes but more the edgy anger behind them that had her reevaluating you understand better than i gave you credit for i understand failure just fine and he knew that compared to a woman like susan templeton he might not be a failure but he could hardly be considered a success if thats all ive got work to do michael remembering that hed always been easily roused and prone to impatience she kept her hand firm and her eyes level with the storm in his its nice to have you at templeton house again now will you show me the horse you told me about is it that walker over there watching you as if hed die if you asked him to michael blew out a breath and wondered how a man was supposed to understand any of the templeton females yeah thats max hes just hoping for a handout why dont you introduce me i actually told her i was sleeping with him laura kept her voice low as she slipped clothes back onto hangers in the wardrobe room i cant believe i stood there and told my own mother i was having sex with michael odds are shed figured it out for herself margo slipped discarded shoes back into their slots and probably wasnt all that shocked as its likely she knew youd had sex before seeing as you have two children you know what im talking about laura mumbled its weird howd she take it well enough poor dad is tiptoeing around the subject as though if he wakes it up it would start an orgy well you could hardly pretend nothing was going on when mrs t caught you and michael playing lifeguard in the pool she chuckled checked her hair in the mirror god i wish id seen that one im sure it was illuminating for all parties it felt like that time annie caught us necking with biff and mark on the cliffs the cliffs she exclaimed before margo could comment lord my mind is a sieve today wait she dashed out nearly bumping into a customer and causing kate to eye her curiously in the back office laura dug her purse out of a drawer and the coin out of the small zippered compartment whats the problem kate demanded slipping in did margo forget to order boxes again well be out by monday if she hasnt what have you got there the cliffs laura pressed a hand to her heart last night i forgot you found one in a leap kate snatched it from lauras hand excitement and triumph spurted straight up into her heart you found another one seraphinas dowry and you forgot to tell us this morning was such a zoo i didnt know i would be in until dad insisted hed cover for me at the hotel and then kayla and ali were begging to stay home from school to spend time with mom and oh never mind she finished with a wave of her hand yes i forgot margo opened the door behind them would the two of you mind terribly if we attempted to run the business today we have customers who what have you got laura found it and forgot when letting the door close smartly at her back margo took the coin from kate where last night on the cliffs on that ledge where i like to sit sometimes i was just sitting there thinking and when i started to go back i saw it well felt it laura corrected i put my hand down right on it id been sitting right beside it just like the other times margo murmured when one was just there for me and one was just there for kate its a sign there she goes kate rolled her eyes and eased a hip onto the desk well what would you call it margo snapped back we search like maniacs have been on and off since we were kids nothing weve all but groomed those cliffs with tweezers nothing she said again gesturing wildly then each one of us goes there at some turning point in her life and there it is a coin one for each which means she stopped looked up from the gold glinting in her hand and stared at laura which means she said slowly youre in love with michael fury what in the world does one have to do with the other to buy time laura took the coin back set it in the middle of the desk blotter the day i went there and found mine i was thinking about josh and what i was going to do about being in love with him and kate she looked over at her friend who was frowning in thought she went thinking about byron you were in love with him werent you yeah but kate trailed off look this is a little too twilight zone for me open that accountants mind for a minute impatient margo turned back to laura and took her by the shoulders are you in love with michael that isnt i asked a direct question laura and ill know if you lie all right yes but it doesnt love matters margo said quietly we matter maybe thats the whole point she released laura and reached into her pocket where she habitually carried her coin this matters she placed it beside lauras and looked at kate who rose and took her own out of her purse it matters kate agreed when the three coins sat side by side were still in it together have you told mick laura no and no i dont know if im going to or how ill handle it i cant plan things out like you kate or run on instinct the way you do margo i have to do it my way which means i suppose maintaining illusions and waiting to see what comes and my emotions are my responsibility then she smiled traced a fingertip over all three coins a sign from seraphina well maybe it is maybe shes telling me not to put all my dreams into one mans hands this time or she might be telling you that you can find that dream if you know where to look margo draped an arm over lauras shoulders either way you cant stop looking its the same as jumping off a cliff havent stopped looking she patted margos hand before reaching for her coin and i think this calls for a celebration why dont we get together tonight and open some champagne talked me into it kate pocketed her own coin i was coming over anyway poker night at the de witts thats right laura grinned dads already rubbing his palms together so margo are you up for it ill be there margo picked up her coin but held it she hoped laura wouldnt put hers or her dreams away too quickly maybe we can get mum and mrs t a little drunk and play some poker ourselves im game why dont we kate broke off at the brisk knock on the office door the customer who poked her head in seemed annoyed and impatient excuse me but is anyone working here im so sorry all conciliatory smiles laura stepped over we had a small problem what can i help you with michael had never been driven to a poker game in a limo and he wasnt sure how he felt about it not that he hadnt ever ridden in one before after all hed worked in hollywood for five years but to a poker game it felt well pretentious then again as josh had said when he came to the stables to fetch him no one would have to worry about how many beers they knocked back obviously at home in the plush surroundings thomas leaned back and tapped his finger on his knee in time with the aria playing on the stereo all michael could think was that big limos opera and poker didnt mix and he began to worry just what the hell hed gotten himself into im feeling lucky thomas wiggled his eyebrows i hope you two boys brought plenty of money which made michael realize that his idea of plenty of money and thomas templeton of templeton hotels idea of plenty of money were unlikely to be in the same ballpark jesus he could lose his shirt and his ego in one funfilled evening my wife fell in love with a tennessee walker you have down at the stables michael thomas crossed his legs at the ankles and decided to see how much of a rise he could get out of young michael fury maybe ill win him from you before were done tonight i dont bet my horses michael said easily or my friends nice watch mr templeton he flicked a glance over thomass slim gold rolex i could use a new watch thomas let out a bark of laughter and slapped michael on the knee a boy needs his dreams i ever tell you about the time i played sevencard stud for thirtysix hours that was in chicago in now we not thethirtysix hours in chicago story josh moaned im begging you shut up harvard almost comfortable michael stretched out his legs some of us havent heard it pleased thomas grinned at michael then ill tell you and you can be afraid it wasnt such a bad ride after all and things looked up when they pulled into the driveway of the multidecked house on seventeen mile and the uniformed driver unloaded two cases of blue moose beer a templeton product from the limos trunk now thats a hell of a beer michael said then hooked his thumbs in his pockets and studied the wood and glass the decks and gardens of the de witt homestead and thats a hell of a house easy access to the beach too josh added kate recommended the property to byron before they got together good call it looks like her michael decided streamlined classy unique man oh man mustang and its cherry too he walked over to the car ran a loving hand over the fender what a beaut and that vette firstround sting ray mmm sweetheart let me pop your hood we going to play poker or are you going to make love to inanimate objects all night he shot a look at josh inanimate my ass honeys like this have more personality and sex appeal than half the women you dated shows that you havent met the women ive dated i dated some of them myself michael strolled toward the front door glancing over his shoulder at the cars then at josh including your wife joshs grin faltered and so did his feet you never dated margo didnt i enjoying himself michael climbed the short flight of wooden steps i seem to recall a couple of interesting evenings in france youre just trying to psych me out and it was working ask her michael said mildly damned if he wouldnt his head reeling with visions he didnt want josh reached around and opened the door two big yellow dogs raced forward and flung themselves at the newcomers nip tuck sit byron called out the order as he stepped into the wide living area the dogs sat butt to butt and continued to vibrate you can put the beer in the kitchen thanks he motioned the driver toward the kitchen think you brought enough we run out josh said we send for more got food i whipped up a few things unable to resist two lolling tongues and two pairs of adoring eyes michael crouched and made friends with the dogs you cook how do you think he got me to marry him kate stepped out smiled thinly you still here josh moved over to tug her hair go play with your own kind she elbowed him away i was just leaving but i want to say that the concept of the allmale poker game is a neanderthal practice that i find insulting particularly when its taking place in my own house being a wise man byron limited himself to rolling his eyes behind her back but michael didnt have to live with her he straightened grinned yeah yeah tell it to gloria steinem and get lost i have no desire to stay and listen to a bunch of fools belch snort and tell lies about the women theyve had chin lifted she snatched her purse from a chair and i was going to tell byron all about that night i picked you up on fishermans wharf and we shut up mick her brows drew together her color rose im leaving wait a minute her husband made a grab missed what night it was nothing she seared michael with a look it was nothing aw sugar michael murmured now youve hurt my feelings men are pigs she tossed back as she slammed the door behind her well that got rid of her michael decided where are the cards margo and kate josh eyed him narrowly cant fault my taste can you michael tucked his hands in his pockets like i said where are the cards men deserve their little rituals susan stretched out on the long arm of the conversation pit in the family room just as we deserve ours i dont mind snuggled back against a mountain of pillows margo nibbled from a bowl of popcorn kate gets huffy where is kate wandering to the window laura looked out she should be here by now oh shed have waited to yank their chains before she left margo shrugged and reached for the champagne shell be along god knows this is better than poker and beer and a bunch of cigar smoke but shes got to make her point ready for a glass mum ann paused in her perusal of the videotapes chosen for the marathon viewing well maybe just a little one they had champagne popcorn a platter of crudites fresh fruit three choices of dip including white chocolate and a stack of movies the baby was sleeping in the nursery and her favorite women were here margo judged it the perfect girls night out im going to do your nails i dont want the fussing margo smiled at her mother its fun mum ive got the perfect shade for you red hot lover ann snorted into her wine i wont wear any such thing as if id be painting my fingernails anyway men go for it to tease margo leaned closer and bob the butchers had his eye on you for years he certainly has not her face flaming ann fumbled with the stack of tapes thats nonsense we have a good customer relationship nothing more he saves the leanest cuts for miss annie margo fluttered her lashes then laughed you should give him a break one of these days oh laura stop worrying about kate shell be here im not worrying just watching and thinking of michael she admitted what was he doing why was it their paths hadnt crossed once since the night before but she made herself come away from the window and pour a glass of champagne what are we going to watch first i vote for to have and have not you know how to whistle dont you steve susan sighed dipped a moist red strawberry into creamy white chocolate the worlds champion comeon worlds best brushoff margo said continuing the theme bette davis id love to kiss you but i just washed my hair best wrenching goodbye laura said getting into the swing bogart to bergman well always have paris when kate came in ten minutes later they were in a heated debate over the ten most dangerous men in cinema history newman margo insisted its the eyes cold or hot and incredibly blue you watch the long hot summer hud or grant susan sat up to make her point dangerous because its unexpected the charm undermines a womans defenses and he has her bogart laura disagreed in anything raw dangerous elemental a hero despite his instincts i cant believe youre discussing men disgusted kate plopped down i just left those four baboons is that white chocolate she reared up again and used her finger to dip in and she continued licking it they were already smug superior and sarcastic micks the worst i cant believe he brought up that time i ran into him on the wharf and we we laura came to attention we what nothing she should have filled her mouth kate decided and began to do so it was nothing he was home on leave and he looked sort of interesting we went for a drive thats all you went for a drive laura repeated with michael thats all well yeah mostly done it now kate thought as every eye in the room focused on her well okay so maybe i experimented a little for a minute whos in charge of the vcr before she could pop up to take charge herself laura clamped a hand on her shoulder define experimented i let him kiss me a couple of times thats it just that do we have bringing up baby i could use a laugh you and michael necked in his car not necked exactly i wouldnt call it necking margo she appealed to her friend for help no a couple of kisses does not constitute necking i necked with him so i know this to be true you laura choked grabbed the champagne bottle you i give him a ten on both technique and style and since that was a number of years ago i can only assume hes improved even that she laughed got up to pop a movie in now mrs t is trying to figure out if she should make a comment or a statement of any kind and mum is sitting there steaming over the idea that the disreputable michael fury has had his very tasty lips clamped on all three of her girls thats just the kind of talk i expect from you ann said with a sniff and id hate to disappoint you hes one of the dangerous men all right she leaned back and patted her mothers knee affectionately thank god for them chapter seventeen contents prev next he wasnt feeling particularly dangerous with the trash byron had dealt him hed held fairly steady in the first hour of the game keeping his bets conservative even predictable while he studied each of his opponents for their tells they were good he admitted all three of them this wasnt any suckers game they may have been the classy high rollers who normally gambled in palaces but he had learned his skills aboard ship where boredom could tempt a man to toss a months pay into the pot just to break the monotony at a card table any card table michael knew a wise man studied his quarries and his foes josh flicked a thumb over his jaw when he had a solid hand and his eyes went blank and cool when he was bluffing de witt tended to reach for his beer when he had a winner and templeton well templeton was a cagey dog but as the second hour got under way michael noted that the man puffed harder on his cigar when he prepared to rake in the chips calculating michael discarded drew into a pitiful pair of treys he had a choice considered the practicalities and decided it was time to shake things up theres your ten he told josh flipping in his chips raise it ten twenty to me absently byron reached down to scratch one of his dogs a sign michael thought smugly that he had nothing im in twenty tommy knocked into the pot and ten more out josh tossed his cards down and rose to help himself to one of the fat sandwiches on the counter ill see your raise and bump it twenty and you two can fight this hand out byron pushed back gulped his beer the boy had been bumping the pot since the deal thomas mused and studied the pretty trio of ladies in his hand well they would have to see what he was made of your twenty and fifty more michaels eyes met thomass over the cards held steady as he pushed chips into the pot fifty and fifty back call or fold thomas studied his opponent then wheezed out a breath between his teeth ill give you this one he decided and tossed his cards down well he demanded when michael scooped back the chips what did you have when michael merely smiled and began to stack his chips thomas hissed out another breath you bluffed me i can see it you didnt have shit a man has to pay to see mr templeton eyes narrowed thomas leaned back tommy he said when a man bluffs me cold he ought to call me by name my deal michael gathered the cards shuffled stud sevencard he grinned you in tommy im in and ill still be in when youre writhing on the floor and begging for mercy michael flipped in his ante a boy needs his dreams thomas let loose a laugh then reached into his pocket damned if i dont like you fury have a cigar a real one not one of those girl smokes byron puffs on thanks but i quit still he sniffed longingly at the clouds of smoke anyway those cubans look too much like a dick josh choked on smoke pulled his cigar out of his mouth thanks mick im really going to enjoy this now howling with laughter thomas slapped his hand on the table deal the cards and prepare to lose your shirt during hour three michael took a pass and walked outside he peed companionably with the dogs and watched the nightdrenched sea hell of a spot isnt it michael looked back over his shoulder as byron approached you sure picked one i was thinking i could put up a small stable there at the edge of the cypress grove simple two stalls two i figure solos lonely even for a horse i liked the look of that pinto mare shes a sweetheart he tucked his tongue in his cheek you clear it with your wife byrons eyes were mild and amused i know all kinds of ways around my wife more i assume than you do even after picking her up on fishermans wharf i was just rattling her cage and yours he lifted his hands palms out never laid my hands on her hardly byron chuckled shook his head i think well just leave that particular door closed but if you want to ride josh about margo id find it entertaining i dont want to have to fight him hes tougher than he looks loosened three of my teeth when we were twelve michael checked them with his tongue and his old mans liable to take bets on the outcome thats the templetons theyll bet on anything look at the way kate margo and laura bet on the shop i keep meaning to go by there again im not much on fancylady shops but im wondering how laura handles clerking i think youll be surprised and impressed i have been its given them something solid and special gives them a living it gives them more than that it gives them unity and a goal and love either the beer or the women were making him sentimental but byron went with it i wasnt around when they conceived it put it together took the chance margo selling off almost everything she owned my conservative accountant pooling her investments to make her share and laura selling her wedding ring she sold her wedding ring to build that shop yeah it was right after they found out ridgeway had pretty much cleaned out their joint accounts she wouldnt take templeton money for the shop so she hocked her wedding and engagement rings to make the down payment on the building what women they are yeah michael frowned out to sea the socialite the model and the accountant they sweated over it they cleaned and sanded and painted and figured out how to make it work it knocks me out to walk in there and see how they are together how they are together anywhere you see them out on the cliffs rooting around in the rocks and dirt for seraphinas dowry all these years theyre still together still looking kate was wild tonight when she told me laura had found another coin he was trying to see it all to settle all these facets into an image in his head he blinked laura she found a coin when last night took a walk down on the cliffs kate says she does that from time to time when she needs to clear her head or just be alone she found one a gold doubloon just like margo did and kate did oddest fucking thing each one of them finding a coin months apart by accident rather than design their treasure hunts turn up nothing then boom one of them just picks up a gold piece off the ground as if it had been there all along makes you wonder the back door slammed open and thomass voice boomed out is this a poker game or a damn church social cards are getting cold then deal em byron called back coming he asked michael yeah laura walks on the cliffs at night now and again byron waded through the dogs who ran circles around him and last night she just reached down and picked up a gold coin spanish son of a bitch thats weird ill tell you whats weirder im beginning to believe theyre going to find the whole thing that theyre the only ones who will never believed it existed ask laura to show you her coin byron suggested you might change your mind i might do that michael murmured then walked back into the comforting arena of cigar smoke and beer when he dragged himself up the stairs at three am he still had his shirt his horses and his ego he would have counted himself lucky for that the fact that he was also eight hundred dollars richer was just icing he thought he might put it toward buying a pretty yearling quarter horse hed had his eye on he stepped through his front door and stumbled over the warm bundle stretched out there jesus christ as he hit the floor the dog yelped shuddered then licked humbly at michaels face bongo what the hell are you jesus get your tongue out of my mouth michael swiped a hand over his face shifted and ended up with wriggling puppy on his lap yeah yeah youre sorry how the helld you get in here learn how to pick locks now he came with me laura stepped out of the bedroom he loves me he didnt want to sleep in my bed all alone me either maybe it was the beer or his abrupt meeting with the floor but his voice seemed to have been lost somewhere along the way she was standing in the lamplight smiling and wearing nothing but one of his shirts her hair was tousled her skin flushed and when he managed to clear his vision he noted that her eyes were bright if a bit unfocused she was in simple words beautiful sexy and drunk did you come for the rent her laugh was low and frothy its after business hours i came for you thought youd never get here how was the poker game profitable how was the movie marathon illuminating did you ever watch really watch the way people kiss in black and white its she sighed ran a hand down her breasts until he had to roll his tongue back into his mouth wonderful she decided just wonderful come and kiss me michael in black and white sugar he had very few rules and was struggling to remember this one as he set the dog aside and rose youre plowed i am indeed she shook back her hair leaned against the doorway for balance dyou know michael i have never been drunk in my life a little tipsy i will admit to having been on occasion a little tipsy but drunk never not done not acceptable for a woman of my standing in the community your secrets safe with me bongo and i will walk you home im not going home she straightened steadied herself enjoying the liberating way the room tilted as she stepped toward him until ive had you then you can tell me if i kiss as good as kate and margo shit he muttered under his breath word travels fast around here you can even rip my clothes off again she linked her arms around his neck its your shirt anyway i like wearing your clothes its almost like having your hands on me are you going to put your hands on me michael im debating ill tell you a secret she pressed against him put her mouth on his ear wanna know my secret she was going to be sorry come sunrise but he skimmed his hands under the shirt what the hell yeah tell me a secret i have dreams about you i used to have them before too long time ago when you would come around with josh i had dreams about you but i never told anybody because it wouldnt be appropriate for a woman of your standing she chuckled nipped his earlobe and sent his blood pressure through the roof xactly you know what id dream about you ill tell you youd find me id be on the cliffs or in my room or in the forest and youd find me and my heart would start to pound so hard so fast she took his hand pressed it against her heart to show him i couldnt move or breathe or even think she continued and her hand laid over his on her breast youd come toward me not saying anything just looking at me looking until my knees were weak until the blood was rushing in my head youd kiss me so rough so hot the way no one else ever would no one else would dare to touch me the way you touched me no it was like drowning he thought staring into those deep gray eyes was like drowning no one would youd rip my clothes rip them off and take me right there wherever we were just the way you did that night just like in my dreams i must have always known you would one day she circled away arms lifted like a dancer on point while he stood where he was aching viciously aching thats my secret i dreamed of you oh my heads spinning she laughed pressed a hand to it being drunk feels just like it feels having you on top of me inside me pounding in me god god i love it she combed her hair back from her face grinned at him look at you standing there watching me never expected to hear such talk from laura templeton did you he knew standing there watching her that if hed been dying of thirst he would have begged for her rather than a single sip of water no and if you dont remember this in the morning im going to be damn sorry im just full of surprises tonight she lifted her arms hooked them behind her head and stretched i watched all those movies drank all that wine ate chocolate and laughed and cried and sighed all those things women do laura lowered her hands again and turned a slow fluid pirouette that made his shirt flow up out i watched margo talk annie into having her nails painted and kate dozing off with her head on my mothers lap margo nursing the baby when he woke i loved it all so much loved being with them my life is them and my babies but through it all you were in the back of my mind where is michael does he still want me and i thought well see ill be there when he comes home and well see if he does if i can make him want me do you he didnt speak couldnt have simply crossed to her dragged her against him and plundered joy and need and pleasure burst through her in one sizzling ball of heat her laugh was smoke like her eyes as he pulled her to the floor no no giddy now and brave enough she rolled on top of him let me this time i want to see if i can he was ripe to explode and pulled her down again laura for christs sake me she jerked back shook her reeling head i want to do things to you things that might be considered inappropriate for a woman of my station he struggled to clamp down on hurry when she straddled him want to use me do you her lips quirked at the gleam in his eyes thats right look we scared bongo hes curled up in the corner hell get over it what do you want to do to me i have to figure it out she blew out a breath toyed with the buttons of his shirt ive got another secret if its anything like the last one itll probably kill me its not a good one now her lips pouted well maybe since it turned out this way it is peter never ripped my clothes off christ forget it and him but when he reached up she evaded him i want to tell you so youll know its kind of funny really we always had very appropriate sex not like with you she traced the vee above the button with a fingertip always proper sex except when we didnt have sex at all which was most of the time and all through the last year we were married and you know what she placed her hands on either side of his head and leaned down a heavyeyed morethantipsy woman what she hummed in her throat as he stroked her breasts you can do that she murmured i dont mind at all but i was saying we had a system no he had a system i was just there he would put on classical music chopin always the same sonata i sometimes still get a tick in my eye when i hear it he would close the door lock it lest a wandering servant be shocked by the goingson though the staff would hardly have business in there at ten fortyfive in the evening it was mostly always at ten fortyfive so he was a creature of habit michael flipped open buttons and found her flesh umm no you dont she sat up again youre trying to distract me he would turn off the lights get into bed he would kiss me three times not two not four but three times then he would i dont think i want a playbyplay here of ridgeways style in the sack in the marital bed please well well just skip right along then since it isnt very interesting anyway at elevenohfive he would wish me a pleasant night and go to sleep the twentyminute special huh you could set your clock by it oh michael she stretched her arms up giving him tempting glimpses of soft white swells i thought it was me i thought that was just the way it was had to be but it isnt it wasnt it doesnt she cupped her breasts in her hands let her eyes close its never predictable with you i never know what youll do where youll touch me next or how and its never proper its so wonderfully improper the things you do with your hands with your mouth on me she dropped her hands to his chest do you have any idea what its like to discover at thirty that you have a sex drive no he couldnt help but smile at her she was so beautifully drunk i found mine at sixteen and never lost sight of it she laughed flinging her head back and making his teeth ache with the need to bite into that slim white throat oh but this is better has to be its like finding seraphinas dowry somehow you know its there somewhere or hope it is and then when you find it after all that time all that wondering its so sweet since you found that elusive sex drive his hands slid up her torso why dont we put it to use im going to make you sweat she eased down again scraped her teeth over his jaw you might even beg now youre getting cocky i take that as a challenge to demonstrate she shoved up her sleeves which fell right back down again are you man enough to agree not to touch me until i say you can he lifted a brow wondering just what the lady had in mind your loss sugar i dont think so ultimately no hands she murmured and pressed his to his sides except mine she lowered her lips to his brushed teased nibbled margo said you had a very tasty mouth she smiled when he winced she was right i think ill stay right here a while she lingered on his mouth changing the angle the depth the tone of the kiss light one moment intense and urgent the next then sultry smoky his fingers aching curled into the carpet not bad for a beginner he managed in a voice rusty with need and i learn fast your hearts pounding michael she nipped at the pulse in his throat cruised over dampening flesh then she gripped his shirt at the shoulder pulled when the seam stayed fast he chuckled from both humor and frustration want me to do that for you i can handle it she eased back kept her eyes on his as she yanked hard the seam ripped exposing muscle and skin she pounced on it like a starving cat oh your body she whispered then crossed her hands taking hold of his shirt and sending cloth and buttons flying you have such a body tough and scarred and tight i want it her mouth streaked down his shoulder over his chest quick greedy bites and sucks feathering openmouthed kisses and flicks of tongue but when his hands came up to grip her hips she shoved them away with a single word mine rising up she shrugged off the shirt then once more bent to her task she was destroying him in a way he hadnt known he could be destroyed slowly inevitably she was taking him in a way he hadnt known he could be taken greedily intently his breath thickened caught released on a groan when she laved her tongue low on his belly every muscle quivered taut wires close to snapping thoughts filled and emptied from his mind so rapidly that he couldnt gain hold sensation rammed violently into sensation like two clenched fists the scent of her elegant as royalty the sheen of her skin glossy as a damp rose and the stroke of her hands restless as lust giddy on her own power she tugged open the button of his jeans felt his body tense like a runner on the mark she lowered her mouth tasting there just there where denim and flesh met and heard him choke out her name she could do this to him she thought as she dipped her tongue under the denim to tease she could create this desperation and weakness this violent need in a strong vital man she could make him want her to the point of madness and she could take whatever she wanted from him she nudged the material down closed her teeth over his hip and heard the breath explode out of his lungs he was helpless she knew lost in her and she could make him ache she took him into her mouth clamped him in a wet velvet vice and shot his system into chaos his hands fisted in her hair as his body bucked under her when her mouth cruised up to his belly again over quaking muscle he was ready to kill to have her still gripping her hair he yanked her head back reared up she felt one shocking jolt at the dark burn of his eyes then his mouth was clamped on hers i didnt say you could touch me she panted it out as his lips branded her throat her shoulders her breasts you didnt beg i need you he found her with his hand shoved her over the peak he was still clinging to now goddamn it take me in triumphant she threw her head back and her laugh was rich and wild locking her legs around his waist she arched back yes bowed like a bridge when he drove himself into her she cried out no longer surprised but shuddering nonetheless over the speed and violence of the orgasm she arrowed up again her body locked to his her hips pumping more she demanded tearing nails down his back michael more blind with greed she shoved him back dug her hands into his waist and took more the storm raged through him whipping toward peak but he could see her rising and falling over him her eyes closed to heated slits her head back in abandon the animal inside him mated with hers until shed ridden both to exhaustion through hazy vision he saw her melt down on him and felt the quakes of the aftershocks rush through her his own body felt bruised numbed weightless so that he wasnt even aware that his arms were locked tight around her like a man holding everything that mattered told you i could do it she murmured turning her lips to his throat yeah you sure showed me he pressed his lips to her hair wallowed there laura he said her name quietly almost to himself then closed his eyes and tried for both their sakes not to hear the rest of it i love you love you you wanted me yes i wanted you her hair smelled like sunlight weakened him all over again will you do something for me michael yeah anything terrifying thought anything will you carry me to bed im still drunk sure baby just hold on he rose with her a feat that even in her impaired state made her heart flutter and one more thing her head dropped limply against his shoulder and when she moaned he had panicked visions of finding a basin to shove under her face before she was sick okay dont worry ill take care of you itll be fine all right warm and soft and trusting she curled into him then blinked against sudden hard light what what her head cocked curiously why are we in the bathroom its the handiest place to be sick go ahead and toss up that wine sugar youll feel better im not going to toss up perfectly good champagne she wrapped her arms tighter when he tried to set her down im not going to be sick then she flopped back dead weight like a woman in a faint and laughed until it echoed off the walls oh thats so sweet you were going to hold my head while i vomited god michael she raised up again kissed him sloppily youre the cutest thing just so cute and sweet i could eat you right up my hero embarrassed he narrowed his eyes maybe ill just stick your head in the toilet anyway if youre not going to lose the champagne and chocolate what do you want i told you to carry me to bed i would think it would be obvious smiling she traced a finger down his chest i want you to want me again if it wouldnt be an imposition he glanced down at her warm rosy naked female his female i guess i could manage that good and do you think you could well she leaned over and whispered something in his ear that made his blood take a quick trip to his loins thats pretty inappropriate behavior but he made a beeline for the bed under the circumstances chapter eighteen contents prev next experiencing a first hangover laura discovered wasnt nearly as much fun as experiencing a first drunk instead of having a head filled with light and color and gloriously rambling ideas she had one crammed with noise along the lines of a poorly directed high school band with the percussion section banging away gleefully at her left temple her system didnt feel free and floaty but clogged the way her mouth seemed clogged with enough dirt to make half a dozen mud pies she was grateful that michael had left her alone rather than witness the humiliation she wouldnt think about the fact that shed spent the night in his bed and now would have to stagger into the house where her family and the staff would shoot her questioning looks she tried to drown those unmerciful drummers under the shower then bit down on her lip when she realized the new sound she heard was her own whimpering under normal circumstances she would never have gone through any of michaels things but she finished up a fumbling search through the mirrored medicine cabinet and bathroom drawers and nearly wept when she found a bottle of aspirin she took four another break in tradition then deciding she couldnt be much more intrusive used his toothbrush she didnt look in the mirror until shed dressed and even then it was a mistake her face was deathly pale her eyes smudged and swollen and as she didnt have so much as a tube of lipstick with her there was nothing she could do about it knowing she had to get it over with she stepped outside and moaned quietly as the sunlight sent hot little spears into her eyes her head didnt feel like the practice field for a marching band now now it felt like glass very thin very fragile glass and it was balanced precariously on her neck hows it going sugar she winced jerked her head fell off smashed on the steps at her feet thank god she had another one she turned it struggled to smile as michael dusted his hands on his hips and walked toward her good morning im sorry i didnt hear you get up the way you were sawing them off i figured youd sleep till noon the insult of the headache faded snore she certainly did not snore she wouldnt dignify such a lie with a comment i have to be at the shop in a couple of hours youre working today she didnt look to be in any shape for it to him give yourself a break laura and go crawl back into bed saturdays are our busiest day he shrugged his shoulders her choice hows the head which one now she did smile a little certainly a man like michael would understand hangovers its bad but no longer unbearable next time you go on a bender chug plenty of water and pop a couple aspirin before you pass out it usually helps take the edge off the morning after i dont intend to have a next time but thanks now that might be a shame he trailed a finger over the back of her hand you make a very inventive drunk hows the memory her blood must have been moving still for she felt it rise up to sting her cheeks its good a little too good i certainly wouldnt have i cant believe that i she shut up closed her eyes you can stop me anytime from making a total fool of myself i kinda like it come here he drew her against him cradling her aching head on his shoulder ice water he murmured stick your face right into a bowl of ice water try to get some food in your system then you just have to tough out the rest of it okay shed have preferred just staying there for the rest of her life i have to go i shouldnt have slept here last night with her face pressed against him she didnt see the disappointment and the hurt shadow his i cant imagine what everyone will think right his eyes were impassive again when he drew her away you go on and shore up the damage to the templeton name i didnt mean forget it he wasnt going to let it touch him forget it he repeated why dont you go riding with me tomorrow tomorrow she pressed her fingers to her eyes if she didnt get them out of the sun soon they were going to implode we have the treasure hunt well go in the morning youll be back for seraphina riding it had been years since shed ridden in the hills through the forest all right id love it can we go about eight that way i can sure eight he gave her a quick pat on the cheek before walking away dont forget the ice water no i but he had already disappeared around the side of the building baffled by his rapid shift of mood she considered following him then she looked at her watch and accepted the reality that her obligations for the day didnt allow time to puzzle out the enigma of michael fury no one asked questions demanded answers or voiced disapproval when laura tucked her children into bed that night she realized she had gotten through the entire day without having anyone question her absence from her own bed oh thered been vibes in the air worry curiosity but shed dodged even those shed survived a hangover as well and the world had not come to an end maybe just maybe laura templeton did not have to be perfect after all she left her daughters and crossed the hall to her own room there she freshened her lipstick brushed her hair she needed to go and join her parents and the old friends who had come for dinner she needed to make certain everyone was comfortable and entertained and oh she needed to stretch out for five minutes just five she promised herself as she lay down crosswise on the bed a quick catnap would set her up help her get through the rest of the evening the minute she closed her eyes she was dead to the world something has to be done mrs t hands gripped tight at her waist ann stood in susans quiet sitting room in the tower suite it has to be all right annie sit down it had been a long evening and though shed been pleased to see old friends susan had hoped for a few moments of solitude before bed the look on anns face warned her she wouldnt get it now whats the trouble you know what the trouble is mrs t too fretful to sit ann wandered the room fussing with curtains realigning candlesticks fluffing pillows you saw how pale and tired miss laura was today you had to see for yourself yes i did see and ive been pale and tired myself the day after ive overindulged in champagne oh as if that was all of it and thats something shes never done before him either perhaps she should have susan thought she sighed annie stop tidying the room and sit down she spent the night with him the whole of it over there with him above the horses because her lips wanted to twitch susan glanced down at her own hands as ann sat across from her yes annie im aware of that well it cant go on and that ann felt was that just how do you expect to prevent a grown woman from doing as she chooses the fact is laura is very attracted to michael perhaps more than attracted shes been lonely and unhappy and now she isnt hes taking advantage of that hes a bad influence why she didnt even come down and say good night to her guests shes never shirked her duties that way she was tired annie and the greenbelts are my and tommys friends which isnt the point at all really you cant worry yourself so about all of this youre her mother but you know i love her just as you love my girl when margo had troubles you worried yourself for her yes understanding susan laid a hand over anns theyre our children and thats as its always been but children grow and go their own way no matter how we worry thats how its always been too shed listen to you mrs t ive been thinking on it the words came out fast now and seemed so logical to her miss laura she hasnt gone away with the girls for such a long time shes been working hard and hasnt had a holiday the spring vacations coming up for ali and kayla they could go away for a while you know how the girls love to go to disneyland if you put the notion in miss lauras head shed take them and it would give her time and distance shed have a clearer eye about what shes doing i think laura and the girls deserve a break but a week in disneyland isnt going to change her feelings for michael annie shes just caught up right now if she had some time without him clouding her mind shed see that man for just what he is at a loss susan threw up her hands let them slap down on the arms on her chair in a show of impatience for gods sake annie what is he why do you dislike him so intensely hes a brute is what he is a brute and a user and probably a fortune hunter as well hell hurt her in more ways than one and im not having it she pressed her lips tight together im not to clear her own temper susan took a long breath i want you to explain to me what hes done you know very well that when he was no more than twelve he was sneaking around this house he was joshs friend and giving mister josh stolen cigarettes daring him into all manner of foolishness boys do foolish things at twelve christ annie i taught my best friend how to smoke when we were fourteen its stupid but its children and was it a childs foolishness that sent him to jail whats this susans face paled a bit michael was in jail how do you know i hear things he was locked up for fighting in a bar oh they didnt keep him but overnight but they locked him up right enough the man likes to use his fists oh for heavens sakes i thought hed robbed a bank or killed someone i may not approve but i cant condemn a man for sleeping in a cell overnight because he punched someone in a bar you dont even know who started it or why or how can you make excuses suddenly furious ann sprang up how can you the man is with your daughter night after night hell use them on her eventually shell do or say something and hell use his fists on her the way he did on his own mother what are you saying a jiggle of fear settled low in her stomach a man who will strike his own mother bloody her mouth and blacken her eye wont think twice about doing the same to another woman shes so small and delicate mrs t i cant bear the thought of what he could do to her you believe michael fury beat his own mother susan said slowly she told me so herself came looking for him here with her poor face all black and blue i took her into my room and did what i could for her and she told me michael had come home the night before drunk and had hurt her had driven her husband off then left her there alone i wanted to go to the police but she wouldnt have it she whirled away emotions choking her ah he belonged in a cell he belonged in a cage if you had only seen her face if that man raises a finger to miss laura i annie i did see michaels mother susan rose i did speak with her then you know he ran off to sea just after that rather than face what hed done mrs t we have to make him go away from here we cant have a man whos capable of what he is near miss laura and her babies ill tell you what she told me annie after she came to shout at me for keeping michael here after that night here ann had to press a hand to her outraged heart to keep it in place that man was here you let him stay here in this house after he slept in the stables until he shipped out he never laid a hand on that woman you saw her she told me she blamed him she couldnt blame herself not then but i had the truth out of her it was her husband who beat her and who had done so before she had come to work with black eyes before and michael didnt put them there but she said i dont care what she said susan shouted the memory of it still made her blood burn a mother blaming a child for her own failings that boy came home and saw his stepfather beating his mother and he protected her the thanks he got for giving that beast what he deserved was having his own mother kick him out of the house tell him he had no right to interfere that he was to blame she stopped for a moment struggled to calm herself and when michael was gone when she knew shed lost him she sat right here in this room and broke down she told me everything but she told me i believed ann sank down in a chair oh sweet god she begged me to help her find him to persuade him to come back she was alone you see and michaels mother was a woman who didnt know how to be alone i want to believe that somewhere inside she regretted what shed done what shed said to him and she loved him but all i saw was a miserable selfish woman who was afraid to be without a man even if the man was the son shed driven away oh mrs t ann pressed her hand against her mouth the tears that swam in her eyes were tears of guilt and pity youre sure of this annie forget what she told you even what ive just said and tell me honestly what you see when you look at him as if you knew nothing more about him than what youve seen since he came here he works hard she sniffled and tugged a tissue from her pocket hes good with children and his animals hes kind to them hes got the devil in his eye and something hard comes into it he doesnt watch his language as he should around the children and i dont think she trailed off wiped her eyes hes good to them and hes been good for them i cant deny it and im ashamed theres no shame in worrying over the ones you love im sorry you were living with the fear that laura had gotten herself involved with the kind of man you thought he was ive hardly slept since hes been here i kept waiting for him to oh the poor boy what a terrible thing to go through and him barely old enough to shave regular youll sleep better now susan murmured but im still keeping my eye on him she managed a weak smile men who look that way theyre not to be trusted around a woman well both worry susan squeezed annies hand we know our laura dont we she needs home family love when everything else is brushed aside thats what she is i dont know if shell find that with michael or what it will do to her if she doesnt shed found something else the thrill of streaking over the hills of racing through lowlying fog that hugged the ground like a river of hearing the thunder of hooves and feeling the strong sleek mount beneath her gather itself to jump she sailed over a fallen log and burst into a clearing where the sun flashed white oh god its wonderful after reining in she leaned low over the horses neck ill never be able to do without this again youre a clever man michael fury she straightened and turned to study him as he sat easily on max how could i buy a horse for myself and not buy that mare for ali ill give you a hell of a deal on three the little bay gelding fits kayla like a glove you ride like a demon laura he reached down to pat the neck of the mare laura rode and fancy here suits you i figured she would apparently you know your horses and your women his eyes flicked up to hers his woman for the moment apparently you look stunning vital rested i slept like the dead last night nearly ten hours trying her hand at flirting she sent him a sidelong look under her lashes did you miss me hed reached for her half a dozen times during the night nah when her face fell he laughed grabbing her by the shirt he tugged her sideways just enough to meet her lips what do you think he dismounted lets give them a rest weve been riding them hard he tossed the reins over a branch as she slid agilely to the ground did you find any more coins yesterday nothing not even a bottle cap i cant oh i didnt tell you did i the other night i heard for reasons he couldnt pin down it had annoyed him that she hadnt come running to him with her coin good for you it was the oddest thing she stretched muscles unused to riding i put my hand right on it just the way you would if youd dropped a quarter and reached down to she blinked lost her train of thought he was standing there just standing there with the sun at his back and his eyes focused on her face what is it you said youd dreamed of me now and years ago on the cliffs in your room in the forest youd turn and id be there yes wasnt it foolish to have her heart lodged in her throat to feel both fear and anticipation prickle hot on her skin michael and id touch you he floated a palm over the curve of her breast felt the quiver there were parts of her life that were barred to him parts of his that he would keep barred from her but here here was equal ground and taste you laid his mouth over hers felt the heat and take you swept her into his arms felt the ache and i will she lay beside him naked in the sunlight with birds singing in the trees he hadnt torn her clothes it amazed her that she wouldnt have stopped him from doing so even if shed had to ride back to templeton house bare as lady godiva instead he had been so gentle so tender that even now she could have wept ive never made love outside she murmured i didnt know it could be so lovely she sat up stretched so many firsts i dont suppose there are many firsts i can give you she smiled down at him bad michael furys already done them all and then some he said with his eyes closed theres so much you dont talk about knowing it was all too typical to pry into a mans past when you were in love didnt stop her she traced a finger down his chest so many secrets inside you told me a couple of yours last night quid pro quo no of course not he opened his eyes you want to know something about me ask she shook her head and started to shift but he reached up and held her still afraid of the answer no she said steadily im not and im surprised youd think i would be fine ask i she hesitated still then gave in all right you said you were married before but you never mentioned her or what happened her name was yvonne we got divorced all right miffed by the terse response she reached for her shirt we should be getting back shit he rubbed his hands over his face and sat up as she shrugged into the soft and now wrinkled broadcloth okay you want to know i met her when i was racing she liked to party with drivers and you fell in love with her christ youre a child in so many ways he stood and dragged on his jeans i fell into bed with her we liked each other we had good sex so we kept falling into bed and we kept having good sex then she got pregnant oh she rose slowly and kept her eyes on her trousers as she slipped them on you said you didnt have children i assumed do you want to hear this or not she looked up surprised by the bitterness in his voice not if you dont want to tell me if id wanted to talk about it i probably would have he swore again then took her arm as she bent to retrieve her boots sit down just sit goddamn it nobody uses that wounded look the way you do he pressed his fingers to his eyes and struggled for control once hed opened up this part of his life he would have to open others she would ask more questions he would give her the answers he accepted it there in the sunwashed woods with his body still warm from hers that this was the beginning of the end okay she got pregnant so we talked about it the best thing for everybody was to go for the abortion simple quick done so we made the arrangements im sorry thats a difficult decision you you never questioned that youd been the one who that id gotten her pregnant yvonne wasnt a liar or a cheat she said the kid was mine it was mine we were friends laura im sorry it was hard for both of you we figured we were doing the smart thing i was trying to make a name for myself on the circuit she had just started a new job a baby didnt fit hell neither of us knew anything about kids about parenthood we were what we were he looked her in the eye scrabblers looking for a good time she kept her gaze level are you telling me it was easy a casual shrug an oops no his eyes shifted stared off into the trees into the shadows no it wasnt easy it just made sense we agreed it was the best solution but the night before we were to go in for it we figured out something else we both wanted it we both wanted the baby it didnt make any sense we didnt know what we were doing but we both wanted the baby she didnt have the abortion no we got married we figured what the hell lets do it lets have a baby she tried to knit things a smile ghosted around his mouth she didnt have a clue we read books went in for one of those sonogram things jesus christ it was just beautiful we argued about names and did all the things i guess everybody does the smile went away and she thought as she watched his eyes so did he middle of the night she was about four months along she started bleeding bad she was in pain and scared we were both so scared i got her to the hospital but it was already pretty much over by then we lost the baby im sorry she rose again but didnt touch him im so sorry michael theres nothing more painful than losing a child no theres nothing the doctors said she was young and healthy and we could try again in a little while we pretended we would tried to keep it together but we started fighting sniping at each other id slam out leave her alone shed slam out leave me alone one night i came home and she was waiting for me shed figured it out before i had she was a smart woman wed stopped being friends all wed had to keep us married was the baby and the baby was gone now we were stuck and we didnt have to be stuck she was right so we decided to start being friends again and stop being married end of story she touched him now took his face in her hands felt the tension theres nothing i can say to ease that kind of grief the kind you carry with you forever no matter what he shut his eyes let his brow rest on hers i wanted the baby i know she eased her arms around him you loved it already i understand im sorry michael gently she stroked his back im sorry i made you tell me it was almost ten years ago its done he drew back then swore at the tears on her cheek dont do that hell you should have asked me something else uneasy he brushed the tears away like about how i used to stunt double for mel gibson she sniffled straggled to give him the smile he wanted did you really you women always go for mel maybe you should come down to hollywood with me i could introduce you he twined a blond curl around his finger me and max we have to go down tomorrow tomorrow she shook her head youre going to la you didnt mention it just got a call saturday with a shrug he sat down to tug on his boots action western with your pal mel he wants me and max so we got to do some meetings some test shots see if we can give them what theyre looking for thats wonderful id think youd be more excited its a job i dont suppose youre interested in tagging along id love to but i cant leave the girls and work how how long will you be gone she bit the question back theyll be so impressed when i tell them ive got a guy coming in for a few days to see to the stock while im gone i should be back by friday oh only a few days she smiled again if you are i have this opening i have to go to on friday night would you like to go an opening of what its an exhibit at the art gallery expressionists to his credit he didnt snort you want me to go look at paintings and make all sorts of idiotic comments on brushstrokes and underlying meanings his cocked his head do i look like a guy whos going to stand around sipping espresso and talking about the use of color on canvas no he was sitting on a stump bare to the waist with faint purpling braises on his ribs his hair was wild and tousled no you dont no more he thought than she looked like a woman who would toss aside responsibility and ran off to la with her lover for a week what the hell is she doing with me he wondered as he rose and to me if this goes on much longer what will we do to each other wed better get back he shrugged into his shirt you dont want to keep seraphina waiting michael she laid a hand on his chest ill miss you good he lifted her into the saddle chapter nineteen contents prev next he wasnt gone a few days but nearly two weeks laura reminded herself every night that he was under no obligation to call her to tell her what was delaying him or just so that she could hear his voice she reminded herself that they had an adult relationship in which each party was free to come and go as he or she pleased it was because shed never had a relationship like it before she told herself that she was fretting worrying feeling hurt she certainly had plenty to keep her busy and she had learned the hard way never to allow a man to be responsible for providing her with a fulfilling life that was her job one she intended never to neglect again with her work her children her family and friends she had a full contented life perhaps she wanted to share it with michael and to be a part of his life but she wasnt a lovestruck teenager who sat by the phone hour by hour waiting for it to ring though she did try to will it to ring a time or two at the moment though she wasnt worried about the phone she had other problems on her hands alis spring dance recital would begin in less than two hours not only was no one ready but one of the kittens had coughed up a hairball in the middle of kaylas bed causing much dismay and more female disgust and one of the barn cats had gone exploring seducing bongo into giving mad chase through the herb garden which resulted in bad news for the chamomile and tansy and earned bongo a bloody nose nothing laura did could lure the insulted hissing cat down from the cypress tree where he had taken shelter and bongo continued to whimper pitifully under her bed despite all of that her biggest problem was ali herself the girl was moody uncooperative and whiny her hair was terrible she claimed her stomach was upset she didnt want to go to the recital she hated recitals she hated everything her patience strained laura tried one more time to style alis hair to the childs specifications honey if youre nervous about tonight its all right youll be wonderful you always are im not nervous ali pouted into the mirror i never get nervous before i dance i just dont want to go people are depending on you your instructors the other girls in your troupe the family you know how excited grandma and granddad were when they left for uncle joshs everyones looking forward to tonight i cant depend on anybody can i i have to do what i say ill do but nobody else does around the circuit again laura thought im sorry youre disappointed your father wont be there hes i dont care about him in a badtempered move ali shrugged and scooted out from under her mothers hands he never comes anyway it doesnt matter then whats the problem nothing ill go ill do it because i keep my promises my hair looks much better now she said with dignity thank you honey if youd i have to finish getting dressed she pressed her lips together a small girl pretty in her tights and ballet skirt its not your fault mama i didnt mean it to sound that way im not angry with you then what mama kaylas wail bounced down the hallway i cant find my red shoes i want to wear my red ones you can go help her ali said and tried to smile ill be downstairs in a minute thanks for doing my hair over its all right because she could see the sorrow haunting alis eyes she leaned down and kissed her on both cheeks i love playing with your hair and i suppose if you wanted to put just a little of that lip gloss on it would be all right you mean before we go not just for onstage just for tonight laura tapped her fingers against alis lips youre not growing up on me any faster than i can help it maaamaaa my shoes and neither is she laura murmured im coming downstairs ali ten minutes tops she found the shoes who would have expected to find them right there on the shoe shelf in the closet after pulling a brush through her own hair laura herded her girls toward the door come on troops get a move on this train leaves in five minutes ill get it annie she called out when the doorbell rang could you check on bongo before you leave hes under my bed and she broke off as she pulled the door open and found michael standing on the other side michael youre home it looks that way if she had leapt into his arms right there in her own home there in front of her children he doubted he could have stuck with the decision hed made but she didnt she only smiled at him held out a hand it was kayla who leapt did you bring max back with the simplicity of childhood she hugged his waist and lifted her mouth for a kiss did he come home too sure max and i travel together whered you get the red shoes kid pretty snappy mama bought them theyre my favorites you came michael halted his admiring study of kaylas red shoes and lifted his gaze to alis face she looked he thought so much like her mother just then with that stunned wonder on her face and the emotion swimming in her eyes i told you i would i thought youd forgotten i thought you were too busy forget an invitation from a beautiful ballerina to watch her dance he shook his head as he straightened boy that wouldnt say much about my memory head cocked he held out the bouquet of pink baby roses we do have a date right you didnt go call some other guy to take my place no are these for me mouth open in a litle o of confused delight she stared at the roses for me who else for me she breathed it taking the flowers in her hands thank you mama michael brought me flowers i see and her eyes stung a bit theyre lovely well use the waterford annie stood a few steps back in the hall her hands folded her eyes on michaels face when a girl receives her first flowers from a man they should be treated as something very special i want to put them in the vase myself and so you should it will only take a moment miss laura yes all right thank you annie ill help kayla raced down the hall let me smell them ah her first flowers laura murmured man why do females always get weteyed over a bunch of posies which reminded him that hed never given laura flowers never real ones just something plucked carelessly out of the ground hed never thought of it had never he realized given her anything but good hot sex flowers are symbolic and she remembered the pretty little wildflowers hed given her so sweet so simple so right everything is to women you could be right she turned back beaming at him it was so thoughtful of you to bring them and to come i didnt realize shed asked you had no idea she was counting on it she asked me a couple of weeks ago he dipped his hands in his pockets laura hadnt asked him he remembered hadnt mentioned it ive managed to avoid ballet for thirtyfour years this ought to be an experience i think youll find it painless she started toward him now and he took his hand out of his pocket to take hers before she could touch him so how are you he asked fine was he just tired she wondered or was this distance she felt did things go well in la yeah it went theyll start shooting in about three weeks well get a couple months work out of it maybe more youll stay in la during the filming she said slowly as a weight sank in her stomach he shrugged it wasnt the time to get into all of this and he was spared when ali marched back down the hall bearing her vase of baby roses like a trophy dont they look beautiful mama annies going to put them in my room theyre perfect we really need to go performers have to be there thirty minutes before curtain ill take those now sweetheart annie slipped the vase from alis hand and ill be there to see you dance she inclined her head toward michael in what from anyone else he would have taken as a friendly smile we all will it wasnt impossible to put everything out of his mind for a couple of hours the kid was so cute all of them were but it was hard to sit beside laura in the middle of all those people the families the partners the couples and not be miserable but hed had time and hed had the distance to allow himself to take a good hard look at what was going on and what was happening to him hed fallen for her all the way it would never work hed seen himself in the dingy little bar in south la drinking beer and swapping stories with wranglers going back to his hotel room after a long day sweaty dirty smelling of horse and hed seen himself growing up in a house that had breathed neglect and violence and tension hed seen himself for what he was a man who had chased all the wrong things most of his life and had found plenty of them a cliff rat son of a waitress and a wastrel who would in time and with effort be able to make a decent living and hed seen laura the templeton heiress sitting in her plush country club drinking tea dressed in her tidy suit running a fancy boutique strolling through a grand hotel that she owned he didnt doubt that hed given her something or that under different circumstances they could give each other more but it would be only a matter of time before the haze of lust cleared from her eyes and she saw what she was doing having an affair with a horse trainer they were both better off that hed seen it first knowing her he doubted she would be able to break it off clean she was too soft too kind to walk without guilt worse she might continue the relationship long after shed realized her mistake because of that sterling sense of obligation he was no good for her he knew it the people who knew both of them understood it eventually she would know it and it would kill him maybe if he hadnt run into that old buddy of his in la the old merchant marine stevedore hed shipped with drunk with raised hell with one of the men who had gone to war with him for profit after the sea lost its lure but they had run into each other and the stories were rehashed the memories swam back and for one harsh illuminating moment he had looked into the surly bitter usedup face of the man across from him and had seen himself michael fury was a man he never wanted to touch laura a man he never wanted her to know if such a man tried to touch her to know her she would cringe in shock before either of them had to cope with that he would do her a favor and slip out of her life as ah twirled on stage laura laid a hand over his and squeezed and broke his heart dont they look wonderful margo murmured beside her josh tapped his foot absently to the music and continued to watch his niece theyre all great but alis the best naturally she chuckled a little leaned closer to his ear but i was talking about laura and michael hmm distracted he shifted and glanced at the couple one row in front of them laura and michael what theyre wonderful together yeah i guess he trailed off stunned as the meaning seeped in what do you meantogether ssh she shushed him fighting back another laugh together together what are you blind his throat went dry and tight theyre not seeing each other theyre not dating dating she had to clamp a hand over her mouth for gods sake josh theyve been sleeping together for weeks how could you not know sleeping shock rage disbelief all slammed together against the words how the hell do you know that because laura told me she hissed into his ear and because if she hadnt i have eyes in my head ssh she ordered when he opened his mouth youre annoying people and heres alis solo he shut his mouth but not his mind he had a great deal to think about and as far as he was concerned his old pal michael fury had a great deal to answer for thered been nothing he could do about it that night but go home and grill his wife then argue with her over the situation josh put her attitude down to female hormones women found michael romantic which had always been his good luck and was the crux of the current problem josh found him in the paddock working a yearling on the lounge line i need to talk to you fury michael recognized the tone something was stuck in joshs craw he wasnt in the mood for it not when he was still thinking about the baffled hurt on lauras face the night before when hed given her a quick pat on the head and told her he was beat in other words im going to bed sugar and youre not invited still he released the yearling and walked to the fence where josh waited so talk are you sleeping with my sister ah well the time had come we dont sleep much michael said easily and braced when joshs hand whipped out and gripped his shirt watch it harvard what the fuck do you think youre doing who the hell do you think you are i asked her to rent this place to you do you a favor and you just jump right in i didnt jump alone damned if hed take the rap for that shes a big girl josh i didnt lure her into the stables promising her candy i didnt force her the idea of it curdled his blood then shamed him you wouldnt have to he shot back you forget who youre talking to i know you mick know your style christ we cruised together often enough yeah we did eyes level michael pried joshs fingers off his shirt but that was all right the two of us going out sniffing out babes this is my sister i know who she is if you knew if you had any idea what shes been through the past few years how easily bruised she is youd stay the hell away from her the women you played with always knew the rules went in for the game thats not laura and because shes your sister because shes a templeton shes not entitled to play bitterness rose like bile certainly not with me i trusted you josh said quietly i always trusted you its one thing for you to hit on kate and on margo but im damned if im going to stand back and watch you make it three for three his eyes went very cold very hard at his side his fist clenched and in his mind he saw it strike out fast it took all of his will and a lifetime of friendship not to follow through get the fuck away from me now you want to take a swing you take one weve gone around before not like this michael thought as his system revved toward violence now they were men and the stakes were higher and if he had any family any that really mattered this was it standing here right now prepared to break his neck why dont we try this instead ill be out by the end of the week ive already started making the arrangements torn now between friendship and family josh narrowed his eyes what arrangements you barely have your foundation up on the new construction ill probably sell it as is once ive relocated to la is that far enough away from your sister harvard or do i have to go to hell when did this come up do i have to check that with you too go away josh im busy here and youve made your point im not sure i have and as he watched his oldest friend walk away josh was no longer sure what the point was he knew she would come there was no way to avoid or prevent it they hadnt been together in two weeks and she would expect him to want her of course he did pitifully but he wouldnt touch her it was only worse now hed nearly talked himself out of his earlier decision had told himself he could find a way to make it work between then the visit from josh had snapped things back into reality he would make it clean he would make it quick she would be hurt a little there was no way to avoid or prevent that either but she would get over it still though hed known she would come he hadnt expected her so soon hadnt expected himself to be so unprepared when he saw her standing in his doorway with the sun in her hair and her eyes so pure so gray so warm i took off from the shop a little early she began she knew she was talking quickly bubbling over with nerves something was wrong she could have been deaf and blind and still have sensed it i thought since my parents were taking the girls into carmel for dinner id see if youd like me to fix yours women like you dont cook sugar they have cooks youd be surprised she came in not waiting for the invitation and swung past him into the kitchen mrs williamson taught us all including josh at least the basics i make an exceptional fettuccine alfredo i thought id see what you had before i brought over ingredients seeing her poking around the kitchen as if she belonged there as if he could come home after a hard day and find her cheerfully waiting for him tore him apart so his voice was cool and careless im not much on fancy sauces sugar well well try something else why wouldnt he say her name she wondered fighting panic he hadnt once said her name since hed come home she turned to him and couldnt prevent herself from leading with her heart oh i missed you michael so much she was halfway across the room reaching for him he could all but feel the way her soft delicate arms would wrap around his neck he stepped back lifted both hands to ward her off im filthy i havent had a chance to jump in the shower you wouldnt want to mess up a nice silk blouse why should it matter hed once torn one off her he hadnt held her in days yet he stood there now with was it boredom in his eyes what is it michael her stomach jittered echoed in her voice are you angry with me deliberately he tilted his head why do you do that why do you always assume that whatevers going on around you is your fault or your responsibility thats a real problem youve got there he added as he walked past her to get a beer out of the refrigerator he twisted off the top drank deep do i look mad to you no she folded her hands gathered her composure no you dont you look vaguely annoyed that im in your way i assumed youd want me to come that youd want to be with me tonight its a nice thought but dont you think this has run its course this you and me sugar weve taken this about as far as its going to go he tipped the beer back again wiped his mouth with the back of his hand listen youre a hell of a woman i like you i like your style in bed and out but we both know weve got to move on eventually she would breathe she told herself however tight the fist was around her heart she would breathe slow and easy i take that to mean youve decided to move on now some things came up when i was in la changed my plans i like to be fair with a woman ive slept with so i figured i should let you know im moving down there next week youre moving to la but your house never meant a damn to me he jerked his shoulder just a place ones the same as the other ones the same as the other she thought dully one house one woman why did you come back at all i left my horses he forced his lips into a grin you went to alis recital you brought her flowers i told the kid id go i dont make many promises so i dont break the ones i do make in this at least he didnt have to improvise youve got terrific kids laura ive liked getting to know them and i wouldnt have let her down last night if you go theyll be devastated theyll get over it he said his voice roughening im just a guy who passed through you cant believe that she stepped toward him you cant believe you mean so little to them they love you michael i im not their father dont lay that guilt trip on me ive got my own life to worry about and thats it she drew in another breath but it wasnt slow it wasnt easy see you around its been fun we meant nothing to you sure you did look sugar lifes long a lot of people walk through it both of us gave each other what we were looking for at the time just sex great sex he smiled again then because his reflexes were good dodged by inches the bottle she picked up and heaved at him before he could recover from the shock of that she was using her hands both of them shoved hard enough against his chest to knock him back two full steps hey how dare you how dare you lower what we have what i felt to some animal urge you son of a bitch you think you can brush me off like an inconvenient speck of lint then walk away a lamp went next and he could only watch speechless and duck fast when she threw whatever came to her hand at his head you didnt think id cause a scene did you she picked up an end table toppled it wrong finished with me are you just like that she snapped her fingers under his nose and im supposed to meekly walk away sob into my pillow and say nothing he backed up something like that so it wasnt going to be quick and clean he decided but messy nonetheless it had to be done break the place up if it makes you feel better its your stuff i expect even royalty has to have its tantrums dont you speak to me that way as if i were some interesting toy thats suddenly run amok you came into my life you exploded into my life and changed everything now youre just finished weve got nothing here and we both know it its just one of those times i saw it first she snatched up a bowl and sent it crashing through his kitchen window another time he might have been impressed with the force and velocity and her aim but at the moment he could only suffer i aint paying for the damages sugar and i never made you any promises told you any lies you knew yourself what you were getting when you came looking for me you wanted me to take the choice out of your hands you wanted me to take you so you wouldnt have to say it thats fact i didnt know how to say it she shot at him well i did and that was fine with both of us you havent got a choice here either its just done her breath was heaving shuddering as she tried to calm it temper her temper she knew was horrible when unlocked and when the key was turned with pain so much the worse thats cruel and its cold where the temper had missed its mark the quiet words arrowed straight into his heart thats life just done she let the tears come they hardly mattered so thats how this sort of thing is accomplished you say its just done and it is so much less complicated than divorce which is the only way ive ended a relationship i didnt cheat on you he couldnt bear having her think that of him or herself i never thought of another woman when i was with you this has nothing to do with you ive just got places to go nothing to do with me she closed her eyes the temper was gone now quickly as always drained to exhaustion i never would have said you were a stupid man michael or a shallow one but if you can say that youre both she lifted her hands rubbed away the tears she wanted to see him clearly since it would be the last time he was rough wild moody he was she thought everything i wonder that you dont even know what youre throwing away what i would have given you what you could have had with me and ali and kayla theyre your kids this was another hurt just as deep just as bloody templetons you wouldnt have given them to me youre wrong pathetically wrong i already had she walked to the door opened it you do what you have to do and go where you have to go but dont ever think it was just sex for me i loved you and the only thing more pitiful than that is that even as you turn me away like this so carelessly i still do chapter twenty contents prev next michael took a step forward then stopped himself she didnt know what she was saying couldnt know he forced himself to step back from the door then turned and watched her walk away across the lawn continued to watch when she changed directions broke into a run shed go to the cliffs he realized she was angry and hurt so she would go to the cliffs to finish crying when she was finished she would think she would stay angry and hurt for a while and hate him longer than that but he knew that eventually she would see it was for the best she wasnt in love with him he scrubbed his hands over his face it already felt raw and battered maybe she thought she was or had talked herself into it he decided it was a kneejerk female reaction that was all it fit a woman like laura sex and love need and emotion she wasnt seeing the big picture but he could men who had lived as he had lived didnt end up happy ever after with women of her class her breeding sooner or later shed have come to the same conclusion found herself drawn back to the country club style maybe she would never forgive him for seeing it first but that couldnt be helped it would kill him to be with her and wait to know that when the passion had dimmed she would still stay with him shed be kind she couldnt be otherwise but he would know when he had become just another obligation he was doing them both a favor by getting out of her life josh was right and no one knew him better but he continued to stand staring out at the cliffs and the lone figure who stood there twisting the knife in his own heart finally he turned away and left the room that was as disrupted as his life to go down to his horses she hadnt known how completely a heart could shatter shed thought she knew when her marriage had ended laura had been certain she would never grieve in quite the same way again shed been right she thought now and pressed both hands to the ache in her heart this was different this was worse her feelings for peter had eroded so slowly over the years that there had barely been any left by the time it was over but this she squeezed her eyes tight and though the air was still and warm she shuddered shed never loved anyone the way she loved michael wildly outrageously brutally and all those feelings were so fresh so bright and new she had treasured them shed treasured discovering that she could feel again realizing she could want and be wanted as a woman shed admired what he was what hed made himself and she had fallen as much in love with the rough and dangerous man as the kind and gentle one within now he wanted it over and there was nothing she could do crying didnt help and her tears were already dry temper changed nothing and she was already ashamed of the way she had snapped in front of him hed think her pitiful now but that couldnt be helped either she stepped closer to the edge to watch the waves beat against rock she felt that way she mused battered by forces that were beyond her control lapped in a violent endless war with no choice but to stand it didnt help it simply didnt help to tell herself she wasnt alone that she had her family her children her home her work because she felt alone completely alone there on the edge of the world with only the thunder of the sea for company even the birds were gone no gulls cried today none wheeled white toward the hard blue sky or dipped toward the spewing waves she could see nothing but the rolling of the endless sea how could she accept it that she would never love this way again why was she expected to go on to do everything that needed to be done alone always alone and know that she would never turn in the night and find someone there who loved her why had she been given this glimpse into what she could have and feel and want if it was only going to be taken away and why was the one thing she had dreamed of all of her life always always just out of her reach she imagined that this was what seraphina had felt as she stood here so many years before grieving the loss of her lover laura looked down pictured that dizzying somehow liberating plunge into space and the fierce furious heart that had taken it had she screamed as the rocks rushed up laura wondered or had she strained to meet them trembling laura took a step back seraphina had found nothing but an end she thought a horribly easy end to pain her own wouldnt be easy because she would have to live with it live without michael and finally accept that she would live without her dream she barely noticed the rumble took it at first for the seas thrashing the ground seemed to jitter under her feet blank for a moment she stared down watched pebbles dance then the roar filled her ears and she knew panicked she tried to stumble back away from the edge the ground rolled unbalancing her as she grabbed frantically for a rock the wave of earth lifted her up and pushed her hard over the rim of the world the horses sensed it first eyes wheeling white panicked whinnies michael reached up to calm the mare he was grooming then he felt it the ground shuddered under him he swore as the noise grew and horses plunged above his head came the sound of crashing glass straining wood the freight train roar deafened him as he fought to keep his balance tack leapt off the walls and fell jangling on the shuddering brick he yanked stall doors open focused on getting his horses out in the wild confusion of the moment one thought pierced like a lance laura my god laura he stumbled forward fighting free when the earth tried to heave him back he raced into the brilliant sunlight ignoring the violent undulations of the tidy green lawn when he was knocked flat he clawed his way back up skidded down the slope no one would have heard him screaming her name as he ran toward the cliffs he didnt hear it himself it lasted no more than two minutes that stretch and shift of the earth all was still preternaturally still when he reached the cliffs shed gone home he told himself shed gone back to the house was safe secure a little shaken perhaps but a native californian didnt panic at every trembler hed go check on things himself as soon as he as soon as he made sure when he looked over the edge and saw her his legs buckled on a ledge fifteen feet below inches away from oblivion she lay white as death one of her arms was flung out so that her hand dangled over that narrow bed of rock into space he wouldnt remember the climb down to her the sharp bite of rock into his hands the small nasty avalanches of dirt and pebbles where his feet slid the stinging slices as roots and rock tore viciously at his clothes and flesh blind terror and instinct took him down fast where a single misstep one incautious grip would have sent him plunging cold sweat dripped into his eyes skidded along his skin he thought was sure she was dead but when he reached her he fought back the panic and fear and placed a trembling finger on the pulse in her throat and it beat okay okay his hands trembled still as he brushed the hair from her cheeks its all right youre all right he wanted to drag her up hold her rock her to him until this greasy sickness in his gut passed he knew better than to move her even with thoughts of aftershocks spinning in his head he knew he had to check the extent of her injuries before he risked shifting her concussion broken bones internal injuries christ paralysis he couldnt get his breath and had to squeeze his eyes shut for a moment and force air in and out until he was calm he made himself move slowly carefully lifting her eyelids to check the pupils gently moving his hands over her head gritting his teeth at the blood that smeared on his fingers her shoulder shed dislocated it he realized as he probed it would be screamingly painful when she woke dear god he wanted her to open her eyes his breath came fast and harsh as he continued to check her no breaks a lot of bruises and some bad cuts and scrapes but nothing was broken he agonized over her back and neck knew he had to leave her to call for an ambulance and the thought of leaving her alone there on that ledge knowing that if she woke it would be to terror and pain ripped him its going to be all right he took her hand squeezed gently trust me i wont be long ill be back when her fingers flexed in his relief burned through him in cold fire laura can you hear me dont move baby open your eyes if you can hear me but i dont want you to move her world was white and thick and cold so cold then there were shadows shifting receding voices whispering under a brilliant roar then his face close to hers dark eyes so blue they burned michael yeah he had to swallow couldnt fear had dried up every bit of the saliva in his mouth yeah youre going to be all right you just took a little fall i want you to michael she said again then her white world flashed red pain sliced through her long ragged blades of it that had her crying out rearing against his hands stop i know it hurts but i dont know how bad it is you have to lie still lie still but the way shed already twisted terrified him look at me look at me tell me if you can feel this he put a hand on her thigh pressed when she nodded he pressed her other leg move your feet for me laura okay good part of his throat opened again when he saw her feet move and flex youre a little banged up thats all and in shock he noted studying her pupils and in pain im going to get you up my shoulder she tried to reach for it fought off a wave of nausea black and boiling nausea the pain was unspeakable and even breathing threatened to make her retch did i break it no just knocked it out of joint his hands were clammy when he closed them over hers blood oozed from a dozen gashes he didnt even feel done it myself a couple times hurts like hell im going to be right back okay just a couple minutes no dont the wrenching pain slammed into her she tried to move away escape it sweat pearled on her face and her eyes went glassy okay hold on he couldnt leave her like this in shock and pain simply couldnt leave her here suffering he could fix it though the thought of what it would take out of both of them churned like acid in his stomach i can pop it back in ill hurt you but itll give you relief youre better off with a doctor though just hanging on until i can get please she closed her eyes agony was an icy white knife digging into muscle and bone i cant think i cant think over it he shifted braced himself beside her he wiped a hand over his mouth smearing blood dont think i want you to scream let out one long loud scream what scream goddamn it he held her down with one hand took a firm grip on her arm hissing when her eyes opened wide and stared into his now she felt the jerk the sick roll of it echoing in her stomach and white again whitehot then nothing his hands were slick with sweat and blood slippery enough that he nearly lost hold his stomach churned as he watched her eyes roll back felt her go limp under him gritting his teeth he snapped the joint into place then his breath whooshed out and he lowered his brow to hers oh baby im sorry im sorry he did lift her now cradling her in his arms rocking them both he lost track ten seconds ten minutes he had no sense of time passing until she stirred again its all done dont worry he pressed his lips to her hair buried his face there until he managed a greasy grip on control its better now yes she was floating pain was everywhere but it was dull now throbbing almost gently in her limbs its better i cant remember what happened an earthquake it knocked you off onto the ledge gently he checked her head the bleeding had stopped but he worried over the lump and the broken skin youre going to have some champion bruises knocked me off my god she turned her face into his chest shivered off the cliff nearly into the sea she thought onto the rocks below like seraphina how bad the house the horses oh michael the girls its fine everythings fine it wasnt a big one i dont want you to worry hed do that for both of them now that he was calmer he was taking stock the quake had shifted rock and earth there was nothing left of the rough path leading back up hed have to leave her climb back up and get ropes let me look at you he studied her face too pale he thought and her pupils were still dilated hows your vision blurry no its fine i have to see if the girls are all right theyre fine theyre with your parents remember in carmel she was lucid he told himself her pulse was rapid but strong how many fingers two she said and gripped the hand hed held up annie the house i said everythings fine trust me all right she closed her eyes again and let herself float i fell off the cliff thats about it he pressed her hand to his lips held it there until he could speak again now listen im going to have to leave you here for a couple minutes then im coming back and ill get you up you have to leave me you cant make the climb i want you to lie right here stay still promise me laura open your eyes and look at me promise me you wont move until i come back she looked at him i wont move until you get back its cold here he stripped off his denim jacket laid it over her thatll help a little just relax now relax and wait for me ill wait for you she murmured the world seemed to revolve in slow motion she watched him rise turn confused she saw him scale the cliff his hands and feet finding purchase showering down little cascades of dirt she smiled dreamily thinking he looked like a hero scaling castle walls was he saving her from the tower climbing up so high to kiss her awake no no he was leaving her she remembered he was leaving her she thought dully and watched too buffered by shock to feel alarm as he slid five full feet down the cliff face she watched as he swung a hand up dug in with bare fingers and fought his way up the rough unforgiving wall he was going away she thought but he would come back for her hed come back then he would leave again when he reached the top he stared down at her his eyes seemed oddly close again as if she could reach up and touch his face then he was gone and she was alone hed left her he didnt want to be part of her life any longer or to allow her to be part of his he would come back she didnt doubt that he would come back and do as hed promised but she would still be alone and she would survive laura thought because there really was no other choice she hadnt leapt from the cliff she hadnt tossed her life aside fate had pushed her but she would survive that as well and go on poor seraphina drifting a little laura turned her head she hadnt fought for life hadnt survived and had lost all of her dreams a tear trickled down her cheek in sympathy in sorrow and as she turned to brush it away her gaze fell on the small dark hole in the wall of the cliff a cave she thought hazily there was no cave on this ledge the rocks had moved she realized and sighed a little everything had moved she inched her way toward the opening a secret place she thought a hiding place a lovers place she was smiling as she pushed herself up sat smelled surely she smelled the faint scent of a young girls perfume seraphina she murmured even as she reached her hand inside the opening and laid it on the polished wood of a chest ive found you poor seraphina lost for so long she continued to speak and if the words were incoherent there was no one to hear she knelt waited for her head to stop spinning and tried to drag the chest into the light laura goddamn it her smile soft her eyes vague she lifted her face and saw him atop the cliff seraphina weve found her michael come and see stay put stay just where you are it was the hit on the head he thought and worked rapidly to secure the rope to the horn of maxs saddle she was disoriented confused his heart drummed in his throat at the idea that she might try to stand she might fall before he could get back to her hold steady he ordered max then played out the rope he went over the edge with more speed than caution the rope burning his wounded hands and the cliff striking out to punish him his ankles sang when he landed and his breath came fast but he had her again hard against him safe you promised not to move seraphina in the cave i cant get it by myself its too heavy i need margo and kate in a minute lets get this on you working fast he looped the rope around her youre not going to have to do anything but hold on to me max and i will get you up all right she didnt question it it was all so simple after all could you get it out for me just out here in the light its been in the dark so long sure now im going to lift you up you look at me nothing but me i will but the chest what chest in the cave dont worry about it ill but he glanced over at the gesture of her hand and saw the dull gleam of brass against wood the shadow of shape jesus christ seraphinas dowry would you pull it out into the light it was small no more than two feet long a domed box of cedar fitted with brass hinges and no more than twenty pounds he judged as he hefted it out a simple box uncarved yet he could have sworn he felt something as his hands closed over it heat where there should have been none a faint vibration that tickled his fingertips it lasted only a moment no more than two heartbeats then it was just a small chest fashioned out of smooth wood and brass ah of her dreams locked away laura said softly all locked away because the one she wanted most was over the quake shifted the rocks frowning michael studied the cave cut so neatly in the wall id say another one some time ago covered it up she wanted us to find it shes been leading us here all our lives now you have it however intriguing the find he had priorities i want you to put your arms around my neck and hold on can you do that hows the shoulder its sore but i can manage how are we going to let me worry about it he helped her to her feet kept himself between her and the edge just keep looking at me he continued pulling her arms up until they linked around him its a good strong rope youve got nothing to worry about did you climb up the cliff i thought i saw you climbing up nothing to it he said aware that her mind was drifting fell off a few too on film he continued to talk as he tested the rope hold tight now were going up max back back the rope went taut with one arm firmly around lauras waist michael let his feet leave the ground and put himself in the walkers hands rocks scraped painfully against his back he used his heels to aid the ascent while sweat ran down his face and the muscles of his arms screamed almost there he told her we didnt get seraphina we have to get her ill go back and get her just hold on look at me she snapped back into focus stared into his eyes you came back for me sure hold on for an instant his heart stopped they were inches from the edge dangling between sky and sea if any one of them faltered they would lose reach up just one hand now reach up laura and grab hold she did as he asked watched her own hand grip the edge of rock and dirt slip away grip again thats it pull ignoring his tortured muscles he levered her up dragging himself behind her as his horse strained to pull them the last foot michael bellied up to level ground then simply lay there his body sheltering hers his face buried in her hair laura god laura his mouth sought hers and for a moment he sank out of terror and into oblivion well get you home well get you home now he drew back pain my head its all right lie still let me take care of you he released the rope let it dangle and gathered her into his arms max hell come dont worry hell come he carried her away from the cliffs and up the long slope to templeton house with max following placidly behind his legs didnt begin to shake until ann burst out of the front door oh sweet lord ive been looking for her everywhere what happened my poor lamb she took a fall he continued moving through anns fluttering hands she needs to get inside in the parlor sprinting ahead ann called desperately up the stairs mrs williamson jenny ive found her then to michael how bad is she everyones on the way i called when i couldnt find her lay her down here on the sofa and let me see oh sweetheart your head what in the world mrs williamson stopped out of breath in the doorway shes had a fall ann snapped out we need hot water bandages i fell off the cliff laura said as her head settled back into place oh my dear god where does it hurt let me look at you she broke off when she heard the sound of cars speeding up the drive doors slamming everyones here ann pressed a kiss to lauras brow everythings all right now susan burst through the doorway first stopped braced herself as her heart tilted well she managed calmly enough whats all this i fell off a cliff laura told her michael got me up i hit my head that was all she got out before the room filled with people and hands that wanted to touch and voices that babbled questions quiet thomas took his daughters hand shot the order out to the group at large josh call the doctor tell him were bringing laura in no rousing herself laura sat up and patted kaylas head as her daughter laid it in her mothers lap i dont need the doctor ive just hit my head its a nasty bump mrs williamson tutted as she continued to clean the blood and dirt from lauras head wouldnt be surprised if you have a concussion here little girl michael he didnt notice all the eyes that focused on him all he could do was stare down at laura i dont know how long she was out five six minutes but shes been lucid her visions not blurred theres nothing broken he wiped a hand over his mouth she had a dislocated shoulder she probably fell on her left side itll be sore but shes got good rotation i dont want to go to the hospital the er will be packed with people after a tremor i dont want to be one of them i need to be home then you should stay home margo crouched beside her we can take care of you you gave us a scare gave myself one murmuring she wrapped her arm around ali as the girl burrowed into her side im fine just a few bumps and bruises it was quite an adventure try scuba diving the next time you want an adventure reaching over the back of the couch kate laid a hand on lauras shoulder my heart cant take this we found seraphinas dowry what kates fingers gripped what its there on the ledge where i fell there was a cave and it was there wasnt it michael i didnt imagine it did i its there ill get it for you youll be getting nothing mrs williamson said lifting her voice over the fresh spurt of questions sit down before you fall down boy and let me see to your hands youve made a fine mess of yourself oh good lord focusing on someone other than her daughter for the first time susan snagged michaels wrist his hands were coated with dirt and blood the knuckles mangled youve cut them to pieces her eyes lifted to his swam overflowed as she realized what hed done michael theyre fine im fine he jerked away abruptly he couldnt breathe wasnt certain how much longer he could stand ive got to see to my horses when he staggered out susan took a step after him mom josh put a hand on her arm let me please bring him back here josh he needs tending to he wont come josh said to himself as he went after his friend michael he hurried across the terrace over the yard feeling like a fool for chasing a man who walked like a drunk beside a clopping horse goddamn it michael wait he caught michael by the shoulder spun him around and stepped back involuntarily at the molten fury that spurted out get away from me im done here im not you listen dont fuck with me now ignoring the pain in his hands michael shoved josh back im in the mood to hurt somebody and it might as well be you fine take a shot the shape youre in i could blow on you and knock you down you idiot you stupid son of a bitch why didnt you tell me you were in love with her what the hell difference does it make only all you stood there and let me dump a pile of shit on you and did nothing all you had to do was open your mouth and say it i thought you were using her i did use her didnt i i used her then i tossed her aside just like you said i would ask her i know what its like to be in love with a woman and be scared boneless you wont make it work and i know what its like to want it so much you screw it up now i know what its like to be a part of making two people i care about miserable and i dont like it this isnt about you id figured out it was time to move on before you had your say ive got other plans ive got things he trailed off turned to press his face into maxs warm throat i thought she was dead his shoulders shuddered and he didnt have the will or the energy to shrug off joshs hand i looked down and saw her lying there and thought she was dead i cant remember anything else until i was down there and put my hand on her throat felt her pulse beating shes going to be all right both of you are she wouldnt have been down there if i hadnt told her it was done if i hadnt hurt her he drew back rubbed his hands over his face smearing blood shes being taken care of so thats fine ive got no place here youre wrong no ones shutting you out but you christ mick youre a mess he took a good look at the battered hands the torn and bloody clothes he didnt want to think quite yet of how close his sister and his friend had come to dying come back inside let mrs williamson fuss over you you look like you could use a drink too ill get one when im done done with what i told her id get the damn chest didnt i im going to get it josh opened his mouth as michael started away again arguments he decided were fruitless hold up ill get byron well do it together chapter twentyone contents prev an hour later dirty and a little sore josh and byron brought the small chest into the parlor thered been a couple of dicey moments during an aftershock when the three of them had been caught crouching on the ledge wondering if theyd lost their minds fortunately it had passed and now the chest still unopened sat on the coffee table waiting i cant believe it margo murmured she brushed the wood with her fingertips its real after all this time she smiled over at laura you found it we found it she corrected we were always meant to her head throbbed dully as she reached for kates hand wheres michael he didnt josh bit back an oath he needed to check on his horses ill get him for you byron offered no it was his choice laura reminded herself and her life had to continue its so small isnt it she mused so simply made i suppose all of us had imagined something huge and ornate and extraordinary but its just a plain serviceable chest the kind that lasts she took a deep breath ready with margo and kate beside her she put a hand on the latch it opened easily soundlessly the interior releasing a scent of lavender and cedar inside were a young girls treasures and dreams a rosary fashioned from lapis with a heavy silver crucifix a brooch of garnets rose petals drying to dust gold yes there was gold glinting as it was poured out of a leather pouch but there were linens meticulously embroidered and carefully folded handkerchiefs with lacy edges turning yellow an amber necklace a ring crafted to fit a small finger and studded with little ruby stones that glistened like new blood pretty pieces of jewelry that suited a young woman not yet married and a locket that held a curl of dark hair bound by gold thread tucked in with them was a small book with a red leather cover inside was the careful conventschool writing of a wellbred woman we met on the cliffs today early when there was still dew on the grass and the sun was rising slowly from the sea felipe told me he loved me and my heart was brighter than the dawn laura rested her head against margos shoulder her diary she murmured she put her diary in with her treasures locked away poor girl i always thought id feel thrilled when we found it kate reached into the box stroked a finger over the amber beads i just feel sad she hid away everything that was important to her in this little box and left it behind you shouldnt feel sad laura laid the open diary on her lap she wanted us to find it and to open it again i like to think it had to wait until all three of us faced something we thought we couldnt face but we did we have she reached out took each of their hands in hers and we should put these in the shop in a special case we couldnt sell any of it margo murmured we couldnt sell seraphinas treasures no not to sell laura smiled at the simple box to let other people dream michael left the rubble of his living room just as it was he was going to stand in the shower and drown out the aches and pains after hed had a drink in fact now that he thought of it getting pissfaced drunk was probably a much happier way to drown out the pain he bypassed beer and took out a bottle of jamesons as he poured a tumbler half full he ignored the insistent knocking on his door go the fuck away he muttered and took one long swallow it did little to improve his mood when ann sullivan pushed open his door well i see youre already drowning your sorrows in the middle of this chaos she set down a box on the counter and frowned at the destruction i wouldnt have thought thered be this much damage we lost only a few breakables at the main house laura did most of it he lifted his glass again as ann pursed her lips did she its rare for her to let her temper loose but a wicked one it can be well sit down well tend to you before we clean up the mess i dont want to clean it up and i dont want to be tended to go away she merely reached into the box and took out a covered plate mrs williamson sent you food i asked her to let me come instead shes worried about you nothing to worry about he studied his hands ive had worse ive no doubt but youll sit down and let me clean those cuts she set a basin bottles bandages on the counter i can take care of myself he lifted the glass peered at the level of whiskey ive already made a start in her nononsense style ann came around the counter and shoved him into a chair sit when youre told shit he rubbed his shoulder where shed pushed it burned like fire and keep a civil tongue in your head she busied herself filling the basin with hot water got infection brewing already ive no doubt the sense of a bean is what youve got she snatched one of his hands and got to work if youre going to play nurse nancy at least goddamn that hurts i imagine dont you swear at me michael fury her eyes stung when she saw just how badly hed damaged his hands but her movements remained brisk and not particularly sympathetic thisll bite some the burn of the antiseptic that she generously poured over open wounds made his eyes cross and filled the air with wild blue curses youve a raw irish tongue reminds me of my uncle shamus what part does your family come from galway goddamn it why dont you just use battery acid and be done with it big strong man like you whining over a little peroxide and alcohol take another drink then as i havent a bullet for you to bite on it scored his pride as shed meant it to michael tipped back the glass and scowled at her he decided to brood while she wrapped gauze over his hands done he demanded with those for the time being youll want to keep the bandages dry and theyll need to be changed regular since i assume youll be as stubborn as miss laura about a doctor dont need a doctor he jerked his shoulder but regretted it when it throbbed shell be fine too shes got enough people hovering over her she inspires love and loyalty because shes generous with giving both rising ann emptied the basin refilled it take off whats left of your shirt he cocked a brow well annie im a little impaired but if id known you had an urge to ow he gaped shocked speechless as she gave his ear a hard twist ill twist more than your ear if you behave like a baboon take that shirt off boy christ he sat for another moment rubbing his stinging ear whats your problem your hands arent the only things youve cut to blazes now get the shirt off so i can see what youve done to yourself what the hell do you care i could bleed to damn death and you wouldnt bat an eye youve always hated me no ive always been afraid of you and that was foolish youre just a pitiful man who hasnt a clue of his own worth and i made mistakes im sorry for and i hope im woman enough to admit it because he wasnt cooperating she tugged off his tattered tshirt herself i thought you had beaten your mother what my mother i never i know that be still oh jesus boy youve done a job here oh poor lad she crooned now as she dabbed gently at the gashes on his back youd have killed yourself for her wouldnt you suddenly tired unbearably tired he laid his head on the counter shut his eyes go away leave me alone i wont nor will anyone else youll have to be the one to do it hold on now this is going to hurt he hissed between his teeth as the antiseptic bit i just wanna get drunk you will if you must she said easily but a man who would brave an earthquake to get to his woman should have enough nerve to face her sober this bruising could use liniment well well see to that after weve seen to the rest take off your pants oh for christs sake im not going to christ he yelped when she twisted his other ear all right all right you want me naked you got it he rose wrenched the button of his torn jeans tugged them off id have gone to the hospital if id known what the alternative was going to be that cut on your thigh could use stitches but well do what we can he sat badtemperedly but shoved the tumbler aside he didnt feel like drinking any longer is she all right a smile ghosted around anns mouth but she kept her head lowered shes hurting in more ways than one she needs you no she doesnt the last thing you know what i am now she lifted her head looked him dead in the eye yes i know what you are but do you michael fury do you know what you are he worried over it like a man worrying over an aching tooth how could he concentrate on what he needed to do when he kept seeing her the way she had been white and still on that ledge or the way she had looked eyes filled with hurt and temper as shed turned at the door and told him she loved him distractions didnt help hed dealt with the mess of the apartment because ann had ordered him to get up off his butt and take out the trash hed calmed his horses rehung his tack then taken the tack down again and packed it he wasnt staying anyway in the end hed given up and started across the lawn to templeton house it was reasonable wasnt it he argued with himself to want to check on her she probably should be in the hospital her family wouldnt push her it was obvious to him that when laura templeton dug her heels in no one could push her he would just check then hed make arrangements to stable his horses elsewhere until he could get the hell out of dodge as he walked through the garden kayla and ali popped up from their perch on the terrace where theyd been playing jacks his first thought was that he hadnt known kids still played jacks then they launched themselves at him you saved mama from the earthquake kayla all but climbing up into his arms made his fresh bruises throb not exactly he began i just you did solemneyed ali looked up into his face everyone said so he started to shrug uncomfortable in the role of hero but she took his hand and her eyes were clouded with worry they said she was going to be all right everyone said she was going to be all right is she why ask him damn it how did he get to be the authority but he crouched down unable to resist that trembling lip sure she is she just got some bumps thats all alis lips curved a little okay she fell off the cliff kayla continued and found seraphina and she got hurt but you and max came to pull her back up mrs williamson said max should have a whole bushel of carrots he grinned tousled her hair what do i get she said you already got your reward what is it search me you got hurt too soberly kayla lifted his bandaged hands one at a time and kissed them do they hurt does that make it better emotion swarmed through him a stinging hive of bees that left behind a sweet ache no one in all his life had ever kissed his hurts yeah much he pressed his face into her hair for a moment wishing wanting is it all right if we go down and see max instinctively ali stroked michaels hair to soothe him to thank him yeah hed like that ah your mom shes in the parlor everyones supposed to be quiet so she can rest but you can go in ali beamed at him shed want to see you and kayla and i are going to get up every morning early before school and clean the stalls until your hands are better you dont have to worry i coward he thought tell them you wont be here tell them youre leaving couldnt just couldnt thanks as they dashed off he watched them two pretty young girls racing away through fanciful gardens he stepped over the scattered jacks and after three tries managed to lift his hand and open the terrace door she wasnt lying on the couch as hed expected but standing at the window her back to the room looking out toward the cliffs she was so small he thought everything about her telegraphed fragility and yet she was the strongest woman hed ever known she should have seemed delicate just then highly breakable with her hair pulled back the soft fluid folds of a white robe wrapped around her but when she turned and those last gilded beams of the setting sun danced against the window at her back she seemed simply indestructible i was hoping youd come her voice was calm as was she a close brush with death had shown her that she could indeed survive anything even michael fury i wasnt able to thank you coherently before or to see how badly you were hurt im fine hows the head she smiled it feels as though i smashed it on a rock would you like a brandy im not allowed myself my many medical advisers tell me i cant have any alcohol for twentyfour hours no ill pass the whiskey hed downed earlier wasnt sitting very well as it was please sit down leading with manners she gestured to a chair weve had quite a day havent we michael i wont forget it anytime soon your shoulder ive had enough fussing its sore she sat smoothing down her robe as she did im sore my head aches and occasionally i get this quick twist in my stomach when i let myself think about what might have happened what would have happened if you hadnt found me her brow lifted as she watched him prowl the room other than that first long stare when shed turned to him hed barely looked at her to keep her own hands still she linked them in her lap is something else on your mind michael other than my medical report i just wanted to see he stopped hooked his thumbs in his pockets and made himself look at her listen i dont see any point in leaving this business hanging between us what business youre not in love with me patiently attentive she angled her head im not no youve just got it all mixed up with sex and now probably with gratitude and thats just stupid so now im stupid dont twist things around im trying to untwist them she leaned forward to touch the box still open on the coffee table you havent seen seraphinas dowry arent you curious its nothing to do with me but he looked down saw the glint of gold of silver of glossy beads not a hell of a lot considering youre wrong its quite a bit considering her gaze lifted to his again quite a bit why did you go back down for it i told you i would a man of your word she murmured i was fuzzy at the time but things are clearer now i remember lying there watching you climb up that rock wall clinging like a lizard your hands bleeding slipping when the wall would give way you could have been killed i guess i should have just left you there you couldnt have done that youd have gone down for anyone thats who you are and you went back for this she stroked the lid of the box because i asked you youre making it bigger than it was you brought me something ive looked for my entire life her eyes swimming with emotion stayed on his i cant make that bigger than it is how many times did you climb up climb down for me michael when he said nothing only turned away to pace again she sighed it makes you uncomfortable gratitude admiration love youre not in love with me dont tell me what i feel because her voice had sharpened he glanced back warily if she started throwing things again he doubted he had the energy to dodge dont you dare to tell me what i feel youre entitled not to feel the same way entitled not to want me to love you but youre not entitled to tell me what i feel then you are stupid he exploded you dont even know who i am i killed for money she waited a beat then rose and walked over to pour herself a glass of mineral water youre referring to when you were a mercenary it doesnt matter what title you put on it i killed i got paid for it i dont suppose you believed in the cause you were fighting for he opened his mouth shut it wasnt she hearing him it doesnt matter what i believed or didnt i killed for profit ive spent the night in a cell ive slept with women i didnt know calmly she sipped are you apologizing michael or bragging christ almighty dont pull that snotty ladyofthehouse routine on me ive done things you cant even imagine in this rarefied world you live in she drank rarefied is it she murmured as compared to the reality you live in michael fury youre a snob jesus christ you are as you see it im above desperation or needs or sins because i come from money and maintain a certain social status im not supposed to understand a man like you much less care for him is that right yeah he ached everywhere that about sums it up let me tell you what i see michael i see someone who has done what he had to do to survive and i understand that very well even living in my pathetic rarefied world i didnt mean someone who didnt give up no matter what got in the way she interrupted staring him down i see someone who decided to take a new direction in his life and is making it work he has ambition decency and courage and i see a man who can still grieve over a child he never had a chance to know she was making him into something he wasnt and she was scaring the life out of him im not what youre looking for youre what i found i have to live with that and when you go i will im doing you a favor he muttered you cant even see it youd have figured it out for yourself sooner or later youve already got the seed in your head which means you know it isnt going anywhere with us it cant and you knew it did i why dont you explain how youve come to that conclusion there were dozens of examples but only one stuck out youre damn careful not to touch me when anyones around is that so she set down her glass with a snap stay right there incensed she marched to the door and out leaving him scowling after her why the hell was he getting into all this he asked himself why was he arguing with her why couldnt he just touch her one more time just hold her one more time then hed go laura strode back in dragging thomas in her wake youre supposed to be resting her father scolded oh hello michael i was about to go down and talk later laura ordered then marched straight to michael hey was all he managed before she grabbed him by the hair dragged his head down and fixed her lips hotly on his he lifted his hands dropped them again then gave up and crushed her against him her body was drumtight all but vibrating with fury but her mouth was soft sweet and the kiss weakened his knees there she pulled away spun toward a baffled and grinning thomas thanks dad if you wouldnt mind leaving us alone again no fine michael i believe you and i will have a little talk later thomas closed the door discreetly behind him satisfied laura demanded not nearly shed just churned up all the urges hed nearly managed to quell saying nothing he yanked her against him again what the hell was that supposed to prove it doesnt change and then he broke just broke shuddering he buried his face in her hair fought to find his breath i thought you were dead he managed oh god laura i thought you were dead oh michael every drop of temper drained out of her as she stroked his back it was horrible for you im sorry so sorry were fine now you saved me gently she cupped his face and studied those dark stormy eyes you saved my life she murmured and touched her lips to his no he jerked back shocked at how close shed come to bringing him to his knees were not going that route were not mixing this up again she stood where she was watching all those violent emotions flit over his face and slowly her aching heart began to swell and to heal her smile bloomed why youre afraid of me arent you afraid of us i see i have been stupid after all thinking it was only me youre in love with me michael and it scares you dont put words in my mouth he began then backed up a full step as she came toward him dont whatll happen if i touch you now the sense of power of right glowed inside her you might shatter tough guy holding it all in i could break you just by doing this and she laid her hand on his cheek youre making a mistake he clamped a hand on her wrist and his fingers trembled you dont know what youre doing i cant be what you need why dont you tell me what you think i need then you figure ill polish up and start playing tennis at the club go to the gallery openings and buy a tux its never going to happen im not going to start drinking brandy and playing billiards or sit in a steam room with a bunch of overweight rich guys and talk about the latest stock reports she began to laugh and the laughter made her head ache and spin so that she had to sit on the arm of the settee until she caught her breath thats telling me you think this is a joke so will all your fancy friends there goes laura templeton with that mongrel she picked up she sobered quickly i could slap you i could actually slap you for that in fact she had to grip her hands together to stop herself from doing just that thats insulting to me and to those i consider my friends you think i care about any of that do you really think so little of me i think everything of you he said and stopped her tirade before it could begin if thats true then you should respect what it is i do need with some alterations its the same thing ive needed my whole life i need my family and my work my home i need to feel that i put in as much as i take out i need my children to be happy and safe and i need someone i love and who loves me to share it all to be there for me i need someone wholl depend on me and whom i can depend on i want someone wholl listen and understand wholl touch me when i need to be touched wholl make my heart beat a little faster when he looks at me the way you look at me michael the way youre looking at me right now youre not going to let me walk he said quietly yes yes i will she reached into the box took out the locket if you need to go to prove something to escape from something even if that something is what we feel for each other i cant stop you she laid the locket down again gently but i wont stop loving you or needing you ill just live without you ill live without the life we could make without seeing my children light up when you walk into the room without the other children we could make together she narrowed her eyes when she saw the flicker in his eye did you think i wouldnt want more children that i havent already dreamed what it would be like to hold a baby we made together no i didnt think youd want more children with me she was breaking him bit by bit laura she rose waited but he only shook his head a family michael thats all ive ever really dreamed of you changed a great deal inside of me but never that you gave me all those firsts and because i was so dazzled by you so in love with you i didnt see that i could give you something back ill give you a family michael he wondered if he could speak how any man could when faced with the gift of everything he would ever need every treasure imagined and sought and despaired of im wrong for you ive got to be wrong for you and it was never supposed to come to this between us i took you because i could because i wanted you more than id ever wanted anything youre right for me she corrected you have to be right for me and what was it never supposed to come to between us michael to plans to futures his gaze was drawn to the open box again and all those tiny precious treasures ive barely started to get my business off the ground hardly made a dent in getting my life into some kind of decent order ive got nothing for you dont you dont you have dreams michael and arent some of them the same as mine she wanted to reach for him then but this time he would have to reach first she would let him walk he realized if he turned and stepped back out the door they would both go on she was waiting for him she was willing to take him just as he was and with her he realized he might find there was more in him more for him than hed ever allowed himself to dream im going to give you one more chance before i say what i have to say what i wasnt going to say what i didnt think youd want to hear how many chances did a man get he wondered how many lives how many offers of everything that mattered he took a step toward her stopped once i say it the door closes for both of us do you understand that her lips curved do you i understood it the minute i saw you again his eyes went dark dangerous stay or run laura she lifted her chin this time she would say it stay then youll have to live with it and me he took her hand not gently but possessively his battered fingers clamping onto hers ive never loved another woman thats a first you gave me she closed her eyes i feel as though ive waited my whole life to hear you say that i havent said it yet he lifted his free hand to her face look at me when i do i love you laura he said when her eyes opened maybe i always did i know i always will ill never lie to you or leave you to handle things alone ill be a father to your children all of them ill love them all of them and theyll never have to wonder if i do michael overcome she turned her lips into his palm kissing his hurts much as kayla had thats everything no its not so heres the rest he waited until her eyes cleared and met his if you want to take a chance on this ill give you whatever i have whatever i can make and whatever i can be the words were just there he realized just there waiting to be said absently he reached over plucked a tulip from the vase on the table beside them held it out to her marry me be my family rather than take the flower she closed her hand over his around the stem yes she touched her lips to his cheek settled her head with a sigh on his shoulder yes she said again feeling his heart thud against hers as she looked into the simple box filled with dreams ive found you she murmured turning her mouth up to michaels weve found each other finally
