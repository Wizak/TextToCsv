chapter nineteen chapter one shed gotten through the entire evening without killing anyone lieutenant eve dallas cop to the bone figured the restraint showed enormous strength of character her day had gone smoothly enough a morning court appearance that had been as routine as it was tedious paperwork both extensive and mindnumbing the single case shed caught had involved pals and their dispute over who had dibs on the last of the illegals a party mix of buzz exotica and zoom theyd been toking on while lazing around on the roof of an apartment building on the west side the dispute had been resolved when one of the afternoon partyers had taken a header off the roof clutching the last of the illegals in his greedy fist he probably hadnt felt much even when hed splatted onto tenth avenue but it sure as hell had broken the party mood witnesses including an uninvolved good samaritan from a neighboring building whod called in the nineoneone all stated that the individual whod been scooped off the sidewalk and into a bag had leaped of his own volition onto the roof ledge danced an energetic keepaway boogie lost his precarious balance and taken flight with a giggling weehaw much to the surprise and possible entertainment of the afternoon passengers on an airtram whod also witnessed the last dance of one jasper k mckinney one inappropriately delighted tourist had managed to capture the entire incident on his pocket vid it all jibed and the books would close on jasper as death by misadventure unofficially eve labeled it death by stupidity but there wasnt a place on the sheet for that particular observation as a result of jasper and his eightstory dive shed clocked out of cop central barely an hour past endofduty only to get bogged down in ugly midtown traffic because the temporary vehicle some sadist in requisitions had tossed at her limped along like a blind threelegged dog she had rank for gods sake and was entitled to a decent ride it wasnt her fault shed had two units destroyed in two years maybe shed forget strength of character and go maim somebody in requisitions in the morning it sounded like fun and after shed gotten home okay almost two hours late shed had to transform herself from kickass murder cop to fashionable corporate wife she was a good cop she reminded herself but more than a little shaky in the corporate wife arena she supposed shed been fashionable since her husband had the entire getup down to the underwear set out for her roarke knew clothes she just knew she was wearing something green with sparkles all over it and where it wasnt green and sparkly it showed a lot of skin there hadnt been time to argue about it but only to dive into the outfit and shove her feet into shoes also green and sparkly with high enough needlethin heels shed been nearly eye to eye with her man it wasnt a hardship to be eye to eye with roarke not when his were that wild unearthly blue in a face drawn by artistic angels but it was tough being social with strangers when you were worried you might tip over and fall on your ass any second but shed gotten through it through the quickchange the quick shuttle trip from new york to chicago through the cocktail hour where her brains were nearly bored to suet despite truly excellent wine and the corporate dinner with roarke entertaining about a dozen clients with her playing hostess she wasnt quite sure what kind of clients they were since roarke had his fingers in every pie known to man or beast so she didnt attempt to keep up what she did know was that most of them could take the prize for most tedious during the fourhour ordeal but there had been no casualties points for her what she wanted now was to get home get out of the sparkly green thing and fall into bed to sleep for the six hours shed have before the clock started ticking again the summer of had been long hot and bloody fall with its cooler temperatures was coming maybe people wouldnt be as inclined to kill one another but she doubted it shed barely settled into her seat on the plush private shuttle when roarke lifted her feet into his lap and slipped off her shoes dont get any ideas pal when i finally get out of this dress im not getting back in darling eve his voice was a purr that echoed of ireland thats the sort of statement that gives me ideas however lovely you look in that dress youd look even lovelier out of it forget it no way im dragging this thing back on and im surely not geting out of this shuttle wearing what you call underwear so just oh sweet baby jesus her eyes crossed then did a slow roll to the back of her head when he pressed his thumbs into her arch i owe you a foot rub at the very least he smiled as she let her head fall back and moaned for services above and beyond i know you detest the sort of thing we did tonight and i appreciate you not pulling out your weapon and stunning mclntyre over the canapes the guy with the big teeth who laughed like a donkey right that would be mclntyre hes also a very important account he lifted her left foot kissed her toes so thanks its okay goes with the package hell of a package she thought studying him through barely open eyes all gorgeously wrapped six feet two inches of him not just the lean muscled build or the heartstopping face framed with the sweep of black silk hair but the brains the style the edge the whole shot and best of all he not only loved her but he got her of all the things they fought about and it was never hard to find something they never butted heads over this he never expected any more of her in the corporate wife area than she could give a lot of people would and she got that roarkes enterprises included holdings properties factories markets and god knew on and off planet he was absurdly rich with all the power that went with it a lot of men in his position would expect a spouse to be at their beck to drop everything and drape themselves over his arm at a moments notice he didnt for every business event or social occasion she managed to attend as his wife there were probably three she missed moreover there were countless times he arranged his schedule to suit hers or put in time as consultant on a case in fact when she thought about it he made a much better cops husband than she made corporate wife maybe i owe you a foot rub she considered youre a pretty good deal he skimmed a finger down her foot from toes to heel i certainly am but im still not getting out of this dress she scooted down in her seat closed her eyes wake me up when we land shed only started to drift when the communicator in her evening bag signaled oh come on she didnt open her eyes but reached out clamped a hand on the bag whats our eta about fifteen with a nod she pulled out the communicator and engaged dallas dispatch dallas lieutenant eve report to belvedere castle central park officers on scene homicide single victim contact peabody detective delia ill meet her on scene my eta is thirty minutes acknowledged dispatch out shit eve dragged a hand through her hair you can dump me and go on i dislike dumping my wife ill go with you and wait she scowled down at the fancy dress i hate going to scenes in these getups i hear about it for weeks it was worse because she had to put the shoes back on and then navigate in them over the grass and onto the paths of the citys greatest park the castle sat at the highest point of the park with its skinny tower rising up into the night sky and the rocky ground giving way to the lake at its feet it was a pretty enough spot she supposed for tourists to take their snaps and vids during the day once the sun set areas like this were the natural habitat of the street sleepers chemiheads unlicensed companions on the troll and those with nothing better to do than look for trouble the current city administration made a lot of noise about keeping the parks and monuments clean and to their credit they even tossed money at the process with some regularity there would be volunteers as well as city workers combing the park for litter blasting off graffiti sprucing up gardens and such then everyone would get cozy and comfortable and put their efforts into other matters until it all went to hell again at the moment it was in decent shape with hardly enough litter to make the predawn cleanup crews work themselves into a lather with roarke beside her she strode as best she could toward the barricades the cops had already put in place the castle was lit up like day with crimescene lights you dont have to wait she told him i can catch a ride ill wait rather than argue she shrugged and pulling out her badge went through the barricades no one made any comments about the dress or shoes shed figured her rep for asskicking would have kept the uniforms quiet but it surprised her not to detect a single grin or snicker behind her back it surprised her more when her partner stepped toward her without a smart remark on her wardrobe dallas its bad whatve we got female caucasian about thirty i got the scene recorded i was about to run her for id when they told me youd arrived on scene they walked together peabody in her comfortable airskids eve in the archkilling heels sexual homicide raped and strangled but he didnt stop there who found her a couple of kids jesus dallas peabody stopped a moment stood in her hastily thrownon clothes rubbing a hand over her tired face snuck out of the house thought theyd have a little adventure sure as hell got more than that weve contacted the parents and child services weve got them in a blackandwhite where is she down there peabody led the way then pointed she lay on the rocks just above the dark still water of the lake she wore nothing but what looked to be a red ribbon tied around her neck her hands were clasped together between her breasts as if in prayer or plea her face was smeared with blood blood eve thought that had spilled out of her when hed taken her eyes she had to ditch the shoes or risk breaking her neck using the can of sealit from the field kit peabody handed her she coated her hands her bare feet even so it wasnt an easy climb down in the party dress and she imagined she looked completely ridiculous completely uncoplike sparkling her way over rocks toward a body she heard something rip and ignored it oh man peabody winced youre going to ruin that dress and its totally iced id give a months pay for a goddamn pair of jeans and a normal shirt a pair of fucking boots then she put it out of her mind set her feet solidly and turned to the body didnt rape her down here theres going to be a secondary scene even a lunatic doesnt rape a woman on a heap of rocks when theres all this grass raped her somewhere else killed or incapacitated her somewhere else had to carry her down here had to have some muscle and bulk to manage that unless there was more than one of them shes what maybe a hundred and thirty pounds anyway deadweight more to protect the scene than the dress eve hitched the skirt up lets get an id on her peabody find out who she is while peabody used the identipad eve studied the position of the body posed her praying begging resting in peace whats your message she crouched to examine the body visual evidence of physical and sexual assault facial bruises torso forearms those look defensive shes got some matter under her nails tried to fight scratched at him its not skin looks like fibers her names elisa maplewood peabody said central park west address not so far from home eve stated she doesnt look uptown no pedicure hands arent smooth and pampered got calluses lists employment as a domestic yeah thats more like it shes thirtytwo divorced dallas shes got a fouryearold kid a daughter oh hell eve drew it in then set it aside bruises on her thighs and the vaginal area red corded ribbon around her throat it was dug into her skin so the bruised flesh puffed around it then the tails draped down to her breasts time of death peabody getting it peabody drew back the gauge studied the readout twentytwo twenty about three hours ago and the kids found her just after midnight first on scene responded dealt with the kids took a visual from above and called it in at quarter to one okay steeling herself she took the microgoggles slipped them on then bent over the ruined face took his time here didnt hack at her neat precise cuts almost surgical like he was doing a fucking transplant so the eyes were what he was after they were the prize the beating the rape those were just the prelude she eased back and took off the goggles lets turn her check the back there was nothing but the darkened flesh from the settling of blood and what eve identified as grass stains on the buttocks and down the thighs came at her from behind thats what he did but it didnt matter to him if she saw him knocked her down sidewalk or pavement no gravelly path see the scrapes on her elbows smacks her around she tries to fight him off tries to scream maybe she does scream but hes hauling her away somewhere he can have his fun without anyone trying to interfere drags her across the grass beats her into submission rapes her ties the cord around her neck kills her when that part of the jobs over its time for the real business eve replaced the goggles strip off whats left of her clothes take her shoes anything else she was wearing jewelry anything that individualizes her carry her down here pose her take the eyes carefully check the pose make any necessary adjustments wash off all that blood in the lake if you want clean up take your prize and be on your way ritual killing his ritual anyway they can bag her eve said as she straightened lets see if we can find the kill site roarke watched her slide her feet back into the shoes shed have been better off barefoot he mused but that wasnt an option the lieutenant would consider despite the heels the glamorous dress worse for wear now the glitter of diamonds she was every inch the cop tall lean steady as the rocks shed just climbed on to view some new horror you wouldnt see the horror in her eyes those long golden brown eyes she looked pale in the harsh lights and the glare of them only accentuated her sharp features her hair nearly the same color as those eyes was short choppy and mussed now from the breeze off the water he watched her stop hold a brief conversation with a uniform her voice would be flat he knew and brisk and reveal nothing of what she felt he saw her gesture and saw the stalwart and more comfortably dressed peabody nod then eve was peeling off from the group of cops and heading back to him youre going to want to go on home she told him this is going to take some time i suspect it will rape strangulation mutilation he lifted a brow when her eyes narrowed i keep my ear to the ground when it involves my cop can i help no im keeping civilians even you out he didnt kill her down there so we need to find where he did i probably wont make it home tonight would you like me to bring you or send you a change of clothes since even with his amazing powers he couldnt just snap his fingers and put her in boots and trousers she shook her head ive got spare stuff in my locker at central she glanced down at the dress sighed at the smears of dirt the small tears the stains from body fluid shed tried to be careful but there you go and god knew what he paid for the damn thing sorry about the dress its not important get in touch when you can sure she struggled knew he knew she struggled not to wince when he skimmed a finger down the dent in her chin when he leaned down and brushed his lips to hers good luck lieutenant yeah thanks as he walked back to the limo he heard her raise her voice okay boys and girls fan out teams of two standard evidence search he wouldnt have carried her far eve deduced what would be the point the added time trouble the additional risk of being seen still they were talking central park so it wasnt going to be quick and easy unless they ran into incredible luck she did inside of thirty minutes here she held up a hand to stop peabody then crouched grounds torn up some hand me the goggles yeah yeah she said after shed strapped them on we got some blood here she went down on hands and knees her nose nearly to the ground like a hound scenting prey i want this area cordoned off call the sweepers i want to see if they can find any trace look here she got tweezers out of the field kit broken fingernail hers she decided when she held it up to the light didnt make it easy for him did you elisa you did what you could she bagged the nail then sat back on her heels dragged her over the grass you can see where she tried to dig in lost a shoe thats why shes got grass stains and dirt on one foot but he went back for it took her clothes with him she pushed to her feet well check bins in a tenblock radius in case he dumped them theyll be torn bloody dirty well see if we can get a description of what she was wearing but even without it well look kept them though didnt you she murmured kept them as a memento she lives a couple blocks from here peabody commented grabbed her close to home dragged her here did the job then carried her over to the dump site well canvass lets get this coordinated then take her residence peabody cleared her throat studied eves dress youre going like that got a better idea it was hard not to feel a little ridiculous striding in her ruined dress and milehigh shoes toward the night droid on door duty in front of maplewoods building at least she had her badge it was one of those things she never left home without lieutenant dallas detective peabody nypsd regarding elisa maplewood she lives here ill need to scan your ids to verify he looked pretty spiffy for so early in the morning but that was a droid for you he wore a natty red uniform with silver trim and was designed to replicate a man in his midfifties just a bit of silver at the temples to match the braid these are in order mrs maplewood is a livein domestic employed by mr and mrs luther vanderlea whats this about did you see ms maplewood tonight im midnight to six havent seen her well need to see the vanderleas mr vanderlea is out of town youll need to clear a visit with the desk comps on this time of night he unlocked the doors walked in with them secondary scan for id he informed them it irritated but eve passed her badge through the electronics on the fancy desk in the blackandwhite lobby your identification is verified dallas lieutenant eve what is the nature of your business i need to speak with mrs luther vanderlea regarding her employee elisa maplewood one moment while mrs vanderlea is contacted the droid hovered while they waited quiet music played it had switched on when theyd started across the lobby set to activate eve assumed when a human entered why people needed music to cross a room she couldnt say the lights were dim the flowers fresh a few good pieces of furniture in case you wanted to sit down and listen to the recorded music were arranged tastefully there were two elevators in the south wall and four security cameras to sweep the lobby the vanderleas had a lot of bucks under the belt wheres mr vanderlea she asked the droid is this an official inquiry no im just a nosy soandso she waved her badge under his nose yes this is an official inquiry mr vanderlea is in madrid on business when did he leave two days ago hes due back tomorrow evening what she broke off as the comp signaled mrs vanderlea will see you now please take elevator a to the fiftyfirst floor you will find mrs vanderlea in penthouse b thanks even as they crossed the checkerboard floor the elevator doors opened why do we thank machines eve wondered out loud they couldnt possibly give a shit one of those innate human traits thats why programmers have them thanking us too i guess you ever been to madrid no maybe no she decided shed been a lot of places over the last couple of years i dont think do you know who designs shoes like the ones im wearing peabody the shoe god those are magolicious shoes sir no not the shoe god these are the product of a man a devious flesh and blood man who secretly hates all women by designing shoes like this he can torture them for profit they make your legs look a hundred feet tall yeah thats what i want all right a pair of hundredfoot legs resigned she stepped off on fiftyone the door to penthouse b was wide as a truck and opened by a petite woman in her thirties wearing a moss green dressing gown her hair was long and sleeptousled and was a deep dark red with subtle gold streaks streamed through it lieutenant dallas god is that a leonardo since she was goggling at the dress it didnt take eve long to conclude she was talking about it probably as leonardo was not only the current darling of the fashionable set but also the main squeeze of eves closest friend i was at a thing my partner detective peabody mrs vanderlea yes im deann vanderlea whats this about can we come in mrs vanderlea yes of course im confused when they called from downstairs and said the police wanted to see me my first thought was something happened to luther but id have gotten a call from madrid wouldnt i she smiled uncertainly nothings happened to luther has it were not here about your husband this concerns elisa maplewood elisa well shes in bed at this hour elisa cant be in any trouble she folded her arms whats this about when did you last see ms maplewood right before i went to bed about ten i went to bed early i had a headache what is this im sorry to tell you mrs vanderlea but ms maplewood is dead she was killed earlier tonight that thats just ridiculous shes in bed the simplest cleanest way eve knew was not to argue you may want to check on that its nearly four in the morning of course shes in bed her suite is back here off the kitchen she swept away through the spacious living area furnished in what eve recognized as antiques a lot of gleaming wood and curved lines deep colors complex patterns and sparkling glassware it flowed into a media room with the wall screen recessed and the game and communication center housed in some sort of cabinet armoire she corrected thats what roarke called those bigass cabinets a dining room angled off to the side with the kitchen behind it id like you to wait here please snippy now eve noted irritated and afraid mrs vanderlea opened a set of wide pocket doors and walked into what eve assumed was elisa maplewoods personal area this place is huge peabody whispered yeah lots of space lots of stuff she looked around the kitchen everything was silver and black dramatic efficient and so clean she doubted even a team of sweepers would come up with a single mote of dust it wasnt that different a setup than the one in roarkes house she didnt think of the kitchen as hers that was summersets province and she was more than happy to let him rule there ive met her before peabody glanced back from her ogling of the massive autochef you know vanderlea met them dont know them one of the dos i got dragged to roarke knows them i didnt place the name who the hell can remember all those people but her face clicked she turned as mrs vanderlea hurried back into the room shes not there i dont understand shes not in her room or anywhere in her suite vonnies sleeping her daughter her little girl i dont understand does she often go out at night no of course she mignon with this she dashed back into elisas suite who the hell is mignon eve muttered maybe maplewood switched to girls might have a lover mignons not here deann was sheetwhite now and her fingers trembled as she held them to her throat who is our dog she spoke quickly the words jumping out of her mouth really elisas dog emotionally a little teacup poodle i bought a few months ago for company for the girls but mignon bonded with elisa she she probably took her for a walk she often does that the last thing at night she took the dog for a walk oh god oh my god mrs vanderlea why dont you sit down peabody some water was there an accident oh god was there an accident there werent tears not yet but eve knew there would be no im sorry it wasnt an accident mrs maplewood was attacked in the park attacked she said it slowly as if the word were foreign attacked she was murdered no no drink a little water maam peabody pressed the glass shed poured into deanns hands sip a little water i cant i cant how can this be we were just talking a few hours ago we were sitting right here she told me to take a blocker and go to bed and i did we the girls were tucked in for the night and she made me tea and told me to go to bed how did this happen what happened no eve thought it wasnt the time to make it worse with details drink some water she noticed peabody going over to close the pocket doors the kid eve remembered this wasnt a conversation a child should hear if she should wake when she did wake eve thought her world would be changed irrevocably chapter two how long has she worked for you eve knew the answer but it would be easier to guide deann over smooth ground before they moved to the rocks two years two years i we my husband travels a great deal and i decided i wanted livein help rather than just the day staff and droids more for company i suppose i hired elisa because i liked her she ran a hand over her face and made an obvious effort to settle she was qualified of course but we just hit it off right away if i were to hire someone whod live in my house be a part of my household i wanted it to be someone i was comfortable with on a personal level the other deciding factor was vonnie yvonne her daughter i have a little girl i have zanna theyre the same age and i thought theyd be playmates they are theyre like family they are family oh god vonnie she pressed her hands to her mouth and now the tears came shes only four shes just a baby how will i tell her that her mothers how will i tell her we can do that mrs vanderlea peabody sat well talk to her and have a counselor from child protection available for her she doesnt know you deann pushed to her feet walked across the room to a drawer took out tissues shed only be more frightened and confused if she heard from a stranger i have to tell her i have to find the way to tell her she dabbed her cheeks with a tissue i need a second take your time eve told her were friends like zanna and vonnie it wasnt our relationship wasnt like employer and employee her parents deann drew in a breath long deep eve gave her top points for control when she came back to the table her mother lives downtown with elisas stepfather her father ah hes in philadelphia i can i can get in touch with them i think they need to hear this from me first they need i have to call luther i have to tell him are you sure you want to handle this yourself eve asked her she would have done it for me when her voice broke she pressed her lips together bore down she would have taken care of my baby and ill take care of hers she would have oh god how could this happen did she mention any problems to you speak of being concerned about someone who bothered her or made threats no no she would have people liked elisa was she involved with anyone romantically socially no she really wasnt dating at this point shed had a difficult divorce and was interested in creating a stable home for her daughter and just as she put it giving men a rest was there someone she rebuffed or discouraged not that i was she raped deanns hands fisted on the table the medical examiner has yet to determine eve broke off when deanns hand shot out gripped hers you know and i wont have you holding back she was my friend the indications are she was raped yes the hand tightened on eves trembled once violently then released youll find him youll find him and youll make him pay thats my intention if you want to help me do that i need you to think if theres anything however insignificant it seems to you if she said anything however casually she would have fought deann stated her husband was abusive and she got counseling she got help and she left him she learned to stand up for herself she would have fought she did wheres the exhusband td like to say hes sweating in hell but hes in the caribbean with his current bimbo he lives there runs some sort of dive shop he hasnt seen his own child not once not ever elisa was eight months pregnant when she filed for divorce i wont let him have that child a combative light glowed on her face now and the heat of it toughened her voice ill fight him if he tries to take custody i can do that for her whens the last time she heard from him a few months ago i think when his child support payment was late again bitching and complaining about having to give her his money when she had this cozy setup here she drew that long breath again the money went directly into an account for vonnie for her education not that hed think of that did you ever meet him no i was denied that dubious pleasure to my knowledge he hasnt been back to new york in four years im not thinking very clearly yet she admitted but i will i can promise you ill think very clearly very carefully and do anything i can to help you but i need to call my husband now i need to talk to luther and to be alone please to be alone so i can find the right way to tell vonnie when she wakes up to tell vonnie and my own little girl well need to see her rooms look through her things some time tomorrow is that a problem no id let you do it now but she looked back toward the door i want vonnie to sleep as long as she can eve rose if youd get in touch with me in the morning then i will im sorry ive completely forgotten who you are dallas lieutenant dallas detective peabody right right i admired your dress when you came to the door it seems like years ago already she got up rubbing at her face as she studied eve you seem familiar to me i cant figure out if its because it seems youve been here for years or if you are i think we met before at some charity dinner or something at a charity dinner oh well of course roarke youre roarkes wife roarkes cop people call you i dont have all my wits no problem im sorry to meet you again under these circumstances her gaze sharpened now and the warrior gleam still lit her face when people talk about roarkes cop over their cocktails and canapes they say shes a little scary a little mean and very relentless would that be a fair description close enough good good deann held out her hand took eves firmly because youre my cop now too shes got a tough road over the next few days peabody commented as they rode down to the lobby she strikes me as the kind wholl handle it when she gets her balance shes got spine eve agreed well look at the exhusband could be he decided to come up to new york talk to the vics parents other friends get a clearer picture of her routine from the vanderleas it wasnt a chance kill the mutilation takes it out of the box for me the setup the pose if it wasnt personal a oneonone sort of thing it was planned at least agreed they crossed the lobby and headed out to the waiting blackandwhite maplewood walked the dog at night a routine a pattern killer notices her notices the pattern and lies in wait tells me he knew the dog wouldnt go for him or had a way to incapacitate the dog have you ever seen one of those little poodles peabody held her hands together to form a little cup still got teeth right she stood just outside the car scanning the neighborhood well lit security droids would patrol regularly doormen on duty there would have been some vehicular traffic that time of night during the attack she walked the dog into the park just the verges probably but she went inside felt safe she lives here knows the area probably stayed close to the street but not close enough hed have to be fast have to be waiting almost certainly she left the sidewalk herself picturing it let the dog sniff around the trees do the dog thing its a nice night shed relax enjoy it she and vanderlea mightve been pals but she still worked in there and hard you could see by her hands shed enjoy a little time out here with the dog just walking just hanging she played her light over the grass toward the grab spot that was surrounded by barricades he waited until she was out of sight of the street just far enough killed the dog or the dog ran off killed the dog peabodys immediate distress had eve shaking her head a guy beats rapes strangles and mutilates a woman i dont think hes going to see offing a dog as crossing any lines jeez eve headed back toward the car she could go home change home was closer than central it would save her the indignity of walking through central in her current attire a point that couldnt be overvalued the blackandwhite can take us to my place we can put together what weve got catch a couple hours sleep and start fresh in the morning i hear that i also hear the unspoken you dont want to go to central in your party dress shut up peabody it was after five am when eve crept into the bedroom she stripped off as she crossed to the bed letting clothes lay where they fell then crawled naked into bed she hadnt made a sound had barely shifted the mattress but roarkes arm circled her waist and drew her back against him didnt mean to wake you up im going to catch a couple hours peabodys bunked in her favorite guest room turn it off then his lips brushed her hair just sleep two hours she murmured and turned it off her next not quite coherent thought was coffee she could smell it the seductive scent climbed into her sleeping brain like a lover up a flowerstrewn trellis then she blinked her eyes open and saw roarke he was invariably up before her and as usual was already dressed in one of his masteroftheworld suits but instead of being in the sitting area of the bedroom as was his habit scanning the early stock reports and whatever over his breakfast he was sitting on the side of the bed looking at her whats up something happen was there another no relax he pressed a hand to her shoulder to hold her down when she started to spring up im your wakeup call complete with coffee he moved the cup into her line of sight and watched her eyes glaze over with longing gimme he eased back handed it over waited while she took her first desperate swallow you know darling if caffeine ever makes it to the illegals list youre going to have to register as an addict they try to make coffee an illegal ill kill them all and it wont be an issue how do i rate coffee in bed i love you yeah you do she took another gulp grinned sucker thats no way to persuade me to get you a second cup i love you back that would probably work he rubbed a thumb along the shadows already dogging her eyes you need more than two hours lieutenant its all i can spare ill make it up eventually gonna grab a shower she was up and took what was left of the coffee with her into the bathroom he heard her call for jets on full at oneohone and only shook his head at her habit of boiling herself awake every morning hed see that she got some fuel in her and hopefully wouldnt have to tie her down and forcefeed her hed just begun to program the autochef for breakfast when he heard the quick padding steps behind him id swear there was a chip in your head that signals any time anyone so much as thinks of food roarke glanced down at the pudgy cat rubbing hopefully against his leg ill wager youve already been fed in the kitchen galahad purred like an engine and rubbed harder ignoring him for the moment roarke selected french toast for eve something she had a hard time resisting he added a couple rashers of bacon knowing his own weakness where the cat was concerned eve came out wearing a short white terry robe im just going to grab something at central when she sniffed the air spotted the plate of french toast that was low yes he patted the seat beside him then moved the cat when galahad took him up on the invitation not you sit down eve you can spare fifteen minutes for some breakfast maybe besides i should fill you in on a couple things two birds time efficiency she sat poured syrup lavishly over bread she took a bite nudged the cat back as he tried to belly toward her plate then reached for the fresh coffee roarke poured the victim worked for luther and deann vanderlea of vanderlea antiquities thats what it said when i ran his data how well do you know them i used vanderlea extensively when furnishing this house and others consulted with his father for most of it but i know luther and his wife i wouldnt call them personal friends but certainly friendly acquaintances hes knowledgeable about his business and very involved in the running of it at this stage pleasant enough people and shes very bright and charming are they suspects luther was in madrid at the time of the murder as far as i can confirm at this point wifes not on my list in fact unless shes an awardwinning actress she and the victim were as much friends as boss and domestic more she took it hard but stood up to it i liked her i can tell you from what i know of luther i cant see him raping a woman much less murdering one and cutting out her eyes he the type who might try to diddle with the maid under his wifes nose one never knows what a man might try to diddle with under his wifes nose but it wouldnt be my call where hes concerned no they strike me as very happy together i think they have a young child girl age four same age as the victims daughter deann vanderleas having a very hard morning the victim have a spouse ex lives in the caribbean abusive history well look at him close current lover not according to deann victim elisa maplewood purportedly went out between ten and midnight to walk the little foofoo dog well get the exact from building security strolled into the park where he grabbed her waited ad to be waiting attacked raped strangled then carted her over to the rocks to lay her out finish his job are the eyes a symbol she wondered windows to the soul an eye for an eye or a twisted religious ritual maybe just a souvenir youll want mira oh yeah eve thought of the citys top profiler im pulling her in this morning shed cleaned her plate while shed talked and got up now to dress we could get lucky and this was a onetime deal why do you think its not too organized and precise too many symbols the eyes red ribbon the pose maybe we find all these apply directly somehow to elisa maplewood but i think they apply to the killer rather than the victim they mean something to him personally elisa may have been a type physically her location her background something of the sort or it may have been enough for her to be female and available do you want my help with the vanderleas i might at some point let me know darling not that jacket more resigned than appalled he rose to take the one shed yanked out of her closet and after a quick study drew out one with pale blue checks over cream trust me i dont know what i did before you were my fashion consultant she told him i do but i dont like to think about it i know a dig when i hear one she sat to pull on her boots mmm he slid his hands in his pockets and fingered a small gray button one that had fallen off possibly the most unattractive illcut suit hed ever seen one shed been wearing the first time hed laid eyes on her ive a link conference shortly then ill be in midtown most of the day he leaned over laid his lips on hers left them there for a long satisfying moment take care of my cop thats my plan you know i hear your friends say your cop is scary mean and relentless what do you say about that lieutenant your friends say the same give my best to peabody he added as he walked out ill keep your best she called out and give her whats left over she heard him laugh and decided that was every bit as good as coffee for setting her up for the day setting up the appointment with dr mira was her first task when she got to her office at central peabodys todo list included confirming luther vanderlea had been in madrid and ascertaining the exhusbands whereabouts eve fed the known data into her office computer and ran a check with ircca to search for any other like crimes the number of sexual homicides involving mutilation didnt surprise her shed been a cop too long even the number that involved damaging destroying or removing the victims eyes didnt put a hitch in her stride she eliminated those where the perpetrator was in a cage or in the ground and spent her morning studying the unsolved or unconvicted her link signaled a number of times reporters on the scent and these she easily ignored letting accumulated data cook she shifted back to the victim who was elisa maplewood standard public education she read no college one marriage one divorce one child professional mothers stipend through first two years parents divorced when she was thirteen mother also a domestic stepfather a laborer father in the bronx unemployed and with a sheet eve mused and looked more closely at abel maplewood petty larceny drunk and disorderlies receiving stolen property assaults spousal assault illegal gambling public lewdness well well abel youre a little bit of a creep arent you no sexual assaults on record but there was always a first time fathers raped their daughters she knew that only too well they held them down beat them broke their bones and pushed themselves into their own flesh and blood she eased slowly away from the desk when she felt her heart begin to race when she felt the memories the nightmare of memories begin to descend over her mind she went for water rather than coffee drank it slowly as well standing at her single narrow window she knew what elisa had suffered during the rape the pain the terror that was more than pain the degradation and shock she knew the way only another victim knew but she had to use that knowledge to find the killer to find justice or she was no good if she let those memories come down too hard blur her focus she was no good time to get back into the field she told herself back in the field and do the job dallas she didnt turn and didnt ask herself how long peabody had been there watching her find her control you confirm vanderlea yes sir he was in madrid as advertised hes on his way home now canceled his last day of business after his wife contacted him he was at a breakfast meeting this morning time difference here and europe at seven madrid time next to impossible for him to have zipped home killed maplewood zipped back and made that meeting the ex brent hoyt hes clear seeing as he spent the night at the drunk tank on st thomas last night he wasnt in new york all right maplewoods father abel has a sheet well need to look at him were heading back to the vanderleas first ah theres someone here who wants to speak to you pertinent well i dont have time to chat eve turned around well check in with morris at the morgue then head uptown i have to be back here to meet with mira yeah well shes very insistent claims to have information she looks normal as opposed to if someones come in with information regarding the current investigation why didnt you just say so because peabody debated letting eve find out for herself or protecting her own skin it was a short debate she says shes a psychic eve stopped dead oh come on feed her to the liaison you know better than to let the loonies in shes registered and licensed and she pulled the pal card i dont have psychic pals its a firm policy no its the mutual friend deal mavis has all kinds of looney friends i dont let them into my office not mavis she claims to be a friend of louises dr dimatto the really normal upstanding dr d and shes shook dallas her hands are trembling hell we give her ten minutes she checked her wrist unit and as a buffer set it to signal in ten bring her in eve sat brooded this is what happened when you went and made friends they had to go out and make friends and then those friends somehow insinuated themselves into your life or your work before you knew it you were hipdeep in people and half of them were crazy all right she amended not all psychics were crazy or scamming some of them a very few some of them were legit she was well aware that law enforcement sometimes used sensitives to good effect but she didnt use them she believed in doing the job through investigative procedure technological processes evidentiary study deduction then you tossed in instinct luck and some asskicking that worked just fine for her she went for coffee now she turned from the autochef cup in hand as the woman came to the door with peabody she looked normal her hair was long waving past her shoulders in a perfectly normal shade of brown a dark and glossy brown that looked as if it might have been the one god opted for when he put her together her skin was dusky and smooth her eyes a clear and pale green that showed nerves but seemed sane as they met eves directly the face was strong and sexy with one of those lush mouths and a thin aquiline nose mexican or spanish blood eve assumed ancestors whod baked in the heat and strummed guitars exotic eve put her in the middle thirties judged her to be about five six with a toned disciplined build she wore casual and wellcut pants with a long shirt both the color of summer poppies a couple of rings with deeply colored stones and dangles at her ears slim drops of gold lieutenant dallas this is celina sanchez okay ms sanchez have a seat im pressed for time so why dont we get right to it all right she sat folded her hands tightly together on her lap she breathed in and out once he took her eyes chapter three well now that ive got your attention celina unhooked her fingers to press two to her right temple as if to compress a pain could i have some of that coffee eve stayed where she was sipping her own they hadnt released the mutilation details to the media but there were leaks she knew there were always leaks her voice was shaky and carried no accent it was husky a shade on the provocative side how did you get this information ms sanchez i saw it and its not an image i enjoyed you saw the victim in central park yes but i wasnt in the park i was in my home im here to explain it to you id really appreciate the coffee eve sent peabody a brief nod you knew elisa maplewood no before we go any further ive never worked with the police its not what i do and not something i aspire to she used her hands when she talked lifting them gesturing in a manner that told eve it was habitual then she gripped them together in her lap as if to hold them still i dont want to see what you see lieutenant i dont want to live with those images in my head primarily i do private consultations and parties im not a lunatic or a gloryseeker though from what louise has told me about you i imagine you think i am how do you know louise dimatto we went to school together and weve remained friendly since thanks she took the cup of coffee peabody handed her youre more open to extranormal areas detective do you have sensitives in your family ah i lets keep this about you eve interrupted all right celina sampled the coffee and smiled for the first time since shed come into the room this is wonderful and i can tell you frankly i need the jolt i had a dream uhhuh celinas smile only widened the snarkiness settles me down who knew louise also said id like you lieutenant dallas oddly enough i think shes probably right thats real nice can we stay on line here of course in the dream i saw a woman she was young attractive light brown hair i think straight hair just brushing her shoulders it looked light brown in the streetlights she came out of a building leading a little white dog on a leash she was wearing jeans and a tshirt there was a doorman and they exchanged a few words i couldnt hear i was too far away she crossed the street wide street with the little dog prancing in front of her in the dream my heart started pounding with fear i wanted to shout at her to go back to go back inside the building but i couldnt speak i watched her take the dog into the park she rubbed her arm and i thought that she was thinking she shouldve tossed on a jacket the nights are getting cooler shell go back for a jacket and maybe itll be all right but she didnt celinas hands trembled again as she lifted the cup to her lips she kept walking with the dog pulling on the leash the shadow fell over her but she didnt see she didnt know he came at her from behind i couldnt see him just shadows hed been waiting watching as id been watching oh i could feel his excitement the madness of it just as i could feel her fear his was red dark vicious red and hers silver red shadows silver light the cup rattled as she set it aside this isnt what i do this isnt what i want youre here finish it shed lost all color and her pale eyes were glassy he hit her and the little dog ran away when he kicked at it she tried to fight but he was very strong he hit her in the face knocked her down she tried to scream but he kept hitting her he kept her breathing went shallow as she rubbed a hand over her heart he kicked her and hit her and he dragged her deeper into the shadows she lost a shoe he wrapped a ribbon a cord around her neck red for power red for death tight she fought for air she fought him but he was too strong he tore at her clothes bitch whore cunt hating her hating her he raped her tightened the cord tighter and tighter until she was still until she was dead tears tracked down celinas cheeks her hands were back in her lap now twisted together like wires hed shown her what she was good for shown her who was in charge but he wasnt done he picked up her clothes put them in a small bag and he carried it and her deeper into the park hes strong very strong he takes care of himself whos more important after all her breath continued to hitch and jump her eyes stared theres a castle a castle on a lake hes king of the castle hes king of everything he slings her over his shoulder climbs down the rocks and he lays her out very carefully shell like it there maybe this time shell stay staring celina lifted her joined hands pressed them between her breasts rest in peace whore and he cuts out her eyes god god he cuts out her eyes and puts them in a little pouch and the pouch into the bag theres blood running down her face blood on his hands and he he leans down and kisses her i woke up i woke up from the dream with the chill of that bloody mouth on mine eves wrist unit beeped and had celina jolting what did you do eve asked her what did i well after i finished shaking i took a tranq i told myself it was a nightmare i know better but i wanted it to be a nightmare not a vision my gift has never taken me anywhere so dark and i was afraid i took a tranq and used it to block it out cowardly but i dont claim to be brave i dont want to be brave not about something like this she picked up her coffee again but this morning i turned on the screen i tend to avoid the news channels but i was compelled to check i had to know and i saw the report they ran her picture the pretty woman with the light brown hair they said her name i didnt want to come here most of the police are born skeptics its why you are what you are but i had to come you say you saw in this vision the victim but you didnt see her attacker i saw his essence you could say i saw a form her throat worked as she swallowed it frightened me more than ive ever been frightened in my life and frankly i wasnt going to come here i was going to try to put it away knowing that about myself made me feel small and ugly she lifted a hand toyed with a chain around her neck her nails were painted a deep and shiny red with the half moons picked out in vibrant white so i came to you because louise has spoken of you and ill try to help how do you intend to help i might see more if i had something of his something hed touched i dont know a flicker of irritation ran over her face this isnt my field its new ground for me and youre not making this any easier its not my job to make it easy ms sanchez its my job to investigate well then investigate me all you want she shot out i can only tell you what i know i know the man who did this is big or thinks of himself that way i know hes strong very strong i know hes mad and i know this woman elisa maplewood wasnt his first hes done it before he doesnt intend for her to be his last how do you know i cant tell you so that youd understand she leaned forward now urgently its what i felt from him he hated her and the hatred thrills and frightens him hate and fear hate and fear those are paramount hes hated all of them and feared all of them i dont know why i saw her saw him maybe she and i were connected in some other life or will be in one to come but im afraid im more afraid than ive ever been that im connected somehow to him i need to help you stop him because i think ill go mad myself if i dont and your fee celinas lips twisted into a tense smile im very expensive and well worth it but i would do this pro bono with one provision which is i dont want under any circumstances my name released to the media i dont want anyone to know beyond those who are absolutely necessary that im involved not only because its the sort of publicity id find irritating not only because its the sort of exposure that would generate an interest in the sort of clientele i avoid but because im afraid of him well let you know thank you for coming in on a half laugh celina got to her feet are you always so hard you tell me youre the psychic i dont read minds celinas tone took on an edge as she tossed her hair back and i dont read people without their permission i can promise you youll never get mine ive got a job to do ms sanchez ill add what youve told us and your offer into the mix well be in touch looks like louise was wrong after all i dont like you she strode out well gee she didnt have to go and hurt my feelings you were a little rough on her peabody commented you didnt believe her i didnt say that my verdict on her is reserved until we check her out run her sir she cant be licensed if shes got a sheet she cant be licensed if shes been convicted eve corrected and headed out run her thoroughly and track down louise dimatto i want to see what she has to say good thinking which of course goes without saying peabody added when eve sent her a cool look if she checks out will you use her id use a twoheaded talking monkey if it helped nail this guy but right now lets just do our tedious cop business in our tedious cop way the morgue was her first stop she could count on chief medical examiner morris to do the job give her the data she needed without a lot of bureaucratic bullshit attached she found him in autopsy with his protective gear over a steel blue threepiece suit on closer look she saw the vest was decorated with abstract line drawings of naked women morris wasnt considered a fashion plate without cause his long dark hair was drawn back in a glossy braid that hung neatly between his shoulder blades he still carried his vacation tan at the moment his sealed hands were smeared with blood and bodily fluids he hummed a jaunty tune under his breath as he worked he glanced over when eve and peabody entered and behind his goggles his long dark eyes smiled you nearly cost me twenty howd i do that i bet foster youd be in before eleven you cut it close i got hung up by a psychic whats your stand on that kind of thing i believe were all born with innate gifts skills potentials and some of those gifts are not easily explained i also believe ninety percent of those who claim to see are dirty rotten liars id up the last part a couple of percentage points but thats about my take too she looked down at the body now what do you see a very unlucky young woman who depending on your personal philosophies no longer sees anything or now sees everything severe trauma he began premortem he wailed on her dallas sexual assault with none of his fluids left behind hed sealed up for the rape strangulation cause of death the ribbons your murder weapon mutilation was postmortem clean cuts somebodys been practicing how clean surgically if hes a doctor a cutter he didnt graduate top of his class id say he used a laser scalpel and with good skill but not exceptional skill several little jags he gestured to a second pair of microgoggles want to see saying nothing eve fit on the goggles leaned over the body with morris see here here he nodded to the screen where the wounds were magnified so peabody could study them as well not precise little tremors in the hand id say and i found fluid he nicked the left eyeball a bit though well have dickhead confirm that in the lab okay i havent found any trace of him on her grass dirt a few strands of hair none of it human youll want dickhead on that some could be canine but thats a guess since she was a dog owner all the bloods hers thats too damn bad fibers a few under her nails on her person she didnt go down easy theyre off to the lab but id make them as cloth most are likely from her own clothes some are probably from his shirt as theres some sealant on them too eve straightened pulled off the goggles you see anything like this before from my lofty height dallas you see every damn thing but this precisely no you not all the elements together but her gut told her shed see them again shes clean dallas sanchez no arrests no criminal peabody studied the readout as eve drove uptown you want to hear the deal the highlights dob february madison wisconsin brrr both parents living in cancun thats more like it no sibs private schools all the way no marriage one cohab threeyear stint that ended about fourteen months ago no children registered and licensed as sensitive selfemployed how longs she had the license fifteen years totally clean on it a few civil suits brought against her all judgment in favor of defendant thats pretty normal for working psychics people get pissed that something didnt work out the way they wanted and they sue people sue the clouds if it rains on their picnic she does a lot of corporate work parties conventions private consults makes a damn good living at it about seven eight times that of your lowly homicide detective resided current soho address for twelve years also has a residence in oyster bay nice sounds legit to me uhhuh you track down louise shes at the shelter today oh eve had been hoping for the canal street clinic shed yet to make a personal appearance at the womens shelter roarke had founded we take the vics residence first if we clear enough time well go by talk to louise ive been wanting to see dachas for myself peabody commented charles says louise is really juiced about it you talk to charles sure now and then as charles a professional and licensed companion was louises guy and had been peabodys guy minus sexual fun it just struck eve as weird but the ins and outs of relationships always struck her as weird her own included any luck with the ribbon if you call the fact that more than thirty retail outlets carry it in the borough of manhattan alone luck then yeah got the manufacturers the distributors its a pretty common item dallas in craft stores party stores some of the better department stores carry it in their gift wrap department its going to be tough to find his source if it was easy everybody would be cops it was far from easy to question deann vanderlea again the woman looked exhausted ill and weighed down with worry and grief tm sorry we have to intrude its all right luther my husband hes been delayed air traffic id do better if he were here i couldnt do much worse she gestured toward chairs in the living area the lounging robe had been replaced with slouchy black pants and a white oversized shirt but her hair was still tousled her feet still bare i havent slept and im holding on by the fingernails at this point do you have any news did you find the man who did this no the investigation is ongoing and were using all resources it was too much to hope for she looked around distractedly i should make coffee or tea or something dont trouble yourself peabody spoke gently a tone eve never quite managed with the same ease if youd like something id be happy to get it for you no thank you no vonnie shes sleeping again she and zanna i dont know if she understands really understands her mothers not coming back she cried cried and cried we all did she fell asleep worn out from it and i put her back to bed zanna too i put them together so neither of them would wake alone shell need counseling mrs vanderlea yes deann nodded at peabody ive already made calls im making arrangements i want i need god luther and i we want to make arrangements for elisa for her memorial im not sure who i need to speak with about it or how soon or i need to keep doing a shudder ran through her im all right as long as i keep doing something well put someone in touch with you eve told her good ive called our lawyers as well to arrange for emergency custody of vonnie to start proceedings to make it permanent as soon as we can shes not going to be ripped away from the only home shes ever known ive spoken with elisas parents well her mother and stepfather her mother her voice broke again and she shook her head fiercely as if to deny herself the luxury theyre corning here later today so we can sit down and talk about whats best somehow elisa would be grateful that youre taking care of her daughter shed be grateful youre helping us do our job yes deann squared her shoulders at eves words i hope so what do you know about abel maplewood elisas father a difficult man in my opinion but he and elisa managed to maintain a good relationship i havent been able to reach him to tell him hes out west somewhere omaha idaho utah im so scattered she dragged both hands through her hair hes been out there a week or so visiting his brother i think probably sponging off him to be frank elisa was always slipping him money her mothers going to try to reach him today it would help if we had his whereabouts just routine ill see you get the information and i know you need to look in her rooms i put the girls in zannas room so they wont be disturbed she started to rise but peabody put a hand to her shoulder why dont you stay here try to rest we know where her rooms are they left her there record on peabody they stepped into a small cheerful sitting room done in bold colors there were a few toys scattered around and a little basket with a red cushion eve assumed was a kind of bed for the dog she moved through it and into elisas bedroom make a note to have edd check out her links her data units she went to the dresser first began to go through drawers she already had a sense of a settled content hardworking woman the search of her quarters did nothing to change that there were a number of framed photographs most of the child there were flowers and the little trinkets women enjoyed having around her wardrobe was casual with two good suits two pair of good shoes there was nothing in it that spoke of a man she checked the bedside link herself pulled up the last incoming it was from her mother a chatty affectionate conversation that included the child toward the end when the little girl ran into the room and babbled away at her gamma dallas i think i found something peabody held up another basket this was in the cupboard under the sitting room entertainment screen what is it a craft basket handwork stuff she did crafts peabody held up a skein of ribbon it wasnt red but it was the same basic type as what had killed her eve stepped forward to take it just as a little girl came into the sitting room she was tiny with curly hair so blonde it was nearly white spilling around a pretty chubbycheeked face she was knuckling her eyes thats my mommys youre not supposed to touch mommys sewing basket less she says ah ill take her peabody murmured and handing off the basket to eve crouched down to child level hi are you vonnie the child hunched her shoulders not supposed to speak to strangers thats right but its okay to talk to the police isnt it peabody took out her badge gave it to the little girl did your mommy tell you about the police they help people and catch bad guys thats right im detective peabody and this is lieutenant dallas whatsa loonat its a job peabody said without missing a beat it means shes a policeman who catches lots of bad guys okay i cant find my mommy aunt deanns sleeping can you find my mommy peabodys eyes met eves over the little girls head why dont we go find your aunt deann peabody suggested shes sleeping her voice spiked her lips began to tremble she said a bad man hurt my mommy and she cant come home i want my mommy to come home now vonnie but she shook peabody off planted herself in front of eve did a bad man hurt my mommy you should come with me now vonnie i want her to say she pointed her little finger at eve poked out her bottom lip shes the loonat jesus eve thought oh jesus she jerked her head signaling peabody to get deann then she sucked it in crouched as peabody had yes im sorry why i dont know tears were gathering in big eyes the color of bluebells did she go to the doctor eve thought of morris the steel table the cold clear lights of the morgue not exactly doctors make you better she should go to the doctor if she cant come home can you take me to her i cant shes shes in a place we cant go all i can do is find the person who hurt her so he can be punished hell have to stay in his room yeah so he cant ever hurt anyone else then she can come home eve looked over helpless and weak with relief when deann rushed in vonnie come with me baby i want mommy i know baby i know deann gathered her up snuggled her in as the child began to weep on her shoulder i fell asleep im sorry i know its hard i know its bad timing all around i need to ask you where she got the supplies in this basket her sewing basket here and there she loved to make things i went with her a few times she tried to teach me but i was hopeless there was a place on third ah god um sew what and a big supply house downtown near union square total crafts i think and the one at the sky mall im sorry she rocked back and forth on her heels stroking vonnies hair shed go in to a shop if she was passing rarely came out emptyhanded would you know where she bought this specifically eve held up the ribbon no i dont tm going to arrange for her data and communication equipment to be taken in would all her transactions and transmissions have been made and received by the ones in these rooms she might have called her mother say from one of the other links but she did all her personal work on her own unit i need to settle vonnie down go ahead eve studied the ribbon its a good lead peabody said its a lead she put the ribbon in her evidence bag lets run it down the main door of the penthouse opened as eve walked back into the living area the man who entered had a shock of gold hair a pale tired face she saw deann spring up from the couch where she was holding vonnie and with the child still in her arms leap toward him luther oh god luther deann he enfolded both of them dropped his head to his wifes shoulder its not a mistake she shook her head and let go with the weeping eve imagined shed been holding in for hours im sorry to intrude im lieutenant dallas he lifted his head yes yes i recognize you deann sweetheart take vonnie in the bedroom he kissed them both and let them go im very sorry for your loss mr vanderlea luther please what can i do is there something i should do it would help if you answered a few questions yes all right he looked in the direction his wife had gone i couldnt get here sooner it seemed to take forever to get home deann told me im still not clear elisa he went out to walk the dog and she was deann said she was raped and murdered raped and murdered right over in the park would she have told you if she was being bothered by anyone if she was concerned about anything yes he said it without hesitation if not me certainly she would have told deann they were very close we were family he sat let his head fall back were you and ms maplewood close youre asking me if elisa and i had a sexual relationship i wondered if you would and told myself not to be insulted im trying not to be i dont cheat on my wife lieutenant i certainly wouldnt take advantage of a very vulnerable woman in my employ a woman i liked very much a woman who worked very hard to give her child a good life i dont ask to offend you why do you characterize ms maplewood as vulnerable he pinched the bridge of his nose dropped his hand she was a single parent who had been misused by her husband who was dependent on me for her salary for the roof over her head come to that not that she couldnt have found other employment she knew how to work but she might not have found a situation that allowed her child to grow up in a home like this with a playmate with people who loved her vonnies welfare was first for elisa was she threatened by her exhusband he smiled humorlessly not anymore she was a strong woman whod put him where he belonged in the past do you know of anyone whod want to hurt her absolutely no one thats the gods truth i cant resign myself not fully to the fact that anyone did i know you have a job to do but so do i my wife needs me the children need me can we do whatever else needs to be done later yes i want to take this she pulled out the roll of ribbon i can give you a receipt not necessary he pushed to his feet rubbed his hands over his face ive heard youre good at your job i am good at it im depending on you he offered his hand we all are they hit crafts stores crisscrossing manhattan on the way downtown eve had no idea there was so much involved in the making of so many things easily available readymade when she expressed the opinion peabody smiled and fingered some brightly colored thread sold in hanks theres a lot of satisfaction in making something yourself picking the colors the materials the pattern individualizing it and seeing it come to life you say so a lot of craftsmen and artisans in my family goes with the whole freeager philosophy im pretty handy myself but i dont have a lot of time for it i still have the tea cozy my grandmother helped me crochet when i was ten i dont even know what that is what the tea cozy or crocheting either and i find i have no interest in finding out she studied the shelves and displays full of supplies and finished products a lot of the clerks weve talked to remember maplewood dont see a lot of men in these joints needlework remains primarily the work and or hobby of the female too bad it can be very relaxing my uncle jonas knits up a storm and claims its one of the reasons hes a healthy vital one hundred and six or seven maybe its eight eve didnt bother to respond but headed out of the shop nobody thus far remembers any man bothering elisa or any other customer for that matter nobody asking questions about her loitering around same kind of ribbon there has to be a connection he couldve bought it anywhere any time he mightve seen her in one of the stores then gone back later to buy his own you know they have these craft fairs too he couldve bumped into her at one of those i bet shed go to the fairs maybe take the kids thats a good line check it out with the vanderleas she stood on the sidewalk thumbs in front pockets fingers tapping idly on her hips as people streamed or trudged around her do that later they need some space were only a few blocks from the shelter well ask louise about the witch sensitives arent necessarily witches just as witches arent necessarily sensitives hey a glidecart wait wait eve pressed a hand to her temple stared at the sky im getting a vision its you stuffing a soy dog in your mouth i was going to go for the fruit kabob and perhaps a small walkaway salad but now youve put the damn dog in my head and i have to have it i knew that get me some fries tube of pepsi i knew that peabody replied but she was too happy with the idea shed actually get lunch to complain about paying for it chapter four it didnt look like a refuge eve thought it looked from the outside at least like a wellmaintained modest multiresident building middleincome apartments sans doorman the casual observer wouldnt note anything special about it even if he bothered to look and that eve reminded herself was precisely the point the women and children who fled here didnt want anyone to notice but if you were a cop youd probably note and approve of the firstrate security fullscan cams cleverly disguised in the simple trims and moldings privacy screens activated at all windows if you were a cop and knew roarke you could be certain there were motion pads at every access with topoftheline alarms entree would require palm plate identification keypad code and or clearance from inside there would be twentyfourhour security probably human and droid and you could bet your ass the entire place would lock down like a vault at any attempt to break in not just a refuge but a fortress dochas gaelic for hope was as safe probably safer due to its anonymity as the white house if shed known such places existed would she have fled to one instead of wandering the streets of dallas a child broken traumatized and lost no fear would have sent her running away from hope even now knowing better she felt uneasy stepping up to the door alleys were easier she thought because you knew there were rats in the dark you expected them but she reached up to ring the bell before she could signal the door opened dr louise dimatto that blond bundle of energy greeted them she wore a pale blue lab coat over a simple black shirt and trousers two tiny gold hoops glinted in her left ear with a third in the right there were no rings on her competent fingers and a plain serviceable wrist unit sat on her left hand nothing about her screamed money though she came from big green seas of it she was pretty as a strawberry parfait classy as a crystal flute of champagne and a born reformer who lived to fight in the trenches about damn time she grabbed eves hand and pulled her inside i was beginning to think id have to call nineoneone to get you down here hi peabody boy dont you look great peabody beamed thanks after considerable experimentation shed found what she liked to think of as her detective look with simple lines interesting colors and matching air sneaks or skids we appreciate you making time eve began times constantly being made my goal is to make enough so theres twentysix hours per day that should be just about nght how about a tour we need come on she kept eves hand trapped in hers let me show off a little remodeling and rehab are finally complete though roarkes given me carte blanche for additional decorating or equipment the man is now my god yeah he likes that part louise laughed and hooked her arms through eves on one side and peabodys on the other i dont have to tell you the security is flawless no security is flawless dont be a cop she complained and gave eve a little hip check we have common rooms down here kitchen and the foods great dining area library a playroom and what we call the family room eve could already hear the chatter as louise took them down a hallway gesturing to rooms women and children chatter eve thought the sort that always made her feel awkward and edgy it smelled like girls too mostly though she caught sight of what she thought were a couple of young boys loping off toward what was likely the kitchen area there were scents of polish and flowers and what she thought might be hair products tones of lemon and vanilla and the hard candy smell she always associated with groups of females there was a lot of color in the place as well as a lot of room cheerful color comfortable furniture spots for sitting alone spots for conversation she saw immediately that the family room was the popular spot there were about a dozen women of various ages and races gathered there sitting on sofas on the floor with the kids who were also of various ages and races they were talking or sitting in silence watching the entertainment screen or juggling babies on their laps she wondered why people were forever bouncing babies when it seemed from her wary observation that the perpetual motion only caused whatever was in their digestive systems to come spewing out of either end not all the babies appeared to appreciate it either one of them was burbling in what might have been contentment but two others were making sounds very reminiscent of emergency vehicles on the run it didnt seem to bother anyone particularly certainly not the field of kids on the floor playing or bickering over their chosen activities ladies conversation died off as the women looked toward the doorway children shut up like clams babies continued to wail or burble id like to introduce you to lieutenant dallas and detective peabody in the moments pause eve saw the reaction to the thought of cops the drawing into self the nervous flicker of eyes the gathering closer of children the abuser might be the enemy and louise the ally but cops eve thought were the unknown and could fall into either camp lieutenant dallas is roarkes wife and this is her first visit there was relief for some the easing of tension in faces and bodies even tentative smiles and for others the suspicion remained it wasnt just a mix of ages and races there was also a mix of injuries fresh bruises fading ones mending bones mending lives she knew their apprehension felt it herself and hated that while louise looked at her expectantly her skin was going cold and her throat shutting down its a nice place youve got here she managed its a miracle the woman who spoke stood up she limped slightly as she crossed the room eve pegged her at around forty and from the looks of her face shed taken a nasty and recent beating she held out a hand to eve thank you she didnt want to take the hand offered didnt want the connection but there was no choice as the woman looked at her with expectation and horribly with gratitude i didnt do anything youre roarkes wife if id had the courage to come to a place like this to go to the police to look for help before now my daughter wouldnt be hurt she turned slightly gestured toward a girl with dark curly hair and a skincast on her right arm come say hello to lieutenant dallas abra the girl obeyed and though she pressed her body against her mothers legs she stared curiously up at eve the police stop people from hurting you maybe yeah they try to my daddy hurt me so we had to go away there would be a horrible snapping sound when the bone broke a terrible and bright pain a flood of greasy nausea a red haze of shock over the eyes eve felt it all again as she stood there staring down at the girl she wanted to step back far far back away from it youre okay now her voice sounded thin and distant under the roaring in her ears he hurts my mama he gets mad and he hurts her but this time i didnt hide in my room like she said and he hurt me too he broke her arm tears flooded the womans bruised eyes it took that to wake me up you dont blame yourself marly louise said gently we can stay here with dr louise and nobody hurts you and nobody yells or throws things its a good place peabody hunkered down as much to take the focus off eve as to speak to the child her lieutenant looked ill i bet theres lots to do we have chores and teachers you have to do your chores and go to school then you can play theres a lady upstairs and shes having a baby is that so peabody glanced back at louise now firststage labor we have full obstetric and natal facilities and a midwife on staff fulltime try to keep off that leg as much as possible for another twentyfour marly i will its better a lot better everything is we really need to speak with you louise all right well just louise trailed off as she got a look at eves face are you okay fine im fine a little pressed for that time thats all well head up to my office deliberately she laid her fingers on eves wrist as they walked back toward the stairs your skins clammy she murmured pulse is rapid and thready and youve gone pale let me take you into exam tm just tired she eased away were running on two hours sleep i dont need a doctor i need an interview okay all right but you dont get the interview unless you down a protein booster there was activity on the second floor as well voices behind closed doors and weeping therapy sessions louise explained sometimes they can get intense moira a moment two women were standing outside of what eve assumed was another therapy room or office one turned and her gaze skipped over louise and fastened on eve she murmured something to her companion gave her a long hug then started down the hall eve knew who she was moira obannion formerly of dublin the woman whod known roarkes mother and after more than thirty years had told him that what hed known of his beginnings was a lie based on murder sickness curdled in eves belly moira obannion eve dallas delia peabody im so glad to meet you i hope roarke is well hes good hes fine sweat began to slide like cold grease down her spine moiras one of our treasures i stole her moira laughed recruited well say though dragooned wouldnt be far off louise is fierce youre having the tour not exactly its not a social call ah i should let you get to business then hows jana doing four centimeters dilated thirty percent effaced last check shes got a ways to go let me know when shes ready will you were all excited about the new baby moira smiled at peabody its good to meet you both and i hope you wont be strangers my very best to roarke she said to eve and stepped out of their way moiras brilliant louise said as she led the way to the next level shes making a big difference here ive been able to ha dragoon some of the best therapists doctors psychiatrists and counselors in the city i bless the day you stomped into my clinic downtown dallas it was the start of the twisty path that led me here she opened a door gestured them inside not to mention leading me to charles briskly she walked to a cabinet and opened it to reveal a minifridgie which reminds me were setting up that dinner party i keep trying to pull off night after tomorrow charless place its cozier than mine eight oclock suit you and mcnab peabody sure sounds like fun ive cleared it with roarke she handed both eve and peabody a bottled protein booster shed have preferred icecold water and an open window so she could lean out just breathe were in the middle of an investigation understood doctors and cops learn to be flexible and live with canceled social engagements barring emergencies well expect you now sit drink your protein lemon flavored because it was quicker than arguing and she could use a boost eve opened the bottle and chugged the office was a big step up from the one louise kept at her clinic roomier more fancily furnished efficient as youd expect but with style swankier digs here eve commented roarke insisted and i confess he didnt have to twist my arm one of the elements were aiming for here is comfort hominess we want these women these kids to feel at ease youve done a good job peabody sat and savored her drink it feels like a home thanks cocking her head louise studied eve well you look better colors back thanks doc eve dumped the empty container in the recycler slot so celina sanchez ah celina fascinating woman ive known her for years we went to school together for a couple of years her familys loaded like mine very very conservative like mine shes the black sheep like me so naturally enough were friends why are you looking into her she paid me a visit this morning claims shes a psychic she is louise frowned and got herself a bottle of fizzy water a very gifted sensitive who practices professionally which is why shes the black sheep her family disapproves of and is embarrassed by her work as i said very conservative why did she come to see you celina specializes in private consult and party work she claims she witnessed a murder my god is she all right she wasnt there she had a vision oh that mustve been horrible for her so you buy it just like eve snapped her fingers if celina came to see you told you shed seen a murder she saw one thoughtfully louise sipped at her water she doesnt hide her gift but she keeps it all very professional and well you could say surface define surface eve prompted she enjoys what she does what she has and shes geared it toward entertaining more than counseling lets say she keeps it light ive never known her to get involved with anything like this who was killed a woman was raped strangled and mutilated in central park last night i heard about that louise sat behind a glossy and feminine desk there werent a lot of details your case yeah celina had a lot of the details that werent released youre vouching for her i am yes id believe her no question can she help yet to be determined what do you know about her on a personal front louise lifted the water bottle again and took her time drinking i dont like dishing about my friends dallas im a cop i dont dish louise blew out a breath well as i said shes from a wealthy conservative family who doesnt approve of her it takes considerable strength of character to buck your family she toasted herself drank her fathers side is aristocratic mexico though he moved to wisconsin for several years for some business or other they live in mexico now and celina bolted for new york made it her place while we were still in college as much id say because she wanted the city as because this particular city was several thousand miles from her family yet on the same continent she shrugged considered id say shes a straightforward goaloriented type she studied parapsychology in college and related subjects she wanted to know everything she could about her gift for a sensitive shes a logical somewhat linear woman shes loyal it takes loyalty to keep friends for a decade or so ethical ive never known her to intrude psychically or to use her talent to exploit did she know the woman who was killed not she said in this particular life hmm i remember having discussions with her about connections past present to come not your style i know but a valid and accepted theory even in some scientific circles what about personal relationships other than friendships you mean she was involved with someone for a few years songwriter musician lovely man they broke it off a while ago around a year ago she shrugged too bad i liked him name lucas grande reasonably successful hes had a number of songs published and produced and works regularly as a session musician he scores vids too whyd they split that feels like dish how does this relate everything relates until i know it doesnt relate basically things cooled off between them they just werent happy together anymore so they went their separate ways it was mutual ive never heard celina trash him any more than a woman does when she splits with a guy i dont see her all that often not enough time but from what i could see she handled it well enough they loved each other then they didnt they moved on did she ever mention elisa maplewood to you thats the woman who was killed no i never heard the name before this morning on the news luther or deann vanderlea antiques louises eyebrows lifted in interest i know them a little i think one of my uncles plays golf with luthers father something like that its possible that celina knows them socially why victim worked for them domestic ah youre reaching dallas yeah but you never know just what youll grab out there you must be really proud peabody said as they got back into the car huh place like that she looked back toward dochas what roarkes done here yeah he puts his money where a lot of people cant even bother to put their mouths as eve started to pull out peabody laid a hand on her arm what were partners now right as you never fail to remind me were friends dubious eve tapped her fingers on the wheel is this going to get sloppy people have private stuff theyre entitled but friends and partners are entitled to unload on friends and partners you didnt want to go in there it shouldnt show eve thought it wasnt allowed to show i went in there because youre aces at doing things you dont want things other people would walk away from im just saying that if something gets over you you can unload thats all and it wouldnt go beyond me you see me doing anything that interferes with the job no i only some people have personal stuff that cant be cleared up with a nice little hearttoheart and icecream sundaes she whipped away from the curb cut off a cab and punched it through a yellow thats why its personal okay and if youre going to sulk because im not crying on your shoulder you can just suck it up she swerved down a side street without a thought to destination thats what cops do they suck it up do the job and dont go around looking for somebody to pat their head and say there there i dont need you to play the understanding friend so i can dump my guts all over the floor for your perusal so just shit shit fuck she yanked the wheel doubleparked and ignoring the furious blasts of horns slapped on the on duty light out of line out of orbit way out none of that was called for none of it forget it im tired she said staring out the windshield beyond protein booster tired and im edgy and i just cant get into all the whys of it i just cant its okay dallas im not sulking im not pushing no youre not hadnt been eve admitted and youre not taking a punch at me even when i deserve it youd hit me back and you hit harder with a short laugh eve rubbed her hands over her face then made herself shift in the seat meet peabodys gaze youre my partner and youre my friend youre good in both areas ive got the shrinks would call them issues i have to deal with them if you observe something in my behavior that affects an investigation i expect you to call me on it otherwise ive got to ask you as my partner and my friend to leave it alone okay okay lets get moving before theres a riot and they drag us out of the car and stomp us to death on the street im for that she drove the next block in silence im going to drop you off at home eve said we need sleep does that mean youre going home to work on the case alone no eve smiled a little im going to take my meeting with mira then go home and crash for a while ill work some tonight if you want to do the same you could push at the ribbons some more and verify abel maplewoods whereabouts on the night of can do what are we going to do about sanchez im going to sleep on it since her head was messed up eve figured it was a really good time to see a shrink or a really bad time either way it wasnt smart to miss or cancel an appointment with mira mira would take it fine but her admin would punish you so instead of lying facedown on some flat surface catching some much needed sleep she was sitting in one of miras cozy scoop chairs accepting a cup of tea she didnt want mira had a soft pretty face surrounded by soft pretty hair the color of natural mink she enjoyed attractive monochromatic suits todays was the green shade of good pistachio ice cream she wore a trio of beaded necklaces with it in a darker shade of green her eyes were the same blue as her scoop chairs and while invariably kind rarely missed a detail youre exhausted havent you slept at all couple hours i drank a booster all well and good sleep is better next on my list tell me about him angry and violent with that anger and violence targeted toward women i dont believe his use of the red ribbon was accidental scarlet the brand for whores theres a duality in his view on women whores to be used and abused yes but the pose the location indicate an awe of them a religious pose a castle madonna queen whore he chooses his symbols why maplewood specifically you believe she was specifically targeted this wasnt random he lay in wait im sure of it she was alone and unprotected she had a child but no husband this may play a part she may also represent by appearance by lifestyle by circumstances the female in his life who influenced him sexual homicide with mutilation most often occurs when the perpetrator was abused or humiliated or betrayed in some fashion by a strong female figure mother sister teacher spouse or lover its unlikely he has or has been able to maintain a longterm healthy intimate relationship with a woman and sometimes theyre just fucking murdering bastards yes mira calmly sipped her tea sometimes but there is a root eve theres always a root whether real or fantasized rape is about power more than its about violence certainly more than its about sex penetration by force for your own gratification while causing fear and pain not just forcing yourself on another person but into them murder takes that power to another level the ultimate control over another human being the method strangulation is very personal very intimate i think he got off on it he strangled her facetoface he watched her die id agree we cant know if he ejaculated as there was no semen but i dont believe hes impotent he may be so without the violence but if hed been unable to orgasm we would see more injuries preand postmortem cutting out her eyes is pretty injurious a symbol again he enjoys symbols he blinded her she has no power against him as she cant see him or is allowed to see him only in a manner he directs this is a powerful symbol to him and possibly the most important he took her eyes away from her not destroying them which would have been quicker and easier and more violent but with some care eyes are important to him they have meaning shed had blue eyes eve thought dark bluebell eyes like her daughter maybe he fixes them could be an eye doctor a tech a consultant mira shook her head td be surprised if he could work with treat or interact with women on a daytoday basis its most likely he lives alone works at a job where he can work alone or primarily with men hes organized but hes also a risk taker and hes proud he not only attacked and killed in a public place but he left her there displayed look at my work and be afraid yes if elisa maplewood was symbolic rather than target specific his work isnt finished hes organized enough to have his next victim in mind already hed study her habits her routines and strategize the best way to take her her father looked like a possibility for about ten seconds hes got a sheet but reports are hes out of town verifying that but it doesnt feel like it was personal on that level because of the symbols mira nodded yes i agree unless you find those symbols relate between father and daughter probabilities would be he didnt know maplewood on that personal a level but only what she symbolized to him im going to run probabilities were tracking down the ribbon its a good lead but she brooded what do you think of psychics well as i have a daughter whos a sensitive oh yeah right she brooded a moment more while mira waited patiently i had a visit this morning she began and told her of celina do you have any reason to doubt she was telling the truth other than a reluctance to believe in woowoo no shes checking out its a little annoying to admit that shes the best lead ive got youll speak with her again yeah personal prejudices and reluctance dont belong on the job if shes a lead ill use her there was a time you were nearly as reluctant to consult with me eve flicked a glance up shrugged maybe for the same reasons you always saw too damn much to suit me maybe i still do you not only look exhausted eve you look sad there was a time shed have shrugged that off as well and walked out but she and mira had come a long way turns out louise dimatto knows the psychic old pals i needed to talk to her about it shes doing duty at dochas today ah thats a shrink trick ah she set the tea aside rising to pace the office to jingle loose credits in her pockets and it works its an amazing thing roarkes done and only more amazing to me when you get down to the reasons he did it some for himself sure seeing as he was kicked around plenty as a kid some for me more for me because of what i went through but altogether more for us because of who and what we are now together jesus i love him more than it shouldnt be possible to feel this way about someone and still knowing what hed done there knowing it was important to him i have some part in it ive avoided going there do you think he doesnt understand why another thing that shouldnt be possible is the way he understands me its a good place dr mira and the name is right on target and i was sick the whole time i was there sick in my heart in my gut sick and shaky and scared i wanted to walk out away from those women with their bruises those kids with their helpless faces one of them had a broken arm one of the kids a girl about six im not good with kids ages eve i could feel the bone snap could hear it and it took everything not to just go down to my knees and scream and youre ashamed of that shame she wasnt sure was it shame she felt or anger or some nasty brew of both youve got to get over it sometime why stunned eve turned back stared well because overcoming and getting over are two very different things mira spoke briskly now because she wanted to get up to go over to draw eve into a hug that wouldnt be appropriate or understood yes you should strive to overcome to survive have a life to be happy to be productive youve done all that and a great deal more but no youre not required to get over it to get over being beaten and abused and raped and tortured you ask more of yourself eve than you ask of anyone else in the world it was a good place and in this good place you saw a child someone had tried to break it hurt you but you didnt walk away she sighed sat again peabody caught a drift when were out she does the pal thing offers to listen if i need to dump so how do i respond to that snap her head off i imagine mira said with a little smile yeah i ream her slap her up and down mindyourownbusiness kind of shit stuff just jumping out of my mouth youll apologize already did you work together as a unit and you have a friendship outside of the job you may want to consider telling her at least some of it i dont see what good it would do either one of us mira only smiled well something to think about go home eve get some sleep chapter five since all eve wanted was a few hours of oblivion miras advice wasnt hard to take she pulled through the gates of home summer still reigned here with perfect summer flowers in deep summer colors with shimmering green grass that seemed to stretch for miles and the tall leafy trees that spread cool shade the house with its towers and peaks and graceful terraces lorded over them part castle part fortress all home the best part of it was there was a bed inside with her name on it she left the car at the front steps and realizing shed neglected to call requisitions and bitch she gave the door an irritated boot when she got out then she forgot it and dragged up the steps and into the house he was lurking summerset was the universal champion of lurk he stood in the foyer bony in black his snooty nose in the air and the fat cat at his feet in eves opinion roarkes majordomo never missed the chance to give her the needle youre earlier than expected and appear to have gotten through the day without destroying any article of clothing i must note this event down on my calendar bitch when im late bitch when im early you could go pro on the bitching circuit your current offensive mode of transportation has not been properly garaged your current offensive face hasnt yet been beaten to a pulp by my fists either mark that on your calendar creepshow he had a couple more in his pocket but decided to save them since there were circles of exhaustion under her eyes and she was already heading up the steps hopefully to bed he glanced down at the cat that should do for the moment he wagged a finger toward the stairs and galahad trotted up them she thought about going to her office first putting her notes and thoughts into a report maybe checking in with the lab running some probabilities but her feet took her straight to the bedroom where the cat streaked in just behind her he bolted up the stairs of the platform took a running leap and landed with considerable grace for a tub of lard on the bed and sat dualcolored eyes narrowed on eves face yeah good idea im right behind you she stripped off her jacket tossed it on the sofa in the sitting area peeled off her weapon harness and dumped it on the jacket then she sat on the arm pried off her boots and decided that was good enough she didnt leap on the bed it was more of a crawl stretching out on her stomach ignoring the cat who slithered onto her butt and circled twice before settling she ordered herself not to think and dropped into sleep like a stone down a well she felt the dream coming felt it oozing out of her system like blood from a wound in sleep she twitched and her hands balled into fists but she couldnt fight it off and it took her took her back it wasnt the room in dallas the place she feared most it was dark without the wash of dingy red light without the icy air instead there were shadows and a clammy kind of heat the heavy smell of flowers going to rot she could hear voices but couldnt make out the words she heard weeping but couldnt locate the source it seemed like a maze sharp corners dead ends a hundred doors all closed and locked she couldnt find her way out or in her heart was thundering in her chest she knew there was something else in the dark something close behind her something horrible waiting to strike she should turn and fight it was always better to stand and fight to face down what came after you and beat it back but she was afraid so afraid and ran instead it laughed low her hand shook when she reached for her weapon shook so hard she could barely draw it she would kill it if it touched her she would kill it but she kept running something stepped out of the shadows and on a breathy scream she stumbled back and fell to her knees sobs clogged her throat as she brought her weapon up sweaty finger poised to fire and saw it was a child he broke my arm the little girl abra held her arm close to her body my daddy broke my arm why did you let him hurt me i didnt it wasnt me i didnt know it hurts i know im sorry youre supposed to make it stop more shadows moved circling her taking form she saw where she was now in the room in the house called hope the room full of bruised and battered women of sadeyed broken children they stared at her and their voices filled her head he cut me he raped me he burned me look look at my face i used to be pretty where were you when he threw me down the stairs why didnt you come when i was screaming i cant i cant elisa maplewood blind and bloody stepped closer he took my eyes why didnt you help me i am i will its too late hes already here alarms rang lights flashed the women the children stepped back stood like a jury at sentencing the little girl called abra shook her head you re supposed to protect us but you cant he strolled in the big terrifying smile on his face the vile and vicious gleam in his eyes her father take a look at them little girl plenty of them and theres always more bitches just beg for it so whats a man to do stay away from me on her knees she lifted the weapon again but her hands shook everything shook stay away from them thats no way to talk to your father little girl he swung out smashing her face with the back of his hand in a blow that sent her sprawling onto her back the women began to hum like bees trapped in a hive gotta teach you a lesson dont i you never learn ill kill you i killed you before did you he grinned and shed have sworn his teeth were fangs then ill just have to return the favor daddys home you worthless little cunt stay back stay away when she lifted her weapon it was only a small knife held in a childs trembling hand no no please no she tried to crawl away away from him away from the women he reached down as casually as a man might reach for an apple in a bowl and snapped her arm she screamed a childs terrified and baffled scream as the whitehot pain flashed and burned theres always more of them theres always more of us and he fell on her eve wake up you wake up now her face was bone white and her body had gone rigid when hed rolled her over to gather her in an instant before shed screamed an icy tongue of panic licked up roarkes spine her eyes were wide open blind with shock and pain he wasnt completely sure she was breathing i said wake up her body arched and she sucked in air like a drowning woman my arm he broke my arm he broke my arm no its a dream oh baby its a dream come back now he trembled as much as she did as he rocked her catching a movement he snapped his head up as summerset rushed in no ive got her is she injured he shook his head stroked her hair as she wept against him nightmare a bad one ill take care of her summerset stepped back then stopped at the door get a soother in her whatever it takes nodding roarke waited until summerset went out shut the door behind him youre all right now im right here they were all there all around me in the dark its not dark now ive got the lights on do you want them brighter she shook her head burrowed into him i didnt help them i didnt stop him when he came in like he always comes in her arm was broken the little girls arm was broken just like mine and he broke mine again i felt it he didnt roarke kissed the top of her head eased her back even when she tried to cling look here now eve look here your arms fine you see though she tried to cradle it against her body he drew it out ran his hand gently from wrist to shoulder its not broken it was a dream it was so real i felt she bent her arm at the elbow stared at it echoes of that phantom pain still rolled through her i felt it i know hadnt he heard her scream hadnt he seen the glassy shock in her eyes he kissed her hand her wrist her elbow i know lie back down now im okay would be i just need to sit here a minute she looked down as the cat wormed his way between them her hand wasnt quite steady when she stroked along his back guess i scared the shit out of him not enough to make him bolt he was with you banging his head against your shoulder doing what he could id say to wake you my hero a tear plopped on her hand but she was beyond being embarrassed by it i guess he rates some fancy fish eggs or something she breathed deep looked up into roarkes eyes you too youre having a soother even as she opened her mouth to argue he cupped her chin in his hand dont argue and for christs sake dont make me pour it in you well compromise this time and split one i damn well need it as much as you or close to it she could see it now he was so pale his eyes were like blue fire against the white of his skin okay deal he got up went over to the autochef and ordered two short glasses when he came back she took the one he handed her then switched them just in case you got sneaky and tranqed mine i dont want to go out again fair enough he tapped his glass to hers then downed his portion after shed done the same he set both glasses aside i might point out that i know you every suspicious and cynical inch and if id tranqed one of the glasses id have held onto it knowing full well youd switch them she opened her mouth shut it again damn it but i didnt he leaned forward kissed her nose deals a deal scared you sorry he took her hand again just held onto it summerset said you got home a bit before five yeah i guess needed the zees she glanced toward the window mustve gotten some its going dark what time is it nearly nine he knew she wouldnt sleep again not now hed have preferred it if she would if he could just lie beside her holding her close while they both slept off the dregs of the nightmare you could use a meal he decided and so could i want to have it in here that works for me i could use something else first what do you want she laid her hands on his face eased up to her knees to press her lips to his youre better than a soother you make me feel clean and whole and strong she slid her fingers into his hair when his arms came around her you make me remember and you help me forget be with me i always am he kissed her temples her cheeks her lips i always will be she slid into him swaying a little as they knelt on the wide bed in the half light the storm had passed but something inside her still quaked from it he would calm that he would make it right again she turned her head her lips brushing his throat as she sought the taste the scent of mate and finding it she sighed he understood her needs what she sought from him sought to give him slow tender thoughtful love there were aftershocks trembling inside him yet but she would quell them his lips skimmed a line along her jaw found hers then sank dreamily in deep and quiet and she his strong troubled woman melted against him he held her there so they drifted together into the peace mouth to mouth heart to heart this time he knew the flutter of her pulse signaled contentment when he eased her back so their eyes met she smiled watching her he unbuttoned her shirt felt her hands steady again loosen his he slid it off her shoulders so he could trace his fingers over her skin pale and smooth surprisingly delicate over such disciplined strength a low sound of pleasure hummed in her throat as she spread her hands over his chest then she leaned down pressed her lips to his ear mine she said it shook him down to the soul taking her hands in his he turned them palms up and laid his lips in the center of each mine they slid down together to lie facing one another to touch to explore as if it were the first time long and lazy caresses that both stirred and soothed unhurried passion that lit low fires she was warm now and sure his lips brushed her breast and made her sigh again closing her eyes she floated on the bliss she stroked his hair all that glorious black silk his back hard strength she heard him murmur aghra my love and thought yes i am thank god and arched to offer him more arousal was a long slow climb up gradually up until sighs became moans and pleasure became a quiver of anticipation when he brought her to peak it was like being lifted up on the rise of a warm blue wave fill me she drew his head down until their mouths met again fill me he could see her eyes open now dark and drenched so he slipped inside her was surrounded welcomed then enfolded they moved together a gentle rise and fall in an intimacy so complete it squeezed his heart he laid his lips on hers again would have sworn he breathed her soul and when she spoke his name the tenderness shattered him she watched the night sky through the window over the bed it was all so still she could almost believe there wasnt a world out there that there was nothing beyond this room this bed this man maybe that was one of the purposes of sex to isolate you for a little while from everything but yourself and your lover to allow you to focus in on your body its needs the gratification that was physical and if you were lucky in that lover emotional as well without those pockets of solitude and sensation you might just go mad shed used sex before roarke for the release the physical snap but shed never known or understood the intimacy of the act before him the complete surrender of self to another shed never experienced the emotional peace that followed until hed loved her i have things to say to you she said all right she shook her head in a little while if she stayed like this much longer saturated with him shed forget there was a world out there one shed sworn to protect ive got to get up dont much want to but i have to youre going to eat she had to smile he hadnt finished taking care of her she thought he never finished im going to eat in fact ill get dinner for both of us he lifted his head and those eyes those brilliant blue eyes narrowed thoughtfully will you hey pal i can work a stupid autochef as well as the next guy she gave him a light slap on the ass roll over he complied was it the sex or the soother was what the sex or the soother that put you in a domestic frame of mind a smart mouth wont get you dinner smart mouth or not he figured he was probably getting pizza she hooked a robe out of her closet then while he watched her with some surprise took one out of his and brought it to him and a smart mouth isnt always verbal i can see sarcastic thoughts in your head why dont i shut up and get us some wine why dont you he left her contemplating the autochef and opened the panel to the wine rack he assumed she needed to keep busy keep the nightmare at bay thinking pizza he selected a bottle of chianti opened it and set it aside to breathe youll be working tonight yeah i have to do some stuff ive got miras profile and i want to walk through that again put together a progress report i havent done any probabilities yet either plus i have to scan the eye banks transplant facilities that sort of thing a time waster since he didnt take them to sell them but its got to be eliminated she brought two plates over to the sitting area set them down on the table whatve you got there he asked her food what does it look like he cocked his head it doesnt look like pizza my culinary programming skills run beyond pizza shed chosen chicken sauteed in wine and rosemary with wild rice and asparagus well fancy that he murmured flummoxed ive opened entirely the wrong wine well live with it she went back for a basket of bread lets eat no this wont do he opened the wine rack again found a bottle of pouillyfuisse in the chilled section he opened it brought bottle and glasses to the table looks lovely thanks she sampled a bite pretty good doesnt quite measure up to the soy fries i had at lunch but its not bad when he winced as shed intended she laughed hopefully youll be able to choke down whatever charles and louise serve when we go to dinner she stabbed more chicken dont you think its weird you know charles and louise peabody and mcnab all having a cozy dinner at charless place im pretty sure the last time the only time mcnab was ever over there was when he and charles punched each other out i doubt itll come to that again but if it does youll be there to break it up and not weird darling no people find each other charles and our peabody were and are friends yeah but mcnab thinks they did the mattress rhumba whatever he thinks he knows theyre not dancing now i still say its going to be weird a few awkward moments perhaps charles and louise love each other yeah about that how can they cruise along this way hes out there boinking other women professionally then boinking her for love whats with that an amused smile curving his lips roarke sipped his wine youre such a moral creature lieutenant yeah wed see how openminded and sophisticated you are if i decided to turn in my badge and become a licensed companion id have a hard time working up a client list because youd smash all their faces in he merely inclined his head in agreement but you werent an lc when i met and fell for you were you a cop and that took some considerable adjusting on my part guess it did and that she thought was as good a segue as she could ask for considering what she wanted to say i know it did but i think under all that youd already done considerable adjusting meaning you werent just after the main chance however you could get it i dont think you ever were in my misspent youth lieutenant youd have hunted me down like a dog not that youd have caught me but youd have tried if id been hunting she trailed off waved it away not where i was going she picked up her wine took a long sip set it down i went to dochas today oh his gaze sharpened on her face i wish youd contacted me id have made time to go with you it was work related i needed to talk to louise about this psychic chick and louise was there today he waited but she said nothing what did you think i think she set down her fork clasped her hands together in her lap i love you more than i can say i dont have the words to tell you how much how much i love you how proud i am of you for what youre doing there i was trying to come up with them but i cant moved he reached across waited until she unclasped her hands to take his whats being done there wouldnt be if you werent part of it part of me yes it would thats the thing maybe you did it sooner because of me because of us but it was in you to do it it always was im sorry i havent gone before doesnt matter i was afraid to some part of me i didnt want to look at was afraid to go there it hurt to go she released his hand she had to do this say this on her own to see those women those kids to feel that fear even more to feel the hope even more than that it brought it back eve no you just listen there was this girl you know sometimes i think fate just slaps something down in front of you and makes you deal her arm was in a skincast her father had broken it oh christ she talked to me i talked back i cant remember exactly my head was buzzing and my stomach was clenched i was afraid id be sick right there or just fucking pass out but i didnt i got through it you dont ever have to go back again she shook her head just wait i dropped peabody at home saw mira came here i needed sleep i thought i would just sleep but it caught up with me it was bad you know it was bad but you dont know that in the nightmare i was back there in the shelter with all those battered women all those broken kids and theyre asking me why i didnt stop it why i let it happen she held up a hand so he wouldnt interrupt though she saw her own pain reflected on his face he was there i knew hed come he said thered always be more more of him more of them i couldnt stop it when he reached for me i wasnt me anymore i mean not who i am now i was a kid he broke my arm just like before and he raped me just like before she had to pause had to wet her throat with wine but heres the thing i killed him just like before and ill keep killing him as long as it takes because hes right theres always more of them the brutal and the battered theres always more and i cant stop it all but i can damn well do the job and stop some of it i have to she let out a breath i can go back there i want to go back there because i know when i do i wont be scared or sick or if i am it wont be as much as bad ill go there because i can see what youve done what youre doing is another way to stop it her arm was broken but itll heal so will she because youve given her a chance it took him a moment a long moment before he could speak you are the most amazing woman ive ever known yeah she gave his hand a squeeze were a hell of a pair chapter six eve took a detour to edd it was always a culture shock for her to walk into a division where cops dressed like partyoers or weekend loafers lots of airboots and neon hues and as many people walking or trotting around talking on headsets as manning cubes and desks music blatted out and she actually saw a guy dancing or she assumed it was dancing while he worked with a handheld and portascreen she made tracks through the bull pen and directly into captain ryan feeneys office where she expected to find sanity she lost the power of speech when she saw him the reliable feeney with his fading vacation tan his wiry ginger hair threaded with gray his face was comfortably creased and droopy but instead of one of the rumpled shirts he habitually wore he was decked out in a stiff and spotless one the color of raspberry sherbet and he had on a tie a tie the closest she could come to describing the color was what you might get if you electrocuted grass jesus christ feeney whatre you wearing the look he sent her was that of a man bearing up under a hideous emotional weight wife said i needed to start wearing color bought this getup then hung over me nagged my ears off until i put it on you look you look like a manager for street lcs tell me look at these pants he shot out a leg so eve was treated to the sight of that skinny limb wrapped in modified skinpants in the same electric shade as the tie god im sorry boys out there think i look iced whatre you going to do i dont honestly know tell me youve got a case for me something thats going to take me out in the field where i can get bloody he lifted his fists a boxers pose wife cant bitch if these glad rags get ruined on the job ive got a case but ive got no fieldwork in the e area wish i could help you out cant you at least take that noose off he tugged at the tie you dont know the wife like i do shell call shell be doing a damn spotcheck on me all through shift to make sure im suited up its got a jacket dallas you poor bastard ah well he let out a heavy sigh whatre you doing in my world the case sexual homicide with mutilation central park heard you caught that one were doing the standard on the links and comps you need more not exactly can i close this she gestured toward his door got the nod when shed shut it she went over to sit on the corner of his desk whats your stand on consulting with psychics on the job he pulled his nose not much call for it in my division when i worked homicide wed get calls now and then from people claiming they had visions or information from the spirit world you know that yeah still do we waste time and manpower following them up then go along and investigate with our measly five senses got some genuines out there he pushed away from the desk to program for coffee most departments these days have a sensitive attached as civilian consultant more than a few carry badges too yeah well we were partnered up for a long time he handed her a mug of coffee those were the days we never used a sensitive no well you use what you use when the tool fits ive got one claims she saw the central park murder in a dream feeney sipped contemplatively you check her out yeah and she jibes licensed and registered got a reference from louise dimatto docs not an asshole no shes not if you were me would you bring her in he lifted a shoulder you know the answer to that she frowned into her coffee you use what you use yeah i know i guess i just wanted to hear it from somebody whos got his feet planted thanks she set the nearly untouched coffee down she was getting spoiled she thought she was finding it easier and easier to walk away from the stuff if it wasnt real coffee thanks no sweat let me know if you need somebody to dig in get his hands and personal attire dirty will do ah you know somebody could spill coffee on that getup wouldnt be your fault he sent her a pitying look shed know aint nobody more psychic than a wife she rounded up peabody if she was going to consult with a psychic she was going to run the possibility by her commander first whitney listened as she gave her oral to back up the data shed already sent to his attention he didnt interrupt but sat quiet at his desk a big man with dark skin and closecropped silvering hair years of riding a desk hadnt wiped the cop out of him it reached right down to the bone the only change in his wide sober face was a quick lift of eyebrows when she mentioned celina sanchez when her report was complete he nodded then eased back psychic consultant not your usual style lieutenant no sir the media liaison is handling the public information front for now well continue to omit the exact nature of the mutilation as well as the description of the murder weapon if you decide to consult a sensitive that data will also be omitted shes firm on that commander if i consult with her i wouldnt feel comfortable giving her name to the liaison or anyone beyond the active investigative team understood the name of your sensitive sounds familiar to me i may have met her at some time or other socially ill check with my wife who has a better memory for that sort of thing yes sir do you want me to wait to speak with ms sanchez again until youve done so no this is your call detective your opinion on this matter peabodys spine snapped straight mine sir ah i might be more open to extrasensory gifts commander we have sensitives in my family would you be one of them she relaxed enough to smile no sir i just have the basic five i believe as lieutenant dallas believes that celina sanchez is worth at least a followup interview then talk to her if and when the eyes leak to the media well see this case blasted on and through every media outlet we need to close it before the circus comes to town celina lived in a section of soho that ran to highend art trendy restaurants and tiny oneroom boutiques it was the land of young wellheeled welldressed urbanites who liked to hold intimate catered brunches on sunday mornings voted liberal party and attended esoteric plays they only pretended to understand much less enjoy street artists were welcome and coffeehouses were abundant celinas twostory loft had once been part of a threestory sweatshop that had produced massive amounts of cheap designer knockoff clothing it like other similar buildings in the sector had been revitalized rehabbed and reclaimed by those who could afford the real estate from the street eve noted the windows were as wide as shuttle ports and a long narrow terrace with an ornate iron railing had been added to the third floor you sure you dont want to call for an appointment peabody asked she ought to know were coming peabody approached the sidewalklevel front entrance beside eve thats sarcasm sir peabody you know me too well eve rang the buzzer for celinas loft moments later celinas voice drifted through the intercom yes lieutenant dallas and detective peabody there was another sound it might have been a sigh please come up ill release the door and the elevator just ask for two the little security light over the door went from red to green locks snicked open eve stepped inside the entryway scanned and observed three firstlevel apartments to her left an elevator door opened they stepped in requested two when the door opened again celina stood on the other side of an ironwork gate her hair was up today in some twisty coil that was secured by what looked like a couple of fancy chopsticks she wore skinpants that were cropped a few inches above the ankle and a snug tank that left her midriff bare she wore no shoes no facial enhancements no jewelry she opened the gate stepped back i was afraid youd come we might as well sit down she gestured behind her to a wide space furnished with a generous sshaped sofa the color of good red wine there was an oversized table on each curve and on one stood a long shallow bowl filled with what appeared to be rocks beside it a tall pillar candle rose out of a hammered cup the floor was the original wood by eves guess and had been sanded sealed whatever people did with old original wood to turn it into a glossy honeytoned sea brightly patterned rugs were scattered over it as brightly patterned art was scattered over the pale green walls through archways she spotted the kitchen a partysized dining area there were opentread metal steps painted a deeper green than the walls and boasting a railing that was fashioned to resemble a slim slithering snake whats that eve nodded toward the only door shut and secured my consultant space it has another entrance i like the convenience of working at home when i can but i also value my privacy i dont take clients in this part of my house she gestured again toward the sofa can i get you something to drink i cancelled my consults today i dont think id do anyone any good you caught me in the middle of a yoga session id like some tea myself no thanks eve responded i wouldnt mind if youre making it anyway celina smiled at peabody have a seat it wont take long rather than sitting eve wandered youve got a big space here yes i need open spaces id go crazy for instance in your office you spoke with louise she contacted you no but you strike me as a thorough woman i assume you checked my license my record my background and spoke with louise before deciding to talk to me again youd consider it necessary louise said you were the black sheep celina came out carrying a tray with a squat white pot and two fragilelooking white cups and saucers she shot eve a wry smile yes thats accurate my family disapproves and is mildly embarrassed not only by my gift but that i choose to make a living from it you dont need the money not for financial security she crossed the room to set the tray on the table but for personal satisfaction in your circumstances lieutenant you hardly need the salary the police department pays you but i imagine you collect it just the same she poured two cups of tea passed one to peabody i cant stop thinking about elisa i dont want to think of her i dont want to be part of this but i have to the nypsd may hire and attach at the primarys request expert consultants civilians mmmhmm celina arched one dark eyebrow and did i pass the audition so far if youre willing and able to serve as such on this matter youll be required to sign a contract the contract will include a gag order preventing you by law from discussing any aspect of the investigation ive no desire to discuss any aspect of the investigation if i agree to do this i require you to sign a document insuring that my name my association with the investigation will not be given to the media so you said before youll be paid a fee standard rate eve held out a hand to peabody waited while peabody took documents out of her bag youll want to read these over youre free to consult a lawyer or legal representative before signing youre giving your word im giving mine i dont need a lawyer for that but she crossed her legs settled back and read each document carefully i dont have a pen peabody pulled one out offered it celina signed both documents handed the pen off to eve well thats that isnt it celina let out a breath after eve scrawled her name on each contract thats that what do i do tell me again exactly what you saw eve laid a recorder on the table for the record she went through it again closing her eyes from time to time as she repeated details her hands didnt shake and her voice stayed strong and steady but eve watched her pale degree by degree as she recounted the murder and where were you when you saw this happen upstairs in bed my security was on all night as always i have full alarms and cameras on all doors youre welcome to take the discs into evidence check them i will it covers both of us have you had any visions since night before last no just a a sense of dread and a feeling of anticipation that could be my own nerves peabody evidence bag saying nothing peabody took out a length of red corded ribbon sealed do you recognize this ms sanchez celina even her lips had gone white it looks like what he used on her eve unsealed the bag held the ribbon out take it tell me what you see all right celina set down her cup then rubbed her palms nervously on her thighs she breathed slowly then took the ribbon she ran it through her fingers kept her gaze fixed on it i dont nothing comes nothing clear maybe i need time to prepare maybe i need solitude baffled frustration ran over her face i thought i expected more i was so sure that id get something since i had this connection i know he used this to kill her they both touched it but i get nothing eve took the ribbon resealed it handed it back to peabody why do you think you didnt see his face that night you saw hers i dont know my connection must be with the victim maybe elisa didnt see him clearly possible maybe you could try again with the ribbon i dont know what difference it would make maybe if you left me alone with it she began as peabody took out an evidence bag i cant do that chain of evidence it doesnt give off anything not for me in any case still celina reached out for it when eve unsealed the bag when her fingers closed over it her eyes went huge and blind she dropped it to the floor as if it had burst into flame and her hand closed over her own throat as she choked while eve only eyed her narrowly peabody sprang up took celina firmly by the shoulders and shook snap back she ordered cant breathe yes you can its not you take the air in let it out there in and out again okay okay she let her head fall back closed her eyes as a single tear slid down her cheek give me a minute she kept breathing kept her eyes shut youre a cold bitch dallas yeah i am testing me the first ribbon was a blind meant nothing just a test bought it yesterday sealed up before i bagged it smart thorough she had her breath back and her color and what might have been respect in her eyes well i suppose if id been murdered id want a cold bitch looking for my killer frowning she looked at the ribbon eve had picked up off the floor i wasnt prepared thats why it hit so hard i can prepare myself to an extent anyway she held out her hand and eve let the ribbon flow into her palm she suffered terror and pain she doesnt see his face not really shes dazed and afraid and hurt but she fights him god hes strong big tough strong its not his face i think its not his face the rape is quick almost mercifully quick hes in her panting pounding when she feels this tighten around her neck she doesnt know what it is but she knows shes going to die and she thinks vonnie she thinks last of her child tell me about him she sat straighter breathed slower he hates her fears her reveres her but not her so much rage so much hate rage excitement its hard to get more than that its like blows raining down on my psyche its hard to get through the madness but i know hes done this before why does he take her eyes i she needs to be in the dark i dont know except he wants her in the dark im sorry she handed the ribbon back to eve its hard and i cant handle the ribbon for long its too much i can do it in short sessions eve nodded noting the sheen of perspiration covering celinas face i see that i need you to come with me to the crime scene celina pressed a hand to her belly id like to change first well wait after celina had gone upstairs peabody let out a low whistle you gotta admit shes got stones yeah she stands up and from where im sitting shes the real deal looks like restless eve got up she liked the space not just the amount of it but the use of it she admired the way celina had held out her hand for the murder weapon is it the civilian or the psychic aspect you dont like eve flicked a glance over her shoulder at peabodys question little of both i dont like attaching civilians to an investigation and dont bother reminding me how often roarke ends up that way its bad enough he does bad enough im getting used to it and the psychic thing how much good is that really going to do she turned back to peabody what did she tell us hes big and strong and out of his fucking mind thats no bulletin dallas its not like shes going to give us a name and address this stuff doesnt work that way why the hell not irritated she jammed her hands in her pockets if you can see stuff why cant you see salient details the killer is murdering bastard who resides at homicide drive that would be useful frosty just think of how quick wed close a case then the department would hire a whole team of psychics the ah the said sensitive detective division and you know what i dont like it after all wed be out of a job eve shot a dark glance toward the stairs and i dont like the idea that she could start poking around in my head she wouldnt do that dallas legitimate sensitives respect privacy they dont intrude peabodys father had eve remembered inadvertently but all the same and there she admitted was the core of her bias i like her peabody added yeah shes okay well take this little field trip see what comes of it then you and me were going back to straight cop work celina changed into a pair of black pants and a blue scoopednecked blouse she wore several crystal drops on a chain around her neck tor protection intuition the opening of the third eye she held them up as they stood at the edge of central park not everyone ascribes to their benefits but under the present circumstances im willing to try anything she adjusted the enormous sunshades that hid half her face pretty day she said warm and sunny the sort of day that brings people outside i love new york this time of year and im stalling the applicable areas have been searched swept recorded eve began from what weve learned the victim walked the dog in this direction and entered the park approximately at this point eve started into the park so many people have been through here i dont know what im going to get truthfully my gift is more direct contact with someone or something usually about ten yards into the trees eve stopped there was no one around she noted after a sweep people were at work in school at the shops in restaurants it was too close to the street this tony street for chemihead gatherings or illegals transactions it was here wasnt it celina took off her shades pocketed them stared at the ground where he grabbed her dragged her deeper into the woods her breathing was slow and even as she walked a very deliberate sound struck her in the face knocked her down dazed her i can see the grounds torn up so this must be where he she took another breath then squatted down and ran her hands over the grass and dirt yanked them back again god eve could see her clench her jaw as she touched the ground again he raped her here control humiliate and punish theres a name in his mind not hers i cant see it cant quite but its not her name its not elisa hes punishing she drew her hands back again tucked them under her arms as if to warm them its difficult for me to get past her and what was done to her shes my connection and she doesnt know him she doesnt know why this is happening hes just she lifted her head looked at eve i can see you eve felt a chill in her belly im not why youre here youre a very strong presence dallas strong mind strong feelings strong instincts you layer over it all with a half laugh celina straightened stepped carefully back and away from the scene im surprised youre so resistant and suspicious of sensitives when you have a gift yourself i dont staring celina huffed out an impatient breath bull do you think what you see and feel and know is just instinct only instinct then she shrugged whatever you call it its a gift she rubbed her arms he carried her from here its dim because she was already gone some part of her is still with me but its thin she weighed about a hundred and thirty deadweight now hes very strong have to be prides himself celina murmured as she began to walk yes theres pride in his body in his strength shes so much weaker than he is now not the victim eve fell into step with her but who the victim symbolizes possibly probably celina brushed stray hair away from her face a trio of interlinked gold circles swung at her ears you probably see him more clearly than i do youre not as afraid of him as i am she paused to study the castle i wonder why he picked this spot its fanciful a landmark he could have left her anywhere it wouldve been easier eve had her thoughts on that but kept them to herself how tall is he well over six feet well over closer to seven thickbodied but hard not fat not hard fat muscular i could feel that when he raped her she sat on the grass sorry im getting the shakes im not used to this kind of work its draining how do you do it its what i do yes both of you she opened her purse took out a pretty box blocker she said when she selected a pill from it vicious headache i cant do anymore today im sorry tapped out to eves surprise celina stretched out full length on the grass do you know what id normally be doing now cant say idly celina checked the time oh yes francine right about now id be settling down to a consult with francine i give her a weekly because im fond of her shes a lovely foolish wealthy woman with a terminal case of husbanditis she just keeps marrying them shes about to take on husband number five though ive advised her against it just as i did with numbers three and four lazily celina drew the pair of stylish sunshades back out of her pocket she slipped them on shell get teary during our hour together and protest that she must follow her heart her lips quirked as she patted a hand on her breast that this time its going to be different shell marry the opportunistic son of a bitch who will then cheat on her he already has but shell refuse to believe it make her miserable then walk off with her pride her selfesteem and a nice chunk of her portfolio she shook her head pushed herself up to sitting poor gullible francine and that lieutenant dallas detective peabody is about the most tragic case i allow myself to deal with how do you know when you talk to a client that you wont see something tragic eve asked and celina smiled its my job to know and if i miss something then see it i do what i can then i step back i dont believe in suffering particularly when its me doing the suffering i dont understand why people insist on causing it or enduring it im a shallow creature she said stretching like a cat in the sun but until a couple of nights ago a damn contented one peabody offered a hand to help her up celina studied it grinned can i take a peek just surface not deep probe no secrets you both interest me peabody wiped her hand on her trousers then offered it again i guess so celina clasped hands continued to hold it after shed gained her feet youre a dependable woman sturdy shoulders and a loyal streak that encompasses every area of your life youre proud of your badge and the work you do careful she said with a laugh and released peabodys hand you open like a door i didnt intend to peek into your personal life but hes a cutie she winked shebody peabody flushed were ah moving into a new place together going to cohabitate congratulations aint love grand smiling she turned to eve raised her eyebrows no laughing celina tucked her hands into her pockets one of these days i predict youll trust me enough thanks she said to peabody you cleansed my palate ill catch a cab in a bit i want to walk off this headache before i go home she started to walk directing herself away from the path theyd taken then she stopped turned there was none of the easy humor on her face now its going to be soon the next i dont know how i know that but i do its going to be very soon eve watched her go and gift or no gift knew she was right chapter seven shes really interesting peabody waited a beat then slid her gaze toward eve as they cut west then south toward central dont you think shes not a yawn but tell me in specifics what did we get from this okay not a lot that we didnt already know or believe or suspect peabody shifted in her seat and regretted the tea now she had to pee and she knew damn well eve wouldnt stop at a handy restaurant where the flash of a badge would get her toilet privileges she crossed her legs tight and tried to concentrate still the fact is its interesting to consult with a sensitive one as obviously gifted as celina i am dependable and loyal after all just like the family schnauzer i prefer cocker spaniel cause theyve got those cute floppy ears she recrossed her legs and in my experience if a sensitives made this sort of connection they can get more if they focus and keep open i think she will shes hooked in and wants to see it through eve glanced in the rearview at the blast of siren she recognized the subtle difference in tone and identified an emergency medical vehicle an instant before the spinning red light of the medical tech wagon came into view she eased toward the curb and the rat trap she was currently stuck with driving vibrated like gelatin in the wake of the speeding wagon i want you to call requisitions the minute we get back to central beg bribe threaten offer sexual favors of any nature but get us a decent ride by the end of shift peabody had her teeth clenched and did her best to speak through them whos going to perform the sexual favors should it come to that you detective i outrank you the sacrifices i make for the badge health clubs what were going to start checking out health clubs sir i dont think i can tone up appreciably before dispensing sexual favors if you want the vehicle by end of shift jesus peabody get your face out of the gutter well you put it there eve jockeyed through traffic let us return to our sworn duty and our current investigation if were after a solo and theres no evidence to lead us to suspect this was a duet or gang killing this is one strong son of a bitch not just in shape not musclebound but a seriously strong guy guy who can carry onethirty the distance from the kill site to the dump site and haul that much deadweight down a small cliff of rocks probably works out regularly and seriously could have his own equipment somebody really serious usually does and were going to try tracking that too fullscale home gyms to start but if were going to use what the psychic queen gives us she said he was proud proud of his body hed want to show it off wouldnt he show what he can do health club health club dallas just offhand would you care to guess how many health clubs we have in our fair city we start with ones who cater primarily to men he doesnt like women so you scratch off the girly gyms where ladies prance around in their skinsuits and drink veggie juice or nibble nutribars before their massage no day spa attached no salons on premises forget the social clubs where guys go to play on the machines and pick up dates scratch off the facilities that cater primarily to samesex orientation the gay pickup cathedrals we look for traditional serious bodybuilder spots the kind that pull in the sweaty guys with big necks oooh sweaty guys with big necks hubba lifting face out of gutter immediately sir too late now eve muttered we can try another canvass of the victims neighborhood this guy surveilled her got her routine we go at it asking about an unusually tall beefy guy after you tackle requisitions contact the vanderleas see if either of them remembers seeing someone like that around check just a few more blocks peabody thought then shed be able to pee she squirmed crossed her legs the other way we run down home gym equipment weight machines virtual systems with bodybuilding programs we check out subscriptions to magazines that squirming isnt going to help you know you shouldnt have downed all that tea its really nice of you to point that out now peabody shot back with some bitterness and squirming does too help oh thank all the gods and goddesses she breathed when they drove into centrals garage treeageism pop out when your bladders full detective thats not all thats going to pop out peabody bolted from the car the instant it stopped and ran waddled to the elevator in her office eve glanced at her link noted several messages she ordered them to play while she set up a murder board for elisa maplewood as they ran she ordered some to delete some to save then stopped what she was doing to turn around and grin at the screen as mavis came on hey dallas were back in town my honey lamb and me maui is just iced totally tpd tropical paradise deluxe everything was mag the concert our rollonthesandnaked vacation part and guess what the bellys completely poking out now honest to god i am so knocked up you gotta see ill jet by soon as i can which was always a treat eve thought when the message ended but if maviss belly really was poking out now she wasnt entirely sure she wanted to see why pregnant women wanted anybody to see their pokedout bellies was another mystery and one she had no desire to solve she turned to the autochef for coffee when nadine furst channel s onair ace clicked on dallas i know youre going to give me the usual yaddahaddah blah but i really want to talk to you re the maplewood case if i dont hear from you im just going to show up at your office ill bring you a cookie eve considered it might be smart to give a short onair especially with the bribe of baked goods a brief oneonone and womantowoman his profile indicated he hated and feared the female so wouldnt it burn his ass to be discussed on screen by two women it might push him into making a mistake shed think about it the thought of cookies made her hungry with a glance at the door she reached behind the autochef under the slight lip and tugged off the candy bar shed taped there it was an obvious hiding place to her mind but it had foiled the insidious candy thief who plagued her she bit righteously into chocolate dropped down at her desk and engaged her computer your authorization code and password are not recognized access denied what the hell are you talking about she gave the machine a quick boot with the heel of her hand dallas lieutenant eve she read off her badge number for authorization repeated her password the computer gave a cheerful little beep then a long grinding buzz the screen flickered dont you start on me first my vehicle now this dont you even start acknowledged operations shutting down no damn it you bitch you son of a bitching bastard whore you know thats not what i meant she smacked it again set her teeth and repeated the startup process after a series of mechanical hiccups it hummed thats better okay open case file sh maplewood acknowledged what flashed onscreen wasnt a case file it wasnt police business unless the various naked couples writhing in athletic and impressive positions were a bunch of vice cops undercover at an orgy welcome to fantacee your virtual garden of sexual pleasure you must be twentyone to enter your debit account will be charged at the rate of ten dollars per minute during your oneweek trial membership mother of god computer close and delete current area incomplete command like hell close this file acknowledged the cavorting figures disappeared now you listen to me this is dallas lieutenant eve i own you i want case file sh and i want it now the screen jumped filled with text in what was possibly italian the sound eve made was somewhere between a scream and a bellow she rapped the machine with her hand punched it with her fist and considered just ripping it out of the network and tossing it out her window maybe just maybe if her luck was in thered be a maintenance guy strolling by under it two birds one stone as satisfying as that would be she calculated she could expect a replacement unit sometime near the end of the current century she swung to her link intending to contact maintenance and ream whoever was unfortunate enough to answer and where will that get you dallas she asked herself those pussfaced jerks in maintenance they live for moments like this theyll sit around down there and laugh and laugh until youre forced to go down and kill every last one of them and spend the rest of your life in a cage she punched the computer again just for the hell of it and inspired tried another angle edo mcnab hey dallas peabodys main squeeze grinned at her from her link screen his narrow pretty face was surrounded by bright blond hair that sported a couple of skinny temple braids i was just about to shoot you the report on the ework dont bother my units funky its giving me grief mcnab how about doing me a favor and taking a look at it you call maintenance when she merely growled he gave a hehhehheh sort of laugh delete that i can give you thirty in about fifteen good or if you officially requested i report to your office at once to bring you a disc and hard copy of the ework i could come now consider yourself officially requested allying op what but hed already broken transmission annoyed she dug out her pocket unit and set to work trying to transfer the data she wanted from the desk unit to the ppc she wasnt an egeek but she wasnt stupid she told herself she knew how to handle basic tech she was pulling her hair when mcnab bopped in he was wearing a purple shirt with a green placket down the center it reached the thighs of baggy green pants with purple racing stripes both colors were picked up in his checked airsneaks eman to the rescue he announced todays complement of silver ear hoops dangled with purple and green beads what seems to be the problem if i knew the problem id have fixed it myself right he dumped a little silver toolbox on her desk plopped into her chair rubbed his hands together wow chocolate he widened his grin wiggled his brows shit go ahead consider it payment in advance uptown what uptown he bit into the candy you know like excellent lets have a look ill just open it for a standard diagnostic he gave a series of commands that might as well have been in venutian to eves ears a lot of codes and symbols and strange little shapes spilled onscreen and the computers voice responded in a kind of gasping croak see see eve sprang to lean over mcnabs shoulder thats not right is it thats not good well hrnmm just let me its sabotage isnt it you expecting sabotage you dont expect sabotage thats why its sabotage theres a point i need to look around some why dont you ah take a break maybe you want me to leave my own office he gave her a pained look lieutenant okay okay she stuffed her hands in her pockets ill be in the bull pen she heard his long relieved sigh as she strode out she marched straight to peabodys desk comp woes peabody asked mcnab stopped by for a second on his way in to you they sabotaged it who are they if i knew who they were id hunt them down and peel the skin off their bones while they begged for mercy uhhuh okay so i got a hold of deann vanderlea somebody found the puppy huh the dog yeah mignon she was nearly on the other side of the park and a couple joggers found her checked her collar id they brought her back was it injured no just scared having the pup back will give them a little comfort anyway she and her husband and the vie all used total health fitness and beauty for workouts and such by the way not the kind of spot were looking for as regards the killers habits it was good to check she doesnt remember seeing anyone suspicious around the neighborhood doesnt recall noticing a big guy at any point but shes going to ask her husband and some of her neighbors the doorman well canvass again anyway yeah fathers out of the picture alibied by a couple thousand miles and he doesnt fit the physical type were after hed have been too easy how about my vehicle ive got a line on that give me a little time everybody wants time today lets do a search on the health clubs manhattanbased to start eve watched with some irritation as peabodys unit responded smoothly to her commands how come the detectives and uniforms in this division have better equipment than i do im the boss you know theres a theory that some people have a kind of mechanical the term deficiency sprang to peabodys mind but she was too concerned with her own health and safety to speak it like an infection or something and it affects the machines they operate thats bullshit i dont have any trouble with my home equipment just a theory peabody said and hunched her shoulders do you have to lurk there while this is running i have to lurk somewhere disgusted eve strode out shed get a tube of pepsi thats what shed do shed cool off with a drink then go back and hassle mcnab she wanted to sit in her own damn office and do her own damn job was that too much to ask she approached a vending machine then just stood there staring at it resentfully it would probably spit the pepsi all over her or send her some health drink just for spite hey you she signaled to a passing uniform then dug out credits get me a tube of pepsi the uniform looked down at the credits eve dumped in her hand ah sure lieutenant the credits were plugged in the machine responded with a cheerful and polite announcement of the selection and its contents the tube slid quietly out of the slot here you go thanks satisfied eve drank as she walked back toward the bull pen thats how shed handle this deal she decided shed have other people screw with the machines whenever possible she was rank after all she was supposed to delegate lieutenant mcnab signaled her and though she tried not to see it watched him purse his lips toward peabody no kissy faces in homicide detective is my unit up and running good news bad news how about the bad first he gave her a comewithme head signal and went back to her office bad news you got a dink system here it was working fine before yeah well see its got some internal problems thats the easiest way to explain it some of its guts well say were designed with planned obsolescence in mind only so many operating hours before they start to fail why would anybody build something thats programmed to fail so they can sell new ones because she looked like she needed it he risked patting her shoulder administration and requisitions buy cheap most times i guess bastards absolutely but the good news is ive got it up for you replaced some things its not going to last more than a few days the way you use it but i can get my hands on some parts ive got connections i can basically rebuild it for you meanwhile if you could try not to smack it around it should hold okay thanks i appreciate the quick work no prob im a genius see you tomorrow night right tomorrow night dinner louise and charles right right dont blow kisses in my bull pen she called when he pranced out she sat drank pepsi and stared at the machine dared it to give her trouble since peabody was running manhattan eve decided to expand to the bronx for gyms the machine responded to her search request as if nothing had ever happened between them it gave her enough confidence to turn her back on it while the search ensued and study her board whered he see you elisa she asked aloud where did you come into his radar he saw you and something about you clicked in that sick mind of his so he watched you and studied you and laid in wait for you a domestic a single parent liked to make things with her hands divorced abusive husband she didnt need the file to remember the details on elisa maplewood early thirties slightly less than average height average build light brown hair long pretty face standard education lowermiddleclass upbringing native new yorker liked nice clothes in simple styles nothing too trendy nothing too provocative no current personal partner or romantic entanglement minimal social life where did he see you the park take the kids to the park walk the dog the shops buy your craft supplies window shop she grabbed the hard copy of the report mcnab had left on her desk link transmissions to her parents to deanns pocket unit to luthers office to the craft store on third to check on an order incomings ran along the same lines her web activity ran to parenting sites craft sites and chat rooms downloads of magazines showed crafts again parenting again and some home decorating stuff some online shopping downloads of a couple books tagged as current bestsellers nothing popped from the search of the vanderleas equipment chat room might be worth checking out she thought and made a note of it but it was tough for her to see this big muscular guy knitting whatever people knit more than that elisa struck her as being too sensible too savvy to give personal information to anyone in a chat room he hadnt tracked her through her discussions on making blankets or the like hes done it before she thought of celinas words and she agreed with them what hed done to elisa had been well planned and well executed under risky conditions quick and efficient and to eve that meant practice she hadnt hit all the elements with her search for similar crimes maybe hed added or adjusted maybe one or more of those hits had been his work pride celina had spoken of his pride she wasnt sure she liked depending so heavily on the opinion of a psychic but it was another point she agreed with thered been pride arrogant pride in the way hed displayed his victim look at what ive done what i can do in the citys great park so close to the home of the wealthy and privileged yeah he was proud of his work and what did a man with pride in his work do when that work didnt reach the standards he wanted he buried the mistakes her blood began to hum it was the right track she knew it and she swung back to her machine she saved and filed the results of her initial search then brought up missing persons she started with a twelvemonth search stuck with manhattan and keyed in elisas basic description to narrow the parameters dallas wait attention focused on her screen eve shot up a hand to stop peabody he had to practice he had to guy builds his body up stays strong and fit it takes discipline takes practice he lives and walks and exists day after day holding in that kind of rage it takes discipline it takes willpower but you have to let it out some time you have to let go you have to kill so you practice until you get it just right search complete two results that match parameters given first image onscreen what is it peabody demanded potentially his practice sessions look at her same physical type as maplewood same age group same coloring same basic build peabody came in mirroring eves earlier position by leaning over her shoulder no resemblance beyond surface i mean but yeah same basic type computer split screen for second image list date on each working task complete thumbsup for mcnab eve mumbled dont look like sisters peabody commented cousins maybe marjorie kates eve read age thirtytwo unmarried no kids midtown address employed as restaurant manager reported missing by fiance april second of this year didnt come home from work lansing and jones caught this one second is breen merriweather age thirty divorced one child son age five upper east side employed as a studio tech channel reported missing by childcare provider june ten this year didnt return home after her shift polinksi and silk caught it i need these files peabody i need to talk to these detectives on it since lansing and jones worked out of central it only took trips on three glides and one elevator to get to their division she found them both at desks facing each other detectives lansing and jones lieutenant dallas detective peabody appreciate the time lansing the bullchested redheaded cop of about fifty stuck out a hand no problem lieutenant you think one of yours is connected to one of ours i need to check it out jones the petite thirtyish black woman shook eves hand then peabodys fiance royce cabel came in to make the report she was only missing overnight but the guy was a mess last seen when she left the restaurant appetito on east fiftyeighth at closing about midnight april first she lived about three blocks away usually walked back and forth guys expecting her home by twelvethirty he says but he falls asleep when he wakes up about two shes not there he flips calls around to everybody he can think of then hes here bright and early next morning to talk to the cops she poofs three weeks before the wedding lansing continued so you look at a couple things maybe her feet got cold and she took off maybe they had a fight and he offs her comes in to report to cover it up but it doesnt play jones shook her head we got copies of the reports our notes witness statements interviews for you you can see everybody we talked to said kates was hipdeep in wedding plans she and cabel had been cohabbing for about eighteen months got nothing on him that points to violence took a truth test didnt even blink when we suggested it she got dead jones said thats my gut on it lieutenant and we got nothing until you buzzed us up i dont know if weve got anything now any problem if i talk to some of the people on your list nope lansing pulled his lip how about a clue were on the sexual homicide mutilation in central park our vics the same physical type as your mr im pursuing the theory that hes done some practicing well shit jones said we can go by polinskis and silks station on the way to see this royce cabel how about the gyms with sweaty guys with thick necks well move on it because it was faster they squeezed on an elevator to ride down to garage level eve did her best to ignore the elbow wedged in her ribs i want us to give nadine an interview because of the connection not just im thinking it might grate our big strong man to see three women dissing him onscreen to know two women are heading the investigation theres a thought several people pushed their way off when the doors opened eve glanced up noted she had three levels to go why dont we see if we can set up the interview later today at central yeah central park at last eve all but leaped out of the doors when they hit the garage dallas wait peabody grabbed her arm dug in her heels i have something to tell you make it snappy i want to say first that in just a few moments youre going to be overcome with a powerful urge to kiss me on the lips i wont think less of you for it peabody why even in your wild perverted dreams reams i want no part in or of would i ever have the least compunction to kiss you on the lips close your eyes eve spoke quietly almost casually have you lost your fucking mind okay okay peabody pouted a little youre no fun she crossed over to eves parking slot spread her arms with a flourish and said voila what the hell is that that lieutenant is your replacement vehicle pucker up eve goggled it was a rare thing to see the lieutenant goggle and peabody celebrated the moment with a snappy little tap dance slowly eve walked around the sleek navy blue sedan it shone under the hard garage lights like a dignified jewel the tires were big black and clean the glass and chrome sparkled this is not my vehicle is too this is my vehicle uhhuh peabody bobbed her head like a puppet on a happy string get out eve smacked her in the shoulder howd you pull this off a little fast talk some slight exaggeration a lot of prevarication and a little assistance from an efairy who knows how to hack you got it through unethical and possibly illegal means damn straight eve set her hands on her hips looked peabody square in the eyes this is such a proud moment for me a proud proud moment are you going to kiss me on the lips not that proud how about a peck on the cheek get in the car your codes lieutenant she handed them over strolled around to the passenger side and you know what dallas this bitch is loaded oh yeah eve slid into a seat grinned when she didnt get the sensation of sitting on bumpy rock well lets see what she can do chapter eight it rocked not only was everything operational but it moved she could zip into vertical and down again stream instead of muscle her way through traffic all comp systems were go as she was told politely by a computerized voice before she even thought to ask the voice addressed her as lieutenant dallas informed her the outside temp was a pleasant seventyeight degrees with winds from the south southwest at a mild twelve per hour it offered to calculate the most convenient route to her destination or destinations with projected traffic patterns and etas it was a fricking miracle you love this car peabody said with a smug little smile on her face i do not love a vehicle i appreciate and expect efficient machines and tools machines and tools that assist me in doing my job rather than inconveniencing and hampering me she whipped around a trudging maxibus threaded through a mired mass of rapid cabs and for the hell of it executed a quick vertical maneuver that shot them east okay i love this car knew you would peabody all but sang it if they try to take it from me ill fight them to the death to the bloody death she smiled all the way to her destination since polinski was out on personal time she dealt with silk a stubby fireplug of a man who sat at his desk munching on nofat soy chips while he gave her background on the missing persons investigation breen merriweather had been reported missing by her neighbor and childcare provider on june tenth shed left the studio between midnight and twelvefifteen and vanished without a trace no serious romantic relationships no known enemies shed been in good health and good spirits and had been looking forward to an upcoming vacation shed planned to take her son to disneyworld east eve took copies of files and notes tag nadine eve told peabody lets do this setup at the castle in an hour make it ninety minutes they met royce cabel at his apartment he opened the door before they knocked and looked at them with what eve recognized as terrified hope you found out something about marjie mr cabel as i told you when i contacted you were conducting a followup im lieutenant dallas this is my partner detective peabody can we come in yeah sure yeah he dragged a hand through his long wavy brown hair i just thought wanted to meet you here instead of at work because i thought maybe youd found something found her and didnt want to tell me over the link he glanced around the room blankly then shook his head sorry i guess we should sit down ah arent detectives lansing and jones still working they are were pursuing another angle it would help us if youd tell us what you know what i know he sat on a deep green sofa heaped with pretty pillows the apartment was painted a dull gold and struck eve as being female the pillows the soft fancy throws the sudden splashes of reds and dark blues i feel like i dont know anything he said after a moment she was working nights that was going to change in june when she took over as day manager wed be on the same schedule again how long had she been working nights for about eight months he rubbed his hands on his thighs as if he didnt know what else to do with them it was okay she liked the work and the restaurants only a couple blocks away id go in and have dinner at least once a week and having her days free gave her lots of time to handle the wedding stuff she was doing almost everything herself marjie loves planning did the two of you have any problems we didnt i mean we did everybody does but we were in a real up phase the wedding hell i didnt have to do anything but show up because she had everything organized we talked about starting a family his voice shook and he cleared his throat stared hard at the wall did she ever mention anyone coming into the restaurant who disturbed her anyone coming by here or anywhere else no i told the other detectives if somebodyd been bothering marjie shed have told me if somebodyd pissed her off at work shed have told me we talked all the time i always waited up for her and wed hash out the day she just didnt come home mr cabel i wish shed just walked off emotions pitched into his voice traces of anger now anger circling around the fear i wish shed gotten freaked or fallen out of love with me or found somebody else or just got a goddamn wild hair but she didnt its not marjie something happened to her something terrible and i dont know what im going to do mr cabel do you or marjie belong to a health club or gym huh he blinked sucked in a breath yeah who doesnt we ah we go to able bodies we try to make it two three times a week sundays for sure since were both off wed do a couple hours maybe then have brunch in their juice bar brunch in the juice bar didnt fit eve thought and decided on another tack before she could speak peabody lifted one of the couch pillows these are really beautiful unique they look handrafted marjie made them she was always making something he ran his hand over one of the pillows used to call herself a craft addict pop eve thought would you know where she bought her supplies her supplies i dont get it its details mr cabel peabody told him details help it was one of the things we didnt do together he mustered up a smile shed dragged me along a few times on her hunts but i made her feel rushed she said because i was so obviously bored shes got a little studio set up in the second bedroom theres probably some record of where some of the stuff came from eve rose can we take a look sure he got up quickly the enthusiasm for the new angle clear on his face its right in here he led them into a small room full of material and threads and ribbons fringes and framing and objects eve couldnt begin to identify it all appeared to be meticulously organized into groups there were a couple of small machines and a mini data and communication center can we turn this on sure let me get it for you he walked over to the d and c booted it up peabody eve tipped her head toward the unit she could make anything cabel continued and wandered the room touching fabrics the quilt on the bed the folk art scattered around the apartment the sofa out in the living area she picked it up off the street hauled it home fixed it up recovered it one day shes going to start her own business do home decorating or maybe run her own craft school something lieutenant theres a transaction here for supplies february another march total crafts eve nodded continued to riffle through wide baskets painted boxes and lifted out three rolls of corded ribbon one in navy one in gold and one in red he trolls the craft shops again eve crossed the park her focus on the castle why does a guy like that troll the craft shops he could have spotted them somewhere else followed them there no two women their only known connection a hobby one dead one missing and presumed i guarantee you when we finish with nadine and go talk to breen merriweathers babysitter were going to find she did crafts were going to find she bought supplies at one time or another from total crafts or one of the other locations either maplewood or kates used he sees them there they fit his requirements he stalks them studies them she tucked her thumbs in her pockets then he lays in wait and takes them if he did kates he almost certainly had to have his own transpo theres nowhere between the restaurant and the apartment where he could have raped murdered mutilated her then hid the body he had to do a snatch and grab then take her somewhere if were right about kates then he changed his method for maplewood eve shook her head not changed perfected kates was one of his trial runs might have been more before her sidewalk sleepers runaways junkies whatever someone who wouldnt get reported missing or was reported months before the grab he had it down to a science when he killed elisa maplewood he might have been working up to that for years happy thought they represent somebody mother sister lover a woman who rejected him refused him abused him dominant female figure why she wondered did the twisted tree of a murderer so often go back to the mother root did the gestation and birthing process come with the power to nurture or destroy when we get him eve continued its going to come out that she this symbol knocked him around or boooo broke his heart or made him feel weak and helpless so his defense lawyers will come along saying oh he was damaged poor sick son of a bitch hes not responsible and thats a pile of shit thats a big smelly pile of bullshit because nobodys responsible for choking the life out of elisa maplewood but him nobody peabody let the rant run waited until she was sure it was over preaching to the choir eve drew it back in yeah where the hell is nadine she doesnt show in five we cancel we need to follow up on merriweather were a couple minutes early i guess we are eve sat on the grass drew her knees up and studied the castle you ever skip around parks when you were a kid sure glad the storm had passed peabody sat beside her freeagers you know i was a regular nature girl you no couple of stints in what you could call summer camp run by statehired nazis eve thought who regulated every breath this ones not so bad you know its still in the city so its okay not looking to make nature girl naturell kill you just for the hell of it eve glanced over and watched nadine and her camera operator crossing to them why would she wear those skinny heels when she knew shed be hiking over grass because theyre jazzed and make her legs look mag eve supposed everything about nadine looked mag from her sweep of streaky blonde hair to the toes of her jazzed shoes she had a foxy angular face observant green eyes and a slim body that curved appropriately in her oncamera suit of power red she was smart she was sneaky she was cynical and for reasons eve imagined neither of them fully understood theyd become friends dallas peabody dont you two look relaxed and pastoral why dont you set up there she gestured to the camera i want the castle in the background you got any real juice she said to eve i can take this live no and were keeping it short we could even say pithy pithy it is nadine took out a small compact to check her face lifted a paperthin sponge and dabbed her nose whos leading off she is eve jerked a thumb at peabody i am lets get to it nadine nodded to the camera angled her body gave her shoulders a roll her hair a little shake and her easy smile turned into a cool serious look this is nadine furst in central park with lieutenant eve dallas and detective delia peabody of the new york city police and security department homicide division behind us is belvedere castle one of the citys most unique landmarks and the site of a recent violent murder elisa maplewood a woman who worked and lived only a short distance from here a single mother of a fouryearold child was assaulted near the very spot where were standing she was brutally raped and murdered detective peabody as a key member of the investigative team handling elisa maplewoods murder can you tell us what progress youve made in finding her killer we are actively pursuing all leads and utilizing all the resources at our disposal are you confident youll make an arrest dont screw up peabody ordered herself dont screw up the case remains open and active lieutenant dallas and i will continue to work toward identifying ms maplewoods assailant gathering evidence that will result in an arrest in order to bring this individual to justice can you tell us what specific leads you are pursuing im unable to discuss specific details of this investigation as such might taint the case were building or affect the progress of said investigation as a woman detective do you feel this particular crime more personally peabody started to deny then remembered part of the purpose of the interview as a cop its imperative to remain objective in every investigation its impossible not to feel on a personal level compassion and outrage for any victim of any crime but that compassion and outrage cant be allowed to overcome objectivity and interfere because the victim must be our priority as a woman i feel that compassion and outrage on elisa maplewoods behalf like lieutenant dallas i want the individual responsible for her suffering and pain for the suffering and pain of her family her friends identified and punished do you agree lieutenant dallas yes i do a woman stepped out of her home intending to walk her dog in the citys greatest park her life was taken from her and thats enough for outrage but it was taken viciously violently deliberately as a cop as a woman i will pursue the man who took elisa maplewoods life however long it takes until hes brought to justice how was she mutilated at this point that detail of the crime and investigation is not for public consumption dont you believe in the publics right to know lieutenant i dont believe the public has a right to know everything and i believe the media has the responsibility to respect the departments decision to hold certain details back we dont do so to deprive or deny the public of their rights but to preserve the integrity of an investigation nadine she said and had nadine blinking eve never referred to her by her first name onair were women in what could be considered highpowered professions however much a crime like this disturbs us a crime in this case specifically targeted at women we have to maintain that professionalism in order to do the job weve signed up to do and in this case the case of elisa maplewood it will be women who stand for her and who work toward seeing that her killer is punished to the fullest extent of the law nadine started to speak again but eve shook her head thats it camera off i have more questions thats it eve repeated lets take a walk but nadine only sighed as eve was already hiking away slow it down heels here your choice pal you wear a weapon i wear heels tools of our respective trades she hooked her arm through eves to slow her down so what was that last bit about eve a personal message to the killer offrecord here nadine tell me how he mutilated her offrecord dallas its driving me crazy he cut out her eyes jesus nadine breathed in stared off into the trees oh jesus was she already dead yeah thank god for that so youve got some psychotic out there who has a big hate on for women not maplewood specifically thats my working theory and the reason you suggested the interview us three girls clever of you tell me what you know about breen merriweather breen nadines head snapped around oh god oh god did you find her she gripped eves arm now is she dead did this bastard kill her too no she hasnt been found i dont know if shes dead but i suspect she is and i believe it might be connected what do you know about her i know she was a nice hardworking woman who adored her son jesus is he targeting single mothers i dont think so no let me take a second she walked a few feet away hugged her arms we werent best pals or anything like that more a working friendship i liked her and appreciated her efficiency i saw her evening shift the night she disappeared i left the station about seven i know she was on till midnight handling the eleven oclock everything ive heard is secondhand but its reliable she turned back she clocked out left the station just after her shift ended she would have taken the subway home thats what she always did its just three blocks east one of the guys saw her heading out yelled good night she waved to him as far as i know hes the last one in the station who saw her he said she was walking east toward the subway did she do crafts crafts you know what crafts are nadine interest keen replaced the sorrow as a matter of fact she did she did a lot of handwork always had a bag of supplies with her and some project going she used to work on it during breaks or wait time is that the connection its looking that way you know any big bodybuildertype guys anybody like that at were desk jockeys and faces she shook her head we onair types work out bodysculpt whatever it takes to keep trim but the public doesnt want their news and entertainment from big bruisers we got some burly techs and some overweight drones but none of them would qualify as bodybuilders is that your line on him another working theory i need a full interview when this is wrapped dallas if breen was part of this thing i need to do a full interview with you and peabody for the station she was one of ours youd want one anyway i would nadine smiled a little but if this hits home i need it fuck objectivity its personal i hear that to save time eve requested breen merriweathers childcare provider meet them at breens apartment eve used her master to gain access and stepped into a small cheerful set of rooms with air stale from disuse her familys paying the rent annalou harbor the sixtyish provider looked around the apartment with sad eyes i still come in once a week water her plants aired it out a couple times but i live upstairs yes maam her husband took jesse her little boy i miss that baby such a sweetie she gestured to a framed photo that showed a grinning little boy in a sideways ball cap breen would never have left him not while there was breath in her body so i know there isnt i know shes dead thats why youre here youre homicide i recognize you ive seen you onscreen we dont know mrs harbor but were pursuing dont pad it for me lieutenant dallas the tone was firm and just a little prim im not a gossip and im not looking for some sort of twisted excitement i loved that girl like she was my own and i can help you more if you dont try to dance around it we believe its highly possible that shes dead mrs harbor and that her death may be connected with another case were investigating the murder in central park the rapemurder i keep up she pressed her lips together until they turned white but she didnt crumble what can i do to help you where does ms merriweather keep her craft supplies in here she led the way into a tiny room equipped with two counters several handpainted cabinets and the machines eve was now accustomed to seeing in such places see she set it up as an activity room for her and jesse his toys and games over there her supplies here that way they could be together when they had leisure time breen liked making things she knit me a beautiful throw last christmas eve opened cupboards while peabody tackled communications and data there were several samples of the corded ribbon i got hits on total crafts and a couple of the others on the list peabody announced mrs harbor were going to need to take her links and computer and some other items into evidence can you give me the contact number for her next of kin take what you need her mother told me to cooperate with the police in any and every way ill get in touch with her my partner will give you a receipt all right itll be easier for them for all of us to know she looked around the room and though her lips trembled once she firmed them however bad it is itll be easier to know for certain yes maam it will i realize the other detectives interviewed you but id like to ask you some questions thats fine can we sit down id like to sit down its hard to think peabody began when they were back in the car that if these three women are linked that nobody connected to them saw this guy if hes the physical description we believe you wouldnt see him blending hes careful are we going to try another push with celina not yet i need think time she settled down to it in her office her feet on her desk her head back she visualized the pattern he wouldnt have expected them to recognize the pattern so quickly because he wouldnt have expected the police to link the murder with the disappearances but if when he killed again hed know theyd see the connections between victims it didnt worry him why the murder weapon was available at the shops the murder victim and the suspected victims had frequented it wouldnt take much longer for the exact location to be identified did he think because it was a fairly common item the cops couldnt nail the source through basic lab work possibly but even so hed have to believe the investigation would include the point of purchase even if someone else had bought the ribbon hed been inside or within sight of the store or stores in order to select his victim but he wasnt worried about it any more than it seemed hed worried about being seen or caught assaulting elisa in a public park because like many psychopaths he believed he was invulnerable that he wouldnt be caught or because a part of him was begging to be caught stop me find me catch me either way wasnt he enjoying the risk factor wasnt he aroused by the chances he took arousal in the selection in the trolling in the stalking all that anticipation building gratification physical violence sexual violence murder committed with an item considered more traditionally female then left on the victim like a decoration enjoyment possessing the strength to overpower and control and kill and more the strength to bear the weight of the dead more than the average man could manage final satisfaction removal of the eyes owning the eyes eve thought arranging the body in a specifically chosen manner and location hed be back to the arousal stage again if not now soon she swung her legs off wrote up her daily then gathered what she needed for an evening session at home she went out to peabodys desk im hitting some of the gyms working my way uptown toward home if youre with me youll have to get yourself back downtown when we call it a day im not missing a chance to ogle and interrogate big sweaty guys i might cut out at six though unless weve got something mcnab and i have a packing date tonight a packing date yeah weve got to get some serious packing done at my place well be moving into our place in a few days our place she patted her belly still gives me a little bit of the jitters you cant imagine what it gives me eve said and walked away when peabody snorted chapter nine they spent a couple of hours talking to men with big pecs and treetrunk legs in workout facilities that carved out the frills and concentrated on the testosterone peabodys main complaint was that a large percentage of the members seemed to be more interested in ogling themselves or each other rather than a certain police detective it was a fishing expedition eve thought as she swung toward home and she didnt feel any appreciable tugs on her line yet shed start running names thats all the few hundred of them shed compiled from membership and subscription lists see if she got any pops on sex crimes he hadnt started down his current path yesterday hed be single so that would eliminate more he wasnt gay or hadnt recognized himself as such he didnt work nights thats when he killed no human hair recovered on the victim or from the murder or dump sites had he sealed up that thoroughly or did he like some of the obsessive body guys shed seen today regularly remove his head and body hair she could almost almost get a picture of him in her head trying to define it she turned toward the gates of home then was forced to stomp on the brakes when they remained shut summerset you prick she lowered the window barked into the intercom open the damn gates you ratfaced pointyassed one moment please your voice print is being identified ill give you my voice print ill give you my voice print all over your she broke off again hissing as the gates slid open thinks hes got a new trick up his sleeve to bust my chops thinks hes going to keep me stewing outside the gates now while he runs his little game if he had balls id kick them into his throat she slammed out of the car jogged up the steps and burst into the house ready to rumble if you wish automated entry lieutenant summerset said before she could spew youll need to inform us when you intend to arrive in a strange vehicle one not yet scanned and cleared for security otherwise as you know youre required to announce yourself so the system can read and verify your voice identification or access codes shit he had her there its not a strange vehicle its my vehicle he gave her his sour smile come up in the world have we just blow me annoyed at the missed opportunity to pound on him she started up the stairs you have guests roarke is entertaining mavis and leonardo on the west terrace first level im about to serve canapes goodie but since the half candy bar was now a far fond memory she could admit privately that anything involving food sounded fine to her she wound her way through the house and found everyone sipping drinks not exactly she corrected mavis was gesturing with her glass as she bubbled more frothy than the lemon fizz in her hand she stood on the patio in a pair of shimmering green boots that ran up to her knees like a thin coat of paint where they met equally tight pants in red no blue no red eve narrowed her eyes as the pants changed hues every time mavis wiggled which was always the shimmering green top floated down to her hips where a lot of beads dangled her hair was red today and to eves relief stayed that way even when she danced in place shed left it down so it trailed along her butt with the ends picking up that same shimmering green as if theyd been dipped in paint the two men watched her roarke with a bemused and affectionate smile and leonardo with open adoration roarke shifted his gaze winked at eve rather than interrupt eve crossed over to where a wine bottle and glasses were set up she poured herself a drink then crossed the patio to sit on the arm of roarkes chair dallas mavis threw out her arms and somehow didnt spill a single fizzing drop did you just get here just i didnt know if wed get to see you but we wanted to come by so i could give summerset a smoochie please youre going to make me sick mavis only laughed then roarke came in right behind us so were having a little hang were getting snacks her eyes green to go with the shimmer danced so i hear eve leaned around roarke hows it going she asked leonardo couldnt be better he beamed at mavis he was a giant of a man with skin of coppery gold a wide face with dark eyes that were currently accented with a sweeping line of silver studs at each corner he wore boots as well pale blue that rode up his calves there his loose sapphire pants sort of poofed into them reminding eve of pictures shed seen of she thought arabia oh boy heres food mavis made the dash over as summerset rolled out a twotiered trolley laden with trays of fancy appetizers and sweets summerset if it wasnt for leonardo id scoop you right up and make you my love slave he smiled a wide toothy smile fearing nightmares eve turned away and stared into her wine i believe i have several of your favorites here youre eating for two tell me im like an oinker every five minutes oooh thats the salmon mingy with the stuff this is just mag she popped it into her mouth i just love eating you sit down now honeypot leonardo walked over rubbed her shoulder im going to fix you a plate cuddle bear she cooed he totally spoils me this pregs business is the top deal of the day you gotta look even as mavis reached for the hem of her shirt eve was curling into herself and wincing oh mavis i dont oh well there was the belly in all its glory and accented by an interlinking trio of bellybutton rings now check this still holding the shirt up mavis turned to the side see its poking i know i said it was poking before you know like five seconds after i found out i was knocked up but now it completely is eve tilted her head pursed her lips there was a little bit of a slope in that area are you pushing it out no feel eve wasnt quite quick enough to whip her hand behind her back i dont wanna dont make me touch it again you cant hurt it she pressed eves hand to her belly solid baby thats good mavis her palm was going to go damp any second really good youre feeling okay at the summit everything is totally uptown you look beautiful roarke told her and cliche or not you glow i feel like im sending off waves she laughed and bounced to a chair i still get the weepies sometimes but theyre happy weepies mostly like leonardo and i were talking a couple days ago about how peabody and mcnab are moving into the building soon and were going to be neighbors at least until we get a bigger place and i just flooded she took the plate leonardo brought her and cuddled up with him on the padded love seat so what do you think they want for like a housewarming dont they have regulation temp control jeez dallas with a giggle mavis popped something else in her mouth housewarming you know where people move into a new place and you get them a gift hold on you have to give them a gift for moving uhhuh plus theyre shacking so it should be a couple thing she ate another canape fed one to leonardo why does there have to be a gift for every damn thing eve complained retail conspiracy roarke patted her knee i bet it is eve said darkly i just bet it is anyway mavis waved it all away we really came by and were all pumped that youre both here because we wanted to talk to you about the baby mavis since you got pregnant when havent you wanted to talk about the baby eve leaned over took a canape from her plate not that theres anything wrong with that yeah but this is a specific thing that involves you the eve licked her thumb and decided to steal another loaded cracker from maviss plate uhhuh we want you to be my backup coach youre taking up baseball eve bit into the salmon thingy with the stuff and decided it wasnt half bad shouldnt you wait until you get the kid out of there no labor and delivery coach youd back up leonardo when i have the baby eve choked on the canape and turned white take a drink darling roarke said with a laugh in his voice put your head between your knees if you feel dizzy shut up are you talking about like being there in the actual place at the actual time in the same room as it you cant coach me through it if youre in queens dallas you gotta have a backup coach somebody who takes the class learns about the breathing and the positions and the stuff daddy bears first string but you have to have one on the bench can i just stay on the bench outside i need you there tears swam into her eyes until they shimmered brighter than her boots youre my best friend in the whole universe i need you with me oh man okay okay dont flood ill do it we feel leonardo said and offered mavis a green cloth to dab at her eyes that first for friendship theres no one who we want to share this miracle with more added to that youre the most steady and solid people we know in a crisis youd keep your heads our heads eve repeated we want roarke there too mavis sniffed into her cloth the there eve turned her head and saw with pleasure the rare sight of utter panic on his face not so damn funny now is it ace were permitted even encouraged to have family present leonardo explained youre our family ah im not sure its quite proper for me to be to see mavis in that condition under those circumstances get out sniffles forgotten mavis giggled and tapped roarke playfully on the arm anybody with a vid players seen me mostly naked and this isnt about the proper its about family we know we can count on you both of you of course roarke swallowed a great deal of wine of course you can when they were alone sitting in the soft light of dusk with the candles summerset had lit flickering roarke reached out gripped eves hands in his they could change their minds its still months away and they could easily change their minds and want this event to be a private one between them she looked at him as if hed sprouted a second head private private this is mavis were dealing with he shut his eyes god pity us and its just going to get more she pulled away sprang up before you know it before you know it shes going to want us to deliver the thing theyll want to do it here in our bedroom or something with cameras live feed to her fans and us pulling the thing out of her utter and genuine horror leaped into his eyes stop it eve stop it now yeah live feed thats mavis to the ground and well do it she spun back to him well do it because shes just sucking us in sucking us in like some she windmilled her arms like some big sucking thing some big pregnant sucking thing lets just calm down with the images eve painted playing in his head roarke took out a cigarette lighting it he ordered himself to think rationally surely youve done this sort of thing before youre a cop you must have at least been on hand during a birthing uhuh nope no once when i was still on patrol we had to take this woman into a health center jesus she was screaming like somebody was ramming steel spikes into her crotch merciful jesus eve could you dispense with some of the imagery but she was wound up now and something gives way in there and stuffs pouring out of her fluids you know i dont no and i dont care to made a hell of a mess in the cruiser but at least she had the decency the common courtesy to wait until she was inside with the doctor or midwife or whoever the hell before she pushed it out for a moment roarke pressed his fingers to his temples we cant think about this anymore well go mad if we do we have to think about something else he stabbed the cigarette out entirely she drew one long shaky breath youre right ive got work murder much better let me help i beg you she had to laugh sure its the least i can do step into my office she took his hand filling him in as they went inside and up how much do you intend to use this celina sanchez id like to keep it minimal she sat at her desk kicked back to prop her feet on the edge shes got the dimatto seal of approval and shes even likable enough id even call her steady but its not a good fit for me still shes cued in to this so i cant ignore what she can give me i knew a man who kept a sensitive on staff and wouldnt make a decision without her worked well enough for him as it happened you got any i do precogs clairvoyants sensitives i dont dismiss what theyve been given or what they can offer but i prefer making my own decisions in the final run youll do the same so far her lets call it intel isnt adding much to my basic nonsensitive cop work but it matches it she frowned mentally picking her way through the data and speculation impressions we could pick up at the kill site and the ones we got leading to the dump site indicate a size fifteen shoe we may be able to make the tread or at least a partial if dickhead in the lab works some magic ground and grass were dry but when he added her weight he left some impressions well thats a large foot youve got there but not all men with big feet are big men big enough to leave impressions on dry grass strong enough to lift and carry a hundred and thirty pounds of deadweight youve got to speculate do the probabilities and when you do you come up with a man between two hundred and seventy and eighty pounds my guess would be a height of between six four and six eight he nodded imagined he was building a picture in his mind similar to the one in hers and if you take it further you assume that kind of strength and body type comes from discipline and dedication body sculpting procedures can give you the build but they cant give you the strength hence your foray into the world of musclemen reminded me i like my guys more on the lanky side lucky for me i cant find any connection between the two missing and presumed and my vie other than their predilection for fussy stuff and frequenting at least some of the same outlets for supplies i could spare you time and look deeper there thats what i was thinking you cant buy a fifteen shoe just anywhere roarke continued youd have to special order or use a specialty outlet for that matter if your man is as described he wouldnt be able to buy anything off the rack right hed need enormous guys r us or the like catchy roarke mused ill keep it in mind if i ever open a specialty retail outlet of that nature im going to do a search and locate on specialty retail outlets of that nature she said mimicking his accent and making him grin tonight well then we should both be busy enough to keep our minds off things best not thought about before we go to our respective corners tell me this why does he do it control abuse is always about control rape is about control and at its core so is murder even if the motive for murder is greed jealousy selfpreservation rage or entertainment it still comes down to control all crime comes down to it at its base dont you think ill take this from you be it your wallet or your life because i can why did you steal when you did a hint of a smile played around his mouth all manner of selfish and entertaining reasons lieutenant certainly to possess something i hadnt had before i took it for myself and the pleasure of doing so successfully to punish the person who possessed it first he inclined his head acknowledging the point no they were in most cases purely incidental to the goal theres the difference doesnt paint the thief white but murder often roots in punishment i think it does here someone controlled him punished him a female and now hes showing her whos boss thats why he left her naked she probably wasnt naked when he raped her tore her clothes fibers still on her indicate but he wouldnt have bothered to strip her down he bothered after because it added humiliation she paused considered he didnt mutilate the female part of her which expresses another kind of rage and control it wasnt sexual but it was personal he strangles not with his hands and odds are he could have snapped her neck like a twig but he uses the ribbon so it means something to him the red cord is also personal he takes her eyes carefully so he can blind her naked and blind more humiliation but he takes them so he can have that part of her does she watch him i think somehow he wants her to watch him because hes in charge now endlessly fascinating he replied what watching you work he came around the desk lifted her chin kissed her lightly and theres nothing nonsensitive about it ill just put together a meal before we settle in thatd be good while he went into the kitchen off her office she set up a second murder board to this one she added pictures of marjorie kates and breen merriweather she was standing studying them when roarke came back in he set a plate on her desk theyre yours now too yeah im afraid they are attractive women comfortably attractive rather than stunning itll be the hair wont it its the hair thats the greatest similarity builds close too average build caucasian women around thirty with a nice average build and long light brown hair thats a big pool for him to fish in not so big when you add in the other factors no that shrinks it they have to poke around craft shops and they have to be out alone sometime at night he works them at night still gives him plenty to choose from she stepped back td better get to it before he picks another one when she went to her desk she was delighted to see hed brought out a burger and fries even though there were a few little broccoli trees alongside them she could ditch the broccoli how would he know but then shed feel guilty since she was more ambivalent toward broccoli than guilt she ate it first to get it out of the way while she started a search for retail shops that specialized in large men more than shed expected eve noted as she poured coffee from the pot roarke had set beside her plate upscale well think about it she reminded herself where else did the arena ball players the basketball dudes and tall or porky rich guys drop their fashion bucks there were midline and discount and she discovered design and tailoring services offered by a couple of the major department stores and a number of boutiques didnt exactly narrow the field when she altered the search to shoes it bounced a few out and tossed a few new sources in he could buy primarily or even exclusively online she thought as she bit into her burger a lot of people did but wouldnt he a man who worked hard to build his body who was proud of the results want to select his clothes in real life check himself out in the mirror have some fawning clerk tell him how good he looked a lot of projection she admitted out of a scarcity of solid facts but when she did a geographic run she found a shop called the colossal man was two crosstown blocks from total crafts isnt that interesting she nabbed a fry computer list any gyms currently in this case file located within a sixblock parameter of total crafts working she ate another fry health and fitness facilities in that sector include jims gym and bodybuilders display map on wall screen applicable sector highlight locations of retail shops and gyms she rose the burger in one hand to walk closer to the wall screen sometimes she thought you saw a pattern because you wanted to and sometimes it was just there hed walked those streets she was sure of it walked from gym to shop to shop because he lived or worked or both in that sector this was his neighborhood people saw him there knew him there and so would she she walked into roarkes office where he sat at his desk enjoying what looked like seafood pasta while he worked his laser fax was humming and his comp signaled an incoming youve got stuff coming in project reports im expecting he said without looking up they can wait i dont have anything for you yet put that on hold a minute come take a look at this he brought his coffee with him went with her into her office eve gestured to the wall screen what do you see a sector of the west village and a pattern so do i i want to start with residences in this sector before you say anything no i cant even guess how many there must be its a long shot a really long shot but he may live there so you start with residential get owner and tenant lists eliminate families couples single women and finetune it down to men who live alone you shouldve been a cop he shifted his gaze from the screen to her face dont i have enough horror in my head with potential midwifery without you heaping more in there sorry itll take a lot of time he may live a block outside my parameter hell he may live five blocks out and work inside it or work one block out or he could just do his shopping and bodybuilding there and live in fricking new jersey but you go with the percentages and the percentages say here itd go quicker if you gave me a hand with the runs nodding he continued to study the screen your place or mine when eve crawled into bed just after one in the morning she knew she was on the scent and hoped could only hope he waited long enough for her to track him down two months between kates breen and maplewood if he sticks with that schedule ill have him before he kills another one shut it down lieutenant roarke drew her in so her head settled against his shoulder she rarely had the dreams when he kept her close shut it down and sleep im close i know im close she murmured and drifted off he was waiting for her she would come she always walked this way briskly her head down her steps nearly soundless in her gelsoled shoes shed have put them on after her shift after shed taken off the whore shoes she wore to serve the men who leered at her over their drinks whatever she wore she remained a whore shed walk by head down and the streetlights would shine on her hair it would look almost gold almost people would think thats a pretty woman a nice quiet pretty woman going about her business but they didnt know he knew what was inside the shell bitter black and dark he could feel it rising in him now as he anticipated her rage and pleasure fear and joy youll look at me now you bitch and well see how you like it see how you like it thought she was so pretty liked to parade and pose in front of the mirror without her clothes or parade and pose for the men she let touch her wont look so pretty when im done he slipped a hand into his pocket felt the long length of ribbon red was her favorite she liked to wear red he saw her as he once had screaming screaming naked but for the red ribbon shed worn around her throat red as his blood when shed beaten him beaten him until hed passed out only to wake in the black in the dark in the locked room shed be the one to wake in the black now blind in hell there she was there she was now walking along in her brisk way head down his heart thundered in his chest as she came closer she turned as she always did through the iron gates and into the pretty park for an instant just one trip of that heart her head came up and there was fear and shock and confusion in her eyes when he leaped out of the shadows she opened her mouth to scream and his fist broke her jaw her eyes rolled back to white to blind as he dragged her away from the lights he had to slap her several times to bring her around she had to be awake for it awake and aware he kept his voice down he was no fool but he said what he needed to say as he used his fists on her how do you like it now bitch whos the boss now whore and there was both shame and unspeakable delight in ramming his body into hers she didnt fight only lay limp and that was a disappointment shed struggled before and sometimes shed begged that was better still when he pulled the cord around her neck when he yanked it tight and saw her eyes bulge the pleasure was so keen he thought he too might die of it her heels drummed soft little thumps on the grass her body convulsed and brought his at last at last to completion go to hell he panted it out while he stripped off her clothes go to hell now where you belong he stuffed her clothes in the bag hed brought with him then hooked the strap crossways over his massive chest he picked her up as if she weighed nothing and he reveled in his strength in the power it gave him he carried her to the bench hed selected so lovely under the big shady tree so close to the dignified fountain there he laid her out carefully bringing her hands together tucking them up between her breasts there now there now mother dont you look nice would you like to see he was grinning a mad grin that all but burst through the thick layers of sealant he wore why dont i help you with that so saying he took the scalpel from his pocket and set to work chapter ten when her bedside link signaled eve rolled toward the sound said shit crap damn it when she fumbled in the dark lights on ten percent roarke called out eve dragged a hand through her hair shook her head to clear sleep block video she ordered dallas hes killing her hes killing her the voice was so thin and breathy eve needed the readout to identify celina pull yourself together pull it together and give me a clear report i saw i saw like the other oh god its too late its already too late where she leaped out of bed tossed her voice toward the link as she raced for clothes central park is he in the park yes no a park smaller gated buildings memorial park where are you i im at home im in bed i cant stand whats in my head stay there understand me stay where you are yes i end transmission eve snapped and cut off celinas wild weeping will you call it in roarke asked ill check it out myself first i should say well check it out she amended as he was up and dressing as she was celina shell have to deal eve strapped on her weapon we all have to deal with the stuff in our heads lets move she let him drive it might have irked that he handled a vehicle any vehicle with more skill than she but it wasnt the time to quibble about it it wasnt the time she admitted to quibble about psychics either she yanked out her communicator and requested a patrol to report to memorial park to check out a possible assault look for a male between six four and six eight muscular build approximately twoseventy if found detain only consider said individual armed and dangerous eve leaned forward as if to give them more velocity as they streaked toward southern manhattan she could be seeing something thats going to happen not that has it could be what do you call it precognition yeah but there was a heaviness in her belly that told her otherwise im close goddamn it i know im on the right track if hes killed tonight he didnt wait two months maybe he never has they chose the west entrance off memorial place and pulled up behind the blackandwhite snugged to the curb how many ways in and out of this eve asked three four about that at a guess i dont know for sure its only about a block square i think one of the smaller and more tasteful of the original wtc memorials she crossed the sidewalk and drawing her weapon moved through the stone archway that led into the green there were benches a small pond big trees plots of flowers and a large bronze statue depicting firefighters raising a flag she moved past it and heard the retching swiveling toward the sound she walked quickly south and saw the uniform on his hands and knees puking into a bed of red and white flowers officer but she saw the bench a few feet away and what was on it deal with him she told roarke and walked to the second uniform who was holding his communicator she had her badge up dallas officer queeks lieutenant found her just a minute ago i was about to call it in we didnt see anyone just her to ascertain death i checked her pulse shes still warm i want this scene secured she glanced back is he going to do us any good hell be okay lieutenant rookie he added with a small pained smile weve all been there get him on his feet queeks secure the scene and do a sweep of this park carefully this isnt where he killed her therell be another site ill call it in she drew out her communicator dispatch this is dallas lieutenant eve acknowledged homicide single victim female location memorial park southwest sector contact peabody detective delia and crime scene acknowledged dallas lieutenant eve dispatch out youll want this roarke said from behind her and offered her a field kit yeah i need you to stay back she sealed up hooked on a recorder he watched her approach the victim begin to record the scene visually and verbally it was fascinating to watch her work he thought again and sometimes it was unspeakably sad there was pity in her eyes and there was anger she wouldnt know it showed and he doubted anyone but himself could see it but it was there inside her as she put a madmans latest work on record shed study the dead he thought and the details shed miss nothing but it wouldnt only be murder shed see shed see the human that made all the difference a little more slender than the others eve thought not as curvy more delicate and maybe just a bit younger but still in the ballpark long light brown hair a little bit of a wave but nearly straight had probably been pretty too though you wouldnt know it now not now that her face was ruined the beating shed sustained was more severe than maplewoods he was enjoying that part more she thought he was less able to control himself punish her what she stood for destroy her what she stood for whoever this woman was it hadnt been she hed killed whose face had he seen when hed tightened the cord around her neck whose eyes had stared back at him when the position of the body the visual injuries were on record she drew the hands apart to run prints lieutenant queeks called from her right i think weve got your kill site secure it block it off queeks i dont want anyone walking around on my scene yes sir victim is identified through fingerprints as lily napier age twentyeight listed address is vesey street apartment c you had been pretty lily eve thought as she studied the id picture on her screen soft slight a little shy employed oharas bar and grill albany street walking home from work werent you lily its not very far saves the transpo fare and its a warm night its your neighborhood youd walk through the park and then youd be home she fit on goggles examined the hands the nails death hadnt yet leeched all the heat from her body looks like dirt some grass we can hope for fibers or skin broken wrist looks like a broken jaw multiple contusions and abrasions on face torso shoulders did a number on you lily appearance of sexual assault some evidence of vaginal bleeding contusions abrasions on thighs and genital area removing some fibers into evidence she worked meticulously plucking tiny fibers from the body never flinching as she took them from the genital area she sealed them tagged them logged them and if part of her system revolted much as the rookies had if part of her wanted to scream at the visions of rape she refused them and continued on still wearing the goggles she leaned down into the dead face and studied the bloody holes where the eyes had been smooth clean cuts similar to those inflicted on elisa maplewood dallas peabody she didnt look around and thought only briefly that she missed for some reason the telltale clomp of peabodys uniform shoes weve got the kill site just south first on scene is queeks verified that scenes secured crime scenes right behind me take part of the team with you have them start looking in a direct path from that scene to this for impressions in the grass but dont let anybody mess with that scene until ive seen it on that uniforms found her no eve straightened now celina sanchez had another vision eve finished her exam of the body and the dump site then walked to where roarke stood just behind the crime scene sensors queeks had set up shed remember that she thought remember that officer queeks worked quick and quiet and didnt annoy the primary with a lot of chatter and questions you dont have to wait ill wait roarke said im in it now guess you are well come with me youve got good eyes maybe youll spot something i miss she took a wide circular route to the second scene if hed left impressions in the grass again she didnt want to disturb them she nodded to queeks good work wheres the rookie i got him out securing the entrances with a couple of the guys hes okay lieutenant just green only been on the job three months and this was his first body it was a tough one too but he maintained until he was well away from the scene im not writing him up for hurling queeks you see anything i should know about other than the body we came in the same entrance as you got one on all four sides we headed south intending to make a circle saw her pretty quick didnt observe anyone else not in the park or on the street we were just coming out of a double d on varick when the call came through on this some street people out some diehard lcs trolling but no one that fit the description we were given how long have you worked in this sector about a dozen you know oharas sure mick place down on albany decent place foods tolerable what time does it close two earlier if its slow okay thanks peabody some blood some of the grass is ripped up somes tamped down got a couple of small scraps of cloth might be from an article of clothing i can see all that peabody what do you see well i think he took her just inside the south entrance as shed started in to cut across the park couldve grabbed her outside but more likely she cut in he took her down here assaulted overpowered tore some of her clothes in the struggle though theres no indication she put up much of a fight raped her here i havent examined the body but it looks like maybe she dug her fingers into the grass as it appears to be the same mo as maplewood he would have strangled her at this point taken her clothes then carried her to the other location where he could pose her and remove her eyes yeah thats what i see inside though she cut through shortcut home patrols go by here regularly park stays pretty clean safe hed have to work fast but thats no problem for him hes got the routine knocked now time of death was oh two hundred almost on the dot first arrived two hundred twenty minutes you factor in the time it took him to undress her carry her pose her mutilate her he cut it close this time he couldve still been in the park when they arrived eve glanced back at roarke lifted her eyebrows he could have heard them car pulls up doors slam he moves off out of the lights behind any number of trees wouldnt he if he could enjoy watching her be discovered yeah yeah he would hed only just finished with her and wouldnt he need a moment to pat himself on the back for the fine job hed done unable to help himself roarke glanced back to where lily napier lay on the bench he hears someone coming and nips back hed kill them if he had to that would be his thinking but how gratifying it must have been to see cops find her so quickly so fresh with him able to see then hes out the opposite direction with a nice bonus to his evening as shed speculated along the exact same lines herself she nodded youre getting good at this i want a thorough sweep of the entire park every blade of grass every flower petal every tree he seals up lieutenant peabody reminded her we dont have his dna his blood type his hair nothing to match if they could find anything in an area this size he seals up eve held out a hand turned it over so the smears of blood shone in the light the too were not looking for his dna were looking for hers again she stepped back but this time she gestured to roarke lets take a little walk youre hoping to be able to see his direction where he moved how he moved anything that adds a line to his pictures good she needed to get away from cop eyes from cop ears and kept going until they were out of the park again on the sidewalk i think geographically hes closer to home here than he was with maplewood but it doesnt matter to him hell go where he needs to go and you didnt come all the way out here to tell me that no look theres no point in you waiting were going to be at this awhile then ive got to go into central deja vu yeah this guy likes night work you havent had more than an hours sleep ill catch some in my office she started to wipe her hand absently on her trousers but he caught her wrist hold on he opened her field kit took out a rag right cleaning the blood off her hands she stared back through the stone arch the park was brilliant with light now the sweepers in their protective suits moved through it like silent images on a screen the media would pounce soon hey always did and would have to be dealt with before much longer lights would go on in the windows of surrounding buildings some would glance out see and wonder then civilians would have to be dealt with she was going to shut down the park so the mayor would have to be dealt with the fun never quit whats on your mind lieutenant too many things and ive got to start lining them up im going to be calling celina into central get a detailed report of her vision im going to have a couple of softclothes cops escort her in eight hundred she stuck her hands in her pockets pulled them out again when she remembered shed wiped off the blood but hadnt cleaned off the sealant heres the thing when she said nothing else only continued to stare into the park roarke cocked his head and that thing would be she said she was home in bed when she contacted me id just like to verify that thats all just like to nail that down you dont believe her i dont not believe her i just want to verify so its off my mind so i dont find myself wondering thats all and if someone could gain access to her bedroom when she was elsewhere check her link you wouldnt find yourself wondering yes she looked at him then and i cant believe im standing here asking you to commit a crime i know if she was home in bed when she contacted me she couldnt have been here when the murder took place not when she called minutes after napiers death i could request a check of her link send an eman to her place with her permission but it seems rude she rolled her eyes i dont give a rats ass about seeming rude but i do about making an ass of myself i do about potentially alienating a valuable source eight oclock then she was torn between relief and worry listen ill contact you when she comes in just to make sure its clear if you get caught darling eve there was a deliberate wealth of patience in his tone i love you more than life itself and have i believe demonstrated that regularly throughout our relationship so i cant understand why you persist in insulting me the neither just in and out just the link dont go poking around if it checks out dont contact me if it doesnt tag me on my personal shouldnt we have code words she sent him a withering look as he grinned at her yeah bite me laughing he jerked her forward and did just that giving her a quick nip on the chin before brushing his lips over hers ill find my own way home get a little sleep eve turned back toward the arch back toward death and didnt see how she could notifying next of kin was always hideous but it was worse somehow worse when it had to be done in the middle of the night she depressed the buzzer on an apartment on the lower west side and prepared to take a slice out of someones world there was a wait long enough she was preparing to ring again when the intercom blinked on yes what is it police eve held up her badge stood with it in view of the peep we need to speak with carleen steeple its four in the fricking morning whats this about sir we need to come inside the intercom clicked off followed by an irritated rattle of chains and locks the man who opened the door wore nothing but a pair of loose cotton pants and an annoyed expression whats this about some of us are trying to sleep and i dont want you waking up the kids were sorry to disturb you mr steeple the brotherinlaw eve thought according to the data im lieutenant dallas this is detective peabody we need to speak to your wife andy a woman with short curly sleepruffled hair poked her face out of a doorway whats going on cops look we reported the illegals deals we saw and the junkies roaming around in the broad fricking daylight we did our civic duty and dont appreciate getting hassled in the middle of the night were not with illegals mr steeple carleen steeple the woman eased out tugging at the belt of a robe yes your sister is lily napier yes there was a flicker over her face that first dawning of fear is something wrong im sorry to inform you your sisters dead no she said it quietly the single sound on the verge of a question oh jesus jesus andy steeple transformed from pissedoff man to concerned husband in a snap he walked quickly to his wife gathered her against him oh honey what happened he asked eve what happened to lily no carleen said again just no can we sit down mr steeple he gestured toward a seating area with comfortably worn chairs a sofa

alone walked into a galleystyle kitchen with a bump out for eating there were benches for seating covered by cushions with zigzagging patterns of yellows and blues yellow curtains with blue borders framed the windows place mats she supposed you called them lay on the table at each space and matched the bench cushion eve picked one up lingering it lieutenant dallas steeple came to the doorway were ready now im going to make some coffee i think we could all use some they sat in the living area and with the little girl settled down peabody joined them carleens eyes were stark and damp but

the other woman he asked eve i saw it on the news i saw you is this the same were pursuing that probability she was eve saw it in his eyes mutilated but he stopped himself from saying the word and drew his wife closer she was killed uptown yes mrs steeple did lily do crafts crafts lily a smile trembled onto her lips no she didnt like to play house as she called it it was part of the problem between her and rip he wanted a homebody and lily just wasnt you have what look like banderafted pieces in the other room kikis room too peabody added its a lovely quilt on her bed thats my work when i got pregnant with drew our son i decided well we decided she amended linking her fingers with her husbands that id try the professional mother route i wanted to be able to stay home with the children then i realized pretty quickly id need something to do i started quilting then that expanded to needlepoint macrame i enjoy it where do you get your supplies what does this have to do with lily mrs steeple where do you get your craft supplies a number of places she named several on eves list did lily ever go with you when you shopped for supplies well yes we often shopped together for a

want to know i want i know what you want but what you need to do is take care of your wife of your family you need to leave the rest of it to us you didnt know her you didnt know lily no but i know her now chapter eleven it was after five am when eve walked into homicide the skeleton squad from the graveyard shift was handling the links catching up on paperwork or sleep she gestured a comeahead to peabody so her partner would follow her into her office ive got to contact whitney better you than me while i do you tag celina inform her were sending a couple of plainclothes to bring her in for a statement i want her here at eight hundred hours then find me two cops to take the detail when you get that set you should catch a couple hours in the crib dont have to tell me that twice gonna join me no ill stretch out in my office where just get this set up and close the door behind you alone eve stared at the link and recited a little mantra in her head let the commander answer and not his wife let the commander answer and not his wife in the name of all thats holy let the commander answer and not his wife then sucking it up she sat down and made the call she nearly let out a cheer when whitneys tired face popped on screen im sorry to wake you sir theres been a homicide in memorial park single victim caucasian female age twentyeight sexual homicide with mutilation the same mo as maplewood scene secure it is sir ive closed the park and have men at every entrance closed it yes sir its necessary for the next ten to twentyfour hours he let out a long long sigh which means its necessary for me to wake up the mayor i want a full report on my desk by eight hundred hours ill see you in my office at nine hundred yes sir eve looked at the blank screen no she didnt see how she was going to manage sleep she input her notes and the record from on scene preparing for the long day ahead she programmed a full pot of coffee then sat to refine her report she read it over searching for any missed details finding none she ran standard probabilities included the results then she saved it filed it and copied her commander her partner and mira rising she pinned lily napiers photos alive and dead to her board at sevenfifteen she set her wrist unit stretched out on the floor and slept restlessly for twenty minutes primed with another cup of coffee she took a shower in the facilities off the locker room briefly she considered popping some stayup but it always made her feel jittery and strange if she was going to be heavily caffeinated she preferred doing it with coffee she opted to use a conference room rather than her office for her session with celina and since peabody didnt appear to be up from her nap scheduled it herself then she called down to the desk sergeant on duty and requested to be informed when celina sanchez checked in rather than tolerate the swill the department offered she culled another pot of coffee from her office and carried it to the conference room the desk sergeant beeped her just as peabody came in she sniffed the air god just pour it in a saucer and ill lap it up get us some bagels or something from vending first eve told her charge them to the squad budget youre actually thinking about food i must be dreaming sanchez is on her way up so get your ass moving thats the dallas i know and love when the door was shut again eve pulled out her personal link and beeped roarkes he answered quickly okay shes eve narrowed her eyes where are you about to continue my little adventure in daytime breaking and entering i told you to wait until i contacted you hmm he smiled and continued to work on celinas bedside link it appears ive disobeyed once again i expect to be roundly punished at the first opportunity damn it would you like to continue this chat or let me get on with things do it in celinas bedroom roarke smiled to himself he had a habit of irritating his wife and was afraid he was just small enough to enjoy it hed watched the cops pull up go into celinas building casual shirts and trousers aside hed have made them as what they were at two blocks heading in the opposite direction cops looked like cops especially to the eye of a criminal even a former criminal and though he trusted his cop implicitly he preferred casing a job personally ten minutes after celina had come out and driven off with her escort it was always best to make certain the mark didnt turn around and go back for something forgotten he jammed her security cameras with a remote and strolled across the street under three minutes later he was through the outside locks and alarms and strolling inside a short time later hed verified the source of the transmission and was replacing the link celina had made the call exactly as shed claimed from her own bedside unit moments after two am his cop could stop wondering it was hard to resist that poking around eve had warned him against it was after all in his nature she his cop would never understand the hum in the blood that came from simply being where you were not allowed to be he gave himself a moment of it admiring the art on the bedroom walls fanciful sensual evocative the color scheme that was richly and confidently female and if he wandered the second level of the loft he was technically on his way out he liked the style the openness of space and again what he saw as the confidence of a woman who knew how she wanted to live and did so he thought it might be interesting to hire her for some business event down the road he strolled out as hed strolled in and with a check of the time calculated hed be in midtown in plenty of time for his first meeting of the day he didnt beep her eve knew roarke and his clever fingers when her personal link hadnt signaled by the time celina was brought into the conference room she knew the transmission was verified as being made from the bedroom link as stated no need to wonder she thought and no mistaking the emotional state of the stricken and exhausted woman who came into the room she looked drawn and sallow like someone who was recovering from a long and severe illness dallas have a seat have some coffee i will she sat at the conference table and used both hands to lift the mug her rings clinked lightly against the cheap stoneware i took a soother after we spoke last night didnt help very much i took another right before i came in that doesnt seem to be doing the job either what id like to do is tranq myself into a coma but im not sure that would help either it wouldnt help lily napier thats her name she drank paused drank again i didnt turn on the media reports this morning i was afraid id see her you saw her last night celina nodded it was worse than the last one what i mean is for me im not equipped for this its very difficult for someone with your gift to witness or experience violence peabody said and was rewarded with a grateful smile yes god yes its not that i experience the same extent the full physical extent of the violence as the victim but enough and if when youre linked psychically the emotions reverberate in you i know how she suffered im alive im alive and whole and drinking coffee while shes not but i know how she suffered tell me what you saw eve ordered it was celina held up a hand as if halting everything until she gathered herself the other time it was like a dream a vivid and disturbing dream but something i could dismiss as just that until i saw the media reports this was more i wouldnt have couldnt have mistaken it for anything but a vision one of the most powerful ive ever had it was like being there walking alongside her she walked quickly with her head down what was she wearing ah dark skirt black i think short a white shirt long sleeves open collar and a little cardiganstyle sweater over it flat shoes with thick soles gelsoles perhaps she barely made a sound she had a bag a small purse she wore on a strap over her shoulder what was he wearing dark i dont know she didnt know he was there waiting inside the park in the shadows he was dark everything about him is dark skin is he black no i no i dont think i see his hands when he strikes at her theyre white glossy and white and big very big he struck her in the face there was horrible pain horrible and she fell and the pain went away she passed out i think he hit her kept hitting her even when she was unconscious in the face in the body see how you like it see how you like it celinas eyes went glassy the pale pale green of the irises nearly translucent whos the boss now whos in charge now you bitch but he stops he stops beating her slaps her cheeks lightly with those big hands bringing her around she needs to be awake for the rest theres such pain i dont know dont know if its his or hers theres so much pain its not your pain peabody said quietly and shook her head before eve could speak youre a witness and you can tell us what you see its not your pain not mine celina breathed in deep he tears her clothes she cant fight barely struggles and when she tries to push at him he yanks her hand away something in her breaks shes confused the way an animals confused when its caught in a trap he rapes her and it hurts it hurts deep inside she cant see him its too dark and the pain is overwhelming she goes under again its safer there theres no pain there she doesnt feel when he kills her her body reacts convulsing and that theres a thrill in that for him her death throes bring him to orgasm im sick celina pressed the back of her hand to her mouth im sorry im sick i need to here come on peabody was up drawing celina to her feet come with me as peabody helped her out of the room eve pushed away from the table she walked to one of the windows shoved it open so she could lean out lean out and breathe she understood the nausea all too well what it was like to see again and again to feel over and over and the sickness that came with it she let the air and the noise the life of the city push it out of her again she watched an airtram crammed with commuters streak by and an ad blimp hover spewing out its announcements for sales events tourist packages her legs felt watery yet so she stayed where she was listening to the click of chopper blades the blast of horns from the street below the rattle of an airbus it all teemed together a cacophony that was a kind of music to her a song she understood and one that gave her a sense of place she was never really alone in the city never helpless with her badge remembering pain knowing its source could make her stronger it was good to know that steadier she closed the window walked back to the table and poured more coffee some of the color had seeped back into celinas cheeks when peabody brought her back in shed fussed with her face a little bright lip dye eye gunk to cover the worst of the damage women in eves opinion could worry about the strangest things at the strangest times once celina was seated peabody went over to get a bottle of water youre better off with this than the coffee she said setting it on the table yes youre right thanks she held out a hand gave peabodys a squeeze thank you for staying with me helping me pull myself back together no problem you must think me very weak she said to eve youre wrong i dont think anything of the kind i we she amended we come to them after its done and we see day after day the results of what people can do to each other the blood the gore the waste its not easy it should never be easy but we dont see it happening how it happens we dont feel what the victim feels and have to take it in yes you do celina wiped her fingers under her eyes youve just found a way to handle it now i have to she steadied herself with more water he undressed her after i think there was a part of me by now resisting the vision fighting it but i think he took her clothes they were torn from the rape he carried her not her damn it she sipped water took three long breaths what i mean is shes someone else to him he sees someone else and hes punishing someone else someone who punished him in the dark hes afraid of the dark he kills at night eve pointed out he has to he has to overcome it possibly what else i broke out of the vision i broke out because i couldnt stand it and i called you i know i should have let it run its course i might have seen something that could help i was panicked and i fought it until i broke out we got to her to the scene quicker because you contacted me we were able to preserve the scene because we were able to get there so fast that matters i hope to god it does are you any closer to him i think we are celina closed her eyes thank god if you have anything of his i can try to see him we have the murder weapon celina shook her head ill try but its bound to be like it was before so what i see feel is the act itself and the emotions raging through it i need something hes touched with his bare hands something hes worn or held to really see him to add to what you already know eve laid the cord on the table try anyway celina wet her lips then reached out touched the ribbon her head snapped back and her eyes rolled up so only a slice of green showed in the white as she started to slide out of the chair her fingers went limp and released the ribbon eve leaped up caught her before she hit the ground all him nothing of her shes gone hidden away when he puts it around her neck theres just his rage and fear and excitement its all over me like like insects biting at my skin horrible what does he do when hes done with her goes back to the light he can go back to the light i dont know what it means my head my heads splitting well get you something for it and have you taken home peabody lets get you a blocker do you want to rest before you go home no she leaned against peabody i just want to go celina eve covered the red ribbon with her hand so when the woman turned she didnt see it you might want to talk to dr mira a little counseling i appreciate the thought i really do but counseling her daughter is wiccan and a sensitive ah charlotte mira shes the best and it might help you to talk to someone whod understand your situation it might thanks when she was alone eve lifted the red cord studied it she didnt need to hold it to see or to feel gift she wondered or curse neither she decided and sealed the ribbon again it was a tool nothing more or less she was trying to find the energy just to stand when the door opened and commander whitney came in she rose immediately sir ive just finished interviewing sanchez and was on my way to your office sit wheres that coffee from my office commander then itll be well worth it he got himself a mug poured then sat across from her saying nothing he scanned her face while he drank how much sleep you bank a couple hours less but who was counting looks it and the fact of that occurred to me when i came in and read your report youve been eleven years give or take a few months under my command havent you lieutenant yes sir that length of time and your rank and you dont feel it would be justified even reasonable to inform me that youre not only running on fumes but have a vital interview scheduled for eight hundred hours when i ordered you to report to my office at nine hundred since he seemed to want an honest answer she took a moment to consider the question no sir he rubbed the bridge of his nose i thought as much you eat any of those he jerked his chin toward the bagels no sir but theyre fresh from vending well as fresh as we get from vending eat one now sir eat dallas indulge me you look like hell she picked one up matches how i feel i spoke with the mayor and have a meeting with him and chief tibbie in about thirty your presence was requested at the mayors office sir or the tower mayors office but i will inform his honor and the chief that youre unable to attend as you are in the field she didnt speak but something must have run over her face something that made him smile tell me what just went through your mind and dont clean it up thats an order i wasnt thinking anything actually sir but i was mentally kissing your feet he laughed picked up half a bagel broke that in half and bit in youll miss some fireworks shutting down a public park i need the scene preserved while the sweepers comb it and the mayor will counter after all the political malarkey that according to all reports this perpetrator seals and therefore youre wasting public funds police manhours and denying the citizens of new york access to public grounds while you chase the wild goose politics werent her forte but shed already gotten there on her own the timing in all probability he was still inside the park very likely still with the victim at the dump site when the first officers on scene arrived he had to have her blood on him if the timing was that close he might not have had the time or the inclination to clean up i know he didnt we found blood trails already from kill site to dump site and from there heading east if i can mark his trail his movements do you think because ive sat at a desk i dont remember how it works in the thick every piece you find is another piece simple as that and while the mayor may not understand that tibbie will well handle it thank you sir whats your next move i want to bring in edd ive been compiling a list residents in a sector that rays out from the craft shop that each of the vies frequented and a couple of gyms i need to check out that may apply i need to juggle it down crosscheck we find names we find matches residents members customers we match and we eliminate and we find him feeney can cut through it faster faster than i can and then i can stay in the field instead of at a comp get it started she walked out with him and parted ways to go back to her office it was easy to brief feeney he understood her shorthand her direction wont be quick he warned her but well get on it as soon as you get us the data im going to pressure the customer lists from the craft shop actually two of them ones out of the parameter but not by much ill do the same at the gyms for membership lists ill feed you what i get as i get it and shoot the data we gathered last night to your office unit works for me ive been running eye banks donors and receivers i think its a time waster but it has to be factored in im going to give you what ive got on that so you can add it to the mix give me all you got youre looking pretty peaky there dallas peaky jeez she cut transmission she zipped files lists even her work notes to feeney despite the peaky remark she thought he had a cops brain maybe outside of the ework hed see something shed missed she grabbed the jacket shed forgotten to put back on after her shower striding into the bull pen she gave peabody a comeahead lets roll out chapter twelve what does peaky mean peabody wrinkled her brow i dunno ah a little looksee you know peekaboo no eve idled at a light as applies to someones appearance they look peaky beats me but it doesnt sound good want me to try to look it up no i asked feeney to do the matches looking for names that come up residentially and in consumer and or employee lists from the area weve outlined the shops and fitness facilities within we need to get the lists feeney will find matches quicker than either of us but its still going to take time considering the size of the area and the number of people were dealing with then theres the number of matches to wade through people tend to do at least some of their shopping and business in their own neighborhoods then we profile them unmarried males to start i can follow the detecting dots he likely lives alone is between thirty and fifty closer to thirty eve interrupted close i think to the ages of his victims why i dont know just feels right it could be a kind of trigger couldnt it the age the age he is himself the age he sees her the one hes really killing hes grown up hes on equal ground now he can punish her eve jerked a shoulder i sound like mira some and like mira it sounds plausible so we assume hes around thirty we know hes strong has big feet according to our civilian consultant he also has big hands and is well over six feet in height but we can verify through evidence the strength and the feet while negotiating traffic eve glanced at her partner doesnt sound like youre convinced by our civilian consultant i believe her but her visions arent hard fact we work with the facts and consider the rest now thats the kind of cynicism i like to hear she isnt making this stuff up and she didnt fake her reaction to the murder weapon dogsick in the bathroom another couple of minutes id have called an mt but visions can be tricky can they you know when it comes to sarcasm you have perfect pitch what im saying is visions often twist around reality interested eve glanced over for instance for instance celina may see the killer as unusually big tall large hands and so on because hes powerful not only physically which we can determine by the mo but in some other way professionally say or financially or she sees him this way because he kills and thats frightening to her the boogie mans a big guy okay eve nodded as she began the hunt for parking keep going we know his shoe size and that its considerably larger than average from this we can extrapolate that he is probably taller than average for a man we know hes strong enough powerful enough you could say to carry a woman the dead weight of that woman nearly fifty yards and down a short but fairly steep cliff its cop work thats giving us the most likely picture of his physical type not visions does the cop work confirm her visions or do her visions confirm the cop work its both isnt it peabody held her breath when eve utilized the vertical and lateral modes to squeeze into an empty slice of space at a curb then let it out when it actually worked civilian consultants are tools but we have to know how to use them eve eyed the traffic waiting for a break in it where she could get out of the car without being slammed into the pavement she doesnt see his face could be he wears a mask or it could be shes too afraid to look that she blocks it eve stepped onto the sidewalk can she do that if shes strong enough and scared enough and shes plenty scared shes not a cop dallas peabody continued as they walked shes seeing murder and its not her choice the way it is ours we dont want to see it we dont pick up the badge we sure as hell dont work in homicide i chose this because i wanted to live and work in new york always did i wanted to be a cop and the kind of cop who found the big answers to the big questions who worked for people whod been victimized and against the ones whod made them victims you close enough okay but celina didnt choose she didnt decide hey i want to be a psychic thatd be frosty but she took what was laid on her and made her life work with it gotta respect that eve gave a brief glance at the sidewalk sleeper with his grimy license hung around his neck who was happily posing for tourists now this comes along peabody added and i think one of her biggest fears is that this new deal isnt a oneshot that shes afraid murder is going to be something she sees even after this ones over its weighty that mustve been some puke session peabody snorted out a laugh gold metal status but what im saying is shes trying and its costing her she may help us but in the end its our job not hers agreed eve stopped outside the craft shop using sensitives is problematic under the best of circumstances the best being the sensitive is coptrained and elects to be part of the investigative team weve got neither of those things in this case but shes linked into this locked in so none of us has a choice well use her ask the questions follow up on her visions and you hold her head when she barfs she reached for the door stopped why new york peabody big bad city hey you want to be a crime fighter you want to fight big bad crime lots of big bad cities out there none of them is new york thoughtfully eve studied the traffic jammed on the streets horns blasted in arrogant defiance of city ordinances on the corner a glidecart vender shouted out colorful insults to the retreating back of a customer whod obviously annoyed him you got that right well well this is a very unusual request the store manager dithered in her tiny office where the single chair was covered in what looked to eve to be a lot of scraps stuck together in a pattern that worshipped some demanding and possibly psychotic god of color she was a fortyish woman with apple cheeks and a constant smile she continued to use it even as she stood wringing her hands together and looking confused you do keep a customer list ms chancy well of course of course we do most of our clientele repeat and they appreciate being notified of specials and sales and events why just last week we had ms chancy we just want the list yes well yes lieutenant is it it sure is you see ive never had a request of this nature and im unsure how to proceed let me help you out with that you give us the list and we say thank you for your cooperation but our customers they may object if they feel ive somehow infringed on their privacy they may object you see and shop elsewhere it wasnt difficult in the confined space for peabody to nudge eve we can assure you of our discretion ms chancy she said this is a very serious matter were investigating and we need your help but theres no reason for us to reveal to any of your customers how we obtained their name oh i see i see but she continued to stand biting her smiling lip what a beautiful quilt chair peabody ran her hand over it is this your work yes yes it is im particularly proud of it i can see why its exceptional work thank you do you quilt a little i do a little of this a little of that im hoping to make more time for my handwork in the future especially since im moving to a new apartment shortly id like to have it reflect my interests well of course ms chancy said enthusiastically i noticed how well supplied and how organized your shop is ill certainly be back in an unofficial capacity as soon as ive settled into my new place wonderful let me give you our store information we hold classes you know and have monthly clubs for any interest she plucked a disc out of a box covered with fabric daisies great you know lieutenant handcrafting not only gives you the opportunity to create beautiful things that reflect your own style and personality while honoring centuries of traditions but is very therapeutic i imagine anyone in your line of work needs to be able to relax and cleanse the soul right peabody swallowed the tickle of laughter at her field promotion by the shopkeeper i couldnt agree more i have a number of friends and associates who could use the same really if we could have your customer list ms chancy peabody gave her a bright toothy smile wed very much appreciate your cooperation and your support of the nypsd oh hmm when you put it that way she cleared her throat but youll be discreet peabody kept the smile plastered on her face absolutely ill just make you a copy back on the street peabodys smile turned smug and there was a little bounce to her step as she walked well well what come on she jabbed eve with her elbow spread a little glory eve stopped at a glidecart caffeine was going to be an essential part of the day couple tubes of pepsi she ordered one straight one pepsi fitness watching the weight she said to eve eve shrugged dug out credits she took the first hit and decided there was hope left in the world you did a good job maybe a longer dance than the one with me smashing chancys face into her desk but not as messy see now that were partners i can be the one with the voice of reason uhhuh what was up with that chair quilt chair they can be a real focal point homey or amusing or striking and its a clever way to recycle scraps from other projects i didnt like her choice of fabrics but the workmanship was first class gee the things you learn eve said that have absolutely no use pick up the pace peabody its a quicker way to ditch the weight than drinking pfs but see im drinking the pf and exercising which means i can have dessert at the dinner party tonight so what are you wearing what am i oh shit i dont think thats appropriate attire for a casual dinner we have to go she continued before eve could speak unless things heat up we have to a couple three hours after shift socializing and recreating with friends isnt going to hamper the investigation dallas jeez she chugged pepsi as she strode the half a block north toward the first fitness center its weird enough this whole cozy gathering but now i have to do it on no sleep and with bodies piling up my life used to be simple mmm it did because it didnt have all these people in it if you need to shove somebody out you know to simplify could you give roarke the push see mcnab and i have this understanding if roarkes clear i get to take my shot at him mcnab gets one at you when eve choked on the last swallow from the tube peabody gave her a helpful thump on the back joking just sort of joking you and mcnab have a sick sick relationship we do peabody beamed it makes us very happy jims gym was a hole in the wall down a dingy flight of stairs and through a muscular iron door eve assumed if a prospective member couldnt handle the door he was laughed back up to the sidewalk where he could slink away holding his puny biceps it smelled male but not in a flattering sense it was the kind of odor that hit you dead center of the face like a fist wrapped in a sweaty jock strap paint was peeling from the walls that had been tuned up to an industrial gray around the time shed been born there were rusty splotches in the ceiling from water damage and a grimy beige floor so soaked with sweat and blood the fumes of both rose up like fetid fog she imagined the men who frequented the place breathed it in like perfume the equipment was elemental no frills weights and bars a couple of heavy bags a couple of speed bags there were a few clunky machines that looked to have been manufactured in the last century a single spotted mirror where a man built like a cargo shuttle was doing biceps curls another was benchpressing what looked like your average redwood without a spotter she imagined the concept of spotters would be spat upon in such facilities a third man pummeled one of the heavy bags like it was an adulterous exwife all were stripped down to baggy gray sweatpants and shirts with the arms ripped off like a uniform she thought all that was missing were the words bad ass emblazoned over the chest when eve and peabody stepped in all movement stopped biceps curls held his fiftypounder suspended bench press clanked his redwood in the safety and heavy bag stood pouring sweat with his fist laid into the bag in the silence eve heard the echoing thuds from the next room and the encouraging lead with your left you stupid fuck she scanned the faces then went with heavy bag because he was the closest place got a manager to her amazement he flushed scarlet all two hundred twentyfive pounds of him ah just jim hes um he owns the place hes um um hes got beaner sparring over in the ring maam she started across the room bench press sat up eyed her with open suspicion and considerable dislike jim he dont take no females in here jim must be unaware that its illegal to discriminate due to sex discriminate he barked a laugh and sneered he dont discriminate he just dont take no females a fine distinction what you got there two seventyfive that be about your weight he swiped sweat from his wide cocoacolored face guy cant bench his weight hes a girl with a nod eve unlocked the weights adjusted them thats my weight then she wagged a thumb inviting him to rise heavy bag stepped over as she positioned herself on the bench maam you dont want to hurt yourself no i dont spot me peabody sure eve curled her hands around the bar set and did ten slow steady reps she replaced the bar slid off the bench i aint no girl she nodded to heavy bag who blushed again then strolled toward the next room i cant bench my weight yet peabody said in an undertone i guess im a girl practice she stopped to watch the sparring match there was a bruiser in the ring with black skin so glossy it looked oiled he had treetrunk legs abs that looked like ridges of steel a punishing right she noted but he telegraphed it by dropping his left shoulder his opponent was in the nordic god style and quick on his feet when she stepped closer she made it as a droid the trainer was wrapped in gray sweats and jogged to different spots outside the ring to shout instruction and insult with equal fervor he was about five eight eve judged and on the shady side of fifty from the looks of it his nose had had the occasion to meet someones fist with some regularity when he peeled back his lips to spew abuse on his fighter eve caught the glint of a silver tooth she waited until the end of the round and watched the black guy heavyweight division hang his head as the flyweight berated him from outside the ropes sorry to interrupt eve began jims head whipped around i dont like women in my place he heaved a towel at his fighter then rolled toward eve like a small tank out eve took out her badge why dont we start over female cops worse than a regular female this is my place man oughta be able to do what he wants to do in his own place and not have some female cop come around telling him he has to cater to women he was working up a good head of steam eyes bulging head bopping like a pigeons feet dancing in place ill shut down before i have females prancing around here and asking me wheres the fucking lemon water arent we both lucky im not here to bust your chops about your overt violations of discrimination laws discrimination my ass this is a serious gym not some froufrou palace so i see im lieutenant dallas this is detective peabody were homicide well i sure as hell havent killed anybody lately thats a big relief to me jim you got an office why so we could go there and have a discussion instead of me cuffing you and hauling your disagreeable ass into central to have the discussion there im not interested in shutting you down i dont give a rats skinny ass if you block women from your membership list or if you haul them in by the bargeload to dance naked in the showers providing you have shower facilities which from the smell of things you dont i got showers i got an office this is my place and i run it my way fine and good your office or mine jim goddamn females you he jabbed a finger at his fighter who continued to stand gloves dangling head down you do an hour with the rope till you learn what to do with your damn clumsy feet i gotta go have a discussion he marched off things started going downhill peabody commented as they started after him as soon as they gave us the vote bet he has that sad day circled in funeral black on his perpetual calendar they had to climb a set of rusty iron stairs to a second level the amazing stench of body odor mildew and flatulence identified the shower facilities and made the eyes water even eve who didnt consider herself overly fussy was forced to agree with peabodys whispered gross jim turned into a room identified as his office by the desk buried under sparring gloves mouth guards paper and used towels the walls were decorated with photos of a younger jim in boxing trunks in one he held a title belt aloft since his right eye was swollen shut his nose bloody and his torso blackandblue she assumed it hadnt been an easy victory what year did you take the title eve asked him fortyfive twelve rounds knocked hardy into a coma took him three days to come out of it you must be proud were conducting an investigation into the rape and strangulation of two women dont know nothing about it he tossed what might have been a pile of dirty laundry off a chair and sat got two exwives gave up on women after the second one wise choice we believe the killer lives works or frequents this area which is it typical female cant make up your mind i can see why you have those two exwives jim youre such a charmer two women are dead they were beaten raped strangled and mutilated for no reason other than they were women the cocky grin faded from his face thats why i dont watch nothing but the sports channels you think i go around beating and raping and killing women i gotta get me a damn lawyer now thats up to you youre not a suspect but we believe the man who killed these woman who may have killed others is serious about his body maintenance hes big and hes very strong youd get that type in here well jesus h christ what am i supposed to do ask a guy when he comes in to lift if hes going out to strangle some woman after youre supposed to cooperate with the authorities and give me your membership list i know laws and shit i dont have to do that unless you slap me with a warrant try this instead eve reached into peabodys bag and took out elisa maplewoods id photo this is what one of his victims looked like before i wont show you the after you wouldnt recognize her not after what hed done to her she had a fouryearold daughter jesus h christ he looked away from it glowered at the wall i know the guys who come in here you think id let some crazy womankiller use my place id sooner have females the membership list he puffed out his cheeks i dont hold with rape mans got a hand doesnt he plenty of lcs around if hes got to stick his dick in something i dont hold with rape worse than killing you ask me he shoved at the debris on his desk until he unearthed an ancient portable computer peabody heaved out a breath when they were back on the street that was an experience my olfactory sense is still in shock it may take a week to recover some of the places we hit yesterday were a little ripe and you could say colorful but that wins the trophy weve got another one to go second craft place is two blocks west well hit that double back and take the next gym peabody calculated the distance already hiked the distance yet to go i get two desserts tonight it took more than two hours it wouldve taken longer but they caught an assistant manager at the craft center who was so excited at the prospect of being even a peripheral part of a murder investigation she would have given them every scrap of data at her fingertips the second gym was cleaner more crowded and a great deal less pungent but the manager insisted on speaking with the owner who refused any cooperation until he himself could come in to deal with the situation he was a hardbodied six three a lightskinned asian with a skullcap of saltandpepper hair he offered eve a hand and took hers in the careful way of a big man who was aware of his size and strength ive heard about these murders its a terrible thing yes sir it is why dont we sit down his office wasnt any larger than jims but it looked to have been cleaned and outfitted not only within the last quarter century but perhaps within the last week i understand you want a list of our members thats right our investigation indicates the killer may use facilities such as this i dont like to think im acquainted with or doing business with anyone who could do something like this its not that i dont want to cooperate lieutenant but it seems i should consult with my lawyer first membership lists are confidential youre free to do so mr ling well get a warrant itll take some time but well get one and the time it takes may give him the opportunity to kill another woman i hear the subtext loud and clear im going to give you the list but im going to ask if you need anything else to come directly to me rather than my manager ill give you my private number men gossip lieutenant the same as anybody i dont want our members put off by the idea they may be pumping iron or showering off next to a homicidal maniac thats no problem she waited a moment while he ordered his computer to access the membership list and copy to disc you dont cater to women female members are welcome he said with a hint of a smile otherwise id be in violation of federal and state statutes regarding discrimination but oddly enough youll see we have no women on our membership list currently surprise surprise well let feeney run with this awhile and grab a couple hours sleep eve said when she and peabody walked back toward homicide were going to need followups with morris and mira and if theres no report from the lab by fifteen hundred we need to kick dickhead want me to set them up no ill she stopped when she saw the big man rise from a bench outside her division yeah go ahead then take the two hours of personal eve hung back until peabody moved off into the bull pen then dipping her hands in her pockets walked forward hey crack dallas good thing you came along when you did cops they get nervous when a big beautiful black man hangs around big he was black he was but beautiful not even close he had a face even a besotted mother would have a hard time loving and that was before the tattoos he wore a skintight silver tshirt under a long black leather vest snug black pants followed the acreage of his legs thicksoled black boots added another inch to his already impressive height he owned a sex club called the down and dirty where the drinks were next to lethal the music was hot and many of the patrons had spent as much time in a cage as out of one they called him crack as he claimed that was the sound he made when he knocked peoples heads together and that summer eve had held him while hed wept like a baby beside the body of his murdered sister you just here to scare cops she asked nothing scares you white girl you got a minute maybe some place without so many ears sure she led the way into her office shut the door cop shops he said with a glimmer of a smile dont know as ive ever been in one in what you might call a voluntary capacity want coffee he shook his head shifting his bulk to look out the window aint much of a place here hot stuff no but its mine you going to sit again he shook his head aint see you in a while no the silence hung a moment as they both thought of the last time theyd seen each other last time i did was when you come by my place to tell me facetoface that you got the bastard killed my sister i didnt have much to say to you wasnt much to say his shoulders lifted fell no too much to say i went by your place a couple weeks ago barman said you were out of town couldnt stay here after what happened to my baby had to get away awhile did me some traveling bigass world out there took a look at some of it never thanked you for what you did for me and my baby sister couldnt get the words out before you dont have to get them out now she was beautiful yes she was ive never lost anybody really close to me but he turned back to her now you lose people every day dont know how you get through one and into the next he drew a deep breath i got the letter from your man saying how the two of you had a tree planted in the park for my girl that was a fine thing to do i went by to see it and its a fine thing want to thank you youre welcome you did right by her i wanted to say that wanted to say i know you took care of her and i wont forget it the livings got to live no matter what so now im gonna try to do that best i can you come down to the d and d now ill be there kicking ass and cracking heads like always im glad youre back you need anything from me you just ask now i gotta tell you hot lips seen you look better long couple of days maybe its time you got out of town awhile maybe she angled her head as she considered him youre a big guy sweetcheeks he patted his crotch i got written testimony to that effect bet but just keep that big dog on the leash she was thinking of geographies again big beautiful black man wants to maintain his big beautiful build he goes to the gym regular i got me some equipment of my own he winked lasciviously but i use a place a couple times a week keeps mind and body disciplined you know jims gym shithole i hear that what about bodybuilders aint no ladies there why i want to waste this body on a buncha men sides man with my attributes gets hit on in a place like that then i have to be busting somebodys face and i use up my valuable time me i use zone to zone man can get himself a full massage a full massage after his workout if hes inclined but you know the other places and you could check them out from the inside if you were so inclined his grin spread could if a skinny white girl cop asked me to im looking for a guy between six four and six eight around twoseventy lightskinned woman hater loner seriously strong maybe if i moseyed into those places like i was maybe considering changing my fitness allegiance id see somebody like that maybe you would then you could tell me see what i can do chapter thirteen eve banked an hours sleep at her desk when she woke she was almost disappointed to find the lab reports holding in her incoming there would be no way to justify trouncing the chief lab tech she read them over listened to the interoffice memo from peabody clearing the followups then scanned her voice and email a message from the commanders office informed her she was required at a media conference at sixteen hundred shed seen that one coming and she was going to be both unprepared and late if she didnt get her butt in gear she scrubbed her hands over her face and put through a call to morris at the morgue he was at his desk and answered himself what can you tell me she asked him tm about to send you the report but i can tell you lily napier had a short life that it was ended in the same manner as elisa maplewoods and in my opinion by the same individual there was more violence to the face and body which would lead me to believe his rage is increasing he shifted and she could see him bring up a file your onsite was thorough as always to that i can add she consumed some porkfried rice four hours prior to her death and was mildly anemic there was no semen i found fibers inside the vagina my guess would be theyre from her panties and were carried inside during the rape there were other fibers that will likely be identified as textile and almost certainly be from her own clothing grass and dirt under her nails in accordance with your observation she dug them into the ground no hair other than her own hair from maplewood turned out to be from the dog and a squirrel eve told him dogs obvious and its probable she picked up the squirrel hair on the grass in the park dickheads report ids the fibers under maplewoods nails as manmade black ubiquitous black cloth well match it when we get him but for now weve got nothing from him lunatics are unfortunately rarely stupid yeah thanks morris she was about to try miras office when she felt her blood sugar bottom out since her chocolate supply was tapped for the moment vending was her only choice she walked out to the hallway and stared at a snack machine with pure dislike problem she glanced over saw mira no i was just going to grab something then tag you i had a consult in this section thought id come to you good fine after a brief hesitation eve pulled credits out of her pocket do me a favor get me a booster bar all right but she waved eves credits away my treat thanks eve stuck them back in her pocket jiggled them im avoiding contact with machines unless absolutely necessary its an experiment hmm fake fruit or fake caramel fake caramel did you have time to read the report on napier only to scan it im afraid mira made the selection and the machine in what eve considered particularly snotty tones raved about the booster bars delicious flavor energy snap and onthego convenience before reciting the ingredients and nutritional data there ought to be a mute feature on these things there really should eve ripped the wrapper bit in do you need more time to study the case file ill certainly take it but i can tell you what youve probably already concluded hes escalating since he killed again so quickly its logical to assume hes already selected and stalked more targets your onsite indicates no defensive wounds and a more violent beating premortem she was smaller than maplewood sort of delicate and he clocked her in the face first off id say broke her jaw didnt have any fight in her from the premortem injuries my conclusion would be he was more angry more frustrated by the fact this victim didnt fight he can only truly demonstrate his superior strength and power if his victim struggles beating on somebodys not much fun if they cant feel it in this case id agree with that she would have been somewhat of a disappointment to him if hes disappointed he may kill again more quickly he may need the satisfaction eve took another bite of the bar paced up and down the corridor while mira waited patiently ive got a media conference coming up do i tell women with long brown hair to stay off the streets after dark jesus i feel like im building a box around him i feel that but i havent got all the sides steady in place yet while im getting them while im looking for the goddamn lid hes going to get another one yes he probably will mira spoke with complete calm he may very well kill more than one before you finish the sides of that box and close the lid and those deaths will be his doing his responsibility not yours i know that but but its hard for you to think theres a woman out there going about her day her life unaware that someones planning to end it violently horribly its hard for you to know he may succeed despite everything youre doing while hes planning it im going to a flicking dinner party tonight eve mira took her arm eased them a little farther away from the traffic pattern in the corridor there was a time you did nothing but the work dinner party eve held her hands out like scales juggled the right stopping a killer and dropped the left as if with great weight nobrainer its not that simple or clearcut and you know it the stubborn set of eves jaw had her pushing the point ill tell you now that i estimated you had two maybe three more years before you burned out before you couldnt stand over another body and keep your sanity that wouldve been a tragedy for you for this department for the city even the thought of it rolled ice into eves gut i wouldnt have let it happen its not a choice two years ago february mira said quietly you came in for standard testing after terminating a suspect suspects a little vague descriptionwise when the guy was holding the bloody knife with the kid hed just ripped apart in the blood pool at his feet you almost didnt make it through testing not because of the termination which was justified and necessary but because of the child you got through it on sheer will you know it and so do i she remembered she remembered perfectly the way shed raced up the stairs the screams tearing through the air tearing through her head and what shed seen when shed broken in the door too late shed looked like a doll a tiny staring doll in the hands of a monster i can still see her her name was mandy eve eased out a breath some hit you harder than others i know it unable to prevent herself mira laid a hand on eves arm rubbed lightly from elbow to shoulder you did the job but couldnt save the child and it hit you very hard youve had others will have others that hit you equally and the fact that youve opened your life that you will go to a dinner party tonight even if the job is still circling in part of your mind may or may not make you a better person a better cop but i can promise you its given you more years a great many more years on the job there was a time what youre saying wouldve just pissed me off a smile quirked miras lips something else i know since it doesnt much maybe youre right its just dinner you gotta eat she looked down at the wrapper in her hand gave a half laugh eventually ill read the case file more thoroughly if theres anything else ill contact you right away and im going to redflag this investigation ill be available to you for consult anytime day or night thanks she rolled the wrapper into a ball pitched it into a recycler and thanks for the boost all around she stopped off in the bathroom to splash ice water on her face and pulled out her communicator as she dried off peabody sir eve could see her white face her startled eyes in the dim light of the crib on your feet soldier media conference in fifteen one police plaza got it just let me slap myself around and wake up im on my way get there now ill slap you around you sweettalker eves lips twitched as she broke transmission maybe it wasnt such a hardship to open up her life here and there in the grand scheme eve considered media conferences more of an ache in the ass than an actual pain it was an annoyance like a mild digestive disorder she could see the politics of the setup using the steps of central to make it a cop deal rather than a mayoral one having the mayor make a brief statement before stepping back and giving the podium to the chief tibbie was terse and to the point as she expected from him he looked powerful and concerned and angry all the traits youd want in the citys top cop when a killer was brutalizing innocent women in the public parks he wore a dark gray suit with a somber blue tie and a small gold nypsd badge in the form of a pin glinting on his lapel a formal and distinguished look eve supposed that fit him like a glove he took no questions but like the mayor issued a statement were in charge eve concluded but were not in the trenches we work for order and send our soldiers out to maintain it it was a good theme a strong stand and a wise move to yield the podium to whitney it all took time and though no new information was really dispensed it gave the media bones to gnaw on and let the public know their top officials were on the job it was a good city tightly run eve thought for all its dark corners and jagged edges it was a good city that was important to remember you didnt want to lose sight of the value and the strengths because you spent too much time wading through the wastes so she could stand here in the bright light of a september afternoon on the steps of her house and know there was murder and meanness and casual cruelties and still it was a good city a good city and the only home shed ever had as primary on this investigation lieutenant dallas will take more questions whitney turned to her lieutenant pecking order eve thought and on impulse took peabodys arm ignored the shocked jerk from it and drew her to the podium my partner detective peabody and i have little to add to the previous statements and the answers commander whitney has already given this investigation is our priority it is ongoing and active and we are pursuing any and all leads questions spewed out like a geyser of hot air she let them wash over her then picked one out of the flood both victims were mutilated do you believe these to be cult killings none of the evidence weve accumulated during this investigation indicates cult involvement we believe elisa maplewood and lily napier were both killed by one individual acting alone and on his own volition can you give us the nature of these mutilations due to the nature of the investigation our desire to apprehend this individual with dispatch and the necessity of building a strong case to bring said individual to justice we cant reveal specifics as pertains to said investigation the public has a right to know did they never tire of swinging that splintered bat eve wondered the public has a right to be protected and were doing everything in our power to do so the public has a right to be confident that its police force and city officials will work diligently to identify apprehend and prosecute the person responsible for the deaths of elisa maplewood and lily napier the public does not have a right to all the salient and sensitive details of this case and you she thought dont have the right to clock up your ratings by slathering over the dead what connection is there between the two victims peabody eve murmured and heard her partner gulp they were both killed by the same method peabody stated they were both female in the same age group the same racial group they were both in public parks at the time of the attacks what other connections what are your leads were not able to disclose or discuss specific details of the investigation for reasons already stated do you consider him a sexual predator two women eve began with what she considered herculean patience were brutalized raped and murdered i think you can draw your own conclusions do you believe hell kill again can you describe the murder weapon in more detail do you have any suspects do you expect to make an arrest soon will you close more parks was the mutilation sexual in nature i wonder her eyes had been flat and cold but now hints of temper glinted in them eve interrupted the barrage of questions and this time there was an edge in her voice i sincerely wonder which part of we will not disclose or discuss specifics you fail as a group to comprehend i wonder why you insist on wasting your breath and our time asking questions we cannot and will not answer so let me save us all the effort and tell you what i know they quieted as if she were about to reveal a new set of commandments two women and let me repeat their names in case youve forgotten them because i havent forgotten who they were nor has my partner nor has any member of this department forgotten them their names are elisa maplewood and lily napier these womens lives were violently and unrightfully taken they were taken near their own homes in our city it is their rights that were violated in the most heinous way it is their rights we will seek to defend as we continue our investigation we will continue this investigation with all the resources available until such time as the individual who violated them is identified apprehended and incarcerated i work for elisa maplewood and lily napier and now im going to get back to it she turned away strode back into central and ignored the questions hurled at her back the moment she was back in a handful of cops drones and civilian liaisons broke into applause shit was all eve said and that was under her breath i thought you were brilliant peabody said from behind her sincerely doesnt do any good to get pissed off or to preach i think youre wrong i think maplewoods and napiers friends and families will appreciate what you said and how you said it aside from that i think it sends a message to the killer loud and clear were hunting him and were not going to stop yeah well theres that and since i enjoy watching you tear a small strip off the more assholey reporters i can forgive you for tossing me into the deep end of the pool without so much as a hold your breath you did fine i did peabody agreed then closed her mouth quickly when tibbie and whitney entered lieutenant detective tibbie nodded to both of them you had considerable to say this afternoon lieutenant not your usual taciturn self no sir well said commander whitney paused as tibbie strode off mayors closing it down a moment of silence for the victims whitney glanced toward the doors cynicism in every pore an inspired touch and a good visual for the evening reports chill down a little he suggested and get back to work tm as chilly as im going to get eve decided after hed moved off to join tibbie she checked the time its early for anyone who was on napiers shift but lets take a shot at oharas her pocket link signaled hell she muttered when the readout warned her it was nadine ive made my statement answered the questions im done nadine tm not calling as a reporter give me five minutes shed sneak eve thought shed prevaricate but she wouldnt lie heading down to the garage can you get in there the smirk twisted her lips please level one section three i dont have time to wait for you she didnt have to wait nadine was already there and the fact that she was idly buffing her fingernails told eve she wanted to rub it in a little i know this is your slot nadine began but since when is this your ride eve skimmed a hand over the fender of the shiny blue vehicle soon when she was absolutely sure of privacy she might just kiss it since my devious partner used the right bribe on the right person go peabody it was nothing a couple vids of dallas naked in the shower and were cruising very funny what do you want nadine im on a tight schedule breen merriweather there was no smirk now you have information i dont know that i do ive very carefully asked some questions she added before eve could speak i know how to ask questions and i comprehend all manner of things including we will not discuss or disclose asking questions with the idea that breen was one of this bastards targets puts a different complexion on the answers she made an offhand comment a few nights before she disappeared to some of the tech crew what comment coffeebreak talk some of the girl techs one of them manhunting no good men left in the city no big strong heroes blah blah and breen said she should come ride home with her some night there was this big silent type starting to ride her train she made some joke about that old horse you know the size of a mans thumbs indicating the size of his equipment said this guy must be hung like a bull because his hands were the size of turkey platters that it no she pushed at her hair they were joking around just chilling so there was a lot of how big is he breen and your expected lewd conversation she breen she said shed pass him to one of the other girls because he wasnt her type she liked men with hair and he was probably an asshole anyway because he always wore sunshades middle of the night and hes wearing sunshades okay it had to be him a lot of people ride the subway at night nadine some of them are men some of the men are large but yeah its possible trains have security cams yeah they do it was hard to look at hope insistent hope in the eyes of a friend and the discs are recycled every thirty days shes been gone a lot longer than that but you could ill look into it the sunshades dallas hes got a thing for eyes i comprehend things too im going to follow up on it all right she backed off though eve could all but see her quiver to say more to ask more you have to promise to let me know soon as i can nadine nodded then shook herself and looked back toward the vehicle so how long you figure before you trash this one shut up to discourage further conversation she got in the car she started it up reversed around nadine and drove out of the garage and immediately contacted feeney ive got a tip the too let a smile be your umbrella and youre gonna get your dumb ass wet huh ill remember that merriweather breen missing and presumed she commented to a coworker a couple days before she poofed about a big guy who started riding her train made a lot of comments regarding his size also described him as bald and wearing sunshades discs are recycled by now if not destroyed he pulled his lip we can go to the transit authority cull through until we find discs if they still exist for that time period we can pick through the images try to find echoes of previous images lot of luck involved there but we might find him she noticed tried not to but couldnt avoid it that todays shirt was the color of lime juice i can ask whitney for the extra manpower and of you need i can do my own begging thanks ill send a couple of boys down to get started got the train route in the file keep me in the loop mcnabs eyes are going to bleed peabody commented when eve ended transmission thats what he gets for being an eman we get a visual of this guy we nail that visual we nail the box it was going to take time eve thought not just hours but days and more than luck it was going to require a small miracle oharas was as advertised a small reasonably clean irishstyle pub more authentic in that area eve noted than some billed as such in the city that attempted to prove it by slapping up shamrocks everywhere and requiring the staff to speak with fake irish accents this one was dimly lit with a good solid bar deep booths and low tables scattered around with short stools bracketing them rather than chairs the man working the stick was wide as a draft horse and pulled pints of harp guinness smithwick with an easy skill that told her hed likely been doing so since he could stand he had a ruddy face a thatch of sandy hair and eyes that skimmed and scanned the room like a cops hed be the man to see ive never had a guinness peabody commented youre not having one now yeah on duty and all but im going to have to try one sometime except they look a little scary and they cost beyond get what you pay for huh yet another tip eve stepped up to the bar its tender pushed pints into waiting hands then worked his way down officers he said youve got good eyes mr ohara im ohara my father was on the job where in merry old dublin she heard it in his voice the same lilt that crept into roarkes when did you come over when i was but a green and cheery twenty off to seek my fortune and did well enough looks like ah well his face sobered youre here about lily you want my help or that of any here to find the bastard who murdered that sweet girl youve got it michael take the stick well sit down a moment he said to eve will you have a pint on duty peabody said a little morosely and he grinned beers next thing to mothers milk but ill pour you out something soft take that booth down there ill be right along pretty nice place peabody settled in the booth looked around im going to come back with mcnab try the guinness does it come in light what would be the point ohara brought two soda waters and a pint to the booth and slid his bulk in across from them to our lily then he lifted his glass bless her sweet soul what time did she leave here that night he sipped i know youre cops but i havent your names as yet sorry she pulled out her badge as she spoke lieutenant dallas detective peabody roarkes cop i thought so you know roarke not in a personal manner of speaking ive a few years on him and we ran in different circles back in the day my father knew him ohara said with a twinkle i bet did well for himself too didnt he now you could say mr ohara i dont know him personally ohara interrupted and leaned in his eyes keen on hers but i know of him and one of the things i know is that hes a man who tends to want and have the best would that include his cop tm sitting here mr ohara as lilys cop and im going to make damn sure shes got the best well he sat back lifted his pint again well now thats a fine answer she left about halfone it was a slow night so i scooted her along a bit early i shouldve had someone walk her home i shouldve thought of that after what happened to that uptown woman but i never thought of it youve got good eyes mr ohara did you notice anyone in here that made you look harder girl doesnt a week go by someone doesnt make me take a harder look i run a pub after all but not what youre meaning there was nobody i saw who made me think id need to worry for my girls hed be big eve continued a big man stronglooking hed keep to himself wouldnt socialize or make conversation he might have worn sunshades he wouldnt sit at the bar unless there was no choice hed want a table in lilys section and hed make it clear he didnt want company td remember someone like that he shook his head but i dont im here most nights but not every wed like to talk to whoever worked lilys shift thered be michael there at the bar now and rose donnelly kevin and maggie lannigan ah pete back in the kitchen at the dishes peter maguire regulars ah well why dont i write some of this down for you get you addresses where i can you can talk to michael now for hes a clever enough lad and can work the bar and talk at the same time thanks let me tell you something about lily she was a shy thing and we teased her about it she had a kind and quiet nature and worked well when she got to know you got comfortable so to speak she was easier she had a smile for you and she remembered your name and what you ordered she didnt shine but she was steady and sweet we wont forget her neither will we chapter fourteen the interviews took them past endofshift and eve thought unless she was going to screw up her personal life she had to set the rest aside and head uptown we could manage rose donnelly that would finish it off peabody gestured west she doesnt live far if it wasnt her night off we mightve caught her here we can swing by then ill dump you and hold that thought she dragged out her signaling link dallas im hoping i could speak to you celinas tired face

after i would tremble you wouldnt tremble if i was holding my weapon at your throat but thanks im going to take this last meet then im heading home the too oh she brightened a bit youre still at work didnt realize thats good thats better im not the only one scrambling see you pleased with the situation she pulled up in front of celinas loft even as she crossed to the entrance celinas voice came through the intercom ive cleared locks come right up anxious eve thought as she went inside and entered the elevator when it reached level two celina was waiting to open the gate thanks for coming thanks for being so quick i wasnt that far away whats going on i need to can i get you something tea a glass of wine no im heading home ive got a thing oh distractedly celina brushed a hand through her hair sorry lets sit down anyway i made tea needed to keep busy while i waited for you tea eve noted along with little cookies some neat wedges of cheese looked like girlchat time to her and she didnt have the time or the inclination you said there wasnt anything new i havent had another vision she sat poured tea for herself i kept some of my appointments today thought i should try but i ended up cancelling the rest after taking the first two i just cant concentrate tough on business i can afford the time off the regulars understand and as for new clients she moved her shoulders elegantly it adds to the mystique but thats not the point and the point is im getting to it celina tilted her head not much on small talk are you i figure theres a reason its called small suppose youre right to begin i watched your media conference i wasnt going to but i felt i thought i should she curled up her legs and it made me think it made you think what i can do more i should do more theres a reason im getting these visions i dont know what it is not specifically but i know theres a purpose and while im doing the minimum i feel is required of me i could do more she sipped tea then set the cup down i want to discuss going under hypnosis eve lifted her eyebrows just when youre ready to bail she thought something interesting comes along how would that help theres a part of me thats blocking celina touched her hands to either side of her head then her heart call it a survival mechanism which i like better than yellowbellied cowardice something in me that doesnt want to know to see to remember so i dont blocking the way you block picking up impressions or whatever you call them from people without their consent not really thats a conscious act though it becomes as elemental as breathing this is subconscious the human mind is a powerful and efficient tool we dont use it to its capacity i dont think we dare she picked up one of the little golden cookies shed set out with the tea and nibbled we are able to block trauma victims often do theyre unable or unwilling to remember the trauma or details of it because they cant or wont face it you must see this sort of thing in your work and in herself eve thought in all the years shed blocked out what had happened in that room in dallas yes under hypnosis those blocks can be removed or lowered i may see more i know theres more and i may see it with the right practitioner id need someone id insist on someone very skilled not only in hypnosis but in dealing with sensitives id want a medical doctor present as well id want dr mira to do it mira after you gave me her name i did some research shes very qualified in all the areas id need shes also a criminologist so it seems to me shed be more cognizant of what to ask me where to guide me while i was under you trust her absolutely celina gestured with the cookie and i trust you i dont put myself in just any hands dallas to be honest im afraid of this but im more afraid of doing nothing and you know whats worse no im terrified ive been pushed into a new arena that what i have what i am is moving down a path i never wanted for myself she hugged her right arm rubbing it gently as if to soothe a spasm that im going to spend the next phase of my life seeing murder and violence linking with victims i liked my life the way it was it makes it harder to realize it may never be just that way again and still you want me to contact dr mira she nodded the sooner the better if i stall i might lose the courage to follow it through give me a minute eve said as she pulled out her link oh right celina rose picked up the tea tray she carried it into the kitchen with slow deliberate moves she put the clean cup and saucer away set her own in the sink then she laid her hands on her face pressed her fingers to her closed lids and hoped with everything she was that she was ready for what was coming celina yes on a quick jerk she dropped her hands then turned to the doorway where eve stood dr mira can see you tomorrow at nine shell need to do a consult first and a physical exam before she agrees to hypnotherapy yes good she squared her shoulders as if adjusting to a weight or shrugging one off that makes sense will you could you be there if and when the hypnosis is approved yes up until youre set to go under you can change your mind clasping a hand over the crystals dangling from her neck chain celina shook her head no i wont i thought this through up and down and sideways before i contacted you i wont change my mind were going to move ahead i can promise you i wont turn back now eve dashed in the house slammed the door at her back im late she snapped before summerset could speak but heres the thing im not always late but youre always ugly whos got the real problem since she finished the question at the top of the stairs and kept going she wasnt annoyed with any reply he might have made she stripped off her jacket as she hit the bedroom door released her weapon harness and tossed it on the sofa yanked off boots by hopping onefooted toward the bathroom and had her shirt off when she heard the water running damn hed beaten her home after all she peeled off the rest turn that water temp up done i adjusted when i heard the graceful patter of your delicate feet stomping about in the bedroom knowing roarke wasnt above being hysterically amused by having her scream after jumping into cold water she stuck her hand in the spray first trusting soul he said and grabbing her hand hauled her in lets stay home and make hot wet love in the shower forget it she elbowed him aside pumped soap into her hand were going to dinner were going to sit around somebody elses house and make stupid conversation and eat food we dont even get to pick for ourselves and pretend not to wonder exactly where in the apartment mcnab and charles punched each other out i can hardly wait he pumped shampoo and began to lather it into her hair what are you doing saving you time what have you done here she hunched her shoulders nothing you have youve been whacking at your hair again it was in my eyes back here he tugged fascinating does the nypsd know they have a cop with eyes in the back of her head has the cia been notified i can do this myself she pulled back scrubbed vigorously at her hair while glaring at him dont tell trina he smiled wolfishly and what would my silence be worth to you you want a quick hand job see youre being deliberately crude to put me off he tapped her chin oddly enough it doesnt work shell know anyway eve muttered and stuck her head under the jets shell know the next time she gets her hands on me and shell make me pay shell pour goo all over me and lecture and paint my nipples blue or something what an interesting picture that creates in my fevered brain i dont know why i did it she jumped out and into the drying tube i couldnt help myself tell it to the judge roarke advised they werent very late peabody thought and when you had two cops two currently overworked sleepdeprived cops being on time wasnt even in the realm besides shed wanted to take as much time as she could squeeze out to make sure she looked her best since mcnab had given her a big oh baby she figured shed pulled it off he looked pretty adorable himself his hair was all shiny and slick and his cute little butt was nice and snug against the seat of black pants saved from being too conservative by the fluorescent silver stripe running down each leg she had her hostess gift a clutch of fairly fresh tiger lilies shed snagged from a vender near her subway stop and theyd been cleared through the lobby to the elevator now youre going to play nice right of course im going to play nice he fiddled with the collar of his silver shirt and wondered if he shouldve added a tie give monroe a run for his sophisticated money why wouldnt i she rolled her eyes at him as they stepped into the elevator then now then you were sleeping with him and i was drunk and pissed off now youre not and neither am i drunk and pissed off he qualified she ordered charless floor fluffed at her hair and wished shed had time to curl it just for a change neither was i what did you have to be drunk and pissed off about he asked sleeping with him you sure my ass doesnt look fat in these pants what my ass she craned her head around to try to see for herself it feels like it looks fat what do you mean you werent sleeping with him after louise you mean after louise i mean ever there ought to be a mirror in here so i could check my fat ass your ass isnt fat and shut up you were going around with him for months she gave the flowers she carried a little sniff you sleep with everybody you go around with pretty much now just a damn minute were going to be late she said as she stepped off the elevator and into the hall were going to be later you telling me you never boinked the lc ever charles and i were are friends thats it mcnab grabbed her arm hauled her back a step you let me think you were boinking him no you let you think i was she poked a finger into his chest and made an ass of yourself which is a pretty short walk really you he he paced down the hall and back again why because we were friends and because i was boinking you moron but we broke up because because instead of asking what was going on you accused and you ordered and took that short walk to assville and you tell me now a minute before we walk in his door yeah thats cold peabody yeah she patted his cheek i wait for payback and i deliver you were a jerk coming over here toasted and punching him but i like that part which is why i was magnanimous enough to forgive you for sleeping with the twins i didnt he tapped a finger on her nose gotcha you didnt i was going to and i could have because we were on the breakup shuttle but i didnt want the twins you bragged about it hey ive got a dick mans got a dick hes gotta have pride in it you are a dick she said but with a sloppy grin now i forgive you for thinking i was bouncing back and forth between you and charles like some sex bunny shebody youre my little sex bunny aw she flung her arms around him to exchange the sloppy grin for a big sloppy kiss the elevator doors opened behind them oh god there goes my appetite dallas peabody sent a dreamy look over mcnabs shoulder were making up next time make up in a dark locked room mcnab your hands are in violation of several civil codes whoops still he gave peabodys butt a final squeeze you start on the transit discs eve roarke laid a hand on her shoulder aimed her toward charless apartment lets at least try to make it through the door before you grill the detectives peabody you look charming thanks this is going to be fun they answered together charles monroe the urbane lc and louise dimatto the blueblooded doctor dedicated to the downtrodden eve had to admit they looked good together he with his handsome vid king looks and she with her polishedgold beauty it didnt mean she didnt consider it one of the oddest couplings of her acquaintance but they looked good together everyone at once louise laughed and reached for eve the closest come in its so good to see everybody when none of us is working she kissed eves cheek then made a fuss over the flowers peabody offered lieutenant sugar charles went for the hello kiss as well but he aimed for the mouth there was a twinkle in his eye shot in mcnabs direction as he gave peabody the same greeting it was going to be eve decided a really weird evening the wine roarke brought was welcomed and opened conversation eve realized after ten minutes wasnt stilted or sparse everyone appeared to be in a party mood shed just have to tuck the case into another area of the brain and get into the personal game for a few hours there was louise looking happy and picture pretty perched on the arm of charless chair and wearing the casual gear of a dark pink sweater and black pants bare feet with pink toenails and to eves considerable surprise a little gold toe ring charles kept touching her in that absent and intimate way a man touched a woman who was his focus a brush on the arm a stroke on the knee didnt she wonder about the women who paid him to touch them and a hell of a lot more apparently not eve decided by the gooey looks they sent each other every five minutes and there were mcnab and peabody snuggled together on the cushy leather couch laughing and talking without any sign of awkwardness just one big happy family as a trained observer she could safely say she was the only one weirded out even as she thought it roarke leaned toward her laid his lips close to her ear relax working on it she mumbled louise has been fussing half the day charles commented i have louise shook back her cloud of hair its the first time weve entertained friends together and i like to fuss fussing eve concluded ran to putting small arrangements of colorcoordinated flowers in little clear vases and positioning them in strategic spots throughout the apartment and marrying the flowers with lots of white candles in different shapes and sizes so the light was subtle and gold shed probably selected the background music too something muted and bluesy that suited the lighting the table was already set with lots of candles and flowers there too and glassware that glinted put it all together with the wine and predinner finger food and you had a cozy relaxing atmosphere for an intimate gathering of friends how did people know how to put it together she wondered did they take classes punt and hope for the best buy instruction discs it was worth it peabody commented everything looks mag im just glad were all here louise sent her smile around the room i wasnt sure youd be able to make it you particularly dallas ive been following the case in the media reports people keep telling me i need an actual life outside the job eve shrugged i figure if you get away from it for a little while maybe youll come back fresh a healthy attitude louise said yeah thats me eve leaned over and plucked one of the colorfully topped crackers from a canape tray my tudes always healthy especially when shes kicking your ass with a grin mcnab ate a tiny stuffed shrimp skinny as yours is pal it doesnt take much do you ever get your skinny ass back to scotland louise asked him not really i was born here and all that went back and forth a lot when i was a kid my parents decided to roost back there outside edinburgh about five years ago i guess i was thinking maybe next time peabody and i have some real time we could go check it out scotland she goggled at him really theyve got to meet my girl her cheeks pinked i always wanted to go over and see europe you know the countryside tromp around in fields and gawk at ruins conversation turned to travel dallas louise said in an aside give me a hand in the kitchen the kitchen me for a minute ah okay eve followed her in looked around were not going to actually cook or anything what do i look simple everythings stocked from a very nice restaurant around the corner its just a matter of putting it together for the table which ill take care of in a minute louise sipped her wine studying eve over the rim are you taking care of yourself what why because you look tired well shit i spent a good five minutes slapping goop on my face whats the point your eyes look tired im a doctor i know these things and i wouldve understood if youd needed to cancel tonight thought about it but the fact is i couldnt do anymore maybe i needed a break from it maybe ive got to learn how to take a break from it thats good but well make this an early evening well see how it goes you and charles things cruising there they are he makes me awfully happy no one has in just that way in a very long time you look happy both of you funny isnt it how you find someone when youve stopped looking i dont know i never looked now that hurts with a laugh louise leaned back against the counter you dont even bother to look and you end up with roarke he just got in my way couldnt get around him so i figured i might as well keep him and oddly she realized it wasnt small talk when it was with a friend it was just talk were thinking about taking a little holiday together maybe next month go up to maine or vermont look at the fall foliage and stay in some quaint little inn youre going to go look at trees laughing louise brushed eve aside to set up the salads people do dallas yeah eve drank takes all kinds bitches whores all but consumed with rage he stormed around the apartment he had the screen on repeat playing the channel interview and the media conference over and over and over he couldnt help himself theyd sent women out after him women discussing him analyzing him condemning him did they think he was going to take that look at them pretending to be so good so clean so righteous but he knew better hed seen and he knew underneath they were cheap and vicious weak and vile he was stronger look at him now just look he did turning to one of the walls of mirrors to admire his body the sheer shape and strength the perfection hed worked so hard to achieve he was a man do you see do you see what i am he turned holding out his arms and a dozen pairs of eyes stared back at him as they floated in their jars they could see him now she could see him she had no choice but to look at him forever what do you think now mother whos in charge now they were all hers all those staring eyes but she was still out there judging him ready with her punishing hand her slashing belt ready to lock him in the dark so he couldnt see so he wouldnt know hed take care of that oh yes he would hed fix her little red wagon hed show her who was boss hed show all of them theyd pay this mothers son would make them pay he thought as he stared back at the screen hed show them what he could do these three he moved closer to the screen gritting his teeth as he looked at eve at peabody at nadine theyd have to be punished sometimes you had to deviate from the plan thats all so theyd have to be punished you were punished when you were bad you were punished when you were good hed save the top bitch for last thats what hed do he smiled fiercely at eve it was always smart to save the best for last it was a good meal with good company for nearly two hours murder didnt play in her head she enjoyed particularly watching roarke relate the way he slid so smoothly between charless urbane sophisticate and mcnabs streetsmart wiseass how he mixed with the women flattering without being oily flirting without being obnoxious effortlessly or it seemed effortless but wouldnt he have things on his mind too the big wheels and complex deals that made up his work and a large part of his life he wouldve spent the day buying and selling god knew what coordinating and supervising projects she couldnt begin to imagine taking meetings making decisions contemplating the enormous chessboard of his empire then he could sit over coffee and dessert telling a story about some bar fight from his youth to make mcnab roll with laughter or exchanging opinions about great art with charles on the way home he reached over brushed a hand over hers that was a very nice evening it didnt even nearly suck high praise indeed she laughed at herself stretched out her legs somewhere along the line shed taken his advice shed relaxed and after shed relaxed damn if she hadnt enjoyed i mean it darling eve i know you do youre a layered guy roarke im nothing if not i dont know why im surrounded by smartasses birds of a feather anyway she said after a beat it was educational to watch you schmooze i wasnt schmoozing schmoozing is business or businessrelated this was personal and friendly conversation ha the things you learn she leaned her head back she was tired but she realized she wasnt weighed down by fatigue there was a lot of conversation and it wasnt even boring or irritating god he picked up her hand pressed it to his lips as he drove through the gates i adore you lot of that going around tonight too it was pleasant to spend time with two couples so obviously in love hard to miss it with all the gooey looks and pats and strokes sex sizzling in the air and all that you ever think how itd be if you switched them around sizzling looks gooey sex i think of little else she snickered as they got out of the car to walk to the door no the people you put peabody with charles and mcnab with louise itd be totally screwed up you could put peabody with louise sick youre a sick man just playing the game he took her hand as they walked upstairs to the bedroom you seem to have your second wind lieutenant i think its my third maybe fourth of the day i actually feel pretty good she booted the door shut behind her in fact sitting around in all that sizzles got me hyped how about some gooey sex thought youd never ask hooking an arm around his neck she jumped so he could catch her in his arms she calculated her weight his narrowed her eyes how far do you figure you can carry me to the bed would be my first guess no i mean how far do you think you could haul me like this especially if im she went limp dropped her weight let her arms dangle she felt him shift and adjust not quite stagger tougher this way right i still think i can manage the bed where i certainly hope you plan to revive a bit youre in good shape but i bet youd feel it if you had to carry me say twenty thirty yards like this since i havent strangled you yet i wont have to she boosted back up as he climbed the platform with her sorry no murder in the bedroom tonight she kept her arms locked around his neck when he lowered her to the bed you touch me obviously amused he nipped at her chin and that wonderful hair brushed her cheeks like strands of silk thats definitely on the agenda no she laughed again then rolled over on top of him when were just hanging out when you dont even think about it i like it she leaned down to rub her lips over his and linking fingers stretching sinuously down slid his arms over his head i like this enjoy yourself he invited probably should make it fairly quick in case i lose this third fourth wind she closed her teeth over his jaw nipping lightly keeping his hands locked with hers she ran her lips down his throat traced them back to his then she curled back like a cat to unbutton his shirt yeah she rubbed her hands over his chest youre in shape then her lips she could feel his heartbeat pick up drum lightly under her hands and lips he wanted wasnt it amazing he always wanted her the muscles of his belly quivered when she tasted there and jumped when she ran her tongue under his waistband she slid down the zipper freed him tormented him then uncurling she watched him as she peeled off her shirt as she took his hands and pressed them to her breasts on a low hum of pleasure her head fell back his hands were hard and smooth and skilled the long liquid tugs began from heart to belly from belly to loins when he used them on her let me let me have he reared up clamped his mouth on her and the hum became a sob the tugs a burn now it could be desperate now it could be urgent slick body straining to slick body hands and mouths greedy for more the sharp nip of teeth the quick bite of nails the hot slide of tongues she was trembling when she straddled him once again their hands and eyes locked she took him in took him deep and cried out breathless she lowered her brow to his fought for breath for sanity a minute she managed its too much wait a minute its not too much his mouth seared over hers its never too much never would be she rose up and rode chapter fifteen while eve was curled in dreamless sleep against roarke a woman named annalisa sommers split her part of the check and said good night to a few friends her monthly posttheater club had broken up a little later than usual as everyone had a lot of news to share the club was just an excuse really for her to get together with some of her friends and have a bite to eat a few drinks and talk about men work men but it also gave her the benefit of several opinions on whatever play theyd seen she used them as well as her own for her weekly column in stage right magazine she loved the theater and had since shed played a yam in her firstgrade thanksgiving day pageant since she couldnt act though shed pulled the yam off well enough to have her mother cry a little had no skill for design or direction shed turned hobby into career by writing observations rather than straight reviews on plays on and off and way way off broadway the pay was lousy but the benefits included free seats and regular backstage passes as well as the buzz of being able to make a semblance of a living doing something she enjoyed and she had a good feeling that the pay was going to improve very soon her column was growing in popularity for the very reasons shed hyped when talking herself into a job with stage right regular people wanted to know what other regular people thought about a play critics werent regular people they were critics after ten months on the job she was beginning to get recognized on the street and enjoyed having people stop her to discuss to agree or disagree it didnt matter she was having the time of her life everything was going so well with work with lucas new york was her personal playground and there was no place else on earth shed rather be when she and lucas got married and her friends agreed things were definitely heading in that direction theyd find a mag apartment on the west side throw fun and quirky little parties and be ridiculously happy hell she was ridiculously happy now she tossed back her hair and hesitated at the northwest corner of greenpeace park she always cut through the park knew the route through like she knew the route from her own kitchen to her own bedroom a very short walk she admitted until that pay raise but two women had been killed in city parks in the last week so a shortcut at one in the morning might not be a smart move that was ridiculous greenpeace was practically her backyard shed be through it in five minutes and home safe tucked into her own little bed and counting sheep before two she was a native new yorker for gods sake she reminded herself as she veered off the sidewalk and into the leafy shadows she knew how to handle herself how to stay aware shed taken selfdefense courses stayed in shape and she had antimugger spray with panic alarm in her pocket she loved this park day or night the trees the little play areas for kids the coop gardens for vegetables or flowers it showed to annalisa just how diverse the city was concrete and cucumbers spreading within feet of each other the image made her laugh as she walked quickly along the path toward home she heard the kitten mewing before she saw it it wasnt unusual to find a stray cat even a feral one in the park but this one she saw as she walked closer wasnt a cat it was just a kitten a little ball of gray fur curled on the path and crying pitifully poor little thing wheres your mama you poor little thing she crouched down picked it up it was only when she held it she realized it was a droid she thought weird the shadow fell over her her hand dived into her pocket for the spray even as she started to spring back to her feet but the blow to the back of her head sent her sprawling the droid continued to mew and cry as blows rained down on her at seven hundred and twenty hours the next morning eve stood over annalisa sommers the park smelled green verdant she thought that was the word sort of alive and burgeoning you could hear the morning traffic on the street and overhead but here there was a small slice of countrified with a vegetable patch spread out in tidy rows behind a screen of pest and vandal fence she didnt know what the hell was growing in it leafy stuff and viney stuff and things that sprawled over small neat hills part of that verdant smell was probably fertilizer or manure or whatever the hell these people mixed in the dirt to grow things theyd eventually put in their mouths and call natural well come to think of it there wasnt anything much more natural than shit except blood and death at the end of the patch behind the odd little vertical triangles where vines grew behind the screen to keep dogs and street people out was a statue of a man and a woman each wore a hat he carried some sort of hoe or rake and she a basket loaded with what was meant to be the fruits of their labor a harvest harvest was the name of the statue she knew but everyone called it ma and pa farmer or just ma and pa annalisa lay at their feet like an offering to the gods with her hands clasped between her naked breasts her face was bloody and ruined her body covered with bruises crappy way to start the day peabody commented yeah a lot crappier for her eve fixed on her goggles got out her gauges get her id she began to recite what the recorder could already see victim is caucasian female evidence of violence on face torso limbs broken clavicle no defensive wounds evident red corded ribbon at the throat apparent murder weapon strangulation there is evidence of sexual assault bruising and lacerations on the thighs and genitals idd as annalisa sommers age thirtytwo resides fifteen west thirtyfirst identification now on record victims eyes have been removed in a manner similar to previous victims maplewood and napier manner of assault death mutilation location type and position of body all in accordance with previous victims he doesnt vary much from pattern peabody said not much why mess with success got some hair fibers on her right hand adhering to the dried blood she tweezed them off bagged them and sat back on her haunches what was she doing in here dallas walking through here in the middle of the damn night they fourwalled the media conference she had to know this guy trolls the parks not going to happen to her people always think it cant happen to them instead of thinking its going to happen to somebody why not me she studied the body she lives close that fits with the others too odds are she had a pattern coming through here on her way home or away from home she cuts through knows her way around hairs not right eve muttered a little shorter than the others a little darker but still in the ballpark yeah hed have to be a little flexible wouldnt he apparently with the scene on record the bodys position logged she turned the victims head lifted it took a blow to the back of the head hard blow maybe he comes up behind her comes up hits her takes her down shes got some scrapes at the knees grass and dirt in the cuts she goes down hands and knees she lifted one of the hands showed the abrasions on the heels then he lays into her beating kicking violence is escalating each time more premortem violence losing it rapes her carts her over finishes the job we didnt hear from celina on this one noticed that eve pushed to her feet well tag her in a few minutes lets look at the kill site it wasnt far this time just on the other end of the vegetable patch along the path traces of blood were in splotches or sprinkles or smears over grass and dirt made it easier for him eve thought he only had to carry this one about eight feet lieutenant one of the sweepers held out an evidence bag found this at point three there standard pocketsized antimugger might be hers didnt do her a lot of good well check for prints got some hair too few strays on the path point one gray so they arent hers eyeballing they dont look human thanks probably squirrel again peabody said maybe what was her employment peabody columnist stage right mag eve nodded coming home then walking home ohone hundreds late for theater a drink after maybe or dinner a date shortcut it through the park its her neighborhood shes got her spray in her pocket just in case so no worries quick breeze through and youre back on the street and almost at your own doorstep hes waiting for her got the spot picked out knows shell walk right by takes her down from behind she frowned at the slight impression on the grass one of the sweepers had already marked carts her over to lay her under ma and pa finishes the job she shook her head again get what else you can on her next of kin spouse cohabit partner im going to try celina before we look at the vics residence she moved

victim with the same man coffeelight skin dark hair neat goatee with soul patch big smile with lots of teeth nicelooking guy she thought and shed bet the bank his name was lucas she took the photo into evidence if they didnt get a last name shed run the picture for an id match a gregarious sociable woman who liked the theater eve mused kept up a friendly relationship with her mother and sister had several pals and from the conversations on the link had a monogamous romantic relationship with a man named lucas and was dead because she cut through the park to save herself three blocks no eve corrected she was dead because someone selected her stalked her and killed her if she hadnt cut through the park last night thered have been another time or another way shed been a target mission

we hung around the studio had some brews some pizza jammed got home i dont know around three jesus did somebody hurt her yes somebody hurt her his face was already splotchy from weeping but now it went white under the stain you said the park oh my jesus christ you said the park those other women it was like those other women annalisa tell me where you had your session and who was there and well get that out of the way tunes on prince um bird god god his hands were all over his face into his hair fingers trembling john bird and katelee poder and i cant think straight her mother have you told her mother weve just come from there theyre tight really tight gave me the onceover about five times but shes okay we get along good i gotta go over there mr grande do you know if anyone was bothering annalisa someone you noticed someone she mentioned no shell mention if her nose itches so shed say if there was ive gotta go see her mom ive gotta go be with her family we need to go see annalisa together we need to do that together shed had a solid seven hours sleep eve thought and had ended the previous day with a nice dinner with friends and very satisfying sex despite all that she carried a vicious headache with her into miras section miras admin informed her with more amiability than usual that the doctor was in session with ms sanchez but she would let them know lieutenant dallas had arrived let them finish eve told her its better im not in there anyway ive got some things i can take care of while i wait she checked her messages first and found one from berenski in the lab gleefully relating that hed nailed her shoe from the imprint my genius knows no borders or boundaries took your pathetic imprint on grass worked my magic and reconstructed the tread matched the tread big foot was in a size fifteen mikon style called avalanche its a modified hiking boot and theres not a lot of wear on this one retails at about threesevenfive eleven outlets in the city deal with that brand and carry it in that size got your list attached you can come in and plant a big wet one on me later yeah thatll happen but she appreciated the magic and scanned the attachment after highlighting the outlets inside or bordering her downtown parameter she spent the rest of her wait time writing her preliminary report she glanced up when the door opened dallas celina hurried out her eyes were swollen from a recent crying jag eve why dont you come in mira gestured celina why dont you both come back in for a moment i let you down celina closed a hand over eves arm as they walked toward miras office i let myself down you didnt eve sat prepared to accept flowery tea then sniffed like a hound when she smelled coffee i knew youd want it and probably need it mira said as she offered a cup its station house but its coffee thanks i didnt check the media reports this morning thank you celina said to mira and took the tea i wanted to hear it from you ive cried all over dr mira and gotten the worst of it out i wont break down again but first i want to tell you i never even considered that hed be out that hed hurt anyone last night i was so damn tired dallas and i wanted to get a good nights sleep before my appointment this morning i just wanted to close everything out so i took a couple of tranqs that sort of thing block visions it can celina glanced toward mira got a nod the drug suppresses i might have seen something but id have been under so deep i wouldnt know hypnosis could bring it out just as it could lower the blocks on the others so i would see in more detail see what i hadnt allowed myself to see quite possibly mira confirmed just as it can take a witness to an event back to the event and bring more details focus them in through the practitioners direction to specifics the things you see she continued that you dont consciously recall i get that eve said when can you do it we havent done the physical exam as yet if i dont find any problems we could begin the sessions tomorrow sessions tomorrow it will almost certainly take more than one eve and i prefer to wait twentyfour hours to make certain the drugs are completely out of celinas system and that shes settled emotionally cant we start sooner ill meditate and cleanse id like to start as soon as possible i feel responsible mira finished you feel responsible for the woman who was killed last night but youre not if she clears the physical does the meditation thing can you go sooner mira looked at eve sighed then rose to check her calendar we could begin at fourthirty today you may not get your answers eve it depends on how receptive celina is to the technique and how much she actually saw and can bring back will you be here celina asked her dont depend on me eve wanted to say dont look at me as your anchor if i can ive got a line ive got to follow and a lot of routine to deal with on the latest victim if you can anything i should know mira came back to sit as applies to profile close to the same pattern it looks like this annalisa sommers was cutting through she broke off as celinas tea cup shattered on the floor annalisa she pressed her hands down as if to push herself from the chair then simply fell back again annalisa sommers oh dear god you knew her maybe its someone else with the same name maybe its of course its not this is why this has to be why im linked to this she stared down at the broken china im sorry no sit still dont worry mira crouched down laid a comforting hand on celinas knee before picking up the shattered pieces was she your friend no i mean not really she pressed her hands to her temples i knew her a little i liked her you had to like her she was so bright and full of life she dropped her hands and her eyes went huge and dark lucas oh my god lucas he must be out of his mind does he know she reached out grabbed eves hand does he know what happened ive talked to him i didnt think it could get worse but it can it does when its someone you know why would she be in the park she thumped a fisted hand on her leg why would any woman go near a park now after whats already happened because people do what they do how did you know her eve asked through lucas she accepted the tissue mira gave her stared at them as if unaware tears were sliding down her cheeks lucas and i were involved we lived together for a long time right eve nodded hes your ex my exlover yes but not my exfriend it wasnt a nasty breakup we just drifted apart and moved on we cared about each other very much but we werent in love anymore finally she pressed the tissue to her eyes weve kept in touch we even see each other now and again for lunch for a drink for sex she lowered her hands slowly no i suppose you have to ask something like that no we werent intimate anymore and some months ago almost a year ago i think he and annalisa began seeing each other i know because i could see it and because he told me it was serious between them they were happy together and i was happy for them broadminded of you oh for she broke off swallowed whatever angry remark shed been about to make took a calming breath havent you ever had someone in your life you loved then you didnt not in the same way no celina gave a kind of sobbing laugh well people do dallas and still manage to care about each other lucas is a good man he must be devastated he is she squeezed her eyes shut should i go see him no not now not yet my being part of this would only make it worse for everyone can we start sooner she reached for mira again couldnt we start right after the physical no you need this time particularly now if you want to help you need to take this time tm going to help she balled her hands again im going to see his face i swear it when i do her eyes burned as they lifted to eves when i do youll find him youll stop him ill stop him chapter sixteen she knew the vie sympathy rippled over peabodys face lucas lucas grande her ex didnt click before man thats got to be rough especially rough mustve been the trigger all along its the kind of logic in paranormal elements you cant use logic and paranormal in the same sentence sure you can oh stubbornly grounded one they were going to check out shoes eve thought that was logical when can i drive the new ride when you learn that a yellow light means haul ass to get through it before it turns red instead of slowing down to a crawl a half a block away you force me to point out that you drive offensively rather than defensively damn straight you drive like one of those prissy ladies at lunch who wont take the last cookie in case somebody else wants it no please please eve said in a high satisfyingly prissy voice you go ahead hell with that i want the cookie i eat the cookie now give me a for instance and stop sulking i get thirty seconds of sulk time when my driving abilities have been so brutally and unjustly insulted besides taking the last cookie is rude and you and your prissy lady pals end up letting the waiter chow down on it after he takes the plate back to the kitchen with a huff peabody folded her arms over her chest because she realized that was probably true and there were many cookies shed missed due to manners for instance what say youre shacked up with this guy her mood lifted instantly i am shacked up with a guy she said proudly peabody yeah yeah this is a hypothetical she sulked a little more as eve plowed through a yellow light is he really cute and sexy and does he bring me cookies and let me eat the last one to show his love and devotion whatever so you and this guy call it off aw i dont like this part who does was it because i ate all those cookies and my ass got fat peabody okay okay sir im just trying to understand the motivation like who called it off and why and never mind she said when she saw eve bare her teeth you call it off go your separate ways you still pals maybe depends dont bite through my jugular or anything because it really does did the breakup involve calling each other unflattering names and hurling small breakable objects or was it sad yet reasonable a mutual decision see eve didnt see it but stayed the course no but well say for this case it was sad yet reasonable so later this guy hooks up with another skirt how would you feel about that depends again am i hooked up with a guy is the other woman thinner than me or better looking or rich or something does she have perkier boobs these factors play in goddamn it why does it have to be so complicated because it is no youre with the guy then youre not then hes with somebody else simple straightforward are you all chummy okay lets see i was hot for this guy before i moved to new york we werent cohabbing but we were pretty involved stuck together in every sense for nearly a year then it fizzled i wasnt wrecked or anything but i was pretty well moony for a while you get over it though we stayed friendly you could say and i used to see him around is this going to take much longer will i need a hit of stayup to get through the rest you asked anyway he hooked up with this skinny blonde with big tits iq of a rabbit but hey his choice right i felt a little pissy about it but i got over that too maybe in some dark recesses of my soul i wouldnt mind so much if he got a mild case of genital warts but his dick doesnt have to actually fall off or anything and if me and mcnab ever take a spin out west i can show him mcnab off and so there no big she waited a beat still awake barely if youre thinking celinas got some mojo vengeance thing going because of grande and sommers i dont see it doesnt work that way anyhow what doesnt work that way you just said depends about six million times the psychic angle doesnt work that way its not like she could put a spell on some guy have him go around whacking women and make sure one of them was sommers second she came to us if she hadnt she wouldnt have made a blip on the investigative radar when sommers got dead third all evidence points to the fact that sommers went into the park voluntarily and alone then theres the profile guys a loner a woman hater and a predator youre right all the way down the line i guess i dont like paranormal logic which smacks mightily of coincidence i think theres another factor working in your head eve said nothing for a long moment okay i dont like the whole setup depending on psychic visions or hypnosis and i dont like sanchez depending on me to bolster her up or hold her hand no more room at the dallas inn for another friend full up maybe if one of you moved off planet or met with a tragic accident i could juggle another one in come on you like her yeah so what do we have to be pals just because i like her does that mean we have to start hanging am i supposed to give her the last damn cookie now peabody laughed patted eves arm there there youll get through this trial you had a good time last night now eve wanted to sulk but she put her energy into scouting for a parking space yeah yeah and dont think i dont know how this stuff works now we have to have everybody over to our place then youre going to have to have us over to yours and were already planning on having a housewarming party see see she zipped with a deliberate recklessness she knew would have peabodys heart stuffed into her throat up to a second level curbside it never ends once you start you cant get off the friendship ride you just keep circling around and around and around with more people trying to cram on now i have to buy you a goddamn present just because youre shacked up in a new place we could really use some nice wineglasses she was laughing as she climbed out of the car you know dallas youre pretty lucky in your friends of which i am one theyre smart and fun and loyal and diverse i mean could mavis and mira be any more different but they both love you then the chilly thing happens and your friends get to be friends yeah and they go out and make other ones and i get stuck with somebody like trina selfconsciously she ran a hand over the back of her hair shes unique they walked down to street level and youve got a man like roarke so youll never lack for cookies eve blew out a breath wineglasses we dont have any nice ones like for company eve had felt more at home in jims gym than she did in the highend clothing store for the discerning kingsized man the shop was three floors the main with one up and one down since the one down dealt with foot apparel couldnt they just call it shoes and socks they headed down it seemed she discovered foot apparel didnt just mean shoes and socks it included house slippers boots something called leg slickers with or without belly control panels there were shoe protectors shoe boxes heating inserts foot and ankle jewelry and any number of products that dealt with foot care or decoration who knew there was so much involved dealing with a guys feet the salesman she approached gave her the usual hem and haw before striding off to contact the store manager eve zeroed in on the shoes in question while she waited sturdy she decided hefting one practical and efficient and well made from the look of it she wouldnt mind having a pair herself madam lieutenant she corrected and turned with the shoe in hand and had to take a step back angle her head up to make eye contact he was seven feet if he was an inch and skinny as the beanpoles shed seen in greenpeace park his skin was dark as a new moon so that the whites of his eyes his teeth gleamed like ice as she gave him the onceover his mouth quirked in a little smile that told her he was used to it madam lieutenant he said very smoothly im kurt richards the store manager power forward he seemed pleased yes for the knicks once upon a time most people automatically ask if i played basketball but rarely guess the position i dont get the chance to follow much round ball i bet you moved over the boards i like to think so ive been retired nearly eight years now its a young mans game as most are he took the shoe from her his palms were so wide his fingers so long it no longer looked outsized and youre interested in the mikon avalanche im interested in your customer list for purchases of this model in size fifteen youd be homicide youre good at guessing positions too i saw a clip of yesterdays media conference so have to assume this has to do with the park murders that what theyre calling them in large red letters yes lips pursed he turned the shoe over in his hand studied it youre looking for a man who wears this particular model in that particular size it would be of help to me if i could have your customer list for those specifics id be happy to be of help he replaced the shoe on its stand and the names of any employees who purchased same that stopped him well im going to consider myself fortunate that i wear a seventeen in footgear would you like to come up to my office while i get that data for you or browse the store well come up peabody she broke off frowning as she scanned the area and spotted peabody with a handful of colorful socks tor gods sake detective sorry sorry she hustled over ah my brother and my grandfather both big feet i just figured no problem richards gestured to a clerk ill have them rung up and boxed for you you can pick them up at the mainlevel counter on your way out you know christmas isnt that far away with the business done peabody scrambled out of the store purchases in hand behind eve oh please really time zips and if you pick up stuff when you see it you dont get that holiday crazy look in your eyes besides these are really nice socks and they were on sale where are we going the cars were walking next stops only six or seven blocks hikell do your ass good i knew it looked fat in these pants then she stopped squinted at eve you just said that to pay me back for buying the socks right youll just never know will you she kept walking digging out her communicator when it signaled dallas got your first matches feeney said over a mouthful of nuts were starting the next level eliminating females families and those outside the profile parameters she wound and swerved through foot traffic shoot the initial matches to my office unit in case i need to backtrack appreciate the rush job feeney my boys put in the time how about the discs from transit slow going there no promises okay lab idd the shoe ive got a customer list from the first outlet ill send it to you you get a bang from that i need to know asap on that how many outlets altogether too many but well knock them down she paused at the intersection and ignored the steam from a nearby glidecart that carried too much rehydrated onion the pedestrian beside her who muttered under his breath about helldemons and the chatter ladened with the bronx from the two women behind her that appeared to center on the purchase of an outfit that was going to make one of them look like a freaking goddess hes a new york guy she told feeney and strode into the street along with the horde an instant before the signal changed and im banking he does his buying in the city we have to go outside burb out of state net its going to take days if not weeks and hes stepped up the pace yeah so i hear well keep to the grindstone here you need more feet in the field let me know i will thanks they hit two more retail outlets before eve took pity on her partner and grabbed soy dogs at a glidecart it seemed like a good day to eat outdoors to take advantage of the balmy weather so she sat on the grass of central park and studied the castle it hadnt begun there but it was her jumping point a kingsized man king of the castle or was that just stretching things hed placed the second victim on a bench near a memorial that honored heroes men particularly men whod done what needed to be done manly men men who were remembered for their actions in the face of great trauma and adversity he liked symbols king of the castle strength in adversity the third laid out near a garden under a statue of farmers salt of the earth salt purified or it flavored and that was bullshit making something grow using your own hands your sweat and muscle to bring life to bring death she blew out a breath it could play in with the crafts it could selfreliance then do it yourself parks meant something to him the parks themselves something had happened to him in a park something he paid back every time he killed we could go back she muttered look back see if there were any sexual assaults on a male in one of the city parks no a kid thats the key hes big now nobodys going to mess with me now but when he was a kid helpless like a woman how do you fight back when youre a kid so youve got to get strong so it cant happen again youd rather be dead than have it happen again for a moment peabody said nothing she wasnt entirely sure eve was speaking to her could be he got beat up or humiliated rather than assaulted sexually humiliated or hurt in some way by the female authority figure yeah eve rubbed absently at a headache at the base of her skull most likely the female hes killing symbolically now and if it was his mother or sister something along those lines it probably wasnt reported well check anyway if a woman who had charge of him control of him abused him physically sexually it would have twisted him from a young age and later the trigger gets pressed and he pays her back you think getting knocked around as a kid is an excuse the snap in eves voice had peabody speaking carefully no sir i think its a reason and it goes to motive there is no reason for killing innocent people for bathing yourself in their blood because someone messed you up no matter how no matter when no matter who thats a line for the lawyers and the shrinks but its not truth truth is you stand up and if you cant youre no better than the one who beat and broke you youre no better than the worst you can take your cycle of abuse and your victim as victimzer traumatized bullshit and she stopped herself tasted the acrid flavor of her own rage in the back of her throat so she pressed her forehead to her updrawn knees fuck it that was over the top if you think i sympathize with him or find any excuse for what hes done youre wrong i dont think that that rant came to you courtesy of personal neuroses it was hard it would be bitter and it was time eve lifted her head i expect you to go through the door with me without hesitation and i know you will without hesitation i expect you to stand with me to walk through the blood to handle the shit and to put your personal safety and comfort second to the job i know you will not only because its who you are but because by god i trained you peabody said nothing it was different when you were my aide a little bit different but a partners got a right to know things you were raped eve simply stared where the hell did that come from conclusion drawn from observations association logical speculation i dont think im wrong but you dont have to talk about it youre not wrong i dont know when it started i cant remember everything you were abused habitually abuse is a clean word peabody really its a soft word and you people tend to use it so easy to cover a lot of territory my father beat me with his fists or whatever was handy he raped me countless times once is plenty so why count your mother gone by then junkie whore i dont really remember her and what i do remember isnt any better than him i want i want to say im sorry but people say that easy too to cover a lot of territory dallas i dont know what to say im not telling you for sympathy no you wouldnt one night i was eight they said i was eight i was locked in this dump hed brought us to alone for a while and i was trying to squirrel some food some cheese i was starving so cold so hungry and i thought i could get away with it before he came back but he came back and he wasnt drunk enough sometimes if he was drunk enough hed leave me alone but he wasnt and he didnt she had to stop gather herself for the rest he hit me knocked me down all i could do was pray that was going to be all just a beating but i could see it wasnt going to be all dont cry i cant take it if you cry i cant take it without crying but she used one of the stingy napkins to mop at her face he got on top of me had to teach me a lesson it hurt you forget after each time how much it hurts until its happening again and its more than you can imagine more than you can stand i tried to stop him it was worse if i tried to stop him but i couldnt help it i couldnt stand it and i fought he broke my arm oh god oh jesus now it was peabody who pressed her face to her knees and wept struggling to do so soundlessly snap she focused on the lake on the calm water and the pretty boats that glided over it it makes a snap a thin young bone and i went crazy from the pain and the knife was in my hand the knife id been using on the cheese fallen on the floor and my fingers closed over it slowly face drenched peabody lifted her head you used it on him she swiped at her face with the backs of her hands i hope to holy god you ripped him to pieces i did i pretty much did there were ripples on the surface of the lake eve saw it wasnt as calm as it looked with those little ripples spreading spreading i just kept stabbing until well bathed in blood there you go she drew a shaky breath i didnt remember that part or most of the rest until right before roarke and i got married the cops eve shook her head he had me scared of cops social workers anybody who mightve stepped in i left him there in that room i dont know how except i was in shock i washed up and i walked out walked for miles before i crawled into an alley and passed out they found me i woke up in the hospital doctors and cops asking questions i didnt remember anything or if i did i was too scared to say im not sure which id never had the id process so there was no record of me i didnt exist until they found me in the alley in dallas so they gave me a name you made the name you see it affecting the job you tell me it does affect the job its made you a better cop thats the way i see it its made you able to face anything this guy were after whatever happened to him whether it was as bad as what happened to you or somehow worse hes used it as an excuse to kill to destroy and cause pain you use what happened to you as a reason to find justice for people whove had it taken away from them doing the job isnt heroism peabody its just the job so you always say im glad you told me it says you trust me as your partner and as your friend you can i know i can now lets both put it away and get back to work eve rose held her hand down peabody gripped it held it a moment then let eve pull her to her feet as much to see annalisa sommers again as to grill morris eve made another trip to the morgue she found him removing the brains of a male cadaver it was enough to put you off she thought even without the soy dog in her system but morris cheerfully gestured her in unattended death fair means or foul lieutenant morris loved his guessing games so she obliged by moving toward the body for a closer look it had already started to decompose so she put time of death at twentyfour to thirtysix hours before hed been brought in and chilled as a result he wasnt pretty she judged his age in the upper reaches of seventy which meant hed been robbed out of forty or fifty years on the average life expectancy table there was some bruising on his left cheek and his eyes were red from broken blood vessels curious now she walked around the body looking for other signs what was he wearing bottom half of pajamas and one slipper where was the top half morris smiled on the bed where was he in the conservatory with professor plum what morris chuckled waved a hand in front of his face joke he was beside the bed on the floor signs of disturbance forced entry none he live alone he did indeed looks like he stroked out had a bigass brain pop since morris was sealed up she gestured open his mouth for me peel the lips morris obliged shifted aside so she could lean in but id talk to the domestic and find out if he or shes the one who gave dead guy the laced nightcap that popped his brain reddish splotches on the gums and under the lips indicate he downed and probably odd on an illegal booster or a derivative would be my guess before tox eval guy was going to selfterminate for any reason hed have finished putting his pajamas on and gotten into bed nice and comfy first so means are foul wheres sommers i dont know why they bother to keep me around here but he was grinning as he slid the brain into a tray for scan and analysis i expect the tox eval will verify both our suspicions shortly sommers is done and in a cold box her family and boyfriend came in together this morning i was able to block them from seeing her though it wasnt easy i had to use official grounds the eyes arent public yet and i dont want them to be not even to next of kin even family and lovers can leak to the media more so if theyre grieving or pissed no access outside of needtoknow to any of the vies in this investigation you want to see her again yeah let me clean up a bit our gentleman friend will hold he went to the sink to scrub blood matter and sealant from his hands her body was more traumatized than the others violence is escalating i know so is his pace morris dried his hands then removed his protective gear dumping it in a hamper were closer every minute were closer i have no doubt well he stepped over in his pristine blue shirt and red necktie offered his arm shall we she laughed as only he could make her in the company of the dead jesus morris youre some number i am indeed i am he led her to storage checked the logs then opened the seal on one of the drawers the puff of cold vapor steamed out as he drew out the body tray ignoring the marks of morriss work eve studied the body face took more of a beating this time face and upper body maybe hes straddling her she put it into her head straddling her while he pounds on her her jaw wasnt broken as with napier but her nose was and several teeth the blow to the back of the head wasnt fatal she may or may not have come around for the rest of it my guess is not mercifully the rape more brutal this time if there can be degrees of brutality in rape yes more abrasions more trauma she was a bit small vaginally smaller that is than the other two victims in this particular area and our killer sports one hell of a woody the eyes surer cuts than the first not quite as clean as the second youre very good at what you do and again cause me some concern about my own paycheck yes theyre all three within a range of skill but this one falls between the others okay she stepped back so he could replace the tray seal the door how close dallas its beginning to depress me hosting all these pretty young women in my house its not close enough eve said flatly until hes in a cage chapter seventeen dickie less affectionately known as dickhead berenski was sitting at a long white counter in the lab apparently compiling or assessing data on a screen when eve came up behind him she saw the data consisted of a roleplaying game involving a bevy of scantily clad stupendously endowed women battling each other with swords hard at work i see in response he waved a hand in front of the screen the battling beauties laid down weapons bowed low enough to show considerable cleavage before calling out at your pleasure my lord jesus berenski are you twelve hey maybe the programs evidence from a crime scene yeah one where several adolescent boys masturbated to death you may not be on the clock but i am ten minutes recreational got you the shoe didnt i he had and she told herself to remember that and not crush his eggshaped head between her hands annalisa sommers hair anal work work work he swiveled around on his stool gave that to harvo my best hair guy shes a flicking genius even if she wont put out i like her already where is she he pointed one long skinny finger toward the right that way then left redhead hasnt sent me a report yet so shes not done ill check it out peabody let eve get a few strides away and kept her voice low that program come with male characters dickhead grinned oh yeah ice eve made her way into one of the glasswalled analysis rooms and saw the redhead harvo thatd be me she looked up from her work studied eve with eyes the color of spring grass eve figured harvo was the whitest white woman shed ever seen still breathing her skin was the color of milk powder against those bright green eyes and the thin slash of mouth dyed the same screaming red as her hair she wore the hair in a tuft maybe three inches high and straight up from the crown of her head she wore a baggy black tunic in lieu of a lab coat dallas right her nails were short and painted in thin diagonal stripes of black and red thatd be me peabody detective harvo nodded at both of them gestured them in harvo ursa queen of hair what have you got for me your majesty harvo snickered scooted a bit to the left on her stool hairlike trace recovered from vie and surrounding scene she began strands of it were secured in a clear disc seal on the work counter harvo popped it in the comp slot brought its magnified image on screen hairlike yeah see its not human hair or animal hair dickhead bounced it to me because when he eyeballed it he made it as manmade fiber guys freaking brilliant too bad hes a complete asswipe hear me loudly not disagreeing harvo chuckled again i also serve as fiber princess what you got here she revolved the image increased magnification is manufactured as in rug eve tugged her own hair not so much not likely to find this in hair enhancements or replacements this is more fur than hair something youd find on a toy stuffed animal droid pet its coated meeting federal flame retardant standards and child safety laws a toy yep now we analyze the makeup the dye the she glanced up at eve as text and shapes began to flash on her screen you want the process and deets no though im sure theyre endlessly fascinating bottom line it gotcha through my amazing almost mystical powers ive made the manufacturer of the fiber and its various uses for it with this particular gray dye droid pet feline common tabby they do kittens young cats fullgrown even your aged family mouser manufacturer is petco i can hunt up retail outlets if you want well take it from here fast work harvo i am also goddess of speed and efficiency oh and dallas fibers were clean no skin oils no detergents no soil id say this little kitty was new thoughts detective how do you think harvo gets her hair to stand up like that its really jazzed but thats not what you meant not even remotely someone couldve given sommers the droid well need to check with the friends she had dinner with after the play its also possible somebody lost the thing in the park before sommers came along and she saw it picked it up not so easy to check that out if we crap out with the friends we start checking the retail outlets for purchases and try to match any with the lists edd is already running on the chance the kitty cat was his sounds like a plan start running with that eve said as they started back to central i need to check with feeney on edos progress then get to miras for the youre beginningtofeelsleepy hour you think hell hit again tonight i think if we dont lock some names in if celina doesnt have a breakthrough and women dont stay the hell out of the parks in the middle of the damn night morris is going to be hosting another guest real soon on her way up to feeney she snagged a drone from illegals and had him pump her out a tube of pepsi from vending she thought her new method was working out well the machines didnt balk and she wasnt tempted to beat them into rubble a good deal all around she spotted mcnab doing the standard edd pace dance chatter when she swung in he saw her and pranced in her direction hold program he said and tipped down his headset hey lieutenant wheres your curvaceous partner if you refer to detective peabody shes working most of us do just wondering if youre figuring to split end of duty were hoping to finish up with packitup mode tonight and start the haulitover mode tomorrow he looked so damn happy she couldnt work up any sarcasm any minute she suspected the words would float visibly out of his mouth in the shape of little red hearts was it something in the air peabody and mcnab charles and louise mavis and leonardo it was like a smooch epidemic come to think of it she and roarke hadnt had a single spat skirmish or spew in well days cant say when well clock out shes tugging a couple lines right now and after i talk to feeney well have more so what hed winced just a quick flicker but shed caught it nothing no thing man i gotta get back to this or my assll be in the flames continue program he pranced off doubletime shit eve muttered to herself and made a beeline for feeneys office feeney had a headset and was also running two comps simultaneously biting out orders tapping screens or keys in a method she supposed shed have admired if she understood it she thought he looked a little like one of those orchestra conductors in charge focused and slightly mad todays shirt was the color of egg substitute but to eves relief was showing some wrinkles and a little coffee stain bloomed between the third and fourth button when she stepped into his line of sight she caught the same flickering wince shed seen on mcnabs face she said goddamn it pause all programs he pulled off the headset doing another run all data but what im going to tell you isnt going to make you happy how can there not be matches she opened the softdrink tube violently

red cord in their hands but theyve patronized the establishments got you a few more who use or have used the gyms but we dont get any dupes no name or names that pop in both places and none on record as purchasing the shoe well he did it all ribbon shoe gym i know it doesnt mean he paid for the murder weapon or the shoes come to that guy who rapes and strangles and cuts out eyes isnt going to

buy a droid cat litter box issue huh thats a point im a little nervous celina lay back in a sleep chair with the lights dim and a whisper of music eve thought sounded like water flowing into a pool shed left her hair loose and curling lavishly around her neck was a silver chain that dangled with several crystals in wand shapes she wore a dress today a long straight column in severe black that stopped inches above her ankles her hands gripped the arms of the chair try to relax mira moved around the chair checking eve supposed the subjects vital and brain wave patterns i am really were recording this you understand yes and youve voluntarily agreed to undergo hypnosis yes and youve requested that lieutenant dallas be present during the session yes celina smiled a little thanks for making the time its okay eve ordered herself not to shift in her chair shed never witnessed a session and wasnt sure she was going to like it even as an observer are you comfortable celina breathed slowly in and out her hand relaxed on the arms of the chair yes surprisingly i want you to continue to breathe slow and deep picture the air coming inside you soft and blue expelling clean and white mira lifted a small screen and eve could see the silver star on a deep blue background the star pulsed gently like a quiet heartbeat look at the star your breath comes from the star returns to it the star is your center uneasy eve looked away from the screen pushed her thoughts back to the case to block out the soothing tone of miras voice she didnt think you could get hypnotized by accident but why risk it time drifted the liquid music miras quiet voice celinas deep breaths when eve risked a glance back she saw the silver star now filled the screen and that celinas gaze was riveted on it youre floating toward the star now its all you see all there is to see close your eyes now and see the star inside you let yourself float with it youre very relaxed light as air youre absolutely safe you can sleep now and while you sleep youll hear my voice youll be able to speak and respond youll keep the star inside you and know youre safe ill count and when i reach ten youll sleep as she

her its a little white dog silly little dog trotting along she laughs at the dog what does the woman look like shes pretty a homey sort of pretty she has brown hair light brown hair straight to her shoulders her eyes are i cant see the color because its dark they might be brown too but its too dark to tell shes white and looks very fit and healthy she looks happy as she walks the dog she talks

her hitting her she fights blue her eyes are blue i see them now and theyre afraid she tries to run but hes too big hes too fast she cant scream cant scream when hes on top of her crushing her celina can you see him i dont want to see him i dont want to he might see me if he sees me hell he cant see you youre floating and he cant see you youre safe and floating he cant see me thats right theres

him look at his face what do you see rage rage contorted his eyes are black black and blind i cant see his eyes hes wearing something over them shades shades over his eyes with a strap around his head his head shines his face shines horrible hes raping her grunting and slamming himself into her i dont want to see just his face theres something over it a mask it shines not a mask something shiny and slick not white not white under the shine brown tanned i dont know her breathing went rapid thready as she turned her head side to side his face is wide wide and square eyebrows eve prompted do you see his eyebrows celina very dark and thick hes killing her now pulling the red ribbon tight tighter she cant breathe we cant breathe i have to bring her out mira said when celina started to gasp for air celina turn away now turn away from them now and look at your star watch your star can you see it yes i its all you see only the star its beautiful its peaceful its guiding you back now bringing you home youre floating down now very slowly you feel relaxed refreshed when i tell you to open your eyes youll wake up and youll remember everything you saw everything we talked about do you understand yes i want to wake up youre waking up now coming up through the layers of sleep open your eyes celina she blinked them open dr mira yes just stay still for a moment im going to get you something to drink you did very well i saw him she turned her head looked at eve i saw him dallas a smile trembled onto her lips and she reached out a hand eve rose gave celinas hand a brief squeeze since it seemed called for then stepped back so mira could give celina a cup would you recognize him eve asked his face celina shook her head and sipped its hard the shades hid his eyes and whatever was on his face over it distorted it i know the body type as id told you before i know now hes either mixed race dark skinned or tanned and the shape of his face hes bald smoothly like a man who removes or has his hair removed i dont understand what he had on his face a sealant most likely thickly applied what about his voice any accent no no it was guttural but that might have been the rage he didnt shout though not even when he he kept his voice down rings jewelry tats scars birthmarks i didnt see anything didnt notice can we try again and ill absolutely not mira brought up the lights i wont authorize another session until tomorrow evening soonest im sorry eve this sort of thing cant be rushed i feel fine celina protested better in fact than i did before we started and i want you to continue to feel fine youre to go home relax have a meal can that meal include a really big glass of wine certainly mira patted celinas shoulder do what you can to keep your mind off this and well take the next step forward tomorrow i feel like i did take a step it wont be as hard tomorrow are there photos i can look at she asked eve before the session tomorrow i might recognize him if i saw his picture ill see what i can put together by then well celina set the cup aside im going to go have that wine ill walk you out miras admin was closing up for the day and a check of the time told eve it was nearly six time to get moving maybe when this is over we can have a glass of wine together eve led the way to a glide sounds good this hypnosis thing does it make you feel like somebody slipped you a tranq you know so youre out of yourself no well maybe a little but youre tethered if you know what i mean theres some part of you thats aware youre being held safe and you can come back hmm it was a little strange but not really unpleasant the process i mean not what i saw during it where i had to go was very unpleasant so i think that colors it somewhat but essentially its not that different than having visions you got that part nailed i certainly should im hoping this is a oneshot this turn my gifts taken but if its not ill handle it better next time youve handled yourself you find your way out of this maze from here yeah ive got to head back she gestured toward her sector havent you been on since early this morning thats how it goes you can keep it celina said sincerely ill see you tomorrow at miras let me know if you want me to come in earlier and look at pictures youll hear from me eve peeled off wound her way back to homicide she detoured by peabodys desk thumped on it gestured and headed to her own office got a basic description added to ours hes a really big son of a bitch mixed race or she said white before sealant threw her off sounds like he coats it on thick probably uses one thats not completely clear mixed race brown skin or tanned bald smooth dome square face dark thick eyebrows no distinguishing marks that she made this time out he wears dark shades when he does them jesus could be somethings wrong with his eyes could be another symbol or part of his pathology well research eye diseases or sensitivities funkyjunkies are light sensitive hes not on the funk steroids maybe to give the body a boost what do you have for me none of the people sommers spent the evening with gave her or remember her with a droid or a toy no cat ive started running purchases havent hit anything yet run it through then youre going to hook up with feeney for some of in the field feeney were splitting his match list such as it is i want to cover as much territory as we can tonight you saddle with feeney im bringing roarke in hes mostly up to speed anyway saves me briefing another badge she paused sat on the corner of her desk listen if you get lucky and pop on this guy tonight remember hes not going to let you take him down easy youre not going to tell me to be careful are you im going to tell you to be good stay sharp you pop him and he goes for either of you hell go for you first female right hell hurt you if he can so dont let him and right back at you sir give feeney the rest of the description keep it in your head maybe he wears a rug so dallas this isnt my first flight out of the nest right right right restless she got up but bypassed coffee for water over caffeinated she told herself as she opened the bottle i got bad vibes is all want me to call and check in when i get home mommy scram scramming eve dropped down at the desk added her record of the session with mira to her case file and organized her notes into her daily report roarke had told her hed meet her at her office at seventhirty if not before so she had time a little time she started the research on eye sensitivities then let the computer hum along while she got up paced to the window bad vibes she thought again and looked out at her city it wasnt extrasensory what she had what she did was in her opinion the antithesis of paranormal it was elemental maybe on some level even primitive the way early man had known when to hunt and when to hide shed say visceral except the word always sounded sort of pompous to her and there was nothing pompous about cop work the vibes for lack of a better word were a combination of instinct and experience and a knowledge she had no inclination to analyze she knew hed marked his next target and could only wonder who and where hed strike tonight chapter eighteen in his elegant dark business suit roarke circled eves new vehicle while it was parked in her slot in centrals garage havent had a chance to really examine your upgrade long overdue lieutenant it does the job better one hopes than your previous one he tapped the hood release the hood latch why so i can look at the engine why it runs what else is there to know looking at it doesnt change anything he gave her a long pitying smile darling eve your absolute lack of interest and aptitude for mechanics is so female watch it pal wouldnt you like to know whats under here he tapped the hood again whats getting you where youre going no though he had stirred some mild curiosity besides im getting a later start on this than id planned lets just move well lets have the codes he lifted a brow when she frowned if you wont let me play with it you can at least let me drive it she supposed it was fair he was giving her the evening for work she gave him the codes then walked around to the passenger side the department appreciates your time and assistance blah blah please youre much too effusive in your gratitude he settled behind the wheel adjusting the seat to his preference scanning the dash he judged the data and communication system to be middlerange it baffled him that the nypsd didnt spring for topoftheline for their mobile situations he engaged the engine and wasnt displeased by the sound youve got more power under you this time at least then he smiled at her sorry i couldnt get here sooner its okay i kept busy and feeney couldnt wiggle loose until about twenty minutes ago so he and peabody are getting a late start with this too then lets catch up he eased out of the slot drove at a discreet speed to the entrance flicked a glance at the pattern of traffic and punched it jesus roarke he whipped through skimming his way around cabs and cars and oneseaters and nipped through a light a blink before it went to red not bad he decided if i bung this thing up the first week ill never live it down ummhmm he went vertical maintaining it until hed swung around a corner could be a bit more elastic on the turns but it handles well enough and if traffic lights you up im not flashing my badge to kill the violation laterals fairly smooth he decided after testing it out so where are we going she sighed long and deep but at least the question allowed her to relay the first name and address to her map system you want the route displayed on windshield or the dash monitor dash will do on monitor she ordered and couldnt suppress the smile when it popped on i ditched the vocals itll only blab at me if i specifically order it to too bad people dont come with the same accessory she rattled off the route how did celinas session go roarke asked her she handled it we got a few more details but its tough going mira wont approve another session without a twentyfourhour break a slow process yeah and hes not going to move slow its not just women hes after but women he sees as having control over him symbolically maybe i pushed him the wrong way pushed him when i did the interview with nadine then the media conference hes escalating whether you push or not hell continue to kill until you stop him yeah ill be doing that ill damn well be doing that soon her first stop was named randall beam and he wasnt happy about having a cop at the door listen i got a thing im just about out the door already what gives if we can come in randall well tell you what gives then maybe you can keep your thing hell how come a guy has a coupla assaults on his sheet copsre always yanking him its a mystery all right eve stepped in scanned the room it was small man messy without being revolting there was the faintest whiff of something in the air that could get randall a little visit from illegals but shed let it pass unless she had to squeeze him there were curtains at the windows which was a surprise and a couple of nicelooking pillows tucked into the corners of a sagging couch physically beam didnt fit her profile he was about six feet tall a solid and muscular oneeighty but compared to a size fifteen his feet were almost dainty his complexion leaned toward jailhouse white and he sported a long brown ponytail still shed need to take the time with him he might have a friend a brother whatever who fit her needs more closely need your whereabouts randall she gave him the nights of the three murders waited while he stood looking putupon and sad howm i supposed to know you cant tell me where you were last night last night one of thems last night last night after i got off work i got gainful employment good for you so after work me and a couple of the guys stopped in at the roundhouse bar on fourth knocked back a few grabbed some chow played some pool lc works the joint names loelle i was flush so i took her up to one of the privates roundhouses got two for a bang had a couple more drinks got home i dunno about two this heres my day off loelle and your buddies going to confirm all that sure why not loelles down there most nights you can ask her and you can ask ike ike steenburg we work together he was there last night what gives lets get through the other two nights he was clueless about his activities on the night of napiers murder but he balked on explaining what he was doing on the night of maplewoods i had a thing was there till after eleven went out with with some people after for you know coffee got home i dunno maybe midnight i really gotta go now whats the thing randall he shuffled his feet stared at them while color came up on his cheeks why i gotta say because i have a badge you have a sheet i need to know and if you make me ask again im going to be a lot more interested in the zoner i smell jesus cops youre always hassling a guy yeah its the part of the job that gets me up out of bed every morning with a big smile on my face he blew out a breath i dont want the guys to hear about it tm the soul of fricking discretion he shifted his gaze up ran it over her face shifted it to roarke and hunched his shoulder you shouldnt oughta get the wrong idea i aint no fairy or nothing dont know why guys want to bang each other when theres women around but you know live and let thats a touching philosophy randall spill he pulled on his nose shuffled his feet just that last assault bust they say i gotta take anger management and shit so i stop punching people and starting fights but i never punched nobody didnt ask for it eve supposed the flaw was in her but she was starting to like him i know the feeling so they shit they say i should do some therapy kind of deal occupational recreational relaxational what all i sign up for this class in ah crafts you do crafts dont make me no fairy or nothing he gave roarke a steely look as if daring him to disagree did you make the curtains roarke asked pleasantly yeah so his fists bunched at his sides its very good work a nice use id say of fabric and color well he eyed roarke eyed the curtains then shrugged they come out okay its constructive and you know therapeutic i sorta got into it i was working on the pillows there at total crafts they got clubs and shit and instructors thats where i was the night youre saying they give you a break on the supplies and shit and you can use their machines you need to and its kinda interesting is all i got a class tonight on needlepoint you can make all kinds of shit you know what youre doing your instructor and classmates verify this yeah but hey you go down there asking questions talking about my sheet its gonna mess me up coupla skirts in there im thinking about hitting on and its gonna mess me up you forgot about me being the soul of discretion randall any of your buddies know about your hobby his face went to stark stupefied shock hell no you think id mouth off about tricking curtains and pillows to the guys theyd rag me till i had to pound on them then i wouldnt be managing my anger issues and all that got a point eve agreed you knew it wasnt him when he opened the door roarke slid back behind the wheel yeah but youve got to run the lap he says his buddies dont know but its possible one does or somebody he works with somebody hes played pool with a neighbor she lifted a shoulder he nips the cord from randall or uses his name to buy it you cant discount long shots lets hit the next she went through the paces because it had to be done but she didnt quibble when roarke announced it was time for a meal nor did she quibble over his choice of a french place with candles on the table and waiters with their noses in the air his name got them a corner booth in thirty seconds flat with the expected fawning service but the food was choice still she brooded over it picked at it and did more rearranging of it on her plate than eating it tell me whats troubling you he laid a hand over hers its more than the case i guess theres a lot going around in my head give me one i told peabody about i told her about when i was a kid his fingers tightened on hers i wondered if you ever would it wouldve been difficult for both of you were partners youve got to trust your partner im rank and i expect her to follow an order without hesitation and i know she will and that my rank isnt why she will thats not the only reason you told her no no its not she looked at him through the candlelight cases like this they get into my gut i can make a mistake because im looking too hard or im looking away because i cant stand to look too hard you never look away eve well i want to sometimes i want to and the difference is a pretty thin line shes with me every day and shes a good cop shell see if im off and shes got a right to know why i am if i am i agree with you but theres still one more reason you told her shes a friend the tightest i guess next to mavis mavis is different oh let me count the ways she laughed as hed wanted shes not a cop and shes mavis shes the first person i ever told any part of it to the first person i could tell any part of it to i shouldve told feeney we were partners and i shouldve told him but i didnt know didnt remember most of it when we were hooked and besides hes a man i told you youre a man im not your father figure he said and watched her reach quickly for her water glass i guess i mean no youre sure as hell not and maybe feeney in some kind of way doesnt matter she decided i didnt tell him telling mira was almost an accident and shes a doctor ive never dumped it in a big lump on anybody but you and now peabody you told her the whole of it then that i killed him yeah she said something about hoping i ripped him to pieces she cried jesus she dropped her head in her hands is that what troubles you most about this that her heart hurts for you thats not why i told her friendship partnership they arent just about trust eve theyre about affection even love if she didnt feel pity for and anger over the child she wouldnt be your friend i guess i know that ill give you one of the other things on my mind then we have to finish the list i watched the whole hypnotherapy deal today miras brought it up before she doesnt push it but shes told me it might help bring things back to the surface clear it out of me maybe the more you remember the more control you have over it i dont know but i dont think i can go there roarke i dont know if i can even if it means getting rid of the nightmares were you considering it i hadnt ruled it out completely for later sometime later but its too much like testing if you terminate somebody on the job you have to go through testing thats sop and you deal you hate it but you deal this is like saying sure put me through the wringer take away my control because maybe possibly itll make things better if you want to find out more and youre not comfortable with hypnosis there are other ways eve you could dig details out of my past for me the way you dug them out for yourself she picked up the water again ive thought about it im not sure i want to go there either but ill think about it some more i guess finding out what we did before about homeland surveilling him knowing about me knowing what he was doing to me and letting it happen to preserve the integrity of their investigation roarke said something particularly vile about homeland and integrity something she thought with dark humor that didnt belong in snooty french restaurants yeah well its played on my head some finding out other people knew and its made me ask myself would i sacrifice a civilian for a collar you would not no i wouldnt not knowingly not willingly but there are people out there people who consider themselves solid citizens who would would and do sacrifice others to get what they want or need happens every day in big ways in little ways for the greater good for their good for their interpretation of someone elses good by action by omission of action people sacrifice other people all the damn time peabody stepped off the subway and stifled a yawn it was still shy of eleven but she was beat at least she wasnt hungry on top of it as feeney had been as happy as she to break for food her belly was nicely full of fried chicken strips at least it had been billed as chicken and she didnt want to question what else might have been inside the batter dipped into some sort of bright yellow sauce they hadnt been half bad of course theyd crapped out on everything else but that was life with a badge she flipped out her palmlink as she trudged up the steps to street level there she is mcnabs face split by a big welcoming grin filled the screen heading home yet just a couple blocks away we covered a lot of ground didnt pick anything up thats the way it goes you said it did you get any more packing done baby youre going to give me a really big sloppy one when you walk in the door its done and were ready to rock and roll out of here really really she did a little skipstep on the sidewalk there was a lot left you mustve worked the whole time well i had the really big sloppy one as incentive you didnt throw out any of my peabody i want to live i didnt ditch anything including your little stuffed bunny mister fluffytail and i go back ill be there in five be prepared for the sloppy one when it comes to sloppy ones im a fricking youth scout she laughed stuffed the link back in her pocket life was really good she thought her life was really good in fact just at the moment it was absolutely mag all the little nerves about moving into a new place with mcnab signing a lease blending lives furniture styles sharing a bed with the same guy for well possibly forever were gone it felt right it felt solid it wasnt as if he didnt irritate her crosseyed sometimes it was that she got he was supposed to it was part of their thing their style she was in love she was a detective she was partnered with the best cop on the nypsd possibly the best cop anywhere shed actually lost three pounds okay two but she was working off number three even now as she walked she looked up smiled at the lights glowing in her apartment her old apartment she corrected mcnab would probably come to the window any minute to look out wave or blow her a kiss a gesture that mightve looked silly on another guy but gave her such a nice little rush when it came from him shed blow one back and wouldnt feel silly at all she slowed her pace just a bit to give him time to come to the window fulfill the fantasy she never saw him coming there was a blur of movement he was big bigger than shed imagined and he was fast she knew in that fingersnap of time that she saw his face eyes obscured by black sunshades that she was in trouble terrible trouble instinct had her pivoting reaching for the weapon she wore at her hip then it was like being rammed by a stampeding bull she felt the pain crazy pain in her chest in her face she heard something break and realized with a kind of sick wonder that the something was inside her her mind stopped working it was training rather than thought that had her pumping out with her legs aiming for any part of his mass so she could knock him back far enough to give her room to roll she barely budged him whore his face loomed over her features obscured by the thick layers of sealant the wide black shades it seemed time dripped slow as syrup that her limbs were weighed down like lead she reared up to kick again all in slow painful motion struggling to suck in air to a chest that burned like fire ordering herself to remember details cop whore going to mess you up he kicked her so she doubled up in agony as her fingers fumbled for her weapon parts of her separate parts of her went numb and still she could feel the violent impact of his feet his fists she could smell her own blood he plucked her up as if she were no more than a childs doll this time she heard felt something rip someone screamed she felt herself hurled into the dark as she fired mcnab put on music shed sounded tired when shed called so he went for some of her freeager flutey shit since hed finished packing the lot including sheets they were going to bunk in her sleepbag he thought shed get a bang out of it last night in the old place all cuddled up together on the floor like kids camping out it was just totally frosty he poured her a glass of wine he liked doing it for her thinking how shed do it for him when he caught a late night it was the sort of things cohabs did he supposed it was the first official cohabitation for both of them theyd live he decided and learn he was thinking maybe hed go to the window toss her out a noisy kiss as she walked up when he heard the screaming he raced out of the kitchen leaping over packing boxes and across the living area to the window and his heart stopped dead he had his weapon in one hand his communicator in the other without any memory of grabbing either and was running out the door officer needs assistance all units all units officer needs immediate assistance he shouted out the address as he bolted down the stairs praying praying she was half on the sidewalk half on the street facedown with blood her blood staining the concrete a man and a woman were crouched beside her and another was huffing toward them get away get away he shoved blindly at the nearest im a cop oh god oh jesus god dee he wanted to scoop her up gather her in and knew he didnt dare instead he pressed shaking fingers to the pulse in her throat and felt his heart hitch when he felt the beat okay god okay officer down he snapped it into his communicator officer down require immediate medical assistance this location hurry goddamn it hurry he touched her hand struggled not to squeeze it got his breath back be on the lookout for a black or dark blue van late model heading south from this location at high speed he hadnt seen it clearly enough not enough hed only seen her when he started to strip off his shirt to cover her one of the men pulled off his jacket here cover her with this we were just coming out across the street and we saw hold on dee peabody you hold the hell on still gripping her hand and seeing now she had her weapon in the other he looked up at the people around him his eyes went flat and cold as a sharks i need your names i need to know what you saw eves heart was knocking on her ribs when she shoved off the elevator and strode doubletime down the hospital corridor peabody she said slapping her badge on the counter of the nurses station detective delia whats her status shes in surgery thats not telling me her status i cant tell you her status because im not in surgery eve roarke put a restraining hand on her shoulder before she simply leaped over the counter and throttled the nurse mcnab will be in the waiting area we should go there first she struggled to draw a breath even out her terror and temper get somebody to go into surgery and get her status do you understand me ill do what i can you can wait down the hall to your left easy baby roarke murmured to her slid his arm around her waist as they went toward the waiting area try to take it easy ill take it easy when i know what the hells going on she stepped into waiting and stopped he was alone she hadnt expected him to be alone such places were usually filled with people agonizing but there was only mcnab standing at one of the windows staring out detective he spun around and the grief and hope on his face shuddered into only grief lieutenant they took her they took her into they said i dont know ian roarke crossed to him laid an arm around mcnabs shoulders and drew him toward a chair youll sit a minute now ill get you something to drink and youll sit a minute theyre taking care of her now and in a bit ill go and see what i can find out you have to tell me what happened eve sat beside mcnab he had a ring on each thumb she noticed and blood on his hands peabodys i was in the apartment all packed up id just talked to her shed tagged me to tell me she was a couple blocks away she was only i shouldve gone out and met her thats what i shouldve done gone out and then she wouldnt be walking alone i had music on fucking music on and i was in the kitchen i didnt hear anything until the screams wasnt her she didnt have a chance to scream mcnab roarke turned from the vending autochef at the tone of her voice he was about to step in draw her away when he saw the change she reached out took one of his bloodsmeared hands in hers held it ian she said i need you to give me a report i know its hard but you have to tell me everything you know i didnt get any details i give me a minute okay give me a minute sure here drink whatever hes got here tea roarke sat on the table in front of them faced mcnab have a bit of tea now ian and catch your breath look here a minute he laid a hand on mcnabs knee until mcnab lifted his head met his eyes i know what it is to have the one you love the only one hurt theres a war in your belly and your hearts so heavy it doesnt seem as if your body can hold it this kind of fear doesnt have a name you can only wait with it and let us help i was in the kitchen he pressed the heels of his hands hard against his eyes then he took the tea hadnt been more than two three minutes since she told me she was a couple blocks away probably just got off the subway i heard a woman scream and shouts i ran to the window and i saw he used both hands to lift the tea then drank it like medicine i saw her lying facedown head and shoulders on the sidewalk the rest in the street two males and a female were running toward her from the northwest and i saw caught a glimpse of a vehicle heading south at high speed he stopped to clear his throat i ran down i had my weapon and communicator i dont know how i dont remember i called for assistance and when i got to her she was unconscious and bleeding from the face and head her clothes were bloody torn some he squeezed his eyes shut she was bleeding and i checked her pulse she was alive she had her weapon out and in her right hand he didnt get her piece the son of a bitch didnt get her piece you didnt see him i didnt see him i got names and partial statements from the three witnesses but then the mts got there i had to go with her dallas i left the witnesses to the uniforms who responded i had to go with her of course you did you get a make on the vehicle plates dark van couldnt tell the color just dark but i think black or dark blue couldnt see the plates light was out on them witnesses didnt make it either one of the guys jacobs he said it looked new really clean maybe it was a sidewinder or a slipstream did they see her assailant his eyes went flat again and cold yeah they made him pretty damn good big beefy guy bald sunshades they saw him kick her fucking stomp on her they saw her lying on the ground and the bastard kicking her then he hauled her up like maybe he was going to heave her into the back of the van but the woman started screaming and the guys shouted and started running he threw her down they said he threw her down and jumped into the van but she got a shot off thats what they told me she got a shot off when he was throwing her down maybe it hit him maybe he staggered they werent sure and i had to go go with her so i couldnt follow up you did good you did great dallas and now she saw he was struggling against tears if he broke shed break take it easy they said the medicals they said it was bad we were riding in they were working on her they told me it was bad tm going to tell you what you already know shes no pushover shes a tough cop and shell come through he nodded swallowed hard she had her weapon in her hand she kept her weapon shes got spine roarke he nodded and walking out to gather information left her and mcnab waiting alone chapter nineteen he paced and prowled and keened like an animal and wept like a child as he crossed back and forth back and forth in front of the staring eyes the bitch had hurt him it wasnt allowed those days were over and he wasnt supposed to be hurt anymore ever look at him he swung around toward the wall of mirrors to reassure himself look at his body hed grown tall taller than anyone he knew do you know how much clothes cost you damn freak you better start pulling your weight around here or you re gonna go around naked as far as im concerned im not going to keep popping for them im sorry mother i cant help it no no he wasnt sorry he was glad he was tall he wasnt a freak and hed made himself strong hed worked hed strained hed sweated until hed created a strong body a body to be proud of a body people respected women feared youre puny youre weak youre nothing not anymore mother grinning fiercely he flexed the biceps of his uninjured arm not anymore but even as he looked as he preened in front of the glass to admire the brawny form hed spent years building he saw himself shrink whittling down until it was a gangly boy with pinched cheeks and haunted eyes staring back at him the boys chest was crisscrossed with welts from a beating his genitals were raw from the vicious scrubbing shed given them his hair hung dank and dirty to his shoulders the way she made him keep it shell punish us again the little boy told him shell put us back in the dark no she wont he swung away from the mirror she wont i know what im doing cradling his injured arm he tried to pace off the pain shell be punished this time you can bet your bottom dollar took care of the cop bitch didnt i didnt i hed killed her he was damn sure hed broken her into a few nasty pieces oh yeah but his arm it was hot and numb the kind of numb that came with prickling needles from shoulder to fingertip he cradled it against his body moaning as he was caught between boy and man mommy would kiss it and make it all better mommy would slap him silly and lock him in the dark we havent finished he heard the little boy the sad desperate little boy no he hadnt finished hed be punished unless he could finish it put in the dark blind in the dark burned and whipped with her voice pounding in his head like spikes he shouldnt have left the cop behind but it had happened so fast the screaming the people running toward him the shocking pain in his arm hed had to run the little boy had said run what choice had he had i had to he dropped to his knees pleading with the eyes that floated in silence that stared without pity ill do better next time just wait ill do better in the bright lights that were never turned off he knelt and rocked and wept eve couldnt sit she wandered to the vending area ordered up more coffee she carried the thin bitter brew to the window stared out as mcnab had done she ran over in her mind what shed done what was left to be done but she couldnt keep her thoughts from stealing into surgery where she envisioned peabodys lifeless body on an operating table and faceless doctors with blood on their hands to their wrists peabodys blood she spun around as she heard footsteps approaching but it wasnt roarke or one of those faceless doctors feeney hurried in his stylish shirt rumpled from the long day a flush of anxiety riding on his cheeks he shot her a look and when she only shook her head he went straight to mcnab and sat as roarke had on the table they spoke in murmurs feeneys low and steady mcnabs thin and disjointed eve circled around them and into the corridor she needed to know something to do anything when she saw roarke coming toward her when she saw his face her knees went to water shes not no he took the coffee from her because her hands had started to shake shes still in surgery eve he set the coffee on a rolling tray so that he could take both of her hands in his just tell me three broken ribs her lung collapsed on the way in her shoulders torn up hips fractured theres considerable internal damage her kidneys bruised and her spleen theyre trying to repair but they may have to remove it god they if they do they can replace it they can replace anything what else he shattered her cheekbone dislocated her jaw thats bad its bad but they can fix theres head trauma its a concern he ran his hands rhythmically up and down her arms kept his eyes on hers its very serious the attending physician hed collared in er had told him peabody looked as if shed been struck headon by a maxibus they they say her chances they wouldnt no i can tell you they have a full team on her and if theres a need for outside specialists well get them well get whatever she needs her throat was flooded and closed like a dam she managed a nod how much do you want me to tell him what mcnab he rubbed her shoulders now waited while she closed her eyes gathered herself how much do you want me to tell him all of it he needs to know all of it he she broke off let herself cling for a moment when roarke drew her in god oh god shes strong shes young and strong and healthy it weighs on her side you know that broken shattered fractured go tell him feeneys here feeneys with him go tell them come sit down then gently he kissed her forehead her cheeks wait with them well all wait together not yet im okay she eased back but took his hands squeezed them before releasing them i just need to settle down and i i need to contact some people i need to do things or ill go crazy he drew her to him again held tight we wont let her go an hour ticked by minute by endless minute we get any more eve shook her head at feeney shed taken to leaning up against the wall outside the waiting area when she wasnt pacing the waiting room had started to fill with cops uniforms detectives civilian drones who settled in to wait or stopped by for news her family i talked them into staying put at least until we know more she sipped from another cup of coffee as soon as we do ill give them her status i played it down a little maybe i shouldnt have but nothing they can do for now right if they have to get here roarkes already made arrangements for transpo hows mcnab hanging on by a couple of greasy threads right now but hanging all the same helps to have other cops around his eyes went to slits hes meat dallas theres not one badge in the city who wont put in the time to track him now he came after one of ours hes meat eve agreed and hes mine she stayed leaning against the wall only turning her head when she heard the clip of heels shed been expecting them nadine streamed down the corridor two uniformed officers at her back good was all eve thought she needed the distraction of going a round with someone but nadine stopped in front of them laid one hand on feeneys arm the other on eves how is she friendship first eve realized when it came to the wire friendship crossed the line first shes still in surgery nearly two hours now did they give you any idea when she stopped herself no they never do i need to talk to you dallas talk alone sorry feeney no problem he slipped back into the waiting area is there somewhere we can sit down nadine asked sure eve simply slid down the wall until her butt met the floor and looking up sipped her coffee after a tap of her foot and a shrug nadine sat on the floor beside her as far as peabodys concerned i wont air anything you dont want aired thats for her appreciated shes my friend too dallas i know she is because her eyes stung she closed them i know it you give me what you want out there and ill get it out now lets take a minute to discuss the gorillas youve put on my tail eve looked over at the uniforms satisfied they were per her orders burly guys and seasoned what about them how do you expect me to work with a couple of storm troopers in my shadow that would be your problem i dont he went after her he could go after you we were on screen together little push she murmured a little push i didnt expect him to go for peabody he was supposed to go for you makes more sense goddamn it im primary im in charge but he goes for my partner so he could go after you working through the lineup i get that now wants me to see he can take out my people under my nose wants me to know it before he comes for me i can follow the dots dallas but it doesnt address how im suppose to gather data and report same when i come as a trio and two of that trio are badges nobodys going to talk to me deal with it eve snapped just fucking deal nadine hes not going to put his hands on another friend he doesnt get the chance for another nadine studied the icy rage on eves face and said nothing she leaned back took the coffee out of eves hand sipped tastes like warm piss she commented then sipped again no maybe a little worse than that its not so bad after the first gallon ill take your word she decided and handed it back i dont want him to get his hands on me i do want to mention i know how to take precautions particularly after my own romp in the park with a homicidal maniac a year or so ago and i havent forgotten who got me out of that im also smart enough and have a healthy enough sense of selfpreservation to accept that there might be times i need someone to take an interest in my welfare so ill deal dallas she shifted looking for comfort on the hard floor and actually the one on the left is kind of hot try not to have sex with one of my men when hes on duty ill try to restrain myself im going to go see mcnab for a minute she nodded eve considered pacing again or just closing her eyes and pushing herself into oblivion roarke came out before shed decided crouched in front of her it might be an idea to go down get some food other than the slop available through vending for the horde in there trying to give me something to do with myself both of us okay he straightened took her hand to pull her to her feet it just seems like we should know something more by now it just seems like she looked toward the elevators and saw louise and charles rushing in news charles demanded nothing nothing for over an hour now ill go into surgery louise squeezed charless arm ill scrub up get a look for myself thatll be better eve said when louise dashed off well know more and thatll be better what can i do charles gripped eves hand give me an assignment something she looked into his eyes the friendship deal came in a lot of layers she thought a lot of measures roarke and i were talking about getting some food for everybody let me take care of that ill just go let mcnab know were here and ill take care of it it keeps rippling doesnt it roarke watched charles move through the groups of cops to where mcnab stood all the people the relationships the connections lieutenant he framed her face with his hands kissed her gently on the forehead it wouldnt hurt you to find a flat surface close your eyes for a few minutes cant do it i didnt think so she waited and felt she was at the center of a vortex as she contacted or was contacted by whitney mira peabodys family cops came some went more stayed edd and homicide uniforms and rank get mcnab she murmured to roarke when she spotted louise keep it low i dont want the whole department out here when she fills us in bracing herself she stepped forward to meet louise roarkes getting mcnab so you only have to say it once good she wore scrubs now pale green and baggy ill go back observe but i wanted to give you what i could roarke came out with mcnab with feeney and charles the first circle eve supposed of all those spreading ripples are they finished mcnab said quickly is she theyre still working on her its going well shes got a solid surgical team ian and shes holding her own she reached out took his hands its going to take a while longer there was extensive damage and the fact is shes undergoing more than one surgery her vitals are good and everything that can be done is being done how much longer eve demanded two three hours more at least shes critical but shes holding now im going to suggest you go down and give blood its something positive you can do ill go back in observe the head of the surgical team will give you more details when its done but ill keep you updated as much as possible could i go in with you if i scrubbed no louise leaned in kissed his cheek go down give blood do the positive think strong thoughts those things matter i promise okay ill go down now well both go down feeney said then jerked his chin toward the waiting room well go down in shifts time were finished youll have more cop blood in this place than you know what to do with a little woozy from the loss of a pint of blood eve would rather have lost it through injury than by syringe she sat back in the waiting area her hands stayed in roarkes while her mind drifted she thought of the first time shed seen peabody looking efficient in her uniform thered been a body between them there was always another body she remembered when shed pulled peabody off patrol and into homicide as her aide and how peabody had nearly sir yes sird her to death in the first hour those days were over hadnt taken the smart mouth long to surface in over and around the sirs stood up for herself is what she did respected the rank but stood up for herself learned fast quick brain good eyes good cop god how much longer fell for a detective who turned out to be a wrong cop shook her confidence hurt her feelings then mcnab had pranced in charles had glided but in spite of the looks of that strange triangle it has always been mcnab a couple of hard bumps and theyd bounced away from each other bad feelings bitter words spitting at each other if they were in the same space more than ten seconds bounced back together eventually maybe thats what people did bounced back where they were supposed to be bumps or not eve at roarkes voice she stirred blinked her eyes open and followed his look toward the doorway and louise she got up quickly joined the group already gathering around louise shes out of surgery theyll be bringing her into recovery and the surgeons will come through shortly to talk to you she came through it mcnabs voice was hoarse with fatigue and emotion she came through yes shes critical and theyll almost certainly put her in icu for the time being shes in a coma oh god its not unusual ian its a way for her body to rest to recover the early scans look good but shell need more theyll need to keep a close eye on her for the next several hours shell come out of it theres every reason to believe so yes there are some concerns the kidney for instance but she came through the surgery well strong i can see her right theyre going to let me see her absolutely in just a little while okay that seemed to settle him the shakes smoothed out of his voice and i can just sit with her until she wakes up she shouldnt wake up alone im sure you can no more than two in the room at once but itll be good for her to know someones there she will know louise promised shell know eve took her turn stepping in with roarke while mcnab hovered just outside the room in icu shed prepared herself but it wasnt enough nothing wouldve been enough to brace her for that first look peabody lay on the narrow bed tethered by more tubes than eve cared to count maybe the steady hum and beep of monitors was supposed to be reassuring but they made her jittery but she could have taken that shed visited hundreds of victims fellow cops perps in hospital rooms and knew what to expect but none of them had been peabody lying utterly still with her face so bruised it was barely recognizable the sheet covered her to the neck but eve imagined there were many other bruises under it strapping bandaging suturing and god knew what under that white sheet theyll treat the bruising roarke said from behind her it wouldnt have been a priority he broke her face the son of a bitch and hell pay for it look at me eve he turned her gripped her arms tight shes mine almost as much as shes yours im in this until the end of it i want my chance at him as well it cant be personal thats the primary rule on any investigation and thats bullshit she stepped away from him stepped toward the bed thats just raging bullshit because its as personal as it gets he doesnt get by doing this to her so yeah she looked up met his eyes then turned her icy gaze to peabody were both in it till the end she leaned over spoke quiet and clear im going to kick his ass for you peabody youve got my word on it she reached out then hesitated unsure where to touch in the end she laid her hand on peabodys hair well be back she waited as roarke bent to touch his lips to peabodys bruised cheek then her lips soon well be back soon they went out to where mcnab and feeney waited he messed her up bad mcnabs eyes looked hollow like caves of anger and anguish yeah yeah he did i want to be there when you take him down i want to be there lieutenant but i cant leave her i cant leave until until she wakes up as far as im concerned thats your primary assignment i could do some work from here while i was sitting with her if i had the equipment i could do runs or data searches anything were still trying on the transit discs i could keep punching that ill get your work eve promised and ill get you what you need to do it feeney laid a hand on his shoulder you go on son sit with her ill bring you what you need thanks i dont think idve made it through tonight if thanks feeney drew a long breath when they were alone and his eyes were bright and fierce were going to burn this bastard damn right eve promised shed start at home shower off the night marshall her thoughts and resources the moment they walked in summerset was there detective peabody he might be an asshole eve thought but right now he looked like an asshole who hadnt slept and who was carrying a load of worry she came through it she looks like somebody tossed her in front of a train but she came through shes in icu roarke continued she hasnt regained consciousness yet but theyre hopeful mcnabs with her if i can be of any help eve had started up the stairs but now she stopped looked down on him and considered you know how to run the unregistered of course tm taking roarke with me so youre on eduty im going to get a shower then ill tell you what youre looking for tell me what youre looking for roarke prompted when they reached the bedroom i have to think it through think out loud while we both grab a shower she worked up the energy to narrow her eyes at him showers strictly for body maintenance i consider sex body maintenance but well catch up with that another time she talked it out while the hot water helped rinse some of the fog out of her head and though she hated them and the jumpy way they made her feel she popped a stayup shoved a couple more in her pocket for later maybe im off but i want to turn all the stones whether youre on or off roarke replied well turn the stones and see whats under them youre going to eat we can chomp a couple nutribars on the way no foot firmly down on this one fuel youll shovel in some fuel its barely six in the sodding morning he reminded her as he programmed the autochef you want to interview the witnesses youll do better when theyre awake he had a point and arguing would only slow things down so she sat shoveled in what he put in front of her you said something to mcnab about how it feels when somebody when somebody you love gets hurt ive put you through that a few times maybe not as bad as this but close enough roarke replied yeah i how do you stand it hints of the fear and the worry of the night eked through how do you get through it he said nothing only took her hand and watching her over it brought it to his lips it made her eyes sting again and her throat constrict and burn so she looked away i cant let go even a little it feels like if i let go at all ill just break to pieces and i cant stop ive got to keep moving keep going forward and i have to keep telling myself theres going to be payment whatever it takes whatever it costs theres going to be payment she shoved her plate away and stood im supposed to say justice therell be justice and im supposed to mean it but i dont know if its going to be enough i should step back from it if i dont know if thats enough i should step back but i wont i cant and will you continue to ask more of yourself than is human she reached down picked up her badge she studied it for a long moment before she slid it into her pocket yeah lets get started she briefed summerset kept it short to the point then headed out to her car i cant believe im asking him to commit an illegal act it would hardly be the first of his life and that im asking him to assist in a police investigation that may very well be a first ha no im driving im all buzzed from the chemicals well now that inspires confidence in your passenger i gotta do stuff or ill just rev you take anything not yet she got behind the wheel talk about more than human just metabolism darling ill likely need something by midday if were still at it you can count on that witness lives same block as peabody get me the exact address then she looked over at him as he called up the data thanks youre welcome but this isnt just for you no i know needing the contact she reached over gripped his hand as she drove through the gates but thanks chapter twenty she didnt bother to hunt up a parking space but doubled beside a clunky solar mini that looked as if it hadnt moved in six months flipping the on duty light she stepped out and ignored the shouted cops suck from the driver of a rusted compact stuck behind her if shed been feeling more chirpy shed have taken the time to stroll over and have a little chat with him instead because she couldnt help herself she walked across the street and studied the bloodstains on the pavement laid in wait thats his style maybe he followed her sometime tracked her home sometime and she didnt make the tail but she shook her head even as she said it you cant just pop a cops address out you work at it maybe you can finesse it but there are blocks on cops personal data had to tail her or do some heavy hacking she thought about the interview for nadine and the media conference both times shed pushed peabody forward how long would it take a decent hacker to pop a blocked address depending on talent and equipment roarke was studying the bloodstains as well and thinking of peabody her steadiness her sweetness anywhere from an hour to a few days an hour jesus why do we bother its a shield against the general populace tapping into a cops data is an automatic flag for compuguard its a heavy risk unless you dont give a bloody damn or you know how to get around the blocks and guards you have any reason to think hes got aboveaverage hacking skills just thinking he knew his victims schedules their routes their habits where they lived and all but one lived without a partner elisa maplewood lived in a family unit yeah a family unit with the male portion of that unit out of the country maybe he factors that element in he tailed them yeah had to do some of that and weve got merriweathers comment about the big bald guy on her subway but he couldve done some comp research gather as much data as possible he takes risks sure big ones but theyre calculated and the guy were projecting doesnt blend merriweather spotted him so im thinking he doesnt do extensive fieldwork preps as much as possible by remote its possible probable he moved fast with peabody faster i think than the others thats because she wasnt the standard for him shes an addon prove a point because he was pissed or threatened she stayed as she was tilted her head to look up at the apartment windows and you know what else he didnt know enough about her to know there was another cop up there waiting for her or enough about the neighborhood to consider someone might spot him and try to help didnt do as much research too mad too threatened in too much of a hurry eve angled back to look down the street she takes the subway most times and she wouldnt be looking for a shadow he couldve stalked her like he stalked the others but i dont think it worked that way because shed have made him shed have made a tail shes got good eyes good instincts hacking her address would cut back on the time and the risk of being seen yeah and she was putting in overtime you have to log any assigned of if he could get her address he could get her schedule because when i hooked her with feeney and brought you in i plugged it into the system he took her chin turning her head so their eyes met eve im not blaming myself or was trying not to im blaming him im just trying to see how it went down thats all he nails her home location knows shell be late if he knows all that he knows she doesnt have a personal vehicle registered in her name and that shell most likely be on foot so he comes here parks and just waits patient bastard he just waits until she comes along still risky this streets welllighted and shes less than a half a block from her door and shes a cop armed and able it wasnt smart roarke said it wasnt like the others no with her me he was pissed prove a point like i said but at the base of it he doesnt figure shell give him trouble not like she did shes just a woman and hes a big strong man take her down take her down toss her in the back of the van and poof she crouched down laid her hand on the stain of her partners blood where was he going to take her same place same place he took the others the ones before the missings and presumeds shell have gotten a good look at him shell be able to describe him more thoroughly even more than celina eve glanced up if she remembers head trauma she might not remember but if she does shell make him shes sharp and she notes the details shell be the one who takes him down when she wakes up if she remembers eve pushed to her feet lets see what the witnesses saw well take the female first essie fort single age twentyseven paralegal at driscoll manning and fort tax lawyers eve worked up a smile as they approached the building youre handy we do what we can he pressed the button for fort in a while they waited eve turned judged the distance between the door and the point of attack a male voice came through the intercom yeah lieutenant dallas nypsd wed like to speak with ms fort i want to see your oh there it is the voice said when she held her badge up to the security cam come on up he buzzed them in and was waiting at the door when they got off on three essies inside im mike mike jacobs you also witnessed the incident mr jacobs ill say essie jib and i were just coming out going to head over and pick up jibs date and we come on in sorry he opened the door wider i stayed here last night didnt want to leave essie alone she was pretty shook up shes getting dressed he glanced toward a closed door the woman who got beat up was a cop right did she make it shes holding her own glad to hear it man that guy was whaling on her mike pushed at his curly mop of blond hair look i was hunting up some coffee you want no thanks mr jacobs id like to get statements from both you and ms fort and ask some questions no problem we talked to some cops last night but everything was messed up look let me get this coffee okay we didnt get much sleep last night and i need the jolt sit down or something ill try to move essie along she didnt want to sit but she perched on the edge of a chair in bold red gave herself a moment to settle by glancing around the room lots of strong colors weird geometric art on the walls a bottle of wine and a couple glasses left over from the night before mike jacobs was wearing jeans and a shirt he hadnt buttoned probably what hed had on the night before probably hadnt planned on staying the night new relationship maybe without the understanding sex would follow an evening out but hed stayed and he had according to mcnab come to peabodys aid maybe he didnt think cops sucked the bedroom door opened the woman who came out looked fragile and slight her hair was a short wedge of glossy ravenwing black and her eyes a blue strong enough to fit her decor though they looked exhausted im sorry mike said the police were coming up i was getting dressed im lieutenant dallas do you know her the woman who was hurt i know shes a police officer ive seen her walking across the street she used to wear a uniform but now she doesnt shes a detective now shes my partner oh those blue eyes filled sympathy distress fatigue eve didnt know im so sorry im so sorry is she going to be all right i eve felt her throat close again it was harder somehow harder to take concern from strangers i dont know i need you to tell me exactly what you saw i we were going out she looked over as mike brought out two thick red mugs thanks mike would you tell it sure come on lets sit down he led her to a chair and sat on the arm of it beside her we were coming out like i said we heard the noise as soon as we walked out the door shouts and well the sounds you hear from a fight he was a big guy seriously big he was kicking her and shouting kicking her when she was down she pumped up her legs knocked him back a little it all happened really fast and i think we all froze for a second or two it was just essie shook her head we were all laughing and joking around then we heard and looked over it was just bam he jerked her up off the ground just hauled her up and i screamed it got us moving mike continued like holy shit dont just stand here we yelled i guess and jib and i started running for them he looked around and he just threw her like heaved her you know she went down so hard essie shuddered i could hear her hit the sidewalk but while she was airborne there was this flash i think she fired at him as she was flying mike looked at essie and got a nod maybe she hit him i dont know she went down hard sort of rolled like she was going to try to fire again or get up or she couldnt essie murmured he jumped into the van moved like lightning but jib said he thought the guy was holding his arm like it was hurt anyway he jetted jib chased the van for a few yards dont know what hedve done if hed caught it but she was hurt really bad and we figured that was more important we were afraid to move her so i was calling for an ambulance when the guy the other guy the cop comes running out fired at him eve thought flying through the goddamn air but shed fired at him and had held onto her weapon tell me about the van black or dark blue almost sure it was black it was new or really well kept lieutenant im sorry dallas it happened really fast like he snapped his fingers and we were all yelling and running so its pretty jumbled up i tried to catch the plate but it was dark and i couldnt make it out it had windows on the side and in the cargo doors they mightve been blacked out or covered i couldnt tell but there were windows you may think its jumbled mr jacobs but every detail youre giving me matters tell me about the assailant did you see his face we got a look when he heard us yelling and turned our way we got a decent look i think essie and i spent some time last night trying to put it together hold on a minute he was like something out of a nightmare essie added when mike went into the bedroom i couldnt sleep last night because i kept seeing him and hearing the way it sounded when he threw her down i think this is the best that weve got mike came back in with a sheet of paper handed it to eve she felt her heart thud when she looked at the sketch you drew this art teacher he smiled a little we only saw his face for a second or two but i think thats close mr jacobs im going to ask you to come into central work with an ident artist sure ive got a class at nine but i can call in you want me to go in now it would be a great help if both of you and mr jibson could go in this sketch can be used in an id program and the three of you can help the police artist create the closest possible likeness ill get a hold of jib now tell him to meet us there where do we go ill take you tell your friend to go to level three section b identification procedure ill have him cleared and escorted give me ten minutes eve got to her feet mr jacobs ms fort i want to tell you how much the department how much i personally appreciate what you did last night what youre doing now mike moved a shoulder anybodyd do the same no not everybody her luck was turning eve decided when she was able to collar yancy as her ident artist there were others who were as good with a sketch or a compgenerated image but yancy had a way of helping a witness remember details of talking them through the process whats the latest with peabody he asked eve she couldnt count the number of times shed been stopped with a variation of the question on her way through central no change he looked down at the sketch shed handed him well get this fucker her brows lifted yancy wasnt just known for his skill with imaging but for his mild manner count on it i need you to run me a copy of that for now get that right for you he moved to his imaging comp slid the sketch in hes got layers of sealant on his face and it distorts it some you need to factor that i know i shouldnt ask how long but i have to i wish i could tell you he handed her the copy how cooperative are they he nodded to the anteroom where the witnesses waited unbelievably almost make me want to hang up my cynics cap and wear the badge of the optimist then itll be quicker he studied the sketch again artist is good thatll help considerably im pushing everything else aside till we have him for you lieutenant thanks she wanted to stay watch the process somehow hurry it along she wanted to be at the hospital with peabody somehow bring her back she wanted to yank and draw on every line and thread at once you cant be everywhere eve she glanced over at roarke shows i feel like im running in place goals in sight but im stuck in this spot maybe you could contact the hospital again charm some information out of somebody i just make them mad people tend to get cross when someone threatens to pull their brains out of their nostrils youd think theyd give me points for creativity im too wired she shook herself as they headed toward her division damn chemicals you take the hospital check in on summerset talk the etalk with feeney and ill cut through the rest do you need me to find you a space ill manage dallas celina sprang off a bench ive been waiting they said you were on your way in you havent answered your voice or email been busy getting to it peabody she clamped a hand over eves arm shes holding im really pressed celina i can give you a few minutes in my office you set she asked roarke i am yes ill meet you out here im sorry celina pushed her hands through her luxurious hair im upset we all are roarke told her it was a long difficult night i know i saw lets take it in here she led the way into her office shut the door have a seat though she knew caffeine wasnt the best idea at the moment she wanted coffee ordered two what did you see the attack on peabody god i was in the tub hot bath before bed to relax me for today i saw her walking sidewalk buildings he he just leaped out at her it was like a blur and the next thing i know im floundering around in the tub like a damn trout i tried to contact you i was already in the field and went straight to the hospital i havent gotten to a lot of my messages he knocked her down he was kicking her and she was fighting him he hurt her it was terrible for a minute i thought she was dead but shes not shes holding celina clutched the coffee in both hands shes not like the others i dont understand i do just tell me what you saw i want the details theyre not clear its so damn frustrating she set the mug down with a snap i talked to dr mira but she wont budge on the time element for the next session i wanted to go under immediately i know i know id see more but i saw i heard screaming shouting and he threw peabody down i saw him jump into it was a van im sure it was a van dark but everything seemed dark he was hurt there was pain she got to her weapon oh good good he was afraid i feel its hard to

wont for me sitting on her desk eve tapped her fingers on her knee if i could get a personal item from someone i believe was a victim a previous victim would you get anything from it very possibly

something as soon as i can anytime absolutely anytime ill come in as soon as you want me im sick about peabody dallas just sick about it some time during the endless night mcnab dropped off in the chair beside peabodys bed hed lowered the guard so he could reach her more easily and when fatigue won he rested his head beside her breast with his hand under the sheet and linked with hers he didnt know what woke him the pings of the monitors the shuffle of feet outside the room the light that spilled through the window but he lifted his head winced with the crick in his neck rubbing it out as he studied her face they hadnt yet treated the bruising and it broke his heart to see her face so damaged it twisted his belly to see her so still its morning he cleared the worst of the hoarseness from his voice morning baby ah suns out but it looks like we might get some rain you ah had a lot of people in and out checking on you if you dont wake up youre going to miss all the attention i was going to get you flowers but i didnt want to leave you that long you wake up and ill take care of that want some flowers come on shebody rise and shine he slipped her hand out pressed it to his cheek there were nasty abrasions down the arm where it had skidded over the sidewalk come on come on back we got a lot to do you know moving day he kept her hand there as he turned his head and watched mavis come in she said nothing only walked to him laid a hand on the back of his head howd you get by the dragons said i was her sister it made him close his eyes close enough shes still out bet she knows youre here mavis leaned over touched her lips to his cheek leonardos down getting her some flowers shell like having them when she wakes up we were just talking about that oh christ he turned his head pressed his face into maviss side as he fought to hold on she waited stroking his hair until the tremors passed and he was able to draw a steady breath ill sit with her if you want to take a walk get some air i cant okay he shifted but stayed close so they watched the steady rise and fall of peabodys chest together louise checked on her a few times i think she and charles stayed most of the night i saw him in the waiting area dallas shes going after the bastard shes hunting the animal who did this to her then shell get him after giving him a pat mavis turned away to pull over a chair wait sorry let me get that you shouldnt be hauling stuff at best the folding chair weighed four pounds but she let him move it over for her mcnab there isnt a lot we me and leonardo can do but we can

belly i wont i feel like im going to fall apart any second then the second passes and its the next and i he jerked straight in the chair i think she moved did you see that no but i she moved her fingers he turned over the hand he held in his i felt them move come on peabody wake up i saw it that time with her fingers gripping his shoulders she leaned forward look shes trying to open her eyes do you want me to get somebody wait wait he pushed up leaned over open your eyes peabody you can hear me no sliding back under again come on youre going to be late for your tour she made some sound part gurgle part moan part sigh and hed never heard sweeter music her lids fluttered and her swollen blackened eyes opened there you are the tears flooded his throat he swallowed most of them and grinned at her what happened youre in the hospital youre okay hospital cant remember doesnt matter now you hurt anywhere i everywhere god what happened to me its okay mavis ill get somebody when she dashed out mcnab pressed his lips to peabodys hand its going to be okay now i promise dee baby i was coming home youll get there soon can i have drugs first he laughed as tears rolled out of his eyes eve caught herself leaning over yancys shoulder and eased back its okay used to it let me tell you first if everybody brought me witnesses like yours my job would be a hell of a lot easier maybe a little boring then he glanced back at roarke this is one of your programs so i see its one of the best image programs on the market though were working on some upgrades still its only as efficient as its operator i like to think so can you guys get back to your admiration session later well take a look heres the sketch your wit brought in and heres my revised image after the session see we got a little more detail subtle alterations but they can boost time on an id match less frankenstein roarke commented yeah the behavior of the subject tends to influence the witnesss memory of his physicality they see this big guy pounding on a woman and he takes on giant characteristics monster shit but your wit had the basics and he had them down square face lots of forehead shiny dome knowing about the sealant lets me program that element the shades hamper the id eyes are the best element for a match but from here we start building using the program he initiated took the sketch through the building stages profile adding dimension skull shape eve watched yancy use a stylist to prompt the program section by section on the image ears line of neck revolve to back view other profile full face shape of the mouth nose angle of bone get it to three dimensions add skin tone okay this is the best probability given current data to take it the last step you have to go with a combo of your own judgment and the comps remove shades eve stared at the eyeless face felt a shudder run through her apt roarke stated yeah his eyes could be damaged but for id purposes were going to try the highest probabilities for the shape colors not an option though id lean toward dark with this skin tone and the eyebrows highest percentage going that direction this is what i get eve studied the finished image the hard square face soft mouth thick eyebrows over small dark eyes the nose was large slightly hooked the ears prominent against the bald skull there he is she said quietly if its not damn near close as a photograph you can spank me yancy said ill toss this to your office unit got you plenty of hard copies ill pass some out myself you want me to run the id match shoot it to feeney in edd nobodys faster then she glanced at roarke saw him smile hardly thats a hell of a job yancy one hell of a job your wits were gold he handed her a stack of hard copies tell peabody were pulling for her bet your ass she punched him lightly on the shoulder a sign of affection as much as appreciation and hurried out going to run for a match myself feeneyll probably beat me to it but well get this started and once we shit shit shit she yanked out her beeping communicator seeing mcnabs code on the readout she stopped short instinctively she reached for roarkes hand as she answered dallas shes awake on my way eve all but sprinted down the hospital corridor and when an icu attendant held up a hand she only snarled dont try it she surged through the door and straight into peabodys room and stopped short peabody was propped up in bed a vague smile on her battered face the short counter under the single window had been transformed into a garden with flowers jammed together in such abundance their scent overpowered even the hospital scent mcnab stood beside her holding her hand as if hed been glued there louise was on the other side and perched on a chair was mavis doing some blooming of her own in florid purple and green hey dallas peabodys voice was slightly slurred and absolutely cheerful hello roarke jeez hes just so gorgeous whatre ya gonna do you gotta think about it louise chuckled and who could blame you youll have to excuse her she said to eve they gave her something for the pain something really specially good peabody grinned totally iced drugs hows she doing very well louise gave peabody a light pat shes got more treatments in store tests scans therapy all that fussy medical business and shell need to be monitored carefully for a while yet but theyve bumped her all the way down to stable shell move to a standard room within a few hours if she stays stable i expect her condition will be deemed good by the end of the day you see my face i mean whoa shit messed me up good they had to what was it reconstruct my cheekbone i dont know why they couldnta done both while they were in there and given me some cheekbones you know and he dislocated my jaw so im talking funny but it doesnt hurt a bit i love drugs can i have more can you cut them back a little eve asked aw peabody poked out her bottom lip i need to talk to her get her statement i need her a little more coherent for that ill check see what i can do but youll need to keep it short shes in a lot of pain without them mcnab said when louise stepped out shed want to do this i know he sighed smiled as peabody examined the fingers of her free hand shes really wonked how come we dont have six fingers you think six would be frosty hey mavis hey peabody mavis moved across the room slid an arm around eves waist she says hey mavis about every five minutes she whispered its cute im going to go out sit with leonardo and charles while you do this part anybody you

stayed with me all night sweet boy love the sweet boy heard you talking to me sometimes you can kiss me too everybody can kiss me because ohoh give me some room eve demanded peabody sir you get a look at him yes sir she drew a breath shakily jesus dallas he messed me up came at me like a hellgod i kept feeling stuff breaking and tearing inside me hell of a thing her fingers moved restlessly on the sheet then dug in as she struggled with the pain eve covered it with hers stilled it i got to my weapon though i hit him i know i did arm shoulder maybe but i nailed one in him you see his vehicle i didnt sorry i just forget it he say anything to you called me a whore whore cop you make the voice if you hear it again bet your ass sir i think i heard him it sounds weird but i think he called for

having your drug party but well take him and youre part of it will you tell me when youve got him youll be the first she stepped back nodded to louise you want to get sprung from here you can recoup at our place if you need to appreciate it i whee she laughed as the drugs bumped up thats more like it well be back eve promised mcnab was on her heels as she went out dallas were crapping out on the transit discs since you got your id you wont need me on that anyway anything else you need me to do get some sleep not until she nodded stick with her ill let you know if anything comes up ill be back in a minute she strode away headed straight for the womans bathroom inside she just sat on the floor pressed her hands to her face and cried her chest hurt with it heaved with it as the pressure finally broke free her throat was raw her head thumping as the emotions shed stifled took over poured out in a hot violent flood and sucked her dry she started to spring up when she heard the door open then stayed where she was when she saw mavis she just lifted her hands let them fall shit mavis i know mavis settled down beside her scared everybody i had my jag already you can go ahead finish yours i think i did but because she could she let her head lean on maviss shoulder a moment maybe after shes better trina could give her the full works peabodyd like that she can be a real girl good thinking well have a complete girl party i didnt mean sure whatever you got any sunshades on you do monkeys screw in the jungle she reached into the purple fringe worked into her shirt and drew out a pair of purple shades with green lenses what the hell deciding they were marginally better than going around with red swollen eyes eve put them on uptown no im thinking down eve got up helped mavis to her feet thanks for the loan ive gotta go bust this bastard chapter twentyone roarke said nothing until they were back in the car eve behind the wheel not your usual fashion accessory huh he tapped a finger on the frames oh mavis i ah borrowed them because she blew out a breath you dont need to hide them from me he slipped the glasses off leaning over to lay light kisses on her eyelids aw she said with a half smile whatre ya gonna do she threw her arms around him burrowing in i didnt want to break down and start blubbering all over mcnab i got most of it out so you dont have to worry about me blubbering all over you i never worry you were due for a breakdown and you timed it until you were sure our girl was going to be all right yeah i guess it was so good to hold to be held now were going to take care of business she eased back eyes bad theyre beautiful she rolled them this is not peabody on drugs by the time you get to central good as new okay but she stuck the sunshades back on just in case they werent even out of the parking garage when her communicator beeped dallas got him oh jesus feeney send it through to my vehicles unit i want to see him were on our way to central now can you meet me in my office ill be there take a look quickly she programmed the vehicle for centrals garage and shifted to auto so she could give the image her full attention there you are you son of a bitch blue john joseph age thirtyone damn it since auto didnt allow her to exceed speed limits or outrun reds she switched back hit the sirens i dont want audio she said to roarke i dont need to hear it all just give me the salient single mixedrace male no spouse no legal cohabitation partner no offspring on record no criminal on record hes got something juvenile ill bet your ass and sealed well worry about that later residence listed as classon avenue brooklyn brooklyn she shook her head as she screamed through traffic no thats not right cant be thats whats here resided that address eight years owner operator comptrain inc same address want the details on that yeah but he didnt live in brooklyn not now ah small data analysis company theres your hacking skills lieutenant hed do most of the work right out of his home for this tech support and the like cross with the customer and member lists moment youve got him as a member ten years standing at jims gym downtown and he didnt pop because of the brooklyn addy wedve gotten to him but he wasnt in the first layer hes not coming to the city from brooklyn to stalk and kill i dont buy it and theyve got gyms in brooklyn for christs sake she flew into the garage cut speed seconds before she arrowed into her slot roarke made of sterner stuff than peabody never flinched he was out of the car with her moving doubletime to the elevator a second residence in the city then one he hasnt listed or rents has bought under another name she jumped off the elevator on the first floor and dashed to a glide hotfooting it up elbowing passengers aside on the way ignoring protests she hopped off jumped on another im going to put this op together fast two tactical teams one to brooklyn and the other ive got an idea on that she streamed up the glide at a run pivoted and rushed through her bull pen without acknowledging any of the calls or questions full data up she snapped at feeney up whats with the shades hell she yanked them off tossed them on the desk mother ineza blue age fiftythree address listed on fulton bingo you rat bastard ineza blue roarke said working rapidly on his ppc retired licensed companion one child son you get me the mothers image from say twenty years ago i bet you get me a white woman with long light brown hair she slapped feeney on the back lieutenant roarke held out his palm unit shes a hit on your customer list for total crafts get me details on her purchases last six months look for the cord she snapped back to feeney lets get started she said and turned to her link to contact the commander fifteen minutes later she was in a conference room briefing her tactical teams team one takes the target in brooklyn briscoll goes in as delivery to ascertain if the subject is on the premises target is to be surrounded at all points were also looking for a black van now identified as registered to subjects mother last years model sidewinder if said van is spotted lock it down baxter youre heading this team team two will deploy to the fulton street residence the same procedure applies with ute taking the delivery position i head this team in both locations we go in fast and we go in hard warrants are coming through if the subject isnt located we wait for him i dont want this asshole making a cop he makes any of you i fry you we take him down and we take him today if there are any screwups on this one any screwups in procedure in chain of evidence if somebody fucking sneezes at the wrong time i will personally put their neck in a wringer and hit go questions just one this from baxter the subject is a large individual with considerable muscle it may take some extreme measures to restrain him just want to make sure everyone on my team is prepared to take these measures whatever they may entail eve angled her head i want him conscious for interview other than that she let it hang dont let those measures get out of hand move out feeney round up team two she ordered her team to strap on protective gear though she didnt see it as an issue she wasnt taking chances she didnt want to visit another cop in the hospital you dont figure the mothers in on this feeney said as they waited inside the surveillance van no we got the cord twentyyard length of it delivered to the fulton street address five months ago im saying she had some in stock previous to that and the new supply was ordered by the son she didnt have any deliveries listed before that or after she always picked up her supplies i figure shes dead or incapacitated she shifted to the balls of her feet back again squatted and straightened to be sure the gear didnt hamper movement if he offed her maybe thats what set him off on the rest maybe she just kicked and that set him off but im betting he helped her out she looked over at roarke you and i are going in the front once weve determined hes inside feeney and his man in the back communications remain open at all times i want everyone with a badge and the civilian consultant to know where everyone is goodsized house she commented studying it through the screened window of the van one floor down below street level two above two men take the below and we go in on my signal i want every door every window covered he moves fast and hes not going to fall down and surrender hell run teams in position feeney told her go to ute go she watched ute zip down from the east corner on a compact jetbike he secured it at the curb bounced off and up to the door with his misdirected package he rang the bell bounced his head around as if bopping to the beat of music through headsets and she heard clear as a bell the answer from the securitycorn what delivery man you wanna sign shit starting to rain the first thin drops splat the streets and sidewalks when the door opened hold positions you got the wrong place blue said this is not hell it looks like a three are you the door slammed in his face ute made a business out of turning his back pointing at his ass and making a kissing sound before bouncing back to his bike subject verified no visible weapons eve jerked her head and slipped out the side door of the van with roarke he hefted the small battering ram she crouched behind a parked car as feeney drove off gonna get wet she murmured she rolled her shoulders rocked back and forth on the balls of her feet you know lieutenant i can get through the door nearly as quickly myself as with this ram and with more finesse and considerably less noise not looking for finesse she nodded when feeneys voice came through her earpiece move in go go go still crouched she dashed across the street noting the movements of her team out of the corners of her eyes as she charged up the steps take it down he reared back slammed it twice then let it fall as the door crashed open they were through weapons drawn every light blared on full and she could hear the fast and heavy rush of feet she veered right toward the sound and caught sight of blue streaking up the stairs police stop where you are she was already running up behind him youre surrounded youve got nowhere to go stop or i will fire he swung back his face red with exertion and what she took as panicked temper she knew though she couldnt see his eyes she knew in that instant from the stiffening of his body he recognized her and he lunged she fired a stream midbody that crossed with the stream roarke fired the combination knocked blue back three staggering steps to her amazement he shook it off like a man hyped on zeus lunged again bitch you hurt me she didnt question herself the need the motive but rather than firing on him she got a running start pumped her legs and slashed into a flying kick that landed both feet in his face blood erupted from his nose spilled out of his mouth but he was still on his feet when she dropped back to hers dont fire she shouted at roarke and whoever was pounding up the steps behind them screw this she muttered as he came for her again lets see how you like it and she curled down locking her hands around her weapon brought them up with as much force as she could muster into his balls he screamed a highpitched sound that made her heart sing he dropped to his knees and rolled that seems to have done it subject is secured i need extensions for these restraints she called out as she pressed her weapon to his cheek youre a big boy blue big strong boy but if i fire this weapon from here youre going to lose a chunk of your face while i might consider that an improvement you may not see if these work feeney stepped over blue muscled his arms behind his back and fought extended restraints into place as the man began to cry like a baby barely maybe hurts a little but gee what can you do get him in the tank read him his rights when she started to get to her feet she winced crouched down again give you a hand lieutenant thanks she took the one roarke offered and stretched her left leg mightve pulled a little something on that kick it was a little high for me well placed though i did enjoy the second maneuver first was for peabody second was i know for all of them he knew it embarrassed her but he couldnt help himself he leaned down kissed her you are my hero get out lieutenant one of the team called out from below youre going to need to see this basement level on my way it was a horror shed never forget no matter how many shed already witnessed how many were yet to come the basement had been converted some years before from the look of it into a small warren of rooms his primary living space eve concluded with some recent adjustments his office was tidily and efficiently set up three complete d and c units a wall of discs minifridgie miniautochef and lights so bright they almost burned the eyes hed set up a personal fitness center equipment mirrors a sparring droid nearly as big as he was the lights seared in the third room the walls were also mirrored and the lights burned bright bouncing their reflections everywhere she could see the fitness area from that position it was his bedroom a young boys room with toys on a shelf space invaders paper on one of the walls the bed was narrow and neatly made with a cover that boasted interplanetary warriors in full battle there was a chair childsized fit with restraints wrist and ankle shackles tied on one of its arms was a bright red cloth shed cast him into the basement eve thought and despite the toys the touches of youthful decor had made it his prison hed kept it as one but hed made an addition there was a single long shelf bracketed into the wall new from the looks of it and the metal brackets shone clean and silver on it were fifteen clear jars filled with a pale blue liquid floating in the pale blue were fifteen pairs of eyes fifteen eve said and forced herself to look fifteen eve stood with roarke in observation inside interview a blue was shackled to the table hand and foot hed screamed like a madman mad child when theyd muscled him down snapped them on had only calmed when at his terrified demands theyd boosted the lights in the room to full she imagined if he got riled enough he could lift the whole shebang and do some damage youre not going in alone it wasnt a question roarke asked it was a statement with the subtle edge of warning im not stupid its me feeney and two uniforms built like arena ball tackles you sure you want to watch this i wouldnt miss it for worlds patching it through to peabodys hospital room so she and mcnab can watch theyll put him away in an institution mental defectives its not the cage id choose for him but itll have to do you need him to tell you where the bodies are she nodded hell tell me after one last look she moved out of observation signaling to feeney she unlocked the door stepped inside ahead of him and the two guards record on she recited the data smiled hello john i dont have to talk to you bitch no you dont have to talk to me she sat down hooked an arm around the back of her chair and thats lieutenant bitch to you you dont want to have a chat we can send you back to a cage youre booked john all those murder charges rape murder mutilation got you cold and youre smart enough to know it crazy as a shithouse rat maybe but youre not stupid you shouldnt call him crazy dallas oh yeah right she smirked at feeney probably got a bunch of sob stories to tell traumas and emotional scarring shrinksll eat that up me i dont give that shithouse rats skinny ass youre going down john fact is you are down we got evidence flying out our butts on you you go and leave us the eyes whats with that whats with the eyes john fuck you rape isnt fucking didnt your mother ever tell you that he reared back face

the bodies that go with the eyes fuck you whore bitch sweettalking me isnt going to work come on dallas feeney patted her shoulder ease back a little listen john you want to help yourself here you got trauma i can see that eve made a rude noise we saw the shackles john we saw how it mustve been for you when you were a kid i bet youve been through a lot and maybe you didnt know what you were doing

difference with the pa she says youre going to lock me away for killing a bunch of whores hows telling you where anything is going to help me listen the police officers going to be okay her names peabody eve interrupted detective delia she got one into you didnt she john gave you back some pain she arched her eyebrows when he drew one of his arms toward his chest stings like a bitch doesnt it when the stream hits doesnt bother me his gaze tracked to the mirror and his shoulders relaxed again look at me i can take anything ran didnt you ran like a rabbit shut up you bitch i did what i had to do lets calm down feeney gestured down with his hands keeping the tone and rhythm of good cop in play the important thing for you john is detective peabodys all right that counts a lot maybe we couldnt help you out if shed taken a downturn but shes okay there are things we can do for you john you cooperate you show remorse you give us the information we need to bring some closure to the families of those other victims were going to put in some good words for you i did what i had to do why do you lock a man up for doing what he has to do eve pulled a red cord out of her pocket why did you use this when he only stared she wrapped it around her own throat watched his eyes go glassy you like how it looks on me want to get your hands on the ends john and pull shouldve killed you first yeah you got that right his gaze was locked on the cord and beads of sweat were popping out on his face on the dome of his head wheres your mother john shut up i said about my mother she liked to do crafts we got her account from total crafts but you know what word is nobodys seen her around in months damn near a year now you kill her first john you take some of her ribbon like all that red ribbon we found in the house and wrap it around her neck you rape your own mother john did you rape and strangle your mother and take her eyes she was a whore what did she do to you john deserved what she got breathing shallow he stared at the mirror again nodded slowly deserved it every time what did she do there was nothing wrong with his eyes she could see that and shed checked his medicals and she thought of the bright lights sunshades and bright lights eyes in jars its a little bright in here she said conversationally lights fifty percent turn them back up the sweat was rolling now im not talking to you in the dark youre not saying anything i want to hear lights thirty percent turn them on turn them on i dont like the dark dont leave me in the dark i didnt mean to see his tone had gone high a boys voice in panic and plea it touched something in her but she tamped it down see what tell me john tell me and ill turn the lights up again whore naked in bed letting him touch her touching

your eyes out next time then you wont see what youre not supposed to see chains rattled as he struggled in the chair i dont want to be in the dark im not weak and puny and stupid what happened in the park just playing thats all just playing me and shelley i just let her touch it it hurts it hurts when mommy hits it with a stick burns burns when she scrubs it with the powder pour acid on it next time and see how you like it in the dark cant see cant get out he fell against the table weeping you got strong didnt you john you got strong and paid her back for it she shouldnt have said those things to me she shouldnt laugh at me and call me names im not a freak im not goodfornothing im a man and you showed her you were a man a man who can rape whores when he wants to you shut her up shut

see her again i know what to do tell me where she is now john where the rest of her is its dark too dark in here tell me so i can turn the lights back up buried decent burial but she kept coming back

shell live there one day wheres the farm upstate not a farm anymore just an old house ugly old house locks on the doors shell lock you in there too maybe leave you there for the rats to eat you dont do what she says when she damn well says it granny locked her in plenty and thatll teach you to mind your ps and qs he was jerking on the chains as he spoke rocking back and forth in the chair teeth bared skin shining with sweat but she wont sell it greedy bitch wont sell it and give me my share she wont give me anything not giving her hardearned to some freak time to take it take it all bitch lights on full he blinked against them like a man coming out of a trance i dont have to say anything to you no youve said enough chapter twentytwo she ordered droids and dogs a search unit and the equipment necessary for multiple remains location identification and removal and knew it would be a very long very difficult procedure she requested morris personally and asked that he select a team she expected and was unsurprised when whitney and tibbie arranged to make the trip upstate for the moment for a small window of time they would keep the media at bay but it would leak soon enough she knew and the ugly carnival would begin because she wanted time to prepare to think without the distraction of cop chatter or questions she traveled upstate in one of roarkes jetcopters with him in the pilot seat they flew through a steady dreary rain natures way of weighing in she thought to make a hideous job more so she saw a little burst of lightning bloom on the horizon far to the north and hoped it stayed there roarke didnt ask questions and his silence throughout the flight helped steady her for what was to come this sort of procedure would never be routine never could be routine nearly there roarke glanced at the comp map highlighting their destination then nodded toward the windscreen at two oclock it wasnt much of a house she could see that from the air as they started the descent small illkept poorly maintained if she was any judge it looked to her as if the roof sagged probably leaked and the lawn fronting the steep narrow road was weedy and littered with trash but the back was blocked in with trees and in front of them ranged a high fence the lawn such as it was spread up dipped down following the rise and fall of land there were other houses and the curious would come out of them before long none of those houses were close not to the bumpy land back of the house a man with a mission she thought a man with a job to do could carry it out in relative privacy in such a place uniforms would knock on doors and ask about the blues and a dark van and any odd activities they set down roarke killed the engines you feel some sympathy for him john blue through the rain she stared at the house the dark dirty windows the scabs of paint puckering its skin i feel some sympathy for a defenseless child tortured by a parent by a woman who most certainly was vicious and cruel we know what thats like she turned her head looked at him we know how it can twist and scar what it can drive you to and i feel a twinge maybe more than a twinge at the way i played the child in interview you saw how i went after him i saw you doing what needed to be done even when it hurt you hurt you eve as much as him maybe more needed to be done she agreed and would live with that because a child didnt kill these women a child didnt rape and beat and strangle them mutilate their bodies a child didnt put peabody in the hospital so no when it comes down to the line i dont feel for john blue we had as bad you had worse maybe she breathed deep maybe and like him i killed my tormentor not like him eve nothing like him it was that point that vital point hed wanted to make to her you were a child in desperate terror and pain defending yourself doing whatever you could to make it stop he was a man and had the choice of walking away however she twisted him he was a man when he committed these acts the child lives inside i know thats shrink pap but its true enough weve both got that lost child in us and and we dont allow that lost damaged child to strike the innocent i know you dont have to soothe me i know we use i guess that child to stand for the innocent me with my badge you with places like dochas we couldve gone the other way but we didnt well i had a few detours it made her smile and thank god for him and we havent finished the trip yet roarke she touched a hand to his you dont know how hard this is going to be i have some idea she shook her head and her face was already bleak no you dont ive done this before its worse than you can imagine im not going to ask you to go back or hang around the edges because you wont but im saying if you need a break from it take it walk away for a while others will believe me theres no shame in it she he thought would never walk away just tell me what you need me to do she had the back of the house cordoned off while the dogs and droids were sent in she took a team into the house it was dank and foul inside dark as a cave but when she called for lights the place illuminated like a torch no dark rooms for john blue she thought hed killed them in the bedroom the smaller of the two his room eve assumed whenever theyd made the trip here there were locks on the outside of the door old locks locks shed undoubtedly installed to keep the boy inside lock him in the dark as her mother had locked her so hed killed her there on the stained mattress lying naked on the floor killed others there in her image she saw lengths of red cord remnants of womens clothing and the smears and stains of blood that had dried on the mattress on the floor everything bagged and tagged she ordered i want a full sweep personal items of some of the vics may include their identification when its done i want the portalab and tech in here to get samples of the blood were going to id every victim he brought here lieutenant one of the team stepped up he wore his full protective suit but had yet to attach the mask and filter were locating them how many so far dogs just found number seven and it doesnt look like theyre done on my way feeney hustled over to join her his mrs feeney suit was smeared with cobwebs and muck found a robodig in the basement looks fairly new been used why use a shovel when you can use a machine and one that makes a manly hum neighbors couldve heard that ill dispatch some uniforms start the knock on doors get it started she pulled on her protective suit carried her mask out into the rain found seven she thought no they hadnt finished yet she knew exactly how many more would be found droids scooted along the uneven ground one of the dogs barked and his body went into a shiver of wagging as he snuffed along the ground at his handlers signal he sat waited hed done his job and they put up the marker for number eight eve walked to whitney who stood under a wide black umbrella sir do you want me to begin evacuation eight his face was set like granite as he stared out at the scene this is your procedure lieutenant evac can confuse the dogs it would be my choice to leave that until we believe all remains are located and marked do so theres nine he murmured they worked inside the house outside in the rain dozens of cops moving like ghosts in their gray gear dogs barked droids signaled and flags were marked on the ground call them off she ordered when thirty minutes passed without an alert move in the evac team lets have some lights she called out as she started across the spongy ground two evac teams one far west one far east morris im with you i need ids as soon as possible sooner ive got dental for the missings on the city list and those weve culled from this area it doesnt come up to this number he scanned the ground where the evac units were beginning to dig but ive got equipment in the portable that will match the dentals for what we have others are going to take a little longer grounds rocky under this sponge roarke commented muddy now as well itll take awhile for the robot diggers to get through this muck can you operate one i can yes get this man a machine eve shouted out and turned to roarke start due south morris assign one of your guys to roarke lets get this done she shoved on the mask engaged the filter and strode toward the first marker she stood much as the search dog had and waited got remains the operator announced the robot was shut down it was handwork now a careful excavation with sensors beeping reading out hair flesh bone beneath the thin layer of dirt she saw hands first fingers laced or what was left of them the filter couldnt mask the full impact of what death slowly does to flesh but still she crouched came closer as the shell of a woman was unearthed her hair was long longer than it had been at death eve thought in one of those mysteries hair continued to grow after life winked out it was dark with dirt but it would be light brown youre found now eve thought well give you back your name the one who did this to you is boxed and caged thats all i can do how long she been in there eve asked morris few months maybe six id say ill tell you more when we get her in get her out eve said and straightening moved to the next marker the false twilight the rain brought deepened toward night the air was cold damp and carried the pitiful stench of death tagged bodies lay bagged beside gaping holes in the earth until they could be transported remains lay on tarps shielded by tents while the mes team worked to identify the yard took on the look of a mass grave overhead the media copters circled spun out their lights word was more reporters were camped on neighbors lawns it hadnt taken them long even now she assumed the scene where she stood the misery and horror of it was being relayed to screens all over the state the country the damn world and people sat in their homes and watched grateful to be warm and dry and alive someone brought her coffee and she drank it without tasting it without thought snagging another she walked to roarke this is the third ive done absently he wiped rain from his face he shut down the machine boosted it aside so the hand team could work and you were right its worse than anything i could imagine take a break she handed him the coffee he stepped back and shoved up the mask as she had done it barely helped now in any case beneath it his face was pale damp with sweat and grim as a grave i wont be put in the ground when my time comes he said quietly ashes to ashes dust to dust whatever the hell i wont make that transition in the bloody dirt ill take the fire quick and clean maybe you can bribe god and live forever youve got more money than he does he managed a small smile to please her its worth a try in any case he drank coffee and looked was unable not to look at the horror surrounding him sweet jesus eve i know his personal cemetery i was thinking his private holocaust and she stood with him for a moment in silence listening to the mournful sound of rain pattering on the bags morris has idd a few through dental marjorie kates breen merriweather from the city lena greenspan thirtyyearold mother of two from three miles away sane parker twentyeight adult ed instructor worked at the local school some of them are going to be street people or lcs but well id them all however long it takes well id them all it matters who they were where they came from who loved them you have to make it matter or theyre just rotting flesh and bone after all theyre only what he made them isnt that so yeah she watched as another was bagged and theyre more much more than he made them when it was done as much as could be done then and there eve stripped off her gear tossed it into the pile for sanitizing and disposal she wanted a shower she wanted hours in hot water as hot as she could stand then more hours in oblivion but she wasnt finished not yet she dug in her pocket for another stayup dryswallowing it as she walked to the copter where roarke waited im going to ask you for one thing he began youre entitled to more than one after the night you put in above and beyond roarke we see that differently but i will ask for one thing from you when this is done when youve closed it down i want two days two days away from this from all of it we can stay at home or go anywhere you like but i want that time for both of us to id say to get this out of our system but we never will not really he pulled off the leather strap hed used to tie back his hair to rebalance ourselves ill say its going to take some time yet i need to be around until peabodys on her feet that goes without saying yeah because she understood it did she pointed then walked to the other side of the copter maybe it was silly to need it as a shield but there were still a lot of cops on scene shed given her official statement to the media though a few lingered hoping for more theyd get no more from her tonight and she wanted private moments to stay private she slid her arms around his waist pressed her cheek to his lets just hold on here a minute gratefully it shakes me you can never get yourself ready for something like this no matter what and you know theyll never be enough payment made for it there cant be im sick im sick in every part of myself she turned her head so it rested on his shoulder so yeah ill give you two days and take them somewhere away roarke away where its just us lets go to the island she tightened her grip tried to envision the sugary sand the blue water and erase the vision of the muddy ground and body bags we dont even have to take any clothes with a small sigh he rested his head on top of hers i cant think of anything more perfect i got to finish up tonights work a couple days more maybe after that then well get the hell out he gave her a boost into the copter you sure youre up to the rest of this tonight youre running on chemicals i sleep better when i tie off the ends she strapped in then used the link to check on peabody while the copter rose into the rain celina opened the gate to the elevator in her loft dallas roarke you both look exhausted youre not wrong i know its late im sorry dont worry about that come in and sit she gestured them in let me get you something have you eaten not thinking about food for some time yet but wouldnt say no to a chair and some tea i think she could use it roarke said before eve could speak we both could just give me a minute she hurried away on bare feet with her lounging robe floating around her ankles peabody she asked from the kitchen shes pretty good considering in a regular room well in the hospital palace roarke finagled for her shell need a couple more days in anyway then maybe she can switch to athome care until shes a hundred percent again tm so glad to hear it i dont know if youve talked to mira but we made more progress today and i think i could work with a police artist tomorrow she carried a tray back in hesitated when she saw eves face what we idd him this afternoon we got him my god celina set the tray down with a little thunk and rattle youre sure i cant believe it were sure its one of the reasons we came by guess you havent had the screen on no i havent clearing the mind and all that how when i figured id left you out of the loop but everything moved fast once it started moving thats not even an issue hes locked up its done she breathed out slowly then reached for the teapot i dont even know how to think or feel its such a relief how did you find him witnesses who saw him assault peabody got a decent look at him and his ride we worked from there picked him up he broke in interview in less than an hour you must be not only exhausted but very pleased she passed cups of tea around it came down to straight cop work after all and some luck i guess i didnt contribute much at the end of things not so you did quite a bit you have a gift roarke continued youve utilized it its not something i have a choice over oh i disagree eve sipped tea you certainly chose to use it when you murdered annalisa sommers what celinas cup rattled in her saucer what did you say you mustve been watching john blue visioning him or months did you see him kill his mother celina did it go back that far is that when you started to plan how you could get rid of your competition as she stared her face went stark white this is horrible this is hideous and horrible youre accusing me of murder of killing poor annalisa you have the man responsible how could you say this to me i have the man responsible for murdering fifteen women fifteen celina he had their eyes on display over the past few hours weve been disinterring bodies from the backyard on his mothers place upstate bet you know about that place too we have thirteen bodies thirteen including his mother whose remains have been positively idd thirteen women he practiced on eves face wasnt pale it was hard as stone cold as ice but a faint flush of rage tinged it did you watch him kill them too add elisa maplewood add lily napier and youve got your fifteen celinas hands fluttered up crossed over her breasts i cant believe what im hearing i think you must have pushed yourself over some edge right up to it but not over if id gone over id be breaking your face right now the way blue broke my partners youd accuse me after i came to you after ive tried to help because you have one too many bodies to fit your case for gods sake i want you to leave my house i want you when she started to rise roarke simply reached out shoved her back into place you want to sit quietly celina and his voice was deathly calm weve both had a miserable few hours and may be less courteous than youre accustomed to so id sit still if i were you now youre threatening me im calling my lawyer havent read you your rights yet so you dont get any ill read them to you celina and you can call your lawyer but right now were just having a conversation i dont like the tone of this conversation you know what i dont like i dont like being used i dont like being hosed by some selfish bitch with a sixth sense so she can kill her boyfriends new woman listen to yourself i was at home all night when she was killed i took a tranq i never left the house not at all true roarke commented oh youve got the security discs thatll prove you didnt go out the front use the elevator but interestingly enough youve no tenants down below and havent for the last few months summersets little contribution eve thought you didnt renew their lease its certainly my choice and that made it very simple roarke went on you went out the door there where you shut down the security cams down the stairs into a and out the emergency evac i checked it myself and you didnt think to seal up first weve your prints on the door on the window on the evac mechanism its my property but her hands were moving restlessly now from her lap to her throat to her hair my fingerprints might be anywhere annalisa didnt fit she was close eve considered in the ballpark but she didnt quite fit blues vision hairs too dark too short then theres the kitten he didnt use props with the others but you needed that moment of distraction youre not a twohundredeightypound man you needed to distract her to get her down so she didnt have time to fight tor heavens sakes he raped her in whatever fantasy youve dreamed up for whatever reason you can hardly accuse me of raping another woman couldnt have been pleasant for you what appliance did you use they make all kinds some of them are so realistic you can hardly tell them from the real mccoy please eve patted roarkes knee sorry youll never prove this oh celina i will eve leaned forward so celina could look directly into her eyes you know i will just like you knew id get john blue with or without you you wanted me to just not before annalisa you have the right to remain silent she began this is insane celina said when eve finished the revised miranda why would i come to you to help always better to be in the inner circle closer to data if you can that was clever of you im going to call a lawyer go ahead eve gestured toward the link once you do ill make it my mission in life to take you down harder im tired i want to close this down because im tired im inclined to work with you on this see what we can manage she saw speculation just an instant of it flicker over celinas face blues got no reason to lie celina he knows how many women he killed and what he did to and with every one of them the number is fifteen he wasnt in greenpeace park the night annalisa was killed hes alibied then it was someone else eve suggested yes it was someone who knew the details details not released to the media someone who could use them copy them but that someone wasnt a man because there was no man that night only you he left you lucas left you and ended up with her we left each other and he wasnt seeing her when we were together no he wasnt decent guy honest guy he didnt twotime you but hed met her before you split he confirms that by the way hed met her and hed felt something click i bet you knew he was interested maybe before he really knew it himself i bet you read him every chance you got i told you i dont intrude youre a liar up till now your gifts been more a game to you than anything else entertaining interesting lucrative you told me once you were shallow and thats one absolute truth lucas wasnt in love with you anymore he was pulling away had to save your pride and make it seem amiable and now look at this his new lady meets with a terrible death and there you are arms open to comfort did you weep a few tears when you went over to comfort him this afternoon i had every right to see lucas decency dont tell me about decency the whip of eves voice had celinas head snapping back you knew what john blue was where he was what he was doing long before you came to my office you watched him kill over and over again and you used them used him used me one of the clerks uptown you were smart to go uptown at a craft shop remembers you celina youre a striking woman and she remembers you coming in four months ago four months ago and buying three yards of red corded ribbon her cheeks werent pale now they were going gray that that doesnt prove you think its all circumstantial and maybe but it adds up so nice means motive opportunity she flipped out three fingers you knew the victim you knew the details of the other murders you had the murder weapon in your possession we can trace it back to that uptown shop itll take a little time but we can do it when we do its as good as around your neck she waited a beat to let that factor sink in youre the only one who could have killed her youre boxed stand up to it celina one thing youre not is weak no im not she picked up her tea wrinkled her nose in distaste id rather a brandy i think would you mind she gestured vaguely on the shelf by the kitchen a double roarke obliged her walked across the room you love him very much celina said to eve we could say outrageously you can say whatever you like what would you do how would you survive if he fell out of love with you if you knew youd become an obligation a duty he didnt quite know how to avoid because being a decent man he didnt want to hurt you to hurt you how could you stand it i dont know i let him go she closed her eyes a moment and when she opened them again they were clear steady i tried to let him go to be reasonable and sophisticated but it hurt she pressed a fist to her heart so much unbearably worse when he fell in love with her i knew hed never come back to me there was no chance hed love me again as long as he loved her she looked up at roarke as he brought her the brandy then enslave us even when they dont mean to i sought the first vision i was grieving and i sought it out i dont know what i intended to do but i was so unhappy so angry so lost and i opened myself up and i saw him as clearly as i see you john blue i saw what he did she swirled brandy sipped it wasnt his mother it wasnt the first i didnt know how many before it was breen merriweather i didnt see him take her from the city but i saw him lifting her out of a van it was dark very dark her hands and feet were bound and she was gagged i could see her fear he took her inside and all the lights so many lights came on so i saw everything he did to her in that horrible room and i saw him bury her in the backyard and you started to plan i dont know thats sterling i didnt know what to do what i would do i almost went to the police it was my first instinct i swear it but i didnt and i wondered who he was and how he could do the things he did so you watched him roarke finished to find out yes i was fascinated and repelled but i was able to link to him and i studied him and i wondered why doesnt he kill annalisa everything would be the way it should be again if hed kill annalisa i wondered if i could pay him to do it but that was too risky and hes mad so he mightve hurt me and i realized maybe thered be a way for me to do it then he killed elisa maplewood right here in the city and i knew how it could be done she let her head fall back i didnt just come to you for information she said to eve i needed to know how you would handle the investigation how quickly you would find him what you thought of me and a part of me i swear to you a part of me hoped youd find him quickly before i but you didnt i gave you information hoping in some part of myself that youd find him stop him before so you could put the blame on the investigation on me when you killed her maybe i agreed to the hypnosis before annalisa she reminded eve i volunteered for it i asked mira to start it right away but she was so cautious her fault too it plays in certainly if any one factor had gone differently it all would be different i told myself if the information i gave you led you to him quickly that was what was meant if she if annalisa didnt walk into the park that night id stop the whole thing if she didnt take the shortcut id walk away from her that i was meant to id tell you everything i saw but she did she did so it seemed that was meant and i let myself become him in a way so i didnt have to think about what i was doing i let myself become him so i could stand apart and watch with a kind of horror then it was too late to go back she shuddered drank more brandy she saw me just for an instant and she was so confused but it was too late to go back i couldnt stop myself well she breathed out when did you know when i learned her connection to lucas grande please she waved that away youre a very clever woman but you had no idea at that point i read you in miras office and after the attack on peabody just to cover myself youre not the only one who can block eve angled her head i told you mira has a daughter whos wiccan and a sensitive she gave me a few pointers you played me thats right but not well enough not fast enough or my partner wouldnt be in the hospital i didnt know hed go after her by the time i did it was too late i tried to contact you i like peabody the too guess you didnt have the same sensibilities about the other women he butchered she lifted her shoulders a little let them fall i didnt know them i do i did it for love whatever i did it was for love bullshit you did it for yourself for control for power for selfishness people dont kill for love celina they just like to pretty up the mess theyve made by saying so eve stood on your feet ill make a jury understand it was a kind of madness thats all and that madness took me over my gift makes me all the more susceptible until what he was got inside of me and killed annalisa you go on believing that celina sanchez youre under arrest why dont i give you a rundown of the counts she nodded to roarke who moved to the elevator first degree sexual assault first degree murder mutilation of annalisa sommers a human being accessory to sexual assault murder and mutilation before and after the fact fifteen counts fifteen you cant blame me for what he did she tried to swing around when eve snapped on the restraints oh yeah we can we do and ill bet mine against yours well make a jury understand why eve looked over as mcnab and feeney got off the elevator additional counts accessory before and after the fact attempted murder assault and battery on a police officer take her in detective book her mcnab took celinas arm my pleasure list detective peabody as arresting officer in absentia he opened his mouth then cleared his throat thank you sir go home kid feeney told her as he took celinas other arm weve got it from here eve listened to the elevator start down should get a team in here tonight see what we can dig up add a few bars to her cage then she rubbed her tired eyes screw it well lock it down tomorrows soon enough music to my ears he recalled the elevator that was well done lieutenant giving the collar to peabody she earned it im still buzzed she rolled her shoulders and stepped into the elevator my eyes want to close but my bodys still jumping i believe we can fix that when we get home you can close your eyes he leaned down kissed her long and deep and ill jump your body sounds like a deal she walked outside fixed a police seal to the door rains stopped she commented still a bit misty yet i like it you liked her he added i did she stood in front of the door looking out at the street the wash of puddles as a rapid cab slewed through i did like her still do on some level even knowing what she is he slung an arm around her shoulders she hooked hers around his waist do you think she loves him lucas no she knew what love was now but she thinks she does eve dropped into the passenger seat this time yawned comfortably when roarke took the wheel she leaned back closed her eyes trusting hed get her home yes she knew what love was
