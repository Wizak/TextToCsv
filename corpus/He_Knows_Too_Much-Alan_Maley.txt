 chapter one madras he knows too much i must ask you to do nothing but this time i caught him in the act i have proof witnesses everything there is no possible doubt surely i said he knows too much the company cant afford to have any problems our position is very sensitive in this country we cant afford to take risks i am telling you once again you will do nothing and if there is any trouble im afraid i shall have to hold you personally responsible so be sensible for once in your life i see so you are telling me to close my eyes to corruption and behave as if nothing has happened is that right i didnt put it quite like that but if you insist yes what vish does or doesnt do is a minor matter compared with the companys global strategy just try to get things in perspective after all you wont be stuck in madras for ever ill make sure that youre not so just go with the flow for a bit longer when youre in your next post this will all seem a very long way away i can assure you but meantime no trouble i hope ive made myself clear oh and by the way i advise you to forget that we have had this conversation goodbye dick sterling put the phone down his hands were trembling he was furious with himself for failing to persuade his boss in delhi keith lennox to support him and was disgusted at the mixture of veiled threats and vague promises lennox had made he knows too much the words still rang in his ears he wondered not for the last time just what it was that vish the office manager of the factory knew how could it be so important that the companys position in india could be threatened by it it simply didnt make sense dick glanced at his watch four oclock he called for his driver gopal and asked to be driven home hed had enough for the day on his way out he passed vish in the corridor vish was a small fat man who waddled slightly when he walked his ugly smile revealed two large teeth and his small eyes reminded dick of a snake was it his imagination or was the man smiling to himself his snake eyes glinted with self satisfaction almost as if he knew he was safe protected dicks car left the trakton office and made its way slowly along the dusty bumpy road leading south into the centre of madras towards his home even though dick passed these buildings every day they never lost their fascination for him no one style dominated this city of contrasts where majestic but neglected colonial buildings stood next to modern glass and concrete banks slum huts built from mud and roofed with coconut palms ramshackle groups of shops selling everything from used car tyres to indianmade foreign liquor and where the traffic was a chaos of vehicles competing anarchically for the few overcrowded spaces on the roads the journey home would take a long time dick sat gloomily in the back of the car going over in his mind the events which had led up to the present crisis how had he got himself into this impossible situation it should never have happened yet somehow looking back it seemed inevitable perhaps he was beginning to believe in fate he had arrived three years earlier to take over as general manager of traktons factory in madras trakton had been in india since before independence it had started out manufacturing military vehicles during the war and switched to commercial vehicles and earthmoving equipment when the war ended because of its key importance in helping to build the countrys industrial base it had not been completely taken over following independence though the indian operation was technically independent traktons corporate headquarters in london still had overall control india was of course only one of the many countries in which trakton operated dick had been transferred to madras from nigeria in fact after a series of other overseas appointments each of the overseas factories had a general manager appointed from headquarters to oversee the management of the local workforce in india this had worked particularly well the indian staff was highlytrained and efficient they were also generally easy to work with the companys enlightened industrial relations policy had made sure of that salaries were higher than the average there was a good pensions scheme and generous health insurance benefits trakton boasted that it had not lost a day in strikes for over fifteen years dick had found his senior indian colleagues particularly good to work with they knew their jobs inside out and were clearly committed to the company many of them had been with trakton for the whole of their working lives starting in the factory and working their way up to become managers they were a good team the only exceptions had been visvanathan or vish as he was known the office manager and his wife molly molly was in charge of the personnel department for reasons dick had only gradually understood vish and molly were regarded by the rest of the senior staff as somehow special they behaved as if they had special privileges and expected other staff to defer to them dick slowly realised that they controlled other staff members through a combination of threats and promises given their positions they could make life very difficult for anyone who opposed them likewise they could make life easy for those who did what they wanted dick knew that this sort of behaviour happened to varying degrees in every culture and didnt think much of it indeed in the first few weeks after his arrival both vish and molly had been all smiles and helpfulness youll need a driving licence dont worry i know someone in the police well fix it for you theres no need for you to worry about any of these things just let me know and ill take care of it vish had said they had invited dick and his wife sally to dinner too their newlybuilt house was in the fashionable upandcoming kalakshetra colony close to the sea dick had been suitably impressed by the expensivelyfurnished house which was full of the most modern household equipment he had halfwondered innocently whether vish had had to borrow money to pay for it all molly was justifiably proud of her collection of indian temple carvings southern indian bronze statues and contemporary paintings they had invited a selection of their closest friends a high court judge a police inspector an ias officer an architect an exminister of finance in the state government the owner of a shipping company a couple from the british high commission a tamil film director and a wellknown local painter dick felt slightly uneasily that these people had been invited to prove to him how wellconnected the visvanathans were it had been a pleasant evening nonetheless it was only later that dick recalled seeing two members of the office staff helping to serve the meal he also noted that there had been no shortage of genuine scotch whisky a drink not easily available on the local market it was not long however before dick began experiencing another side to the visvanathans one morning he had gone into vishs office unexpectedly for an informal chat he found his office manager stamping his feet with rage screaming abuse at one of the junior drivers papers and files had been thrown on the floor dick asked vish to follow him to his office there he had suggested that perhaps less dramatic personnel management techniques should be used in future vish had not liked the criticism his small snakelike eyes had almost disappeared in the fat folds of his face he had continued to clench and unclench his hands throughout the brief interview sweat ran in streams down his neck he had left the office soon after the interview and remained away on sick leave for two more days soon afterwards molly went to see dick about the promotion of a senior driver to a supervisors position in the stores she recommended the mans attitude and suitability for the job dick had therefore promoted the man it was only several weeks later that dick discovered that another equally wellqualified staff member had also applied for the promotion unfortunately his papers had been mislaid by the personnel department and had never reached dick when dick had questioned her about it molly had raised her eyes to the ceiling and sighed now you can see what i have to put up with dick she cooed theyre all so unreliable the papers were under a pile of files on shivkumars desk ive told him so many times i really think we should consider transferring him what do you think i think you should deal with all applications in person from now on dick had gently suggested i suppose youre right but my workload is already so heavy and isnt it a good thing for us to train the juniors to take more responsibility she gazed at him quite shamelessly with her liquid black eyes she had more charm than her husband and dick could see that some people would think she was attractive he realised looking at her that there was nothing much he could do unless he wanted a major row chapter two family life dick was woken from his thoughts as the car screeched to a stop to avoid an autorickshaw and a scooter carrying a family of four which had cut across the crowded road outside the high court buildings dicks mind came back to the present for anyone with strong nerves travelling in india is a constant source of interest and surprise his driver gopal inched his way forward successfully winning a few feet from a bus cutting in on one side and a watertanker on the other each puffing out clouds of billowing black diesel fumes the road widened as they passed fort st george gopal speeded up and they were soon leaving the elegant but neglected university buildings behind they drove the length of the marina the sea on the left and a succession of historic buildings on the right even at this hour a few people were strolling along the beach taking the early evening air soon there would be crowds all escaping the oven heat of the city for the cooling evening sea breeze it was fivethirty before they reached the treelined shade of boat club road and the calm of dicks company house set well back from the road in its own garden the chowkidar opened the gate and the car slid gratefully into the cool shade of the porch there was a note on the kitchen table from dicks wife sally to say she was out to tea with one of the awful society women who seemed to form a permanent part of their social life she reminded him that they were to attend a drinks party at the jussawallahs a parsee couple they had met at the club the previous week he groaned then made his way to the bathroom for a shower later as he sat drinking a cool beer on the terrace overlooking the garden dicks thoughts returned to his present problems he was fortyeight years old no longer young but still young enough to rise in the company he was in good shape physically six feet tall slim and muscular even if his hair was prematurely grey he had worked for trakton since leaving university they had sent him to some pretty hard countries when he was young papua new guinea ecuador iran saudi arabia he had always managed to do well even in the most difficult conditions and he had paid the price his first wife sarah had died of malaria in papua new guinea at twentyfour he had found himself a widower and father of a baby daughter angie she was grown up now but he still recalled the desperation of those weeks and months following sarahs death for a time he had gone to pieces drinking heavily and moving from one unsuitable woman to another it was only when he returned briefly to london between jobs that he met sally they had both been invited to a drinks party at the ecuadorian embassy he was to leave for quito a month later she was working as a secretary at the foreign office on the surface they had nothing in common she was from an upperclass family with a town house in knightsbridge and a place in the country near bath she had no need to work but her father an exambassador himself had arranged for her to work at the foreign office partly at least in the hope that she would find someone suitable to marry instead she fell hopelessly in love with dick a man without money with a dubious reputation and with a baby daughter to bring up into the bargain it would have been difficult to find anyone less suitable but when they woke together the next morning in dicks bayswater flat it seemed the most natural thing in the world sallys family had disapproved of their relationship but she left for quito with dick after a brief and quiet civil marriage in kensington registry office noone from sallys family had attended their life together had been a great success though not without its ups and downs sally had been a wonderful mother to angie and they had had simon a year after their marriage they still enjoyed each others company even if they were very much absorbed in their own concerns dick with trakton sally with raising funds for a childrens charity she was involved with there were many days when they scarcely saw each other dick thought about vish again he had long suspected that the man was dishonest but he had never been able to prove it before dicks suspicions centred on the way the company awarded contracts for various kinds of building and maintenance work it seemed to dick that the costs for this kind of work were higher than they should be contracts also seemed to be always awarded to the same few companies many of them owned by personal friends of vish he suspected that vish was taking a percentage from the contractors in exchange for giving them the contract but for a long time dick had never been able to prove this when questioned vish had always had very clever reasons for selecting one contractor rather than another cheaper one it was only when the building contractor haridas enterprises came directly to dick to complain they had not been awarded a contract for building traktons new factory at hosur that dick had found real evidence haridas enterprises had complained that the twenty per cent they had formerly paid to vish had been increased to twentyfive per cent when they had refused to pay vish had given the contract to another company naveen construction who had obviously agreed to pay him the higher rate haridas had provided dick with all the evidence he needed about previous contracts dick understood that in different cultures people did different favours for each other sometimes it was called corruption sometimes it wasnt dick wanted to be careful in judging vish it was the contract for the factory in hosur which was really big money that convinced dick that vish was really corrupt it was for a project which was worth many crores of rupees and would last at least three years if vish was getting twentyfive per cent of the total cost he was going to make a lot of money out of this at last dick had something really big to charge vish with and hard evidence too so earlier that day he had called vish and presented him with the evidence it had been a stormy meeting vish had clearly never been challenged in this way before he had sweated he had shouted he had protested his innocence he had threatened it was after this meeting that dick had phoned his boss the director of trakton keith lennox his thoughts were interrupted by sallys arrival hello darling she said as she bent to kiss him on the cheek how was your day terrible i dont want to talk about it now i confronted vish this morning and then had a row on the phone with keith lennox about it i just cant understand keiths attitude dont you think youre getting a bit obsessed with the visvanathans darling said sally after all you are the boss surely if you have proof of whatever it is all you have to do is sack them if only life was that simple sighed dick with an air of tiredness who are we going to this evening come on dont pretend youve forgotten them theyre that nice couple we met at the club last week sally seemed genuinely upset that he hadnt remembered he owns a shipping company you should be interested in that at least anyway do try to stay awake this time dick went up to the bedroom half an hour later to find sally coming out of the shower he dried her with one of their biggest bath towels they kissed and one thing led to another so that they arrived an hour late for the party though noone seemed to notice the rest of the evening was spent in dull and empty conversations they returned at midnight and dick immediately fell into a dreamless sleep chapter three threatening shadows delhi january in the following weeks dick began to receive anonymous poisonpen letters these were usually written using letters cut from the newspaper and stuck crudely onto a sheet of paper they accused him of a variety of things mainly of a sexual nature there were about a dozen such letters at first dick was amused then angry then worried of course he was innocent of the accusations but even a rumour could be damaging both to him and to the company he had asked indian friends for advice they told him to ignore the letters the city was full of jealous madmen many of his friends too had received such letters in the past they would stop sooner or later they did indeed stop a month or so later but he continued to feel uneasy there was someone out there who had a grudge against him who wanted to harm him more worrying was the death threat he received someone telephoned the factory to say that he would be dead within a week the call was anonymous it had been repeated three times dick then received an anonymous letter containing the same message for some time he could not think straight it felt like a bad dream a british consular official in bombay had been shot in his car a few weeks earlier but dick wondered why any terrorist organisation would want to kill him when he reported the death threat to the police they did not take it very seriously they gave him a retired police officer as a bodyguard for a time and advised him to be careful in fact noone tried to kill him things gradually returned to normal but it was an unnerving experience in the meantime dick kept vish under tight control first of all he made sure that vish was kept out of any business connected with the hosur factory construction project dick himself took direct charge of the project and checked every detail of the contracts he cancelled the contract with naveen construction and renegotiated a new contract with a company vish had no connections with and now that he knew for certain that vish was dishonest dick systematically checked on vishs other activities perhaps lennox might change his mind if there was sufficient evidence against vish once they realised that dick was determined to investigate vish some of the other senior staff quietly gave him information and hints about where to look dick soon discovered that vish routinely used company drivers and company cars and factory workers to carry out work on his own house to run errands and to act as waiters at the many parties he gave he remembered recognising staff at that first dinner party at the visvanathans house in kalakshetra dick held another stormy disciplinary meeting with vish at which he gave him a formal letter warning him not to exploit staff outside working hours dick then looked into the procedures for disposing of office equipment such as airconditioners typewriters and office furniture as he had suspected he found that vish was selling these at belowmarket prices to his friends who then paid the difference directly back to vish dick put a stop to this he investigated the system of awarding maintenance contracts for the buildings and machinery again vish was arranging for these contracts to go to his friends and business associates with a percentage payment to himself under the table it seemed that everywhere dick looked there was something shady going on that every stone he turned over had a snake under it every january the managers of trakton s indian factories were called to delhi for an annual conference and their performance for the year was reviewed as he did every year dick flew up from madras to delhi the day before the conference began he arrived in the early evening there was a wintry haze over delhi partly caused by traffic pollution and partly by the many fires on street corners men wrapped in blankets and shawls huddled around these fires as his car passed on one intersection near claridges hotel a group of bedraggled reduniformed bandsmen waited to be hired for a wedding a sadlooking white horse snuffled the dust in search of grass to eat while its owners prayed for a bridegroom to ride it he was staying as usual at the imperial hotel on janpath splendidly unchanged by modern fashions he was welcomed there in style a turbaned porter took hold of his bags and whisked him off to a comfortably oldfashioned spacious airy room on the ground floor dick would never understand the attraction of modern fivestar hotels when such genuine comfort was available a few moments later the porter returned with a letter dick sat down and read it quickly at first and then more slowly trying to take it in the letter was from lennox dear dick were all so looking forward to seeing you here in delhi again plenty of issues to discuss as youll see from the enclosed agenda i think wed better organise our annual appraisal interview slightly differently this year there are some difficult issues to be dealt with especially on the personnel management side in view of your long association with the company i dont want to rush to any conclusions but clearly i have to keep the companys best interests in mind to keep things confidential i think its better to do this outside the office i suggest therefore that we meet for a business breakfast at my place the morning after the conference is over it will give us a better chance to discuss your future youll be away in time to take the early afternoon flight to madras so no problem there barbara and i look forward to seeing you for drinks this evening along with the others yours as ever keith at seven a company car collected him and took him off to keiths house just off aurangzeb road opposite claridges hotel most of his colleagues had already arrived he felt strangely uneasy the letter with its combination of forced friendliness and concealed threat keep things confidential i have to keep the companys best interests in mind had unnerved him he felt insecure even among these people he had known and worked with for years cameron laidlaw from the calcutta office joked with him about their entry into middle age was this a veiled suggestion that he was getting too old for his job jim prentice from bombay talked enthusiastically about the latest management systems was this a hint that dick was somehow falling behind the latest trends frank prendergast from kanpur talked darkly about major restructuring did this mean some senior jobs would soon be lost and keith himself constantly referred to the generation gap and the need to update was this an indirect criticism of the more experienced staff by the time they sat down to dinner dick had drunk more than was wise by the end of the dinner he felt the floating sensation which he knew was a danger signal he excused himself and left staggering slightly as he made his way to the car the twoday conference went well all the factories had had an exceptionally good year and profits were soaring but throughout the conference there were ambiguous remarks about the future and conspiratorial looks between those sitting round the table dick wondered what was going on below the calm surface of the meeting or was it just his imagination the morning after the conference dick went for a walk in the garden around humayuns tomb even at seven in the morning there was plenty of activity overweight women in track suits jogging heavily in the frosty dawn light hoping to cancel out the overeating of the coming day with a little gentle physical exercise respectable gentlemen in woollen scarves walking their dogs students training in the chill of the dawn and all of this in the looming shadow of the great crumbling domes of the mughal emperors mausoleum mysterious in the misty air by half past eight dick was in the dining room at south end road keiths wife barbara had welcomed him looking fresh and bright as usual she was a comfortable woman completely devoted to making her husband happy she spent most of her time and energy on her home and on cooking for which she was justly famous everyone enjoyed barbaras homemade cakes her pies her souffles her barbecued fish she was not a very stimulating person to talk to unless the subject was cooking gardening interior decoration or babies but everyone liked her for her simple kindness and for her tact in spite of her position as the bosss wife she never made anyone feel small or unimportant after a few minutes of polite conversation with barbara keith appeared barbara then tactfully left them alone together and went upstairs tea or coffee asked keith politely the perfect host dick wondered uneasily if this was the condemned mans breakfast coffee thanks but can we get on with the interview keith im a bit confused by your decision to hold it here no hurry dick lets just enjoy our breakfast first shall we and he took a large mouthful of bacon and freshly fried egg as he spoke dick had no appetite for the food but he managed to chew his way silently through it when they had finished they moved with a last cup of coffee into keiths study it was a room designed to impress visitors with framed photographs of keith with the president of the republic keith with the queen keith with the minister of trade and industry the bookshelves were lined with the latest books on management and a stateoftheart personal computer stood on his desk right dick let me come to the point as quickly as possible the company is doing well but to keep ahead of the competition we have to bring in new people and make sure that we are absolutely top quality on the management side of course dick replied but surely last years results show that weve have been doing just that well up to a point youre right of course said keith with a slightly embarrassed smile but we mustnt forget the personnel management side what do you mean by that asked dick warily well the thing is ive been getting rather a lot ot complaints about the way things are going in the madras factory experienced local staff underappreciated that sort of thing problems with the new factory project in hosur friction with the senior management you know people feeling they are undervalued no i dont know said dick feeling his anger rising in fact its simply not true well opinions obviously differ on that as far as i can tell ive also had to warn you about not doing anything to endanger the companys position in india if you remember keith continued dick had to forcibly stop himself from making an angry response what ive called you here to consider dick is the possibility of you taking early retirement as you know the company makes very generous retirement arrangements for senior staff my own feeling is that you need a change to be absolutely frank you havent taken advantage of all the management training schemes weve offered you either youve done pretty well everywhere youve been for the company but times are changing dick you cant go on in the old style for ever you cant simply rely on your past achievements we have to look to the future i really do think you should give this offer your serious consideration he paused for effect it might not come again dick felt the scarcelyconcealed threat in those words ill certainly consider it dick said grimly but i cant guarantee ill accept ill need to talk to sally anyway but i just dont understand why you should be pushing me to take retirement when the madras results are the best of all our factories in india well as your manager you must understand that i have to look at the wider picture i cant really say more dick i hope you understand what im telling you it was ten before dick left feeling betrayed and shaken by the interview they had wrestled verbally over everything but keith had refused to change his position dick felt that keith had not told him honestly what the problem was but the sinister reference to keiths earlier warning about vish was worrying he continued to go over the interview in his mind for the rest of the day and for long after it despite keiths assurances dicks flight to madras was delayed by the notorious winter fog in delhi it was past midnight when he eventually arrived in madras during the drive from the airport back to his home he dozed in an unpleasant halfsleep barely noticing the stray cattle and water buffaloes wandering across the path of the car when he arrived home sally had already gone to bed he went to his study and poured himself a large glass of whisky there were letters for him on his desk he tore open a large envelope with the company logo on it marked personal in confidence it contained details of the early retirement scheme but this was clearly not an offer it was an order he had no choice obviously all the decisions had already been taken before his interview with lennox the envelope also contained the copy of a letter to jim mann appointing jim to the madras factory to take over dicks job in one months time he poured himself another glass of whisky he felt angry at the injustice at the hypocrisy of keith who had not had the courage to tell him the whole truth and then depressed as he thought about his own loss of selfrespect his stupidity at having trusted old friends he felt betrayed he had worked for trakton for twentyfive years had sacrificed his first wife to it and a gaping emptiness now faced him his whole life had been built around a company that had just decided to throw him out for no good reason there now seemed very little to live for it was five before he eventually dragged himself to bed the empty bottle stood on the desk the only witness to his agony chapter four breakup and breakdown november with nothing to keep them in india any longer dick and sally returned to england and moved back into their house in cambridge it was a big comfortable house on the edge of the city which they had bought many years earlier and only used occasionally for holidays the rest of the time it had been rented to visiting professors from abroad it was the nearest thing they had to a home but still it felt unfamiliar somehow temporary for a time dick made an effort to readjust to life in cambridge they joined a film club visited the theatre regularly gave one or two small parties in an attempt to reestablish contact with old friends dick even had dinner in his old college once but found the social atmosphere so chilly the conversation so boring and the food so indigestible that he decided not to repeat the experience he even offered his services as a lecturer at evening classes in business administration but there were no vacancies dick quickly realised that he no longer felt at home in britain it was also clear to him that he had no real friends left in england and that his sense of purpose had been destroyed when he lost his job he tried not to feel bitter but it was difficult gradually he sank into an aimless existence sleeping late reading the newspapers till midday then going down to the local pub for a few pints of beer and a sandwich for sally it was different she fitted back into britain as if she had never left it she slipped effortlessly into a social life he had never shared anyway she found parttime work in a local charity organisation she had a role he realised that she belonged here whereas he did not not any more they shared less and less he broke off relations with his daughter angie over an argument about how she should bring up her children angie and her husband believed in giving their children total freedom this was not the way dick had been brought up neither was it the way he had raised angie herself during a visit to their house they argued and dick stormed out of the house he never visited them again he also argued with his son simon about his wife melanie dick could not stand melanie and insulted her in front of simon neither simon nor sally ever forgave him he had isolated himself from his wife and his children now he felt isolated even from himself sally spent more and more time out of the house dick spent more and more time in it he began to drink heavily sally would return at five in the evening to find him drunk she began to come back later hoping to find him in bed he usually was snoring noisily they spoke little to each other and when they did it was only to talk about everyday practical matters who would get petrol for the car what they would buy at the supermarket when the bills had to be paid when the tax returns were due it was only occasionally that dick felt able to speak about his inner feelings of hopelessness and despair i know you think im exaggerating he began one sunday morning over breakfast i know were well off my pension is more than enough to live on we dont have to worry about money we have a nice house cambridge is a dream city i know all that but cant you understand that i have lost my sense of purpose all i can say is that youd better find another one then sally replied not very sympathetically its easy enough for you to say that but i cant focus my mind any more i feel as if i cant do anything useful any more noone needs me any more youve got your life the kids have theirs and anyway ive spoiled things there too the company was my life i dont seem to be able to find anything else worthwhile to do well one thing you could certainly do is drink less to be honest i think youre pathetic youre just wallowing in selfpity just think of all the other managers and executives whove lost their jobs and been thrown out on the street with mortgages to pay and their kids to bring up and with no compensation at all for christs sake dick stop feeling so sorry for yourself pull yourself together and find something to occupy your mind this conversation was repeated with variations at intervals over the next few months in july they went on holiday to spain but it was ruined by dicks drunken behaviour and sallys frozen silences it was a depressing experience for both of them the night after their return their simmering rage against each other broke through the surface dick was opening a bottle of wine when it slipped from his hands and smashed on the kitchen floor their tension splintered along with the bottle you bloody drunk screamed sally cant you even open a bottle now i dont think i can stand this any more you fall into bed stinking of drink you cant behave politely with anyone your children cant stand you and you lie around feeling sorry for yourself from morning till night what are you for gods sake you make me sick sick sick sick im going to bed you can do what you like you pathetic bastard but dont wake me up with your moaning dick smashed his glass against the wall took the car keys and drove into town after a few desperate drinks and dinner in the riverside restaurant he began to feel that things were not so bad after all sally had exploded before it was true that he was drinking a bit too much he decided to cut down on drinking perhaps he should join a health club things could be put right between them sally was a good woman she would understand him better if he made an effort she would appreciate that the alcohol made him feel optimistic he left the restaurant and stumbled unsteadily along the towpath next to the river he recalled the days when he had walked here as an undergraduate who could have predicted what his life would become he stood swaying for a moment on the river bank a plane was passing over high in the sky overhead he raised his head to look at it lost his balance slipped and tumbled into the river a group of japanese tourists pulled him out of the water in fact he had fallen in at a place where the water was only half a metre deep but very muddy he could not find his car keys no taxi would agree to drive him home so he had had to stagger the mile or so back home on foot his wet muddy clothes sticking uncomfortably to his skin on arrival he discovered that he had lost his house key too sally opened the door to find a stinking muddy husband on the doorstep she said nothing until the following morning im sorry dick but we cant go on like this she said at breakfast ive tried to be patient with you i do understand that youve been injured by whats happened but i just cant stand it any longer i dont recognise you any more youre not the man i married youve become a total stranger the only thing is for us to separate at least for a time either you leave or i do you decide please sleep in the guest bedroom tonight i shall be out all day today well speak again tomorrow morning but by the time dick got out of bed the next morning it was eleven oclock sally had gone out he packed his clothes some personal papers and his laptop computer into two cases he called his sister maureen in reading to ask if he could stay for a day or two he wrote a short note to sally then he called a cab and left the house in long road he knew he would never return to it chapter five down at hove the grey waves sucked at the stony beach the horizon was a misty blur dick walked along the seafront into a stiff cold wind spray from the sea mixed with icy rain lashed his face it was only three in the afternoon but the sky was already dark soon it would be evening then night another endless night to be spent alone he made his way unsteadily back to his small flat in george square the square was impressive the grand regencystyle houses took up three sides of it the fourth was open to the sea a public garden occupied the centre his flat was on the third floor it comprised a living room a bedroom a study a small kitchen which smelt of old cooking oil and a tiny bathroom with noisy plumbing it was cramped and depressing but it was anonymous and it was cheap dick had rented it from a friend of his sister maureen soon after leaving sally three months previously as autumn turned slowly to winter in hove dicks despair grew deeper the days were a succession of selfhatred drinking and nightmare sleep each morning he woke at four then struggled to find sleep again by the time dawn came he had fallen into a deep slumber and only woke again at eleven he got into the habit of taking lunch in a cheap spanish restaurant on the high street they served an oily paella with a red house wine which tasted like antifreeze fluid the main attraction was the waitresses who were young and attractive and obviously available for other services if required he had only once invited one of them back to his sad flat he decided not to repeat the experiment sex without commitment was not his style after lunch he would take his walk along the seafront gloomy in its winter mood the sea was always grey or brown almost always rough and threatening the sad hotels and boarding houses sulked in the winter light hove was a forlorn mixture of the genteel and the shabby of retired civil servants and unemployed teenagers in the afternoons he tried to write at first he had thought about writing his memoirs he quickly realised that noone would be interested in reading them he then began writing poetry it was intensely personal it was confused it was certainly not likely to be published but in some ways it kept him from going mad in the evenings he would drink steadily until he fell into a deep sleep more than once he woke in the middle of the night to find himself still slumped in his armchair the days were a blur lacking any focus any purpose anything to look forward to he rarely received anything through the post except advertisements and bills but one morning he was surprised to find a letter with an indian stamp on it sally had sent it on from cambridge he recognised the neat handwriting as ramus ramu short for ramanathan had been his personal assistant in madras a sort of secretary advisor and confidant rolled into one he had also become a good friend dear dick i hope all is well with you and with family members also i have been ivoriying a little because we have not been hearing from you for some time now suresh and others have been asking of you also please send us your news soon to relieve our worries i am fine but i have been transferred by mr mann to registry it seems he prefers someone recommended by vish as an assistant i wonder why otherwise things are running much the same way the factory is doing well but the hosur factory project has been suspended something to do with changing contractors but management does not tell us what there is a rumour that vish is renegotiating the contract with some other company that will be interesting will it not people also say that mr lennox will soon be returning to london on promotion you remember nagarajan in the accounts department you helped him out when his wife died well he has also taken early retirement and gone back to his hometown near bangalore he is a broken man all along i have suspected something but now i am sure the reason you and nagarajan were sent on early retirement is definitely some sort of plot of vish and molly they somehow persuaded lennox to get rid of you how do i know this i will tell you number before you went to delhi that last time molly had also gone she said that she was on sick leave but i have found on the file the receipt for the air ticket in central filing we can discover many things i checked with pal in the delhi office and he remembers seeing her in lennoxs office at about that time number i have also overheard some interesting conversations one day i heard vish threatening nambiar in accounts you do what i told you or ill arrange for you to take early retirement too on another occasion i overheard molly telling one of her friends that mr mann was not like you he knew how to behave himself he had learnt his lesson from what had happened to you she said number i have also obtained a personal note from lennox to vish dont ask me how i came by it in central filing you can sometimes find things which ought to have been destroyed anyway it is obviously about you it agrees with vish that something has to be done urgently because you were getting too curious especially about the hosur factory project i will show it to you one day if you wish what does all this mean it means that they were all in it together it means that they all wanted you out of the way maybe you can understand why but it is not yet clear to me anyway i thought you should know about it in case you can make some sense of it i hope i have done the correct thing by informing you of same i will write another letter when i hear from you all your friends here join me in sending very sincere greetings to sally and to your good self yours ramu the letter was dated october so it had taken some time to arrive dick made himself a cup of coffee and took it to the big window overlooking the square it was raining and a lone traffic warden sticking fines on parked cars was the only sign of human life dick read the letter again then reread it he sat reflecting on its contents thinking back to the time of his retirement he forgot to go out for lunch and it was three in the afternoon before he got up from his desk he grabbed his coat and went out for a long walk along the seafront he felt he was thinking more clearly than he had fo months the letter had confirmed all of his suspicions and as he walked his thoughts were a mixture of happiness and anger he was happy that he still had some friends back in india and angry that he was right about the connection between the visvanathans and lennox his thoughts then turned to revenge and by the time he returned to the flat his mind was made up he would find out what lay behind the relationship between lennox and the visvanathans and make it public chapter six return to madras by the beginning of december dick had made arrangements to return to madras he would be leaving on december ramu had reserved a room for him at the madras club since receiving ramus letter dick had become more like his old self he was taking regular exercise and had almost stopped drinking he felt a new sense of energy he had a purpose again and now he was returning to a place he loved and where he felt at home he had also reached some decisions about his life on the evening before he left he called sally to tell her that he had seen a lawyer about their divorce the conversation was civilised and polite but distant both of them knew that their relationship was over for ever but neither could quite believe it he explained the financial arrangements he had made and told her he would be away in india for a month or two she did not ask him why he was going as he put the telephone down he felt that a chapter of his life had ended quickly followed by excitement at the prospect of a new start it was early morning as the plane circled over st thomas mount and landed with a nasty bump on the runway at madras two hours later dick finally cleared immigration collected his case from the squeaking baggage conveyorbelt and made his way through customs unchallenged by the fiercelooking uniformed officers outside the sun was up and as he passed from the airconditioned cool of the baggage hall into the sunlight he was met by a wave of steamy heat pungent with the first smell of india a mixture of spices and diesel fumes ramu had arranged a car to meet him fighting his way through the crowd of beggars and boys trying to grab his suitcase from him dick climbed into the back of the battered old ambassador the driver was a thin little man with skin the colour of coal dust who said nothing but who wove his way skilfully in and out of the chaos of the morning rushhour to the calm of the madras club dick was pleased to find a note from paul fernando the angloindian manager of the club inviting him for an evening predinner drink courtesy was not yet dead at least not in southern india his room in the guest wing was spacious with a high ceiling a large ceiling fan which swooped through the sticky air slicing it into cooler segments a bed fitted with a mosquito net and an antique writing desk the bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom oldfashioned but with a shower which worked the rooms had all the luxury of simplicity after a lengthy shower he called room service for a cold beer and sat with it on the balcony looking towards the adyar river there were magnificent tamarinds and raintrees umbrellas of shade for the green parakeets doves and mynahs the club was an eighteenthcentury building formerly the residence of the anglican bishop of madras it was a splendid white building with a dome and large columns at the entrance it overlooked the advar river which was an impressive view provided it was seen from a distance seen closer up it was a sluggish channel of evil smelling black polluted water an ecological disaster after lunch he called some of his closer friends in particular ramu and suresh they agreed to meet at the raintree restaurant in the connemara hotel the following evening the connemara was one of the oldest hotels in the city the raintree restaurant was tucked away in a garden area at the rear of the main hotel it served chettiar food spicy but sophisticated a complex range of flavours which exploded in the mouth one after the other ramu and suresh were waiting for him in the lobby when they reached the table he found lalitha and nirupama too a nice surprise conversation most of it about the most recent gossip and scandal got under way immediately noshir battliwallah had been discovered in the bed of the american consulgenerals wife nicky patel was having a homosexual affair with the son of a state minister the daughter of a leading doctor had run off temporarily with a press photographer there was no lack of material over coffee conversation turned to the visvanathans they went back over the long history of their misdeeds how vish had been involved in a bank fraud case way back in and how keith lennox had given evidence for him in court and how vish had been let off how he had organised alcohol smuggling in the early s before dick had arrived how he had repeatedly cheated the company over the resale of airconditioners and other surplus equipment how the visvanathans had regularly exploited junior staff using them as unpaid personal servants at their home how they had arranged a system of underthetable payments for the award of contracts the list went on and on the visvanathans had done very well out of their position but questions still needed to be answered how had they got away with it for such a long period and why should they have been considered dangerous to the company it made no sense surely it should have been easy just to get rid of them why had noone done it one new thing which dick learnt was that molly had been away for a year in the uk in this was very unusual and noone knew why she had been given permission to go immediately after her return she and vish had announced the date of their marriage it had attracted attention at the time because vish was a hindu brahmin and molly a keralite christian and the fact that they had hardly known each other before molly went away so suddenly in they never had any children dick also wanted to find out what had happened to nagarajan nagarajan had been in charge of accounts at trakton when dick left he had been closely involved in the hosur factory project suresh gave dick his address in devanahalli i dont know exactly what he knows but im sure he knows something and he likes you he always used to talk about how you helped him out when his wife died maybe it will help if you take a bottle when you visit him anyway if anyone can help you im sure he can chapter seven nagarajan it was not till after christmas that dick managed to establish contact with nagarajan his letters went unanswered and the telephone number suresh had given him rang engaged the whole time dick spent the christmas and new year holiday looking up old friends eventually he received a card from nagarajan inviting him to visit at your earliest convenience dick took the early morning flight to bangalore and checked into the west end hotel his favourite hotel in the whole of india it was still an island of peace in a city which had gone wild with development the rooms were in separate buildings surrounded with gardens and trees the service was efficient and polite and the rooms comfortable and spacious it took dick some time to get through to the number in devanahalli nagarajan eventually came to the phone he sounded vague and confused but the line crackled so badly that dick could not really tell he managed to communicate his message that he would be coming over to devanahalli the next morning nagarajan told him he would be welcome dick took an early breakfast on the terrace of the west end he ordered idlis with masala and chutney and the jetblack southern indian filter coffee the grass in the garden was wet with dew and he wrapped himself tighter in his kashmiri shawl to keep warm there had been a wedding party in the garden the night before now the grass was littered with fading orange marigold garlands and bruised jasmine flowers turning from white to brown he wondered how long the newlymarried couples happiness would last he hoped it would be longer than the brief beauty of these flowers he hired a car with a driver for the day and by eight they were threading their way through the morning rush hour towards the northern exit from the city under the british raj bangalore had been an army town with wide treelined roads and comfortable bungalows it was still an important military base but now it was also the hightech capital of india with space industries aeronautics computer software telecommunications silicon chips the works the bungalows were being rapidly replaced by highrise blocks shopping malls and luxury apartments and it now had the worst traffic pollution dick had experienced for years they passed the maharajahs palace hidden behind groves of eucalyptus trees then out beyond the agricultural college and all the research institutes which were springing up along the road they passed the parsi towers of silence where dead bodies were left exposed to be eaten by birds of prey it looked abandoned and did not seem to have been used for some time the traffic was chaotic yellow autorickshaws weaving in and out of the traffic sometimes carrying seven or more people buses so overloaded that they sagged down at one corner lorries piled so high with sugarcane that they seemed about to turn over old cars driven by even older men clutching the steering wheel as if their lives depended on it and they did gradually the traffic thinned as they got farther from the city rural india the india of the villages surrounded them again very soon after they left the city bullock carts moved slowly along loaded with sugarcane hay groups of people the road was lined with tamarind trees many of them scarred by traffic accidents and with families of monkeys playing under them beside the road there were the dark green mango orchards fields of grapevines groves of coconut palms silvery sugarcane plantations small fields of red peppers and of course the bare granite rock of the deccan plateau they turned right at the road junction at dodballapur taking the direction of nandi hills dick had heard about the hills but never visited them he did not realise then what an important role they were to play in his life it was ten when they arrived in devanahalli it took some time before shaukat the driver located nagarajans house they found it in a quiet lane well away from the town centre it was a singlestorey house built from granite blocks like all the other houses in the town it was built around a courtyard in the traditional southern indian style nagarajan was waiting for dick at the entrance dick was shocked when he saw nagarajan he was like a driedup plant brown and lifeless they went into the courtyard of the house sitting in a shady corner they began to talk nagarajans daughter lakshmi served them coffee when dick first saw lakshmi he felt he instantly recognised her although he had never met her before it was as if he had always known her she was in her early thirties or so he guessed her skin was dark much darker than nagarajans with a warm glow it was her eyes which caught his attention first dark pools in which her feelings surfaced her long jetblack hair hung down her back she wore a simple sari which did not completely hide the outline of her full breasts and narrow waist she moved with an indefinable grace she was quite simply the most beautiful woman he had ever seen their eyes met briefly before she bent to pour the coffee while lakshmi busied herself with preparing lunch nagarajan told dick that she was a widow he had arranged her marriage to a boy from the same community a computer software specialist they had married at the boys home town near ljdipi in north karnataka when she was twentytwo by then she had completed her ma in english literature it was time for babies grandchildren to warm the old peoples hearts and to justify their years of work and struggle but no children came and five years later girijan her husband had died in a motorcycle accident she had returned to her father and now took care of him in his retirement that was the only role left to her as they talked nagarajan drank dick had brought him a bottle of dutyfree whisk as a present nagarajan steadily drank his way through it he had always been a heavy cigarette smoker but now he smoked beedies thin handrolled black tobacco sticks which gave off an acrid smoke and choked anyone who inhaled it the room was soon filled with smoke the horse races begin again soon he said coughing his dry smokers cough ive got some good tips for winners this season i could certainly use some extra money the company pension is miserable look at this place he gestured around him at the room they sat in with its cement floor and bare stone walls i always knew there was something funny with that bitch molly he said abruptly changing the subject it was her who got me sacked you know her and her bastard of a husband they didnt like the questions i was asking about the hosur factory contract somehow they got to lennox with stories about me unreliable dishonest me dishonest interfering inefficient and all that so one morning not long after youd gone i got this letter id been given early retirement just like you only i got the minimum payment there was nothing i could do about it i wrote letters to delhi but never got a proper answer what the hell was going on there dick id hoped you might tell me said dick how is it that the visvanathans always seemed to have so much power i dont know for sure dick said nagarajan becoming more and more informal as the whisky took its effect he had never before called dick by his first name but you know that they all knew each other in the old days dont you madras was lennoxs first post with the company i remember because id only just joined as a typist vish was a typist like me and molly was a telephone operator that molly was quite a girl in those days she knew how to enjoy herself all right plenty of rumours about her i can tell you i think old ned ned outram he was in the factory at the time as chief engineer i think old ned fancied her they went out together i think for a while im pretty sure it was ned i dont know its all mixed up in my mind now lennox was around too without his wife to start with she only came out to join him later it was all such a long time ago it wasnt long after that that she went off to the uk on special leave molly i mean that caused some gossip i can tell you she told everyone she was going to look after her sick uncle in birmingham noone believed that though some people even said shed gone to have an abortion in secret i dont know about that but i know she didnt waste any time in marrying vish when she got back and they never had any children i always wondered about that of course lennox had gone to egypt by then on promotion i always thought he was a crafty bastard that one was it ned i dont know have another drink dick doesnt anyone know what she really did when she was in the uk asked dick surely someone must know maybe percy hancock might know if hes still alive he was in charge in delhi at that time he must have approved the leave i always thought they were perfectly suited to each other molly and vish i mean both as evil as each other i hate their guts i just hope they get their punishment one day have another drink nagarajans confused conversation was interrupted when lakshmi brought them lunch it was simple vegetarian food rice dal and vegetable masala with chappaties but the aroma was delicious lakshmi in traditional indian style did not eat with them she would eat later dick ate hungrily but nagarajan only picked at his food while continuing to smoke yet another beedie as soon as the meal was over nagarajan excused himself and tottered unsteadily across the courtyard to his room for an afternoon sleep leaving dick alone at the table it was some time before lakshmi returned to clear the dishes she said nothing and went about her work with her eyes lowered not looking at dick as she was about to leave the room dick asked her how is your father what has happened to him as you can see she said he has lost hope in life it has happened since he retired my mother died the same year he has not forgiven himself though he was not to blame now he drinks quite a bit it helps him remember the good times he often speaks of you he has never forgotten what you did to help when my mother was so ill before all this happened she spoke softly but in a dark warm voice that sent a tremor through dick he did not want her to leave the room how long have you been with him here just over a year now since my husband was killed your father told me i am so sorry it must be very difficult for you she raised her eyes to look straight at him there were no tears but they seemed full of hidden suffering it was an arranged marriage we never how can i explain what has happened has happened it cannot be changed many people are less fortunate than me but dont you get lonely here with only your father for company i am not lonely it is not hard work to look after my father as you can see he eats little he is often out of the house i have time to think and to read i read a lot books are good company in any case they are what i have he was about to ask another question anything to keep her with him for a few more minutes when she suddenly changed the subject you must be feeling tired after your journey i will show you the guest room you can take a sleep too my father will not wake until teatime their eyes met briefly before she led him across the courtyard to the room next to her fathers enjoy your rest i will call you at teatime she turned away from him and walked slowly back across the courtyard he lay on the bed his thoughts were confused molly and her mysterious year in britain nagarajans dead existence in this small town his own sudden fascination for lakshmi the thoughts came and went moved in and out of focus if only he thought he was woken by a gentle knocking and lakshmi s voice if you are ready i am serving tea to my father in five minutes tea was an uncomfortable experience nagarajans mood seemed to be heavy without alcohol to lighten it the whisky bottle now stood empty on the table he still seemed halfasleep he silently smoked one beedie after another while slowly sipping his tea lakshmi said nothing though dick occasionally caught her eye after drinking two cups dick rose to leave why dont you stay asked nagarajan roughly isnt my house good enough for you lakshmi opened her mouth to speak but he silenced her with a look anyway i thought you would stay for one or two days theres noone to talk to here except fools he seemed unaware of the insult to his own daughter but no doubt she did not qualify as someone fit to have a conversation with anyway go if you must but youre always welcome to my house ive never forgotten what you did for mrs nagarajan ask percy hancock he must know something dick left him slumped in an old chair in the corner of the darkening room still smoking the sound of his cough followed dick out lakshmi accompanied him to the door leading to the street his car was waiting they stood for a moment before he got in please excuse my father for his rudeness he doesnt mean it its the way he is now its not always easy to her voice trembled as she looked down he saw the tears filling her eyes theres nothing to excuse said dick ive had a good day and youve been very hospitable i think i shall take your father up on his offer to come again i hope you will her voice was steady again and she smiled as the car drove off he looked back she was still standing in the street she did not wave behind her rising above the town he saw the dark shape of the nandi hills in the gathering dusk chapter eight cambridge february hello old chap do come in have a seat how about a glass of sherry or would you prefer something stronger dry or sweet dry fine me too nothing like a glass of old fino is there good for the soul i always say my goodness though long time no see isnt it now knighted sir percy hancock former chief executive of trakton and before that head of the delhi office of the company sank back into his leather armchair sherry glass in hand eyes twinkling behind his halfmoon spectacles dick guessed that what he meant by long time no see was what the hell have you come to see me about after all these years i smell a rat what are you trying to get out of me sir percy was wellknown for his charm he was the son of a baronet had been educated at eton and trinity college cambridge had a distinguished record with the guards during the second world war for which he had been awarded a dso had married the daughter of a banker done very well for himself with trakton and was now a widower enjoying his sunset years alone in cambridge the last thing he wanted was trouble and despite his sophisticated kindly charming manner he had a reputation for acting ruthlessly if the occasion demanded it but everyone said he also had the memory of an elephant that was the key issue for dick would he remember what had gone on in madras over twenty years earlier and even if he did would he tell dick what he knew dick had telephoned him simply saying he would like to see him on a brief visit to cambridge while carrying out some research sir percy had invited him to lunch he could hardly have done less for a former colleague the georgian house in chaucer road was spacious and comfortable in the english style there was no sign of modern interior design the furniture was comfortable rather than stylish there were antique persian rugs on the floor the walls were covered with old pictures of eton and cambridge with framed photographs of sir percys father being introduced to king george v of sir percy with nehru it was not exactly a museum but it had a strong sense of history about it a long garden stretched away behind the house equally english with wide flower beds flowering trees and perfectly kept grass even in winter there were flowers so whats all this about research eh didnt know you were into the academic stuff whats it all about then there was a suspicious edge to his voice but he continued to smile well its just that i have plenty of time on my hands now so ive been thinking of writing a book i thought i could do a sort of study of economic development in india id use trakton as a kind of case study so im just collecting some background information filling in details im not familiar with that sort of thing i know youre a real encyclopaedia on the early days of the company so i thought id try to pick your brains to see if my idea is possible not many brains left now dear boy sir percy said innocently i say mustnt let the food get cold lets have our lunch cooks are so hard to find these days im lucky to have mrs dobbs cant afford to upset her you know mrs dobbs a large silent woman in her fifties served them smoked salmon followed by a delicious meat pie and a lemon sorbet for dessert they drank gaillac perle with the salmon get it from a chum of mine has a vineyard you know not bad eh they also drank a dark red fruity cahors with the pie you have to take care of yourself when youre my age said sir percy referring to the lunch regular meals good solid food proper food none of this junk food you know keep it simple though nothing in excess what have another glass to finish off never mind ill finish it for supper good for the bloodpressure i believe lets have some coffee in the study as they sat in the comfortable booklined study dick realised that sir percy had successfully diverted him away from the subject of trakton all through lunch he must find a way of getting back to the subject now how long were you with the company in india sir he asked casually over ten years dear boy over ten years but of course i dont remember much now ive lost contact with everyone you know noone has any time for an old fool like me what i just look after my garden these days are you interested in flowers at all dick did not reply to this and returned to his questions one of the things im hoping to cover in the book is the career profiles of indian staff to try to show how office and factory workers became managers that sort of thing rather dear boy good idea dick decided that he must circle round the subject to confuse sir percy before coming to the point so he asked sir percy about a number of staff from the delhi headquarters who had done well for themselves as managers he asked about staff in bombay in calcutta in kanpur sir percy talked on and on about what he remembered of them much of it surprisingly frank and honest it certainly showed that his memory was as sharp as ever dick swallowed hard and attacked do you remember the visvanathans in madras sir now they did very well oh yes molly and vish i remember sending both of them on training courses at various times that sort of thing excellent material splendid nice couple too as i recall of course i didnt know them personally or anything like that dick decided to try a daring tactic to surprise sir percy perhaps it would work at least it might catch sir percy off his guard and make him tell dick something useful i wonder if you know what happened to molly visvanathans child the one she had in britain during her year off you did know about that of course you must have approved her special leave dick realised with a thrill of excitement that he had accidentally stumbled on the truth he had hit his target it was as if a chill suddenly came over the room sir percy had been taken off his guard and for a split second only he lost his easy selfassured manner but almost at once he recovered it when he replied his voice was as silky and relaxed as ever yes yes of course bad business that what poor gal got in trouble with one of the british staff in madras you know couldnt have that sort of thing going on had to get her away for a bit she could have stayed on in the uk with the boy but she decided to go back named him john i think yes john gave him her own family name verghese but what became of him where is he now he must be over twenty by now does molly still keep in touch with him dick was anxious to follow up on his unexpected advantage but sir percy was already steering him away from the danger zone couldnt say dear boy went to a good school and all that his father paid for it all as far as i know then he came up here i believe went to st johns college if im not mistaken but i say old boy i cant see what all this has to do with career development of indian staff eh it was all a long time ago better forgotten theres no point in stirring it all up again it wont do anyone any good how about a cognac dick accepted they sipped the golden liquid in silence how do you find it dear boy its armagnac actually i prefer it its got a bit more oomph than cognac matter of personal taste i suppose dick nodded appreciatively he was about to ask his final question but sir percy got in first by the way theres no point in asking who the father was i couldnt possibly tell you that could i id leave it all alone if i were you dear boy dick decided that he would get no more information from sir percy thanked him and left sir percy elegant in his bow tie and expensive tweeds walked with him to the gate take my advice dear boy by all means write your book if thats your intention but forget about all this molly business it could get you into trouble serious trouble do come again dear boy when you can spare the time ive got a really nice chablis in the cellar id like to try on you come in the summer when we can sit out and enjoy the garden chapter nine jacko of st johns dick looked at his watch half past four already the lunch had gone on far longer than hed expected the old boy certainly had stamina dick decided to walk back to st johns his old college he would go along the backs the frosty february air by the river would help to clear his head as he turned down fen causeway he thought again about sir percys reaction to his question about mollys child hed obviously decided there was no point in denying it that would not have fooled dick instead he had told dick just enough but no more he had also managed to issue a warning dick wondered how much more he knew and had not told he crossed silver street and made his way along the backs kings college chapel was romantically veiled in the early evening mist with frost on the lawns sloping down to the river a perfect tourist picture postcard he entered st johns college by the rear gate crossed the pepys bridge and made his way to the guest rooms in chapel court one of the privileges of membership of a cambridge college was the right to a few nights free accommodation every year in the college guest rooms dick had never used this privilege before but he was glad of it now he had not told sally of his visit to cambridge and had no wish to meet her it would only have led to disagreements over the divorce settlement it was better to let the lawyers sort it all out he took a shower then relaxed in the battered but comfortable armchair in his room he felt that he needed to think things through to somehow organise what he had discovered so far so that he could make sense of it he knew for sure now that vish and molly had had some sort of special relationship with keith lennox in delhi the three of them had plotted to get rid of dick and then nagarajan earlier dick had found out about vishs crooked schemes and tried to have him dismissed he had failed because lennox had forbidden him to act against vish why dick had only survived for a few months longer in the madras factory and he had been harassed with poisonpen letters and the death threat but it was only when he had begun investigating the big hosur factory contract that he had been sent on early retirement what was the connection and where did mollys son john fit in who was his father was this the key to the whole affair dick determined to speak to his old tutor sir jeremy jackson the retired professor of comparative philology jacko as he was affectionately known by everyone in the college was a famous eccentric some people even considered him to be mad but he had been a fellow of the college for over forty years and was a part of the place and he knew the undergraduates personally unlike many professors he spent a lot of time just chatting to students he would certainly remember john verghese dick called the stewards office and booked himself for dinner at high table the next day jacko was bound to be there he never missed his three free meals a day dick had eaten too much for lunch he did not feel like going out into the cold night and sitting alone in some anonymous restaurant he read for a while then went to bed it was only nine thirty as he turned out the light the thought of lakshmi flashed through his mind he wondered how she was coping with her father though it was ridiculous he had met her only once he found himself missing her he told himself not to be a fool and went to sleep he woke at six in the morning the courtyard below was dark but filled with thick milky fog the windows were covered with patterns of frost distant footsteps echoed strangely on the cobblestones in the courtyard he wrapped himself tighter in the bedclothes and slept again until seven he spent a lazy day after breakfast in the college buttery he strolled off into the town he browsed in the bookshops and bought a couple of collections of short stories for lakshmi he lunched at the riverside restaurant overlooking the fateful place where he had fallen into the river he wondered if his keys were still buried somewhere in the sticky black mud in the afternoon he went to a film at the arts cinema one of the places he used to go as a student it was called wolf and starred jack nicholson as a man who turns into a werewolf it was oddly disturbing and he looked around at the audience in the cinema almost expecting to see human wolves after dressing for dinner he walked across to the senior common room for sherry a handful of professors and guests were already there he helped himself to a glass of college sherry and went to check the list of those dining that evening sure enough jackos name was there he recognised very few of the other names except the masters he noted that a nobel prizewinner and a wellknown woman novelist were among the guests jacko came in and walked straight across to him he was a small sprightly man with a round stomach and twinkling eyes his bald head was suntanned he took a mediterranean holiday every winter got your note dick splendid to see you again let me just get myself a drink right cheers just got back from my holiday in greece lovely weather good to catch up with the latest greek idiomatic expressions i love it how are you keeping at a signal from the master everyone followed him in single file into the great hall and took their seats at the high table on a raised platform at one end below them the undergraduate students sat at the long tables under the portraits of famous former students hanging on the woodpanelled walls everyone rose for grace to be said in latin of course dick sat next to jacko who between mouthfuls of food made rude comments in a loud voice about the other dinner guests jacko continued to do this for the entire meal they then stood again for grace again in latin and filed out come back to my rooms dick i cant stand any more of this ridiculous talk cant hear myself think well have some coffee sent over and you can try my slivovica i got a bottle off one of my exstudents before the bosnian thing started terrible business jackos rooms were on the first floor facing the chapel although he must have been over eighty years old he was clearly still active a grammar of albanian lay on the desk next to a work on the phonology of old basque journals on linguistics were scattered around the room and a large mandarinenglish dictionary with wellthumbed pages lay open on the dining table a college butler brought them a tray of coffee jacko uncorked a bottle of clear spirits pungent with the aroma of plums here you are this will put hair on your chest and he poured dick a glass of the fiery liquid now what can i do for you dick whats your problem dick explained that he had some friends in india who were anxious to contact a student who had been at st johns until recently it was not quite the truth but it was not a complete lie either jacko remembered the name immediately john verghese of course i know who you mean a very nice chap angloindian very intelligent he got a first class degree in economics last year i have to admit that he was a bit of a disappointment to me though id been hoping to use him as an informant on malayalam very interesting language malayalam spoken in kerala you know fascinating place i went there many years ago when i was learning the language myself tamil telugu kannada and malayalam wonderful languages you know all as ancient as they come pushed down to the tip of the subcontinent by those terrible aryans id been hoping he could help me with translations id been doing of some ancient texts not a bit of it the fellow didnt speak a word of his mothers language in fact the poor chap had never set foot in india completely english terrible thing mind you it happens all the time now i get arab students who cant read classical arabic chinese students who cant write proper characters only these miserable simplified things old mao brought in and indian students who dont know a thing about sanskrit i dont know what the worlds coming to do you happen to know what happened to him after he went down from the university he went into a bank in london i think we can easily check up on it tomorrow morning old briggs was his tutor not a bad fellow briggs he has a weakness for his colleagues wives but nobodys perfect hes a good scholar in his way hell have vergheses address ive no doubt i cant disturb him this evening though he has a regular lady visitor on thursdays i believe next morning he called on jacko again after breakfast he learned that john verghese had taken up a job as a trainee at a wellknown bank in the cityjacko handed him the address and a contact telephone number there do give the boy my best regards if you look him up oh and by the way if you happen to be in mysore next time you go to india do look up old aranganayagam at the institute of indian languages hes a wonderful old rogue terrible womaniser youd enjoy him tell him he still owes me that article hell know which one i mean dick took an afternoon train to london the train broke down at stevenage and finally crawled into kings cross an hour and a half late it was now the rush hour to avoid the crowds dick had an early dinner at a greek restaurant in victoria he got back to hove at ten in the evening there was a pile of junk mail in his mailbox and one letter from his solicitor setting out details of the proposed divorce settlement he put it to one side and went straight to bed chapter ten a visit to ned in bath dick spent the weekend thinking about the information he had gathered so far he had to find out who johns real father was that was obviously one of the keys to the conspiracy between molly vish and lennox sir percy had told him that mollys lover had been british he needed to know which british staff had been in madras in he remembered that nagarajan had mentioned ned outram dick had never met outram in person but he had heard plenty of stories about his sensational love life he needed to check with nagarajan but he also needed to find out if there had been any other british staff in the factory at the time one of them he felt sure had fathered mollys child just after lunch on sunday he made an international call to nagarajan it would be about six in the evening in devanahalli he calculated it was lakshmi who answered the phone dick realised immediately that he had been hoping that she would yet the moment he heard her voice he felt a rising sense of unease coupled with nervous excitement he could not say what he really wanted to say to her hello oh dick you want to speak to my father i think yes i do but i am so happy to speak to you too i am sorry but he is out with some friends can i take a message for him he will be back late tonight will you call again lakshmi i will call again did you hear what i said i said i am so happy to speak to you and i meant it dick i am happy to hear your voice also very happy lakshmi i got you a couple of books in england ill send them on tomorrow thats so lovely dick i only wish i the line was suddenly cut there was just a long whistling sound dick sat thinking for a long time just to hear lakshmis voice again had turned his emotions upside down an hour later he called ramu at home in madras ramu confirmed that ned outram had been in madras at the time more importantly ned and keith lennox had been the only british staff in the factory that was what dick needed to know mollys lover had been one of them he sat for a long time wondering whether he should call nagarajans number again he no longer needed information but he longed to hear lakshmis voice again finally he decided it was better not to call instead he called ramu again to get outrams address ramu agreed to call him the following day after checking the personnel records in the office at lunchtime the following day ramu rang through with the information ned was living in bath ramu gave the address and telephone number he also warned dick to be careful vish had been asking questions in the factory about dicks last visit he is furious you have touched a raw nerve no doubt about it said ramu with delight molly also has been asking all sorts of questions about your doings i shall keep ears and eyes open as usual dick called the bath number several times before he managed to reach ned he sounded a bit vague not quite connected to the real world eventually he agreed to see dick the following day he gave him directions on how to find the house but dont expect too much my old friend he mumbled i live in elegant poverty youll see i do look forward to seeing you im sure well find lots to talk about dick checked into a small hotel on the weston road in bath he had chosen it from the town street plan because it was within walking distance of neds house here he was above the town with audley park sloping down towards the back of royal terrace the houses were built from the golden yellow bath stone most of them eighteenth or nineteenth century big houses standing in spacious gardens he found neds house in a narrow lane off the main road it was a large square victorian house standing in an untidy overgrown garden with a dark cypress tree in front of it dick rang the doorbell which echoed away deep inside the house no one answered dick looked at his watch it was six in the evening he had told ned to expect him between half past five and six he rang again he was taken by surprise when a voice behind him said its no good ringing the door bell you must be dick sterling i forgot to mention that i dont live in the house cant afford to i let the house to some business people i live in the servants flat in the basement come on ill show you the way he led the way down a narrow flight of steps to a small door in the stone wall it opened into an airless room full of dark furniture and smelling of unwashed clothes cooking oil and stale tobacco in one corner there was a sink and a draining board full of dirty dishes ashtrays were scattered about full of cigarette ends through an open doorway dick could see an unmade bed clothes thrown on the floor the overall effect was one of total neglect dick turned his attention to his host ned outram was about his own age he must have been strikingly handsome once but now he was balding and great grey bags hung down below his watery eyes he wore dirty jeans and a grey denim shirt under a dirty white woollen sweater his belly hung out over the waist of bis jeans from years of beer drinking sorry about the mess he said though it was not a real apology ive got used to living on my own and ive forgotten how normal people live that is if i ever knew shall i make you some coffee or tea or can i offer you something a bit more exciting vodka tequila you say and ill tell you whether ive got it dick saw the empty bottles by the sink which explained the unreality in which ned seemed to be living no thanks ned i dont need anything for the moment i just wanted to ask you a few questions about the time you were in madras with the company oh yes the company the wonderful company the company that will take care of us all for all time the jolly old company that will do anything to survive forget the company it was the company that ruined my life so dont talk to me about the company i think i know how you feel after all something similar happened to me do you feel like telling me about it i mean about what they did to you well they kicked me out if thats what you mean it was in id been there for ten years by then they invented something and got rid of me but who were they dick asked the bloody visvanathans god knows how they did it but they did it was as if the top management were blind they only listened to what the visvanathans told them but i thought you got along pretty well with molly especially what do you mean by that exactly asked ned his face suddenly red with anger well the way i heard it you and molly had quite a thing going back in and there were a lot of rumours about molly going on special leave to the uk for a year you must be joking said ned molly was an absolute bitch do you understand what i mean by that she would have done any thing with any one to get ahead she was totally available at a price it wasnt a price i wanted to pay yes we did go out once or twice yes she did stay back at my place once but only once i dont make a habit of sleeping with snakes so who was the father of mollys child then dick asked directly look i dont want to accuse anyone but i know barbara lennox wasnt around for a couple of months and i know that lennox wasnt as pure as he pretended to be and i know that molly did go to his place at least once and stayed there you know what the gossip is like in madras you can check it with ramu if you dont believe me and im damned sure that i didnt give her a child what makes you so sure well believe it or not im not capable of giving anyone a baby i had myself tested way back when my marriage was breaking up theres no way that child could have been mine im infertile i couldnt give a baby to anyone chapter eleven london john verghese they met at the small italian restaurant la perla in greek street soho dick had contacted john verghese at barings bank a few days previously he had arranged the lunch by claiming to be the close friend of keith lennox and by mentioning jacko john was tall and athletic in a truly striking way he moved with the grace and confidence of a wild animal yet his smile was kind he seemed like a really nice human being dick noted from his lightbrown skin colour that there was no doubt of his angloindian parentage over the antipasto dick tried to find out just how much john knew about his own origins well ive been so incredibly lucky he said after my parents were killed keith and barbara were really wonderful in fact i dont remember my real parents at all i was too young it was keith and barbara who felt like my real parents i think i spent every holiday with them or with their family jane you know jane their daughter well jane and i were even thinking of getting married at one point but uncle keith stepped in and stopped it maybe its best and my uncle and auntie in india were also incredibly kind and helpful your uncle and auntie dick queried yes im sure you must have run into them in madras auntie molly and uncle vish they always visit me whenever they come over to the uk dick felt that the pieces of the puzzle were beginning to fall into place by the time the meal was over dick was sure that he knew what lay behind the twentyyearold story dick spent the next month collecting documents as evidence he obtained a copy of johns birth certificate from st catherines house in the strand he traced the private hospital where john had been born and got copies of the receipts paid for by lennox he confirmed that john had attended a wellknown catholic public school and obtained copies of the school bills also paid by keith lennox he obtained through ramu some interesting records concerning the hosur factory project the company had originally been offered the land at a special cheap price but this offer had disappeared instead the company had paid forty per cent more for the land for their new factory vish and molly had collected twenty per cent of the difference from the sellers and lennox had known of this and done nothing ramus documents included a copy of the original offer he also heard from ned again sending him a yellowing photograph of lennox and molly they were standing close looking into each others eyes he had his arm around her it was a picture of young lovers how ned had got hold of it he had no idea but it was just one more small piece of the jigsaw puzzle slowly and carefully dick built up a file proving extensive corruption by the visvanathans under the protection of keith lennox the only possible motives for lennoxs action were either financial gain for himself or to hide the scandal of molly and the illegitimate child dick recalled the public disgrace which keith would have experienced if his relationship had become known things have changed now but at the time mixedrace affairs were highly disapproved of by both europeans and indians in either case he would have been in deep trouble if it had ever been made public dick felt a rising sense of anger revenge would be sweet ramu had hinted in his letter that nagarajan knew even more it was not difficult for dick to make up his mind to return to india the thought of lakshmi alone was enough chapter twelve nandi hills dick spent only one night at the club in madras before flying on to bangalore but soon after going to bed he was disturbed by two telephone calls one was from ramu he had heard that the visvanathans were planning something he did not know what it was bur it had to do with dicks inquiries dick had obviously touched a raw nerve ramu advised him to be very careful these guys are dangerous they will stop at nothing to save themselves be very careful dick i will go on looking around and contact you as necessary you will be at west end or nagarajans dick told him to try either the other call was anonymous when dick picked up the phone a muffled voice simply said youd better get back to the uk where you belong remember your death threat this time were not playing games mind your own business or else he spent an uncomfortable night tossing and turning in a halfsleep before the dawn birdsong finally woke him the west end was as always a welcome oasis in the clouds of traffic pollution of bangalore dick made a call to devanahalli the number did not answer he decided to hire a car anyway and to leave early the next morning the driver turned out to be shaukat the same man who had driven him on the previous occasion by half past seven they were again in the thick of the morning traffic and by nine they were in devanahalli neither dick nor shaukat had noticed the black ambassador with dark windows which had left the west end just after them and followed them at a safe distance all the way to devanahalli as shaukat drove the car into the dusty lane dick felt butterflies in his stomach would lakshmi be there what would he say to her what would her reaction be did she have the same feelings for him as he had for her after all they had only spoken a few words on the phone he was basing everything on the glances they had exchanged the last time on the halfspoken hints on the telephone on his own feelings perhaps he was imagining it all why should anyone as beautiful as lakshmi be in the least interested in a man almost twice her age with his career in ruins behind him and from a completely different culture he cursed himself for building up so many hopes on so little evidence yet his hands were trembling as he knocked on the street door it was lakshmi herself who opened the door she was plainly taken completely by surprise her face showed shock then joy then worry almost pain then she smiled the most wonderful smile and asked him to come in he followed her across the courtyard to the living quarters she was wearing a simple cotton sari of a deep turquoise colour with a thin border of crimson and gold she moved with all the grace he remembered as she prepared coffee they talked it felt as if they had always known each other her tense nervousness had left her she was warm and relaxed could this be because her father was not there dick wondered i tried to call you from bangalore yesterday he said but then i decided to come anyway im so glad you did dick our phones out of order as usual but my father is away im afraid he has gone to the wedding of a nephew in anantapur but he is due back this evening i hope you can stay to see him i can make you some lunch later he should be back by nightfall he will be very upset if he finds out he has missed you of course ill stay but i dont want to put you to any trouble i mean its no trouble at all quite the opposite she paused as if in doubt about what she was going to say when she spoke her voice was darker more serious dick im sorry but i lied to you last time what do you mean lied i told you i was not lonely here in fact im desperately lonely it is so isolated here i have noone i can talk to really talk to there is nowhere to go nothing to do except to take care of my father and he is becoming more and more difficult you saw for yourself last time so i would be so happy if you would stay until he comes back i would like to know you better will you stay of course ill stay maybe i shouldnt say this bt i didnt come here again just to see your father i have thought of you often since i left i came to see you too lakshmi looked down he wondered if he had said too much too soon but when she looked up she had a radiant smile of pure joy on her face she said nothing but poured his coffee for him her eyes did not leave his face for a moment as he drank it i know what said dick suddenly why dont we go out for the day ive got the car and the driver there must be somewhere interesting we could go and it would make a change for you wouldnt it thats a lovely idea dick but arent you tired i dont mind preparing lunch no come on lakshmi lets enjoy ourselves wheres the nearest place we could go well theres nandi hills which isnt far away it would only take about half an hour or so to get to it was one of tipoos forts then the british made it into a sort of small hill station for holidays in the hot season there are some nice walks at the top is there anywhere we can get lunch there i think there are a couple of small places if you dont mind the indian food great thats settled then ill wait while you get ready and then well go lakshmi returned fifteen minutes later wearing jeans and a shirt she had tied her hair up in a bun she looked younger more athletic i hope you dont mind she said i cant go climbing about up there in a sari as they drove out of the lane the black ambassador slid out from behind a parked lorry and followed them dick and lakshmi were both too absorbed in their conversation to notice it but shaukat frowned as he looked in the rear mirror he had seen the car behind them in the morning it seemed odd that it should be behind them again now but he said nothing dick wanted to see some statues he had read about in a temple not far from devanahalli so they stopped on the way to the hills they parked the car in the small dusty lane leading up to the temple entrance there were the usual small shops selling garlands of jasmine flowers coconuts and bananas as offerings to the gods cigarettes and soft drinks and a variety of cheaplooking copies of the temple statues monkeys were fighting over scraps of food in the shade of a big raintree below the temple steps from the outside the temple was unimpressive large granite blocks with very little decoration but inside it was fantastic the heavy stone roof was supported by hundreds of pillars each one carved in the shape of gods temple dancers cows lions and other mythical animals the variety was almost too much yet somehow it all seemed to fit together dick went from pillar to pillar trying to absorb the wealth of detail in each figure lakshmi found him standing absorbed in front of a statue of a temple dancer the naked figure was caught in midmovement gracefully standing on one leg the other raised to kneeheight one arm was held slightly away from the body the hand hanging loosely down the other arm was held at shoulder height the fingers formed into a graceful mudra the breasts were full and naked the angle of the hips and thighs voluptuously erotic yet not in the least vulgar the face shone with a kind of peaceful delight dick thought of lakshmis smile earlier now i wonder what youre thinking lakshmi said from behind him he turned with a guilty look on his face hoping she could not see into his thoughts what are you blushing for a brahmin priest appeared and offered to chant prayers for them he did so then broke a coconut as an offering finally they both took aarti touching their fingers to the burning camphor and taking a spoonful of ganga water in the palms of their hands before drinking it as they left the temple dick felt that the ceremony they had just performed had tied them still closer together in a way he could not define they were both silent as they walked back to the car as the car turned out on to the main road again the parked black ambassador once again followed shaukat recognised the car and he speeded up the other car speeded up too the narrow road to the top of nandi hills winds up in a series of over thirty tight hairpin bends to a point over metres above sealevel the hills are covered by thorn bushes and eucalyptus trees but there is a lot of bare granite rock exposed to the burning dry heat as they negotiated each bend shaukat had to change down into first gear and the car shook as it staggered up the next straight slope with every bend the view extended until they could see far away across the brown dusty plateau to other groups of hills in the far distance eventually they passed through the narrow gateway into the fort and drove up to the summit there were a few groups of noisy schoolchildren being looked after by tiredlooking teachers and two or three families out for the day otherwise there was hardly anyone there were a few restaurants lakshmi decided that the least bad would probably be the one run by the state tourism authority it had the advantage of being perched on the edge of the mountain top overlooking the precipice they took their seats at a dirty table next to the window which gave a magnificent view of the surrounding landscape soon after they had ordered from the menu a group of three men came in and sat at a table on the other side of the room two of them were very darkskinned and looked thin and hungry they were dressed in lunghis and white shirts which had not been washed for a long time the third one was pale and fat with a thick black moustache he was wearing spotlessly clean white trousers and shirt with the collar turned up and a pair of black and white shoes he reminded dick of a famous timil film star he was obviously the leader and ordered beer and snacks for the group they were soon in deep conversation dick did not like the look of them nor the way they kept glancing over in his and lakshmis direction he felt sure they were talking about them but soon dick and lakshmi were so deeply absorbed in each other that they forgot all about the men at the other table they talked mainly about themselves dick told her about his forced retirement about the breakup of his marriage about his present inquiry and his hopes of revenge a shadow passed across her face when he spoke of revenge but he did not notice it at the time lakshmi listened silently then she began to tell him about her own marriage the way she had been advertised in the brides column of the newspaper then inspected by the boys family how the dowry had been agreed and how finally she had married girijan and moved to udipi to live with his family the indian motherinlaw is not always as cruel as so often described but clearly lakshmi had been unlucky she was badly treated and made to work harder than a servant and girijan had been a weak man certainly not able to stand up to his forceful mother things had been worse because lakshmi had had no children she had been made to feel guilty by all those malicious relatives and their questions any good news and their meaningful looks when she had had to answer not yet but dick i couldnt do it all on my own dick was about to ask the obvious question when he noticed the great wall of black cloud building up on the horizon and the flashes of lightning the monsoon is due anytime said lakshmi i hope it wont break tonight so dicks questions went unanswered and they talked instead about tipoo sultan who had built the fort and who had ruled a large kingdom in southern india until defeated by the british at srirangapatnam just outside mysore tiger tipoo had been a forceful leader and a man without pity just below the restaurant where they now sat was tipoos drop a vertical rock face which fell metres to the rocks below one of tipoos famous punishments was to have his enemies thrown over the edge on to the rocks below lets go and see it before we leave dick suggested all right but lets hurry its already three oclock dick realised with a start that they had been talking for over two hours as they got up to leave he noticed that the men at the other table had gone he felt vaguely relieved outside a hot wind had started to blow they walked down past a small crumbling temple and a few low buildings out on to the bare top of the mountain the granite was flaking in layers like the scalp of some ancient giant dick recalled that these were the most ancient rocks on earth almost nothing grew there only some dry grass clinging to cracks in the rocks as they moved down the skull of the mountain he looked back at the ominous silhouette of the temple on the brow of the slope eventually they reached the place where people said tipoo had got rid of his enemies there was a crumbling brick wall overgrown by plants in the wall there was a gap dick moved forward and looked over the edge there was a vertical drop to the plain below he pulled himself back nervously he had an instinctive fear of heights lakshmi excused herself for a few minutes nature calls she said and walked off into some bushes further up the slope leaning on the wall dick looked out over the plain to where lightning now flashed along the horizon and the black clouds looked like mountains behind it he heard a footstep and turned assuming it was lakshmi as he turned two of the men from the restaurant threw themselves at him each one grabbed an arm and began to force him backwards towards the gap in the wall he could feel the rough bricks digging into his back the leader the man with the black and white shoes stood a few yards back shouting to them in tamil dick struggled hard and managed to free one arm and push the first man backwards then he swung the second man hanging on to his other arm in a wide circle until his head hit the wall with a dull thud the leader and the first man both ran at him together the leader had taken out a knife but he never had time to use it lakshmi came racing down the slope giving out a terrifying scream and with a classic karate kick to the mans wrist sent the knife flying high into the air and over the wall dick managed to punch the side of the first mans head both men now turned away and half ran half staggered down into the trees dick looked round for the second man but he was gone then there was the sound of a car driving off at speed dick sat down and leaned his back against the wall he was shaking and his face was white from the shock lakshmi knelt by him dick theres blood on your shirt let me look its ok i think just a few scratches on my arms and my back feels sore i think i must have bruised it on the wall nothing serious lakshmi i think you saved my life just now but where did you learn to kick like that i was in the karate team when i was at university dick i always knew it would come in useful one day but we must get away from here they may try to attack us again can you walk all right dick got shakily to his feet and they made their way back to the car park taking care to stay in the open shaukat noticed the blood on dicks shirt but he said nothing until they were halfway down the hill there was one black ambassador following us always today sir it has gone there were three goondas who drove off fast as hell itself i hope all is well sir they kept a careful watch all the way back to devanahalli but there was no sign of the black ambassador the goondas had obviously decided they had had enough for one day chapter thirteen devanahalli may after dick had taken a hot bath lakshmi rubbed a sweetsmelling ointment into the deep scratches on his arm and along his back she gave him one of her fathers white cotton kurta pyjama outfits to wear while she washed his shirt for him he was beginning to feel less tense but why do you think they attacked you dick does it have anything to do with what you told me at lunchtime why would anyone try to kill you because im sure thats what they were trying to do and they might have succeeded if it hadnt been for you lakshmi i dont know how to thank you they must have been trailing us all day just waiting for the right opportunity it frightens me to think about it anvway im sure youre right it must be connected to the inquiries ive been making someone obviously wants to stop me very badly dick dont you think you should give up this scheme of yours what good can it do you it is not good to become obsessed by revenge i cant stop now ive got almost all the information i need why should they get away with all the terrible things theyve been doing for so many years do you realise how much suffering theyve caused other people and i dont just mean me look at your own father no i cant stop now all i need to do is to decide how im going to use the information ive got so as to cause them the most trouble there was a long pause lakshmi looked worried and upset eventually she broke the awkward silence i dont think it is right to take revenge people are punished for their actions by what they become god arranges punishment we should leave it to him but thats just fatalism said dick and it means that criminals all over the place get away with the most dreadful crimes against other people please think about what i have said said lakshmi if only because i believe you are now in great danger and and i am afraid of what they might do to you she left the room in tears and did not return for over an hour dick sat alone with his thoughts it was six by the time she came back dick had decided what he had to do he rose to leave i must go back to bangalore lakshmi tomorrow ill fly to madras i need to speak to the visvanathans facetoface i should have done it before then at least theyll know what theyre up against but dick thats walking into trouble please dont do it dont worry lakshmi ive had an idea it will be my life insurance policy ill tell you about it in a minute but you cant leave now anyway my father should be back any time and its getting dark it isnt safe for you to travel in the dark supposing those men are waiting for you please dont leave im sorry if i upset you by what i said i meant it but i can understand how you feel too just dont leave me now weve had such a lovely day together well most of it was lovely i mean before they tried to kill you who knows when we may be able to see each other again please dick ok ill wait until your father comes back then ill decide whether to stay on till tomorrow or not dick said lakshmi began to prepare supper dick sat watching her but somehow the easy familiarity they had felt earlier in the day had evaporated they felt awkward and did not know quite what to say to each other perhaps it was their disagreement perhaps it was the thought that nagarajan might walk in at any moment perhaps it was the realisation that they might never meet again in the distance there was the sound of thunder the air was hot and suffocating by seven thirty nagarajan had still not returned they ate supper lakshmi looked nervous and worried are you worried about your father no im sure hes all right if he isnt back by eight theres not much point in waiting for him it isnt the first time he has stayed longer than expected he probably found some old friends to drink with and talk about the good old days hell come back when hes ready eight oclock came and went dick did not know what to do he knew he should leave but he did not want to lakshmi had become very important to him but somehow things had gone wrong between them and now he felt unsure of what to do about it eventually he took his courage in both hands and spoke lakshmi i dont want to lose you im sorry about our disagreement i dont want to go back to bangalore this evening but i dont know if i should stay wont it be bad for your reputation what about your neighbours wont they talk tell me what you want me to do lakshmi looked him full in the eyes then walked across to where he was sitting she took both his hands in hers and held them i dont care about my reputation or about what the neighbours might say ive had enough of this life it isnt a real life at all please stay dick who knows my father may turn up after all tell your driver to find a place to stay till the morning then come back and well talk they went on talking till midnight the electricity had gone off soon after nine probably because of the storm which they could still hear in the distance so they sat talking by candlelight the sense of easy familiarity had returned between them dick gave lakshmi the sealed packet he had brought with him in it was a copy of all the documents he had collected about the visvanathans and lennox if anything happened to him she was to send it by registered post to london to the chairman of the board of directors of trakton and to the daily mail newspaper eventually dick got up and they made their way across the courtyard dick to his room lakshmi to hers her fathers room was between them as they said goodnight dick took lakshmi in his arms and began to kiss her gently on her hair her neck her cheeks just at that moment there was a sudden blinding flash of lightning thunder shook the the house and heavy rain began to pour down in torrents soaking them both come inside lakshmi said softly in her room she fell into his arms he felt her body close to him he lifted her face to him and kissed her they kissed long and deep their bodies close against each other he felt her soft mouth opening for him her full breasts pressing urgently against him her hands caressing him he remembered the temple statue he had seen earlier in the day and the image melted into the reality of lakshmi in his arms as they lay down together nothing existed except this moment of total surrender to each other it was as if they had become one person fused together in this white hot moment of pleasure i love you lakshmi i love you too dick she murmured hold me dick please i need to feel you again the storm outside grew quieter but the rain continued to pour until morning they slept little and between sleeping and loving they had long whispered conversations dick stayed with lakshmi until after lunch they were both happy to be with each other he had never felt closer to anyone in his life they agreed that they would meet as soon as dicks business with trakton was over they made no definite plans but there was an unspoken understanding between them about a future life together lakshmi again saw him off the lane was full of pools of water from the night rain she stood waving as the car turned out of the lane behind her the nandi hills were sharply outlined against the rainwashed air chapter fourteen kidnap the car bumped over the rough holes on the mahabalipuram road out of madras dick sat in the back uncomfortably squeezed between two men in dirty white shirts and lunghis their leader sat in the front seat with the driver and the other man who had introduced himself as satish but this isnt the way to kalakshetra colony dick protested as they passed the marundheshwarar temple in tiruvanmiyur weve passed it already we are going somewhere quieter said satish menacingly please do not be alarmed and dont even think of trying anything but the palms of dicks hands began to sweat as they drove farther and farther out of the city the two men in the back stank of stale cigarettes coconut oil pomade and paan he began to feel sick and he cursed himself for being so stupid as soon as he had returned to madras he had called vish to arrange a meeting vish had been unusually polite even friendly he had agreed to come to dicks room at the club at six the following evening instead he had sent satish with a message to say that he was unwell but could see dick at home the car would take him and bring him back dick had been deceived by satishs educated accent and smart appearance satish had politely held the back door open for him outside the club he himself had got in next to the driver everything seemed so normal and civilised but when the car reached the theosophical society grounds it slowed down and stopped the back doors on both sides were thrown open and two men jumped in one on either side of him dick immediately recognised them as his attackers at nandi hills at the same time their leader got into the front seat beside satish dick had struggled to get out of the car but one of the men pressed something hard and sharp into his side by then the car was speeding out of the city and the dark windows made it impossible for him to attract anyones attention outside he had fallen into the trap like an idiot the car bumped quickly along the narrow road in the dark from time to time it slowed to avoid the water lorries driving towards them at high speed in the middle of the road madras is permanently short of water and water is driven into the city in lorries but the drivers were often drunk on toddy or arrack and drove with no thought for others and usually without headlights shortly after passing cholamandel the artists village the car turned off left towards the sea along a rough track it stopped outside a large house overlooking the beach dick looked around there were no other houses in sight the house was newlybuilt and furnished with all rhe luxury dick remembered from the visvanathans apartment in kalakshetra all those years ago they had obviously got even richer he was shown into a large room with a terrace overlooking the sea he was left there with the leader guarding the door it was half an hour before vish and molly came into the room by then he was feeling distinctly nervous vish had put on weight he waddled heavily into the room his eyes mouth and nose were now surrounded by fat it was as if a small clever rat sat trapped in the middle of a labyrinth of fleshy folds his eyes were as sharp and snakelike as ever though and his mouth wore the unpleasant smile dick remembered so well revealing his two large front teeth molly too had put on weight but she dressed to conceal it the rich mysore silk sari was carefully folded around her but even that could not hide the fat backflaps of flesh bulging out between her choli and her waist she wore more makeup than dick remembered but her eyes too shone dangerously just as they had when he saw her last if vish was the rat she was the snake so we meet again only this time youre not any more the boss in fact you were never the boss as you know now it seems you have been interfering in things which dont concern you dont concern me said dick i seem to remember i lost my job because of them and so did some of my friends thats just your imagination who will believe you youre just trying to find someone to blame youre so pathetic molly added in her highpitched nasal voice i suppose you know that none of the staff ever respected you i cant say i blame them she flashed a look of pure hatred at him dick kept silent refusing to respond he wanted to know where all this was leading before he said anything vish spoke again anyway even if you tell what you say you know what difference will it make to us who cares about these things well just deny it all anyway and you cant touch us here youre just an interfering foreigner and ive got plenty of friends who can take care of you dick decided that the time had come to speak oh i think quite a lot of people would be interested dont you theres john verghese for a start im sure hed be pleased to find out who his real parents are hed be delighted to know that his mother abandoned him as a baby you bastard molly screamed do you think id let you get away with that dick suddenly realised that he had won they did not know he had found out about mollys child they onlv knew about his inquiries into the hosur factory affair he had got them in a corner and im sure that barbara lennox would be delighted to find out that her husband has been deceiving her for over twenty years dick went on ignoring mollys explosion of anger and dont you think that the board of directors at trakton would be interested to find out that you two have stolen enormous sums of company money and that lennox knew all about it and did nothing and i doubt whether even your friends would be able to stop a nice juicy story about it in india today or the hindu and i think trakton has enough highlevel contacts to make sure theyd win a case against you in the courts after all i calculate you made over two crores out of the hosur land deal alone i wonder how much of that went to your friend lennox so i reckon there would be quite a lot of people who would be interested and youve made plenty of enemies over the years once you were down there would be plenty of people ready to kick you think about it we have already thought about it said vish threateningly and weve decided that we cant let you go around spreading your white mans dirt about us you seem to forget that i am a brahmin do you think i can allow a shitface like you to pollute me you must be out of your mind i dont see that you can do anything to stop me said dick but his heart was beginning to beat faster as he said so oh no vish replied i think it is quite simple to do something just step outside for a moment they moved to the terrace dick could hear the wind in the palm trees the waves pounded heavily on the beach below it was cloudy and pitch dark he could just make out the white foam capping the waves as they broke its a lovely night for a swim isnt it said vish menacingly of course the sea is very powerful here people are always getting carried away especially foreign tourists who dont realise the danger its worse if theyre drunk of course and you will be drunk shankar come the man with the black and white shoes moved quickly behind dick and held his arms the other two men pushed him back into the room and tied him to a chair satish stood behind him and pulled his head back they forced his mouth open and poured in a glass of whisky he coughed and spluttered but most of it went down you always were a heavy drinker werent you came mollys voice from behind him such a pity you never learned when to stop so decadent really dick knew that if he didnt speak up now he was finished his body would be washed up somewhere down the coast and noone would ever suspect murder theres just one thing he shouted as the men pulled his head back again if anything happens to me one set of the papers containing the evidence will be sent to trakton another set will go to the newspapers accidents may happen but theyd better not happen to me the men suddenly let go of his head he could not see what was happening but he overheard a confused whispered discussion in tamil going on behind him after what seemed a very long time vish waddled round the chair to face him he leaned towards him with an evil angry look on his face all right you win today im going to let you go but just remember if you tell what you know i will get you because by then i will have nothing more to lose so my dear boss get to hell out of here and dont forget what ive told you they took dick out to the car and pushed him into it then they drove off but not in the direction of madras a few kilometres down the road the car slowed and dick was pushed out onto the roadside the car reversed and drove quickly back the way it had come dick slept late the following morning he had been picked up by a late night hotel tourist bus which had dropped him off in town at eleven in the night he had taken an auto back to the club feeling shaken but oddly confident he tried to call lakshmi but without success then he fell into a deep and dreamless sleep the following day he called ramu and arranged to have lunch with him luckily british airways had a seat on the next days flight to london he booked it the rest of the morning he spent in his room trying to reach lakshmi he did not succeed he hurriedly scribbled her a note telling her what had happened and reassuring her that he was ok in the club dining room surrounded by white uniformed waiters his recent adventure seemed incredible he told ramu all about it and about what he proposed to do next in london ramu was as always supportive dick asked him to continue to try to contact lakshmi it was as he was leaving that ramu mentioned that he himself was considering early retirement not like you of course mine will be voluntary he said with a smile only i feel i want to do something on my own maybe start my own company something like that now that the government economic policy is more liberal encouraging foreign investment and all that why dont you join me youve got lots of experience plenty of contacts and you know the indian scene we would make highly suitable partners think about it chapter fifteen teatime in barnes london june it was not difficult to arrange to meet barbara lennox she remembered him of course and agreed to see him again to hear news of her good friends the visvanathans keith was away on a business trip to thailand she invited dick to tea in barnes on saturday afternoon london was enjoying fine summer weather so dick decided to take the underground to hammersmith then walk across the bridge to barnes he passed pubs smelling of warm beer full of afternoon customers there was a feeling of relaxation in the air with young couples strolling handinhand men with their shirts off mowing their lawns redlegged women slumped in deckchairs in their front gardens children playing halfnaked in the park it was britain at its most casual happy to forget in this temporary sunshine the miseries of unemployment and recession the lennoxs had a large victorian house overlooking the pond in barnes barnes was the territory of the successful business executives bankers computer whizzkids retired diplomats all those who had made it and kept it barbara answered the door herself and led dick into a large sunfilled room which looked out directly onto the large garden behind the house it was a comfortable room with large armchairs and tables covered with family photographs and souvenirs dick noticed a picture of john verghese standing with keith and barbara at a school prizegiving there were also pictures of the lennoxs daughter jane an attractive redhead barbara had prepared a tray with tea and small homemade cakes dick recalled that she had always been proud of her home and her cooking skills she poured the tea so how is everyone over there she asked with a slight scottish accent dick spoke in general terms about the visvanathans about ramu about nagarajan he was careful not to betray his feelings about any of them oh yes nagarajan such a nice man i believe he took early retirement such a pity about his wife i heard that his daughter had lost her husband too so sad dick had a sharp feeling of loss as she said this it was strange to hear lakshmi referred to in the third person like a stranger as the conversation went on dick gently tried to discover just how much barbara knew about john verghese and about keiths relationship with him he decided that unless she was a superb actress she knew nothing she talked about how they had taken care of him during school holidays the poor child had lost both his parents in a car accident she explained it was the least we could do and somehow we felt we kept in touch with india through him he became part of the family in a way there was even a time when he and jane were in love at least they said they were i would have liked them to get married it sort of felt right in a way if you know what i mean but keith was absolutely against it ive never seen him so upset i could never understand why after all hes not colourprejudiced or anything like that but there was no way i could talk him round funny really anyway jane married nigel last year hes a diplomat and theyre in senegal now im afraid theyre not very happy though still you cant have everything in a marriage can you she sounded suddenly old and tired it was as if a worrying thought had crossed her mind then she smiled and went on to talk about keith he was now chief executive he had even been contacted unofficially to find out whether he would accept a knighthood and become sir keith lennox she thought it would be lovely if he would then he could retire and wed maybe see a bit more of each other dick left feeling that barbara was a nice homely woman who had no idea of the web of deceit which surrounded her she would be totally shocked if she ever discovered the truth he was glad to know that it would be a weapon he could use in his meeting with lennox barbara kissed him on the cheek as he left she smelt faintly of old lavander it reminded him of his childhood he almost regretted what he was about to do to her chapter sixteen the showdown londonу june it was not so easy to arrange a meeting with lennox himself dick called the company headquarters several times each time he was told that lennox was away finally he called barbara to find out when he would be back she gave him a date a week later meantime he had been trying desperately to reach lakshmi by phone he even left messages with ramu to try to contact her he needed to speak to her urgently in the end he wrote her a long carefullyworded letter in it he told her that his divorce from sally had finally come through he asked her to marry him when he had written it dick walked down towards the sea to post it a light summer drizzle had started to fall and the late afternoon holidaymakers were packing up their things and leaving the beach for the shelter of their hotels dick felt a sudden uneasy feeling that things were not well with lakshmi finally he got through to lennox who reluctantly agreed to meet him at his club the united services in piccadilly the following monday evening you enter the united services up a flight of stone steps and through a dark entrance hall the porter told dick that mr lennox was in the reading room on the first floor when dick entered the dark highceilinged room he saw lennox sitting in a large leather armchair by the window reading the times they greeted each other coldly this was the first time they had met since the interview in delhi four years earlier dick had travelled a long hard road since then but now the advantage was with him or so he thought lennox had not changed much his sandy hair had thinned a little he still wore a small toothbrush moustache which he pulled at nervously from time to time his eyes were still the same watery blue colour but he had developed the unpleasant habit of clearing his throat each time he spoke as if to emphasise the importance of what he was saying this was new but his way of dressing had not changed much still the dark pinstriped suit and the white shirt with red stripes worn with a club tie he was the very picture of a respectable selfimportant boring business executive so hm what exactly did you wish to see me about im afraid hm i cant give you more than half an hour hm i have hm an important dinner to attend it wont take long i wonder if youve heard from your friends the visvanathans recently lennox gave him a venomous look and plucked at his moustache you never give up do you i advised you hm four years ago to leave it alone you didnt hm take my advice and you lost your job isnt that enough oh more than enough in fact it was too much but you havent answered my question have you heard from your dear friends as a matter of fact hm i did have a call from them a day or two ago they hm mentioned hm that they had met you in madras and did they also mention that they tried to kill me hm i hardly think they would do anything like that oh no not even if i had proof of their involvement in a major financial scandal hm i dont know what youre hm referring to what hm financial scandal ok let me spell it out for you in before barbara came out to join you in madras you had an affair with molly verghese as she then was she became pregnant with your child you somehow persuaded her to go to the uk for a year and have the baby you also seem to have been able to persuade sir percy hancock to agree to the leave since then you have been paying for the education of the child pretending his parents were dead you have also been blackmailed by the visvanathans who would have revealed what they knew unless you kept your mouth shut about all their dishonest schemes you knew your career and your marriage would have been finished if they had told what they knew you knew how strong the prejudice was against mixed relationships you would have done anything to keep it quiet in fact you did do many things including getting rid of me ned outram nagarajan and goodness knows how many others you couldnt risk my finding out any more about the hosur factory construction deal because that was a really big one i dont know whether you took any of the cash yourself but the visvanathans certainly did well out of it and you knew all about it but you kept quiet anything to protect your precious reputation lennoxs pale face had now gone almost grey he pulled incessantly at his moustache he cleared his throat again now look here hm i cant have you accusing me of this kind of thing hm ill hm take you to court before you do that i suggest you take a look at this said dick quietly and handed him a large brown envelope you dont have to look at it now take your time youll find it makes very interesting reading i wouldnt leave it around for barbara to find though i have the originals of all these documents i think youll find that there is enough there to put you in jail for a nice long time whats more it would ruin your marriage and respectable reputation i am hm well aware of the contents of your hm envelope but i advise you hm for your own safety hm to destroy the originals and hm forget about the whole thing its hm past history your friends have already tried to kill me twice im not frightened by your threats and as you will know from your friends if anything happens to me a set of these documents will go straight to the chairman of the board ive also arranged for a set to go to barbara and another set to the daily mail so think twice before you threaten me you miserable bastard so hm what do you hm propose to do now lennox was now sweating heavily its up to you youve just been offered a knighthood i believe i want you to refuse it then i want you to resign from the company finally i want you to pay one hundred thousand pounds each to nagarajan and ned outram if you refuse i shall send out the documents you decide ill call you tomorrow morning in your office just say yes or no good night and do enjoy your hm dinner chapter seventeen in gods hands things moved quickly after that the same evening after he had returned to hove dick managed to get through to lakshmi at last she told him that her father had died of a heart attack a week earlier she sounded quite calm but dick desperately wanted to be with her lakshmi im so sorry i feel helpless here i want to be with you to help you its all right dick please dont worry my father was already dead inside it may be better for him like this perhaps he is with my mother again dont worry about me i can manage as long as i know you are there did you get my letter lakshmi will you marry me yes i did dick and i do want to marry you now my father is dead there is nothing to keep me here but im still worried about your thoughts of revenge how can you hurt that poor innocent woman or the son john they have done nothing to you i want you to give up the idea i dont think i could marry a man who would do that please think about it and tell me what you decide i couldnt live with a man who did a thing like that but lakshmi i have lennox where i want him hes trapped how can i give up now he deserves it and so do the visvanathans cant you understand dick i can understand but i cant agree i told you before we should leave judgement to god people like that are punished by what they become leave it at that and dont make innocent people suffer im sorry dick thats my last word if you go ahead with this i cant see you again the line was suddenly cut dick was not sure whether it was the indian telecommunications or whether lakshmi had put down the telephone on him he repeatedly tried to call again but every time the number rang with the engaged tone he went to bed in a confusion of doubt and uncertainty how could she be so obstinate even her own father had been destroyed by these bastards couldnt she see that but she obviously meant what she said yet how could he live without her now he could not imagine a life which did not include her it was three in the morning before he finally fell into an uneasy sleep and when he woke his mind was still confused about what to do the next morning he called lennox the answers no i wont hm give in to blackmail ok i gave you the choice you know what the consequences will be good bye in the afternoon he called barbara lennox and asked if he could visit her briefly the next day he told her he had a small packet for her which he had forgotten the last time she told him she would be at home in the afternoon and to come for tea later that evening he received a call from ramu dick did you get my letter i have not been hearing from you so i am asking myself is something wrong no nothing wrong ramu but i havent had any letter from you whats it about is everything ok with you yes fine but i wrote to you about our business deal please let me know what you think of my idea as soon as possible its too complicated to talk about on the phone but we need to make a decision very soon this is the right time dick i must ring off now please call me when you get my letter take care dick replaced the receiver thoughtfully so ramu had been serious about them becoming business partners he went down to the mail box there among the junk mail and the bills was ramus letter he took it upstairs poured himself a glass of wine and sat down to read it dear dick i want to ask you if you have thought any more about my business proposal now that the regulations on foreign investment have been relaxed there are lots of opportunities for us id really like you to go into partnership with me ive enclosed all the details please have a look at them carefully and let me know as soon as possible now is the time so that we are first in the market before other people get the same idea if we dont do it now well lose our advantage also if i have understood properly you might wish to spend more time in india now perhaps with a certain young lady you know that madras is the gossip capital of the world isnt it if you are needing best man i am always willing to oblige with my good wishes to you as always yours ramu the next morning dick took the train to london on the way up he thought back over everything especially lakshmis threat not to marry him if he carried out his plan surely she could not be serious but he remembered how upset she had been the last time it made him angry to think of the way nagarajan had become and of his death his mind went back to the miserable life ned was leading in bath he thought about the way his own career had been ruined why should these criminals lennox vish and molly be allowed to go free it was impossible to let them go he would have to do what he had decided even if lakshmi disapproved this time he took a taxi to barnes he was surprised when barbara opened the door to him she was in tears her hair was uncombed and it looked as if she had slept in her clothes please come in she said in a shaky voice i dont know whats wrong with me but i cant stop crying ive been like this since yesterday i cant seem to concentrate on anything my head is full of terrible thoughts i cant sleep i cant eat it makes me feel sick even to think of food my hands keep trembling im terribly sorry about all this im so ashamed to be crying like this i dont know if i can even make you tea my hands are shaking so much its terrible to feel like this every way i turn there is another black thought i feel trapped in my own life there is no escape do you understand what im trying to say oh no нow could you i must seem like just another one of those hysterical middleaged women you read about in the newspaper but this is real i thought i was walking on solid earth and now i am falling down a deep black hole nothing is solid any more my life has fallen to pieces i was living in a dream now im locked in a nightmare im sorry i need to sit down he sat her down in the kitchen and made tea for her he tried to comfort her and to find out what had caused her breakdown the cup of tea seemed to calm her nerves she stopped crying and began to talk more coherently im sorry to be like this she said but i have to talk to someone i cant keep it all inside me any longer i feel as if i was going to explode please just listen and tell me if you think im mad i suppose ive had india on my mind since your last visit it brought back memories of the time when keith and i first went out there all those years ago i kept remembering scenes from our life in madras i have a very good memory and the looks on peoples faces snatches of conversations at parties started to come back to me there was something worrying me but i couldnt put my finger on what it was until last night keith didnt come home last night he had an important dinner and decided to stay at his club he often does that so im used to it anyway there was nothing interesting on the tv so i started to look at our old photograph albums it was the thoughts of india that started me off i think so there i was looking at all those photographs parties receptions birthdays picnics at the beach hill stations the taj mahal you know and still there was this something worrying me a vague thought at the back of my mind she paused to blow her nose i realised that one of our albums wasnt there so i started to look for it after id looked everywhere else i wondered whether it might be in keiths study i dont know what made me think of that i dont usually go in there when he isnt here but i went in this time and sure enough there it was under a pile of papers on his desk i couldnt think what he wanted it for maybe he had been thinking about the old days too goodness knows why but as i took it from the desk an envelope fell on the floor the handwriting looked familiar i picked it up inside there was just one photograph i had never seen it before here it is she passed dick a yellowing black and white photograph he realised with a shock that he had seen it before it was the photograph of molly and keith which ned had sent him it was obvious that they were in love with each other but in case there was any doubt molly had written on the back for my darling keith our unforgettable day and night with all my love molly she had also written the date he silently handed the photograph back to barbara how stupid i have been she moaned starting to cry again i should have realised there was something strange going on but you know sometimes you just dont notice what is right in front of your eyes look at the date that was a month before i went out to india to join keith they were lovers i cant believe it but they were lovers she broke down in tears again then i began to think of all the other suspicious things that had happened molly going to england so suddenly to look after an old uncle then john becoming one of the family my god he certainly was one of the family and i realised why keith had prevented john from marrying jane and somehow i simply didnt suspect anything thats the terrible thing but the worst thing is not that they were lovers i would have forgiven keith that i loved him you know in fact i still love him thats what is breaking me up no i would have been able to forgive him but the worst thing was that they went on fooling me for over twenty years and i was blind to it all how could i have been so blind so stupid and as i went on thinking scenes came back to me looks exchanged embarrassing silences it all added up what is it that makes us so trusting so easy to deceive i realised that my life with keith the life of secure happiness had been based on a lie it wasnt what i thought it was at all and my nerves snapped and now look at me im over my marriage is in ruins and i have noone to help me noone i thought of killing myself you know last night i got up and went into the kitchen i closed the windows and the door and turned on the gas in the oven but then i realised i couldnt do it i cant bear to live but i havent got the courage to kill myself what am i going to do how can i face keith now oh my god her shoulders shook as she began to cry again she was clearly in a state of shock dick felt powerless to do anything yet he could not simply walk away and leave her he looked at this pathetic woman and realised that he could not add to her suffering by giving her the packet he had brought he remembered his own breakdown and the agony he had suffered she needed help and quickly he persuaded her to lie down on the sofa in the lounge and called her local doctor he explained that she was in shock and needed urgent attention two hours later the doctor arrived and gave her a sedative to help her sleep a nurse arrived shortly afterwards to attend to barbara dick explained briefly what had happened and asked the nurse to call keith lennox and to ask him to return home at once when dick left the house barbara was fast asleep he could do no more keith would now have to face the problem he had created lakshmi had been right people are punished by what they become he walked back to hammersmith deep in thought what had lakshmi said god arranges punishment we should leave it to him it seemed that she was right after all he decided to call her as soon as he got home tomorrow he would book a seat on the first plane to madras there was a future after all he stopped in the middle of putney bridge and looked down at the thames swirling below taking out the envelope he tore it open and dropped the contents page by page into the water they floated gently down and were carried swiftly away on the current enough was enough postscript dick is sitting under a raintree in the large garden of his house in a suburb of bangalore it is teatime lakshmi joins him carrying their twoyearold daughter rukmini their fiveyearold son arjun will soon be back from school dicks partnership with ramu has done very well they now have offices in madras bangalore bombay and delhi their services are in great demand among overseas companies planning to set up in india life is good for them it has not been so good for some other people barbara somehow managed to repair her marriage with keith but disaster of another kind hit them in trakton collapsed under heavy debts keith was arrested in london for misusing company funds after a long trial widely reported in the newspapers he was sentenced to three years in jail he comes out next year people who know barbara and keith well say that he is now a broken man last year vish and molly met with a serious accident they were driving into town from their beach house when their car ran into a water lorry vish is now severely braindamaged he cannot talk and spends his days in a darkened room molly was luckier she could walk but she went through the windscreen of the car her face was so badly cut that she has permanent scars not even plastic surgeons could help it seems she never goes anywhere nowadays lakshmi goes back to the house to fetch arjun as he sips his tea dick thinks again of her wise words we should leave punishment to god dick felt eternally grateful that he had not tried to play god god was definitely better at it than him the end
