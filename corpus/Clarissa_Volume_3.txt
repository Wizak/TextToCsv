clarissa harlowe letter i miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe tuesday nine oclock i write because you enjoin me to do so love you still how can i help it if i would you may believe how i stand aghast your letter communicating the first news good god of heaven and earth but what shall i say i am all impatient for particulars lord have mercy upon me but can it be my mother will indeed be astonished how can i tell it her it was but last night upon some jealousies put into her head by your foolish uncle that i assured her and this upon the strength of your own assurances that neither man nor devil would be able to induce you to take a step that was in the least derogatory to the most punctilious honour but once more can it be what woman at this rate but god preserve you let nothing escape you in your letters direct them for me however to mrs knollys till further notice observe my dear that i dont blame you by all this your relations only are in fault yet how you came to change your mind is the surprising thing how to break it to my mother i know not yet if she hear it first from any other and find i knew it before she will believe it to be my connivance yet as i hope to live i know not how to break it to her but this is teasing you i am sure without intention let me now repeat my former advice if you are not married by this time be sure delay not the ceremony since things are as they are i wish it were thought that you were privately married before you went away if these men plead authority to our pain when we are theirs why should we not in such a case as this make some good out of the hated word for our reputation when we are induced to violate a more natural one your brother and sister that vexes me almost as much as any thing have now their ends now i suppose will go forward alterations of wills and suchlike spiteful doings miss lloyd and miss biddulph this moment send up their names they are out of breath kitty says to speak to me easy to guess their errand i must see my mother before i see them i have no way but to shew her your letter to clear myself i shall not be able to say a word till she has run herself out of her first breath forgive me my dear surprise makes me write thus if your messenger did not wait and were not those young ladies below i could write it over again for fear of afflicting you i send what you write for if there be any thing else you want that is in my power command without reserve your ever affectionate anna howe letter ii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe tuesday night i think myself obliged to thank you my dear miss howe for your condescension in taking notice of a creature who has occasioned you so much scandal i am grieved on this account as much i verily think as for the evil itself tell me but yet i am afraid to know what your mother said i long and yet i dread to be told what the young ladies my companions now never more perhaps to be so say of me they cannot however say worse of me than i will of myself self accusation shall flow in every line of my narrative where i think i am justly censurable if any thing can arise from the account i am going to give you for extenuation of my fault for that is all a person can hope for who cannot excuse herself i know i may expect it from your friendship though not from the charity of any other since by this time i doubt not every mouth is opened against me and all that know clarissa harlowe condemn the fugitive daughter after i had deposited my letter to you written down to the last hour as i may say i returned to the ivy summerhouse first taking back my letter from the loose bricks and there i endeavoured as coolly as my situation would permit to recollect and lay together several incidents that had passed between my aunt and me and comparing them with some of the contents of my cousin dollys letter i began to hope that i needed not to be so very apprehensive as i have been next wednesday and thus i argued with myself wednesday cannot possibly be the day they intend although to intimidate me they may wish me to think it is for the settlements are unsigned nor have they been offered me to sign i can choose whether i will or will not put my hand to them hard as it will be to refuse if my father and mother propose if i made compulsion necessary to go to my uncles themselves in order to be out of the way of my appeals whereas they intend to be present on wednesday and however affecting to me the thought of meeting them and all my friends in full assembly is perhaps it is the very thing i ought to wish for since my brother and sister had such an opinion of my interest in them that they got me excluded from their presence as a measure which they thought previously necessary to carry on their designs nor have i reason to doubt but that as i had before argued with myself i shall be able to bring over some of my relations to my party and being brought face to face with my brother that i shall expose his malevolence and of consequence weaken his power then supposing the very worst challenging the minister as i shall challenge him he will not presume to proceed nor surely will mr solmes dare to accept my refusing and struggling hand and finally if nothing else will do nor procure me delay i can plead scruples of conscience and even pretend prior obligation for my dear i have give mr lovelace room to hope as you will see in one of my letters in your hands that i will be no other mans while he is single and gives me not wilful and premeditated cause of offence against him and this in order to reinin his resentment on the declared animosity of my brother and uncles to him and as i shall appeal or refer my scruples on this head to the good dr lewen it is impossible but that my mother and aunt if nobody else must be affected with this plea revolving cursorily these things i congratulated myself that i had resolved against going away with mr lovelace i told you my dear that i would not spare myself and i enumerate these particulars as so many arguments to condemn the actions i have been so unhappily betrayed into an argument that concludes against me with the greater force as i must acknowledge that i was apprehensive that what my cousin dolly mentions as from betty and from my sister who told her that she should tell me in order to make me desperate and perhaps to push me upon some such step as i have been driven to take as the most effectual means to ruin me with my father and uncles god forgive me if i judge too harshly of their views but if i do not it follows that they laid a wicked snare for me and that i have been caught in it and now they triumph if they can triumph in the ruin of a sister who never wished or intended to hurt them as the above kind of reasoning had lessened my apprehensions as to the wednesday it added to those i had of meeting mr lovelace now as it seemed not only the nearest but the heaviest evil principally indeed because nearest for little did i dream foolish creature that i was and every way beset of the event proving what it has proved i expected a contention with him tis true as he had not my letter but i thought it would be very strange as i mentioned in one of my former if i who had so steadily held out against characters so venerable against authorities so sacred as i may say when i thought them unreasonably exerted should not find myself more equal to such a trial as this especially as i had so much reason to be displeased with him for not having taken away my letter on what a point of time may ones worldly happiness depend had i but two hours more to consider of the matter and to attend to and improve upon these new lights as i may call them but even then perhaps i might have given him a meeting fool that i was what had i to do to give him hope that i would personally acquaint him with the reason for my change of mind if i did change it o my dear an obliging temper is a very dangerous temper by endeavouring to gratify others it is evermore disobliging itself when the bell rang to call the servants to dinner betty came to me and asked if i had any commands before she went to hers repeating her hint that she should be employed adding that she believed it was expected that i should not come up till she came down or till i saw my aunt or miss hervey i asked her some questions about the cascade which had been out of order and lately mended and expressed a curiosity to see how it played in order to induce her how cunning to cheat myself as it proved to go thither if she found me not where she left me it being a part of the garden most distant from the ivy summerhouse she could hardly have got into the house when i heard the first signal o how my heart fluttered but no time was to be lost i stept to the gardendoor and seeing a clear coast unbolted the alreadyunlocked door and there was he all impatience waiting for me a panic next to fainting seized me when i saw him my heart seemed convulsed and i trembled so that i should hardly have kept my feet had he not supported me fear nothing dearest creature said he let us hasten away the chariot is at hand and by this sweet condescension you have obliged me beyond expression or return recovering my spirits a little as he kept drawing me after him o mr lovelace said i i cannot go with you indeed i cannot i wrote you word so let go my hand and you shall see my letter it is lain there from yesterday morning till within this halfhour i bid you watch to the last for a letter from me lest i should be obliged to revoke the appointment and had you followed the direction you would have found it i have been watched my dearest life said he half out of breath i have been watched in every step i took and my trusty servant has been watched too ever since saturday and dared not to come near your wall and here we shall be discovered in a moment speed away my charmer this is the moment of your deliverance if you neglect this opportunity you can never have such another what is it you mean sir let go my hand for i tell you struggling vehemently that i will sooner die than go with you good god said he with a look of wildness and surprise what is it i hear but still drawing me after him as he retreated farther from the door it is no time to argue by all thats good you must go surely you cannot doubt my honour nor give me cause to question your own as you value me mr lovelace urge me no farther i come fixed and resolved let me give you the letter i have written my further reasons shall follow and they will convince you that i ought not to go nothing madam can convince me by all thats sacred i will not leave you to leave you now would be to lose you for ever am i to be thus compelled interrupted i with equal indignation and vehemence let go my hands i am resolved not to go with you and i will convince you that i ought not all my friends expect you madam all your own are determined against you wednesday next is the day the important perhaps the fatal day would you stay to be solmess wife can this be your determination at last no never never will i be that mans but i will not go with you draw me not thus how dare you sir i would not have seen you but to tell you so i had not met you but for fear you would have been guilty of some rashness and once more i will not go what mean you striving with all my force to get from him what can have possessed my angel said he quitting my hands and with a gentler voice that after so much illusage from your relations vows so solemn on my part an affection so ardent you stab me with a refusal to stand by your own appointment we have no time to talk mr lovelace i will give you my reasons at a better opportunity i cannot go with you now and once more urge me no farther surely i am not to be compelled by every body i see how it is said he with a dejected but passionate air what a severe fate is mine at length your spirit is subdued your brother and sister have prevailed and i must give up all my hopes to a wretch so truly despicable once more i tell you interrupted i i never will be his all may end on wednesday differently from what you expect and it may not and then good heavens it is to be their last effort as i have reason to believe and i have reason to believe so too since if you stay you will inevitably be solmess wife not so interrupted i i have obliged them in one point they will be in goodhumour with me i shall gain time at least i am sure i shall i have several ways to gain time and what madam will gaining time do it is plain you have not a hope beyond that it is plain you have not by putting all upon that precarious issue o my dearest dearest life let me beseech you not to run a risque of this consequence i can convince you that it will be more than a risque if you go back that you will on wednesday next be solmess wife prevent therefore now that it is in your power to prevent the fatal mischief that will follow such a dreadful certainty while i have any room for hope it concerns your honour mr lovelace as well as mine if you have the value for me you pretend and wish me to believe you that my conduct in this great point should justify my prudence your prudence madam when has that been questionable yet what stead has either your prudence or your duty stood you in with people so strangely determined and then he pathetically enumerated the different instances of the harsh treatment i had met with imputing all to the malice and caprice of a brother who set every body against him and insisting that i had no other way to bring about a reconciliation with my father and uncles than by putting myself out of the power of my brothers inveterate malice your brothers whole reliance proceeded he has been upon your easiness to bear his insults your whole family will seek to you when you have freed yourself from this disgraceful oppression when they know you are with those who can and will right you they will give up to you your own estate why then putting his arms around me and again drawing me with a gentle force after him do you hesitate a moment now is the time fly with me then i beseech you my dearest creature trust your persecuted adorer have we not suffered in the same cause if any imputations are cast upon you give me the honour as i shall be found to deserve it to call you mine and when you are so shall i not be able to protect both your person and character urge me no more mr lovelace i conjure you you yourself have given me a hint which i will speak plainer to than prudence perhaps on any other occasion would allow i am convinced that wednesday next if i had time i would give you my reasons is not intended to be the day we had both so much dreaded and if after that day shall be over i find my friends determined in mr solmess favour i will then contrive some way to meet you with miss howe who is not your enemy and when the solemnity has passed i shall think that step a duty which till then will be criminal to take since now my fathers authority is unimpeached by any greater dearest madam nay mr lovelace if you now dispute if after this more favourable declaration than i had the thought of making you are not satisfied i shall know what to think both of your gratitude and generosity the case madam admits not of this alternative i am all gratitude upon it i cannot express how much i should be delighted with the charming hope you have given me were you not next wednesday if you stay to be another mans think dearest creature what an heightening of my anguish the distant hope you bid me look up to is taken in this light depend depend upon it i will die sooner than be mr solmess if you would have me rely upon your honour why should you doubt of mine i doubt not your honour madam your power is all i doubt you never never can have such another opportunity dearest creature permit me and he was again drawing me after him whither sir do you draw me leave me this moment do you seek to keep me till my return shall grow dangerous or impracticable this moment let me go if you would have me think tolerably of you my happiness madam both here and hereafter and the safety of all your implacable family depend upon this moment to providence mr lovelace and to the law will i leave the safety of my friends you shall not threaten me into a rashness that my heart condemns shall i to promote your happiness as you call it depend upon future peace of mind you trifle with me my dear life just as our better prospects begin to open the way is clear just now it is clear but you may be prevented in a moment what is it you doubt may i perish eternally if your will shall not be a law to me in every thing all my relations expect you next wednesday dearest creature think of next wednesday and to what is it i urge you but to take a step that sooner than any other will reconcile you to all whom you have most reason to value in your family let my judge for myself sir do not you who blame my friends for endeavouring to compel me yourself seek to compel i wont bear it your earnestness gives me greater apprehensions and greater reluctance let me go back then let me before it is too late go back that it may not be worse for both what mean you by this forcible treatment is it thus that i am to judge of the entire submission to my will which you have so often vowed unhand me this moment or i will cry out for help i will obey you my dearest creature and quitted my hand with a look full of tender despondency that knowing the violence of his temper halfconcerned me for him yet i was hastening from him when with a solemn air looking upon his sword but catching as it were his hand from it he folded both his arms as if a sudden thought had recovered him from an intended rashness stay one moment but one moment stay o best beloved of my soul your retreat is secure if you will go the key lies at the door but o madam next wednesday and you are mr solmess fly me not so eagerly hear me but a few words when near the gardendoor i stopped and was the more satisfied as i saw the key there by which i could let myself in again at pleasure but being uneasy lest i should be missed i told him i could stay no longer i had already staid too long i would write to him all my reasons and depend upon it mr lovelace said i just upon the point of stooping for the key in order to return i will die rather than have that man you know what i have promised if i find myself in danger one word madam however one word more approaching me his arms still folded as if i thought he would not be tempted to mischief remember only that i come at your appointment to redeem you at the hazard of my life from your gaolers and persecutors with a resolution god is my witness or may he for ever blast me that was his shocking imprecation to be a father uncle brother and as i humbly hoped in your own good time a husband to you all in one but since i find you are so ready to cry out for help against me which must bring down upon me the vengeance of all your family i am contented to run all risques i will not ask you to retreat with me i will attend you into the garden and into the house if i am not intercepted nay be not surprised madam the help you would have called for i will attend you to for i will face them all but not as a revenger if they provoke me not too much you shall see what i can further bear for your sake and let us both see if expostulation and the behaviour of a gentleman to them will not procure me the treatment due to a gentleman from them had he offered to draw his sword upon himself i was prepared to have despised him for supposing me such a poor novice as to be intimidated by an artifice so common but this resolution uttered with so serious an air of accompanying me in to my friends made me gasp with terror what mean you mr lovelace said i i beseech you leave me leave me sir i beseech you excuse me madam i beg you to excuse me i have long enough skulked like a thief about these lonely walls long too long have i borne the insults of your brother and other of your relations absence but heightens malice i am desperate i have but this one chance for it for is not the day after tomorrow wednesday i have encouraged virulence by my tameness yet tame i will still be you shall see madam what i will bear for your sake my sword shall be put sheathed into your hands and he offered it to me in the scabbard my heart if you please clapping one hand upon his breast shall afford a sheath for your brothers sword life is nothing if i lose you be pleased madam to shew me the way into the garden moving toward the door i will attend you though to my fate but too happy be it what it will if i receive it in your presence lead on dear creature putting his sword into his belt you shall see what i can bear for you and he stooped and took up the key and offered it to the lock but dropped it again without opening the door upon my earnest expostulations what can you mean mr lovelace said i would you thus expose yourself would you thus expose me is this your generosity is every body to take advantage thus of the weakness of my temper and i wept i could not help it he threw himself upon his knees at my feet who can bear said he with an ardour that could not be feigned his own eyes glistening who can bear to behold such sweet emotion o charmer of my heart and respectfully still kneeling he took my hand with both his pressing it to his lips command me with you command me from you in every way i am implicit to obedience but i appeal to all you know of your relations cruelty to you their determined malice against me and as determined favour to the man you tell me you hate and o madam if you did not hate him i should hardly think there would be a merit in your approbation place it where you would i appeal to every thing you know to all you have suffered whether you have not reason to be apprehensive of that wednesday which is my terror whether you can possibly have another opportunity the chariot ready my friends with impatience expecting the result of your own appointment a man whose will shall be entirely your will imploring you thus on his knees imploring you to be your own mistress that is all nor will i ask for your favour but as upon full proof i shall appear to deserve it fortune alliance unobjectionable o my beloved creature pressing my hand once more to his lips let not such an opportunity slip you never never will have such another i bid him rise he arose and i told him that were i not thus unaccountably hurried by his impatience i doubted not to convince him that both he and i had looked upon next wednesday with greater apprehension than was necessary i was proceeding to give him my reasons but he broke in upon me had i madam but the shadow of a probability to hope what you hope i would be all obedience and resignation but the license is actually got the parson is provided the pedant brand is the man o my dearest creature do these preparations mean only a trial you know not sir were the worst to be intended and weak as you think me what a spirit i have you know not what i can do and how i can resist when i think myself meanly or unreasonably dealt with nor do you know what i have already suffered what i have already borne knowing to whose unbrotherly instigations all is to be ascribed i may expect all things madam interrupted he from the nobleness of your mind but your spirits may fail you what may not be apprehended from the invincible temper of a father so positive to a daughter so dutiful fainting will not save you they will not perhaps be sorry for such an effect of their barbarity what will signify expostulations against a ceremony performed must not all the dreadful all follow that is torture to my heart but to think of nobody to appeal to of what avail will your resistance be against the consequences of a rite witnessed to by the imposers of it and those your nearest relations i was sure i said of procuring a delay at least many ways i had to procure a delay nothing could be so fatal to us both as for me now to be found with him my apprehensions on this score i told him grew too strong for my heart i should think very hardly of him if he sought to detain me longer but his acquiescence should engage my gratitude and then stooping to take up the key to let myself into the garden he started and looked as if he had heard somebody near the door on the inside clapping his hand on his sword this frighted me so that i thought i should have sunk down at his feet but he instantly reassured me he thought he said he had heard a rustling against the door but had it been so the noise would have been stronger it was only the effect of his apprehension for me and then taking up the key he presented it to me if you will go madam yet i cannot cannot leave you i must enter the garden with you forgive me but i must enter the garden with you and will you will you thus ungenerously mr lovelace take advantage of my fears of my wishes to prevent mischief i vain fool to be concerned for every one nobody for me dearest creature interrupted he holding my hand as i tremblingly offered to put the key to the lock let me if you will go open the door but once more consider could you possibly obtain that delay which seems to be your only dependence whether you may not be closer confined i know they have already had that in consideration will you not in this case be prevented from corresponding either with miss howe or with me who then shall assist you in your escape if escape you would from your chamberwindow only permitted to view the garden you must not enter into how will you wish for the opportunity you now have if your hatred to solmes continue but alas that cannot continue if you go back it must be from the impulses of a yielding which youll call a dutiful heart tired and teased out of your own will i have no patience sir to be thus constrained must i never be at liberty to follow my own judgment be the consequence what it may i will not be thus constrained and then freeing my hand i again offered the key to the door down the ready kneeler dropt between me and that and can you can you madam once more on my knees let me ask you look with an indifferent eye upon the evils that may follow provoked as i have been and triumphed over as i shall be if your brother succeeds my own heart shudders at times at the thoughts of what must happen and can yours be unconcerned let me beseech you dearest creature to consider all these things and lose not this only opportunity my intelligence never mr lovelace interrupted i give so much credit to the words of a traitor your base intelligencer is but a servant he may pretend to know more than he has grounds for in order to earn the wages of corruption you know not what contrivances i can find out i was once more offering the key to the lock when starting from his knees with a voice of affrightment loudly whispering and as if out of breath they are at the door my beloved creature and taking the key from me he fluttered with it as if he would double lock it and instantly a voice from within cried out bursting against the door as if to break it open the person repeating his violent pushes are you there come up this moment this moment here they are here they are both together your pistol this moment your gun then another push and another he at the same moment drew his sword and clapping it naked under his arm took both my trembling hands in his and drawing me swiftly after him fly fly my charmer this moment is all you have for it said he your brother your uncles or this solmes they will instantly burst the door fly my dearest life if you would not be more cruelly used than ever if you would not see two or three murders committed at your feet fly fly i beseech you o lord help help cried the fool all in amaze and confusion frighted beyond the power of controuling now behind me now before me now on this side now on that turned i my affrighted face in the same moment expecting a furious brother here armed servants there an enraged sister screaming and a father armed with terror in his countenance more dreadful than even the drawn sword which i saw or those i apprehended i ran as fast as he yet knew not that i ran my fears adding wings to my feet at the same time that they took all power of thinking from me my fears which probably would not have suffered me to know what course to take had i not had him to urge and draw me after him especially as i beheld a man who must have come out of the door keeping us in his eye running now towards us then back to the garden beckoning and calling to others whom i supposed he saw although the turning of the wall hindered me from seeing them and whom i imagined to be my brother my father and their servants thus terrified i was got out of sight of the door in a very few minutes and then although quite breathless between running and apprehension he put my arm under his his drawn sword in the other hand and hurried me on still faster my voice however contradicting my action crying no no no all the while straining my neck to look back as long as the walls of the garden and park were within sight and till he brought me to the chariot where attending were two armed servants of his own and two of lord ms on horseback here i must suspend my relation for a while for now i am come to this sad period of it my indiscretion stares me in the face and my shame and my grief give me a compunction that is more poignant methinks than if i had a dagger in my heart to have it to reflect that i should so inconsiderately give in to an interview which had i known either myself or him or in the least considered the circumstances of the case i might have supposed would put me into the power of his resolution and out of that of my own reason for might i not have believed that he who thought he had cause to apprehend that he was on the point of losing a person who had cost him so much pains and trouble would not hinder her if possible from returning that he who knew i had promised to give him up for ever if insisted as a condition of reconciliation would not endeavour to put it out of my power to do so in short that he who had artfully forborne to send for my letter for he could not be watched my dear lest he should find in it a countermand to my appointment as i myself could apprehend although i profited by the apprehension would want a device to keep me with him till the danger of having our meeting discovered might throw me absolutely into his power to avoid my own worse usage and the mischiefs which might have ensued perhaps in my very sight had my friends and he met but if it shall come out that the person within the garden was his corrupted implement employed to frighten me away with him do you think my dear that i shall not have reason to hate him and myself still more i hope his heart cannot be so deep and so vile a one i hope it cannot but how came it to pass that one man could get out at the gardendoor and no more how that that man kept aloof as it were and pursued us not nor ran back to alarm the house my fright and my distance would not let me be certain but really this man as i now recollect had the air of that vile joseph leman o why why my dear friends but wherefore blame i them when i had argued myself into a hope not improbable that even the dreadful trial i was to undergo so soon might turn out better than if i had been directly carried away from the presence of my once indulgent parents who might possibly intend that trial to be the last i should have had would to heaven that i had stood it however then if i had afterwards done what now i have been prevailed upon or perhaps foolishly frightened to do i should not have been stung so much by inward reproach as now i am and this would have been a great evil avoided you know my dear that your clarissas mind was ever above justifying her own failings by those of others god forgive those of my friends who have acted cruelly by me but their faults are their own and not excuses for mine and mine began early for i ought not to have corresponded with him o the vile encroacher how my indignation at times rises at him thus to lead a young creature too much indeed relying upon her own strength from evil to evil this last evil although the remote yet sure consequence of my first my prohibited correspondence by a father early prohibited how much more properly had i acted with regard to that correspondence had i once for all when he was forbidden to visit me and i to receive his visits pleaded the authority by which i ought to have been bound and denied to write to him but i thought i could proceed or stop as i pleased i supposed it concerned me more than any other to be the arbitress of the quarrels of unruly spirits and now i find my presumption punished punished as other sins frequently are by itself as to this last rashness now that it is too late i plainly see how i ought to have conducted myself as he knew i had but one way of transmitting to him the knowledge of what befel me as he knew that my fate was upon a crisis with my friends and that i had in my letter to him reserved the liberty of revocation i should not have been solicitous whether he had got my letter or not when he had come and found i did not answer to his signal he would presently have resorted to the loose bricks and there been satisfied by the date of my letter that it was his own fault that he had it not before but governed by the same pragmatical motives which induced me to correspond with him at first i was again afraid truly with my foolish and busy prescience and the disappointment would have thrown him into the way of receiving fresh insults from the same persons which might have made him guilty of some violence to them and so to save him an apprehended rashness i rushed into a real one myself and what vexes me more is that it is plain to me now by all his behaviour that he had as great a confidence in my weakness as i had in my own strength and so in a point entirely relative to my honour he has triumphed for he has not been mistaken in me while i have in myself tell me my dear miss howe tell me truly if your unbiassed heart does not despise me it must for your mind and mine were ever one and i despise myself and well i may for could the giddiest and most inconsiderate girl in england have done worse than i shall appear to have done in the eye of the world since my crime will be known without the provocations and without the artifices of the betrayer too while it will be a high aggravation that better things were expected from me than from many others you charge me to marry the first opportunity ah my dear another of the blessed effects of my folly thats as much in my power now as as i am myself and can i besides give a sanction immediately to his deluding arts can i avoid being angry with him for tricking me thus as i may say and as i have called it to him out of myself for compelling me to take a step so contrary to all my resolutions and assurances given to you a step so dreadfully inconvenient to myself so disgraceful and so grievous as it must be to my dear mother were i to be less regardful of any other of my family or friends you dont know nor can you imagine my dear how i am mortified how much i am sunk in my own opinion i that was proposed for an example truly to others o that i were again in my fathers house stealing down with a letter to you my heart beating with expectation of finding one from you this is the wednesday morning i dreaded so much that i once thought of it as the day of my doom but of the monday it is plain i ought to have been most apprehensive had i staid and had the worst i dreaded happened my friends would then have been answerable for the consequences if any bad ones had followed but now i have only this consolation left me a very poor one youll say that i have cleared them of blame and taken it all upon myself you will not wonder to see this narrative so dismally scrawled it is owing to different pens and ink all bad and written in snatches of time my hand trembling too with fatigue and grief i will not add to the length of it by the particulars of his behaviour to me and of our conversation at st albans and since because those will come in course in the continuation of my story which no doubt you will expect from me only thus much will i say that he is extremely respectful even obsequiously so at present though i am so much dissatisfied with him and myself that he has hitherto had no great cause to praise my complaisance to him indeed i can hardly at times bear the seducer in my sight the lodgings i am in are inconvenient i shall not stay in them so it signifies nothing to tell you how to direct to me hither and where my next may be as yet i know not he knows that i am writing to you and has offered to send my letter when finished by a servant of his but i thought i could not be too cautious as i am now situated in having a letter of this importance conveyed to you who knows what such a man may do so very wicked a contriver the contrivance if a contrivance to get me away so insolently mean but i hope it is not a contrivance neither yet be that as it will i must say that the best of him and of my prospects with him are bad and yet having enrolled myself among the toolate repenters who shall pity me nevertheless i will dare to hope for a continued interest in your affections i shall be miserable indeed if i may not and to be remembered in your daily prayers for neither time nor accident shall ever make me cease to be your faithful and affectionate clarissa harlowe letter iii mr lovelace to joseph leman sat april honest joseph at length your beloved young lady has consented to free herself from the cruel treatment she has so long borne she is to meet me without the gardendoor at about four oclock on monday afternoon i told you she had promised to do so she has confirmed her promise thank heaven she has confirmed her promise i shall have a chariotandsix ready in the byroad fronting the private path to harlowepaddock and several of my friends and servants not far off armed to protect her if there be occasion but every one charged to avoid mischief that you know has always been my principal care all my fear is that when she comes to the point the overniceness of her principles will make her waver and want to go back although her honour is my honour you know and mine is hers if she should and should i be unable to prevail upon her all your past services will avail nothing and she will be lost to me for ever the prey then of that cursed solmes whose vile stinginess will never permit him to do good to any of the servants of the family i have no doubt of your fidelity honest joseph nor of your zeal to serve an injured gentleman and an oppressed young lady you see by the confidence i repose in you that i have not more particularly on this very important occasion in which your assistance may crown the work for if she waver a little innocent contrivance will be necessary be very mindful therefore of the following directions take them into your heart this will probably be your last trouble until my beloved and i are joined in holy wedlock and then we will be sure to take care of you you know what i have promised no man ever reproached me for breach of word these then honest joseph are they contrive to be in the garden in disguise if possible and unseen by your young lady if you find the gardendoor unbolted you will know that she and i are together although you should not see her go out at it it will be locked but my key shall be on the ground just without the door that you may open it with yours as it may be needful if you hear our voices parleying keep at the door till i cry hem hem twice but be watchful for this signal for i must not hem very loud lest she should take it for a signal perhaps in struggling to prevail upon the dear creature i may have an opportunity to strike the door hard with my elbow or heel to confirm you then you are to make a violent burst against the door as if you would break it open drawing backward and forward the bolt in a hurry then with another push but with more noise than strength lest the lock give way cry out as if you saw some of the family come up come up instantly here they are here they are hasten this instant hasten and mention swords pistols guns with as terrible a voice as you can cry out with then shall i prevail upon her no doubt if loth before to fly if i cannot i will enter the garden with her and the house too be the consequence what it will but so affrighted these is no question but she will fly when you think us at a sufficient distance and i shall raise my voice urging her swifter flight that you may guess at that then open the door with your key but you must be sure to open it very cautiously lest we should not be far enough off i would not have her know you have a hand in this matter out of my great regard to you when you have opened the door take your key out of the lock and put it in your pocket then stooping for mine put it in the lock on the inside that it may appear as if the door was opened by herself with a key which they will suppose to be of my procuring it being new and left open by us they should conclude she is gone off by her own consent that they may not pursue us that they may see no hopes of tempting her back again in either case mischief might happen you know but you must take notice that you are only to open the door with your key in case none of the family come up to interrupt us and before we are quite gone for if they do youll find by what follows that you must not open the door at all let them on breaking it open or by getting over the wall find my key on the ground if they will if they do not come to interrupt us and if you by help of your key come out follow us at a distance and with uplifted hands and wild impatient gestures running backward and forward for fear you should come up too near us and as if you saw somebody coming to your assistance cry out for help help and to hasten then shall we be soon at the chariot tell the family that you saw me enter a chariot with her a dozen or more men on horseback attending us all armed some with blunderbusses as you believe and that we took quite the contrary way to that we should take you see honest joseph how careful i am as well as you to avoid mischief observe to keep at such a distance that she may not discover who you are take long strides to alter your gait and hold up your head honest joseph and shell not know it to be you mens airs and gaits are as various and peculiar as their faces pluck a stake out of one of the hedges and tug at it though it may come easy this if she turn back will look terrible and account for your not following us faster then returning with it shouldered to brag to the family what you would have done could you have overtaken us rather than your young lady should be carried off by such a and you may call me names and curse me and these airs will make you look valiant and in earnest you see honest joseph i am always contriving to give you reputation no man suffers by serving me but if our parley should last longer than i wish and if any of her friends miss her before i cry hem hem twice then in order to save yourself which is a very great point with me i assure you make the same noise as above but as i directed before open not the door with your key on the contrary wish for a key with all your heart but for fear any of them should by accident have a key about them keep in readiness half a dozen little gravelstones no bigger than peas and thrust two or three slily into the keyhole which will hinder their key from turning round it is good you know joseph to provide against every accident in such an important case as this and let this be your cry instead of the other if any of my enemies come in your sight as you seem to be trying to burst the door open sir sir or madam madam o lord hasten o lord hasten mr lovelace mr lovelace and very loud and that shall quicken me more than it shall those you call to if it be betty and only betty i shall think worse of your art of making love than of your fidelity if you cant find a way to amuse her and put her upon a false scent see volii letter xxix you must tell them that your young lady seemed to run as fast off with me as i with her this will also confirm to them that all pursuit is in vain an end will hereby be put to solmess hopes and her friends after a while will be more studious to be reconciled to her than to get her back so you will be a happy instrument of great good to all round and this will one day be acknowledged by both families you will then be every ones favourite and every good servant for the future will be proud to be likened to honest joseph leman if she should guess at you or find you out i have it already in my head to write a letter for you to copy which occasionally produced will set you right with her see voliii letter xxi this one time be diligent be careful this will be the crown of all and once more depend for a recompense upon the honour of your assured friend r lovelace you need not be so much afraid of going too far with betty if you should make a match with her she is a very likely creature though a vixen as you say i have an admirable receipt to cure a termagant wife never fear joseph but thou shalt be master of

sarvant to command joseph leman letter v mr lovelace to john belford esq st albans monday night i snatch a few moments while my beloved is retired as i hope to rest to perform my promise no pursuit nor have i apprehensions of any though i must make my charmer dread that there will be one and now let me tell thee that never was joy so complete as mine but let me inquire is not the angel flown away o no she is in the next apartment securely mine mine for ever o ecstasy my heart will burst my breast to leap into her bosom i knew that the whole stupid family were in a combination to do my business for me i told thee that they were all working for me like so many ground moles and still more blind than the moles are said to be unknowing that they did so i myself the director of their principal motions which falling in with the malice of their little hearts they took to be all their own but did i say my joy was perfect o no it receives some abatement from my disgusted bride for how can i endure to think that i owe more to her relations precautions than to her favour for me or even as far as i know to her preference of me to another man but let me not indulge this thought were i to do so it might cost my charmer dear let me rejoice that she has passed the rubicon that she cannot return that as i have ordered it the flight will appear to the implacables to be altogether with her own consent and that if i doubt her love i can put her to trials as mortifying to her niceness as glorious to my pride for let me tell thee dearly as i love her if i thought there was but the shadow of a doubt in her mind whether she preferred me to any man living i would shew her no mercy tuesday daydawn but on the wings of love i fly to my charmer who perhaps by this time is rising to encourage the tardy dawn i have not slept a wink of the hour and half i lay down to invite sleep it seems to me that i am not so much body as to require such a vulgar renovation but why as in the chariot as in the inn at alighting all heart bursting grief my dearest creature so persecuted as thou wert persecuted so much in danger of the most abhorred compulsion yet grief so unsuspectedly sincere for an escape so critical take care take care o beloved of my soul for jealous is the heart in which love has erected a temple to thee yet it must be allowed that such a sudden transition must affect her must ice her over when a little more used to her new situation when her hurries are at an end when she sees how religiously i shall observe all her injunctions she will undoubtedly have the gratitude to distinguish between the confinement she has escaped from and the liberty she has reason to rejoice in she comes she comes and the sun is just rising to attend her adieu be half as happy as i am for all diffidencies like nightfogs before the sun disperse at her approach and next myself thou wilt be the happiest man in the world letter vi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe wednesday april i will pursue my melancholy story being thus hurried to the chariot it would have been to no purpose to have refused entering into it had he not in my fright lifted me in as he did and it instantly drove away a full gallop and stopped not till it brought us to st albans which was just as the day shut in i thought i should have fainted several times by the way with uplifted hands and eyes god protect me said i often to myself can it be i that am here my eyes running over and my heart ready to burst with sighs as involuntarily as my flight how different how inexpressibly different the gay wretch visibly triumphing as i could not be construe his almost rapturous joy in the success of his arts but overflowing with complimental flourishes yet respectfully distant his address all the way we flew for that rather than galloping was the motion of the horses which took as i believe a roundabout way to prevent being traced i have reason to think there were other horsemen at his devotion three or four different persons above the rank of the servants galloping by us nowandthen on each side of the chariot but he took no notice of them and i had too much grief mingled with indignation notwithstanding all his blandishments to ask any questions about them or any thing else think my dear what were my thoughts on alighting from the chariot having no attendant of my own sex no clothes but what i had on and those little suited to such a journey as i had already taken and was still to take neither hood nor hat nor any thing but a handkerchief round my head and shoulders fatigued to death my mind still more fatigued than my body and in such a foam the horses that every one in the inn we put up at guessed they could not do otherwise that i was a young giddy creature who had run away from her friends this it was easy to see by their whispering and gaping more of the people of the house also coming in by turns than were necessary for the attendance the mistress of the house whom he sent in to me showed me another apartment and seeing me ready to fain brought me hartshorn and water and then upon my desiring to be left alone for half an hour retired for i found my heart ready to burst on revolving every thing in my thoughts and the moment she was gone fastening the door i threw myself into an old great chair and gave way to a violent flood of tears which a little relieved me mr lovelace sooner than i wished sent up the gentlewoman who pressed me in his name to admit my brother or to come down to him for he had told her i was his sister and that he had brought me against my will and without warning from a friends house where i had been all the winter in order to prevent my marrying against the consent of my friends to whom he was now conducting me and that having given me no time for a travellingdress i was greatly offended at him so my dear your frank your openhearted friend was forced to countenance this tale which indeed suited me the better because i was unable for some time to talk speak or look up and so my dejection and grief and silence might very well pass before the gentlewoman and her niece who attended me as a fit of sullenness the room i was in being a bedchamber i chose to go down at his repeated message attended by the mistress of the house to that in which he was he approached me with great respect yet not exceeding a brotherly politeness where a brother is polite and calling me his dearest sister asked after the state of my mind and hoped i would forgive him for never brother half so well loved a sister as he me a wretch how naturally did he fall into the character although i was so much out of mine unthinking creatures have some comfort in the shortness of their views in their unapprehensiveness and that they penetrate not beyond the present moment in short that they are unthinking but for a person of my thoughtful disposition who has been accustomed to look forward as well to the possible as to the probable what comfort can i have in my reflections but let me give you the particulars of our conversation a little before and after our suppertime joining both in one when we were alone he besought me i cannot say but with all the tokens of a passionate and respectful tenderness to be better reconciled to myself and to him he repeated all the vows of honour and inviolable affection that he ever made me he promised to be wholly governed by me in every future step he asked me to give him leave to propose whether i chose to set out next day to either of his aunts i was silent i knew not what to say nor what to do whether i chose to have private lodgings procured for me in either of those ladies neighbourhood as were once my thoughts i was still silent whether i chose to go to either of lord ms seats that of berks or that in the county we were in in lodgings i said any where where he was not to be he had promised this he owned and he would religiously keep to his word as soon as he found all danger of pursuit over and that i was settled to my mind but if the place were indifferent to me london was the safest and the most private and his relations should all visit me there the moment i thought fit to admit them his cousin charlotte particularly should attend me as my companion if i would accept of her as soon as she was able to go abroad mean time would i go to lady betty lawrances lady sarah was a melancholy woman i should be the most welcome guest she ever received i told him i wished not to go immediately however and in the frame i was in and not likely to be out of to any of his relations that my reputation was concerned to have him absent from me that if i were in some private lodging the meaner the less to be suspected as it would be known that i went away by his means and he would be supposed to have provided me handsome accommodations it would be most suitable both to my mind and to my situation that this might be best i should think in the country for me in town for him and no matter how soon he was known to be there if he might deliver his opinion he said it was that since i declined going to any of his relations london was the only place in the world to be private in every new comer in a country town or village excited a curiosity a person of my figure and many compliments he made me would excite more even messages and letters where none used to be brought would occasion inquiry he had not provided a lodging any where supposing i would choose to go either to london where accommodations of that sort might be fixed upon in an hours time or to lady bettys or to lord ms herfordshire seat where was the housekeeper an excellent woman mrs greme such another as my norton to be sure i said if i were pursued it would be in their first passion and some one of his relations houses would be the place they would expect to find me at i knew not what to do my pleasure should determine him he said be it what it would only that i were safe was all he was solicitous about he had lodgings in town but he did not offer to propose them he knew i would have more objections to go to them than i could to go to lord ms or to lady bettys no doubt of it i replied with such an indignation in my manner as made him run over with professions that he was far from proposing them or wishing for my acceptance of them and again he repeated that my honour and safety were all he was solicitous about assuring me that my will should be a law to him in every particular i was too peevish and too much afflicted and indeed too much incensed against him to take well any thing he said i thought myself i said extremely unhappy i knew not what to determine upon my reputation now no doubt utterly ruined destitute of clothes unfit to be seen by any body my very indigence as i might call it proclaiming my folly to every one who saw me who would suppose that i had been taken at advantage or had given an undue one and had no power over either my will or my actions that i could not but think i had been dealt artfully with that he had seemed to have taken what he might suppose the just measure of my weakness founded on my youth and inexperience that i could not forgive myself for meeting him that my heart bled for the distresses of my father and mother on this occasion that i would give the world and all my hopes in it to have been still in my fathers house whatever had been my usage that let him protest and vow what he would i saw something low and selfish in his love that he could study to put a young creature upon making such a sacrifice of her duty and conscience when a person actuated by a generous love must seek to oblige the object of it in every thing essential to her honour and to her peace of mind he was very attentive to all i said never offering to interrupt me once his answer to every article almost methodically shewed his memory what i had said he told me made him very grave and he would answer accordingly he was grieved at his heart to find that he had so little share in my favour or confidence as to my reputation he must be very sincere with me that could not suffer half so much by the step i so regretted to have taken as by the confinement and equally foolish and unjust treatment i had met with from my relations that every mouth was full of blame of them of my brother and sister particularly and of wonder at my patience that he must repeat what he had written to me he believed more than once that my friends themselves expected that i should take a proper opportunity to free myself from their persecutions why else did they confine me that my exalted character as he called it would still bear me out with those who knew me who knew my brothers and sisters motives and who knew the wretch they were for compelling me to have with regard to clothes who as matters were circumstanced could expect that i should be able to bring away any others than those i had on at the time for present use or wear all the ladies of his family would take a pride to supply me for future the product of the best looms not only in england but throughout the world were at my command if i wanted money as no doubt i must he should be proud to supply me would to heaven he might presume to hope there were but one interest between us and then he would fain have had me to accept of a bank note of a hundred pounds which unawares to me he put into my hand but which you may be sure i refused with warmth he was inexpressibly grieved and surprised he said to hear me say had acted artfully by me he came provided according to my confirmed appointment a wretch to upbraid me thus to redeem me from my persecutors and little expected a change of sentiment and that he should have so much difficulty to prevail upon me as he had met with that perhaps i might think his offer to go into the garden with me and to face my assembled relations was a piece of art only but that if i did i wronged him since to this hour seeing my excessive uneasiness he wished with all his soul he had been permitted to accompany me in it was always his maxim to brave a threatened danger threateners where they have an opportunity to put in force their threats were seldom to be feared but had he been assured of a private stab or of as many deaths wounds as there were persons in my family made desperate as he should have been by my return he would have attended me into the house so my dear what i have to do is to hold myself inexcusable for meeting such a determined and audacious spirit thats all i have hardly any question now but that he would have contrived some wicked stratagem or other to have got me away had i met him at a midnight hour as once or twice i had thoughts to do and that would have been more terrible still he concluded this part of his talk with saying that he doubted not but that had he attended me in he should have come off in every ones opinion well that he should have had general leave to renew his visits he went on he must be so bold as to tell me that he should have paid a visit of this kind but indeed accompanied by several of his trusty friends had i not met him and that very afternoon too for he could not tamely let the dreadful wednesday come without making some effort to change their determinations what my dear was to be done with such a man that therefore for my sake as well as for his own he had reason to wish that a disease so desperate had been attempted to be overcome by as desperate a remedy we all know said he that great ends are sometimes brought about by the very means by which they are endeavoured to be frustrated my present situation i am sure thought i affords a sad evidence of this truth i was silent all this time my blame was indeed turned inward sometimes too i was halffrighted at his audaciousness at others had the less inclination to interrupt him being excessively fatigued and my spirits sunk to nothing with a view even of the best prospects with such a man this gave his opportunity to proceed and that he did assuming a still more serious air as to what further remained for him to say in answer to what i had said he hoped i would pardon him but upon his soul he was concerned infinitely concerned he repeated his colour and his voice rising that it was necessary for him to observe how much i chose rather to have run the risque of being solmess wife than to have it in my power to reward a man who i must forgive him had been as much insulted on my account as i had been on his who had watched my commands and pardon me madam ever changeable motion of your pen all hours in all weathers and with a cheerfulness and ardour that nothing but the most faithful and obsequious passion could inspire i now my dear began to revive into a little more warmth of attention and all madam for what how i stared for he stopt then a moment or two only went he on to prevail upon you to free yourself from ungenerous and base oppressions sir sir indignantly said i hear me but out dearest madam my heart is full i must speak what i have to say to be told for your words are yet in my ears and at my heart that you would give the world and all your hopes in it to have been still in your cruel and gloomy fathers house not a word sir against my father i will not bear that whatever had been your usage and you have a credulity madam against all probability if you believe you should have avoided being solmess wife that i have put you upon sacrificing your duty and conscience yet dearest creature see you not the contradiction that your warmth of temper has surprised you into when the reluctance you shewed to the last to leave your persecutors has cleared your conscience from the least reproach of this sort o sir sir are you so critical then are you so light in your anger as to dwell upon words indeed my dear i have since thought that his anger was not owing to that sudden impetus which cannot be easily bridled but rather was a sort of manageable anger let loose to intimidate me forgive me madam i have just done have i not in your opinion hazarded my life to redeem you from oppression yet is not my reward after all precarious for madam have you not conditioned with me and hard as the condition is most sacredly will i observe it that all my hope must be remote that you are determined to have it in your power to favour or reject me totally as you please see my dear in every respect my condition changed for the worse is it in my power to take your advice if i should think it ever so right to take it clarissa had been censured as behaving to mr lovelace in their first conversation at st albans and afterwards with too much reserve and even with haughtiness surely those who have thought her to blame on this account have not paid a due attention to the story how early as above and in what immediately follows does he remind her of the terms of distance which she had prescribed to him before she was in his power in hopes to leave the door open for a reconciliation with her friends which her heart was set upon and how artfully does he unrequired promise to observe the conditions in which she in her present circumstances and situation in pursuance of miss howes advice would gladly have dispensed with to say nothing of the resentment she was under a necessity to shew at the manner of his getting her away in order to justify to him the sincerity of her refusal to go off with him see in her subsequent letter to miss howe no ix her own sense upon the subject and have you not furthermore declared proceeded he that you will engage to renounce me for ever if you friends insist upon that cruel renunciation as the terms of being reconciled to you but nevertheless madam all the merit of having saved you from an odious compulsion shall be mine i glory in it though i were to lose you for ever as i see i am but too likely to do from your present displeasure and especially if your friends insist upon the terms you are ready to comply with that you are your own mistress through my means is i repeat my boast as such i humbly implore your favour and that only upon the conditions i have yielded to hope for it as i do now thus humbly the proud wretch falling on one knee your forgiveness for so long detaining your ear and for all the plain dealing that my undesigning heart would not be denied to utter by my lips o sir pray rise let the obliged kneel if one of us must kneel but nevertheless proceed not in this strain i beseech you you have had a great deal of trouble about me but had you let me know in time that you expected to be rewarded for it at the price of my duty i should have spared you much of it far be it from me sir to depreciate merit so extraordinary but let me say that had it not been for the forbidden correspondence i was teased by you into and which i had not continued every letter for many letters intended to be the last but because i thought you a sufferer from my friends i had not been either confined or ill treated nor would my brothers lowmeant violence have had a foundation to work upon i am far from thinking my case would have been so very desperate as you imagine had i staid my father loved me in his heart he would not see me before and i wanted only to see him and to be heard and a delay of his sentence was the least thing i expected from the trial i was to stand you are boasting of your merits sir let merit be your boast nothing else can attract me if personal considerations had principal weight with me either in solmess disfavour or in your favour i shall despise myself if you value yourself upon them in preference to the person of the poor solmes i shall despise you you may glory in your fancied merits in getting me away but the cause of your glory i tell you plainly is my shame make to yourself a title to my regard which i can better approve of or else you will not have so much merit with me as you have with yourself but here sir like the first pair i at least driven out of my paradise are we recriminating no more shall you need to tell me of your sufferings and your merits your all hours and all weathers for i will bear them in memory as long as i live and if it be impossible for me to reward them be ever ready to own the obligation all that i desire of you now is to leave it to myself to seek for some private abode to take the chariot with you to london or elsewhere and if i have any further occasion for your assistance and protection i will signify it to you and be still further obliged to you you are warm my dearest life but indeed there is no occasion for it had i any views unworthy of my faithful love for you i should not have been so honest in my declarations then he began again to vow the sincerity of his intentions but i took him up short i am willing to believe you sir it would be insupportable but to suppose there were a necessity for such solemn declarations at this he seemed to collect himself as i may say into a little more circumspection if i thought there were i would not sit with you here in a public inn i assure you although cheated hither as far as i know by methods you must excuse me sir which but to suspect will hardly let me have patience either with you or with myself but no more of this just now let me i beseech you good sir bowing i was very angry let me only know whether you intend to leave me or whether i have only escaped from one confinement to another cheated hither as far as i know madam let you know and with that air too charming though grievous to my heart if you have only escaped from one confinement to another amazing perfectly amazing and can there be a necessity for me to answer this you are absolutely your own mistress it was very strange if you were not the moment you are in a place of safety i will leave you to one condition only give me leave to beg your consent it is this that you will be pleased now you are so entirely in your own power to renew a promise voluntarily made before voluntarily or i would not now presume to request it for although i would not be thought capable of growing upon concession yet i cannot bear to think of losing the ground your goodness had given me room to hope i had gained that make up how you please with your relations you will never marry any other man while i am living and single unless i should be so wicked as to give new cause for high displeasure i hesitate not to confirm this promise sir upon your own condition in what manner do you expect to confirm it only madam by your word then i never will he had the assurance i was now in his power to salute me as a sealing of my promise as he called it his motion was so sudden that i was not aware of it it would have looked affected to be very angry yet i could not be pleased considering this as a leading freedom from a spirit so audacious and encroaching and he might see that i was not he passed all that my with an air peculiar to himself enough enough dearest madam and now let me beg of you but to conquer this dreadful uneasiness which gives me to apprehend too much for my jealous love to bear and it shall be my whole endeavour to deserve your favour and to make you the happiest woman in the world as i shall be the happiest of men i broke from him to write to you my preceding letter but refused to send it by his servant as i told you the mistress of the house helped me to a messenger who was to carry what you should give him to lord ms seat in hertfordshire directed for mrs greme the housekeeper there and early in the morning for fear of pursuit we were to set out that way and there he proposed to change the chariot and six for a chaise and pair of his own which he had at that seat as it would be a lessnoticed conveyance i looked over my little stock of money and found it to be no more than seven guineas and some silver the rest of my stock was but fifty guineas and that five more than i thought it was when my sister challeneged me as to the sum i had by me and those i left in my escritoire little intending to go away with him see vol i letter xliii indeed my case abounds with a shocking number of indelicate circumstances among the rest i was forced to account to him who knew i could have no clothes but what i had on how i came to have linen with me for he could not but know i sent for it lest he should imagine i had an early design to go away with him and made that part of the preparation he most heartily wished he said for my minds sake that your mother would have afforded me her protection and delivered himself upon this subject with equal freedom and concern there are my dear miss howe a multitude of punctilios and decorums which a young creature must dispense with who in a situation like mine makes a man the intimate attendant of her person i could now i think give twenty reasons stronger than any i have heretofore mentioned why women of the least delicacy should never think of incurring the danger and the disgrace of taking the step i have been drawn in to take but with horror and aversion and why they should look upon the man who should tempt them to it as the vilest and most selfish of seducers before five oclock tuesday morning the maidservant came up to tell me that my brother was ready and that breakfast also waited for me in the parlour i went down with a heart as heavy as my eyes and received great acknowledgements and compliments from him on being so soon dressed and ready as he interpreted it to continue on our journey he had the thought which i had not for what had i to with thinking who had it not when i stood most in need of it to purchase for me a velvet hood and a short cloke trimmed with silver without saying any thing to me he must reward himself the artful encroacher said before the landlady and her maids and niece for his forethought and would salute his pretty sullen sister he took his reward and as he said before a tear with it while he assured me still before them a vile wretch that i had nothing to fear from meeting with parents who so dearly loved me how could i be complaisant my dear to such a man as this when we had got in the chariot and it began to move he asked me whether i had any objection to go to lord ms hertfordshire seat his lordship he said was at his berkshire one i told him i chose not to go as yet to any of his relations for that would indicate a plain defiance to my own my choice was to go to a private lodging and for him to be at a distance from me at least till i heard how things were taken by my friends for that although i had but little hopes of a reconciliation as it was yet if they knew i was in his protection or in that of any of his friends which would be looked upon as the same thing there would not be room for any hopes at all i should govern him as i pleased he solemnly assured me in every thing but he still thought london was the best place for me and if i were once safe there and in a lodging to my liking he would go to m hall but as i approved not of london he would urge it no further he proposed and i consented to put up at an inn in the neighbourhood of the lawn as he called lord ms seat in this county since i chose not to go thither and here i got two hours to myself which i told him i should pass in writing another letter to you meaning my narrative which though greatly fatigued i had begun at st albans and in one to my sister to apprise the family whether they were solicitous about it or not that i was well and to beg that my clothes some particular books and the fifty guineas i had left in my escritoire might be sent me he asked if i had considered whither to have them directed indeed not i i told him i was a stranger to so was he he interrupted me but it struck him by chance wicked storyteller but added he i will tell you madam how it shall be managed if you dont choose to go to london it is nevertheless best that your relations should think you there for then they will absolutely despair of finding you if you write be pleased to direct to be left for you at mr osgoods near sohosquare mr osgood is a man of reputation and this will effectually amuse them amuse them my dear amuse whom my father my uncles but it must be soall his expedients ready you see i had no objection to this and i have written accordingly but what answer i shall have or whether any that is what gives me no small anxiety this however is one consolation that if i have an answer and although my brother should be the writer it cannot be more severe than the treatment i have of late received from him and my sister mr lovelace staid out about an hour and half and then came in impatiently sending up to me no less than four times to desire admittance but i sent him word as often that i was busy and at last that i should be so till dinner was ready he then hastened that as i heard him nowandthen with a hearty curse upon the cook and waiters this is another of his perfections i ventured afterwards to check him for his free words as we sat at dinner having heard him swear at his servant when below whom nevertheless he owns to be a good one it is a sad life said i these innkeepers live mr lovelace no pretty well i believe but why madam think you that fellows who eat and drink at other mens cost or they are sorry innkeepers should be entitled to pity because of the soldiers they are obliged to quarter who are generally i believe wretched profligates bless me said i how i heard one of them swear and curse just now at a modest meek man as i judge by his low voice and gentle answers well do they make it a proverb like a trooper he bit his lip arose turned upon his heel stept to the glass and looking confidently abashed if i may say so ay madam said he these troopers are sad swearing fellows i think their officers should chastise them for it i am sure they deserve chastisement replied i for swearing is a most unmanly vice and cursing as poor and low a one since they proclaim the profligates want of power and his wickedness at the same time for could such a one punish as he speaks he would be a fiend charmingly observed by my soul madam the next trooper i hear swear and curse ill tell him what an unmanly and what a poor wretch he is mrs greme came to pay her duty to me as mr lovelace called it and was very urgent with me to go to her lords house letting me know what handsome things she had heard of her lord and his two nieces and all the family say of me and what wishes for several months past they had put up for the honour she now hoped would soon be done them all this gave me some satisfaction as it confirmed from the mouth of a very good sort of woman all that mr lovelace had told me upon inquiry about a private lodging she recommended me to a sisterin law of hers eight miles from thence where i now am and what pleased me the better was that mr lovelace of whom i could see she was infinitely observant obliged her of his own motion to accompany me in the chaise himself riding on horseback with his two servants and one of lord ms and here we arrived about four oclock but as i told you in my former the lodgings are inconvenient mr lovelace indeed found great fault with them and told mrs greme who had said that they were not worthy of us that they came not up even to her own account of them as the house was a mile from a town it was not proper for him he said to be so far distant from me lest any thing should happen and yet the apartments were not separate and distinct enough for me to like them he was sure this must be agreeable enough for him you will believe mrs greme and i had a good deal of talk in the chaise about him she was very easy and free in her answers to all i asked and has i find a very serious turn i led her on to say to the following effect some part of it not unlike what lord ms dismissed bailiff had said before by which i find that all the servants have a like opinion of him that mr lovelace was a generous man that it was hard to say whether the servants of her lords family loved or feared him most that her lord had a very great affection for him that his two noble aunts were not less fond of him that his cousins montague were as good natured young ladies as ever lived that lord m and lady sarah and lady betty had proposed several ladies to him before he made his addresses to me and even since despairing to move me and my friends in his favour but that he had no thoughts of marrying at all she had heard him say if it were not to me that as well her lord as the two ladies his sisters were a good deal concerned at the illusage he received from my family but admired my character and wished to have him married to me although i were not to have a shilling in preference to any other person from the opinion they had of the influence i should have over him that to be sure mr lovelace was a wild gentleman but wildness was a distemper which would cure itself that her lord delighted in his company whenever he could get it but that they often fell out and his lordship was always forced to submit indeed was half afraid of him she believed for mr lovelace would do as he pleased she mingled a thousand pities often that he acted not up to the talents lent him yet would have it that he had fine qualities to found a reformation upon and when the happy day came would make amends for all and of this all his friends were so assured that they wished for nothing so earnestly as for his marriage this indifferent as it is is better than my brother says of him the people of the house here are very honestlooking industrious folks mrs sorlings is the gentlewomans name the farm seems well stocked and thriving she is a widow has two sons men grown who vie with each other which shall take most pains in promoting the common good and they are both of them i already see more respectful to two modest young women their sisters than my brother was to his sister i believe i must stay here longer than at first i thought i should i ought to have mentioned that before i set out for this place i received your kind letter every thing is kind from so dear a friend see vol ii letter xlvii i own that after i had told you of my absolute determination not to go away with him you might well be surprised at your first hearing that i was actually gone the lord bless me my dear i myself at times can hardly believe it is i that have been led to take so strange a step i have not the better opinion of mr lovelace for his extravagant volubility he is too full of professions he says too many fine things of me and to me true respect true value i think lies not in words words cannot express it the silent awe the humble the doubting eye and even the hesitating voice better shew it by much than as our beloved shakespeare says the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence the man indeed at times is all upon the ecstatic one of his phrases but to my shame and confusion i must say that i know too well to what to attribute his transports in one word it is to his triumph my dear and to impute it to that perhaps equally exposes my vanity and condemns my folly we have been alarmed with notions of a pursuit founded upon a letter from his intelligencer how do different circumstances either sanctify or condemn the same action what care ought we to take not to confound the distinctions of right and wrong when self comes in the question i condemned in mr lovelace the corrupting of a servant of my fathers and now i am glad to give a kind of indirect approbation of that fault by inquiring of him what he hears by that or any other way of the manner in which my relations took my flight a preconcerted forward and artful flight it must undoubtedly appear to them how grievous is that to think of yet how as long as i am situated can i put them right most heavily he says they take it but shew not so much grief as rage and he can hardly have patience to hear of the virulence and menaces of my brother against himself then a merit is made to me of his forbearance what a satisfaction am i robbed of my dearest friend when i reflect upon my inconsiderateness o that i had it still in my power to say i suffered wrong rather than did wrong that others were more wanting in their kindness to me than i duty where duty is owing to them fie upon me for meeting the seducer let all end as happily as it now may i have laid up for myself remorse for my whole life what still more concerns me is that every time i see this man i am still at a greater loss than before what to make of him i watch every turn of his countenance and i think i see very deep lines in it he looks with more meaning i verily think than he used to look yet not more serious not less gay i dont know how he looks but with more confidence a great deal than formerly and yet he never wanted that but here is the thing i behold him with fear now as conscious of the power my indiscretion has given him over me and well may he look more elate when he sees me deprived of all the selfsupposed significance which adorns and exults a person who has been accustomed to respect and who now by a conscious inferiority allows herself to be overcome and in a state of obligation as i may say to a man who from a humble suitor to her for her favour assumes the consequence and airs of a protector i shall send this as my former by a poor man who travels every day with pedlary matters he will leave it at mrs knollys as you direct if you hear any thing of my father and mother and of their health and how my friends were affected by my unhappy step pray be so good as to write me a few lines by the messenger if his waiting for them can be known to you i am afraid to ask you whether upon reading that part of my narrative already in your hands you think any sort of extenuation lies for your unhappy clarissa harlowe letter vii mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday wedn april you claim my promise that i will be as particular as possible in all that passes between me and my goddess indeed i never had a more illustrious subject to exercise my pen and moreover i have leisure for by her good will my access would be as difficult to her as that of the humblest slave to an eastern monarch nothing then but inclination to write can be wanting and since our friendship and your obliging attendance upon me at the white hart will not excuse that i will endeavour to keep my word i parted with thee and thy brethren with a full resolution thou knowest to rejoin ye if she once again disappointed me in order to go together attended by our servants for shew sake to the gloomy father and demand audience of the tyrant upon the freedoms taken with my character in short to have tried by fair resolutions and treat his charming daughter with less inhumanity and me with more civility i told thee my reasons for not going in search of a letter of countermand i was right for if i had i should have found such a one and had i received it she would not have met me did she think that after i had been more than once disappointed i would not keep her to her promise that i would not hold her to it when i had got her in so deeply the moment i heard the door unbolt i was sure of her that motion made my heart bound to my throat but when that was followed with the presence of my charmer flashing upon me all at once in a flood of brightness sweetly dressed though all unprepared for a journey i trod air and hardly thought myself a mortal thou shalt judge of her dress as at the moment i first beheld her she appeared to me and as upon a nearer observation she really was i am a critic thou knowest in womens dresses many a one have i taught to dress and helped to undress but there is such a native elegance in this lady that she surpasses all that i could imagine surpassing but then her person adorns what she wears more than dress can adorn her and thats her excellence expect therefore a faint sketch of her admirable person with her dress her waxlike flesh for after all flesh and blood i think she is by its delicacy and firmness answers for the soundness of her health thou hast often heard me launch out in praise of her complexion i never in my life beheld a skins so illustriously fair the lily and the driven snow it is nonsense to talk of her lawn and her laces one might indeed compare to those but what a whited wall would a woman appear to be who had a complexion which would justify such unnatural comparisons but this lady is all glowing all charming flesh and blood yet so clear that every meandring vein is to be seen in all the lovely parts of her which custom permits to be visible thou has heard me also describe the wavy ringlets of her shining hair needing neither art nor powder of itself an ornament defying all other ornaments wantoning in and about a neck that is beautiful beyond description her headdress was a brusselslace mob peculiarly adapted to the charming air and turn of her features a skyblue ribband illustrated that but although the weather was somewhat sharp she had not on either hat or hood for besides that she loves to use herself hardily by which means and by a temperance truly exemplary she is allowed to have given high health and vigour to an originally tender constitution she seems to have intended to shew me that she was determined not to stand to her appointment o jack that such a sweet girl should be a rogue her morning gown was a pale primrosecoloured paduasoy the cuffs and robins curiously embroidered by the fingers of this evercharming arachne in a running pattern of violets and their leaves the light in the flowers silver gold in the leaves a pair of diamond snaps in her ears a white handkerchief wrought by the same inimitable fingers concealed o belford what still more inimitable beauties did it not conceal and i saw all the way we rode the bounding heart by its throbbing motions i saw it dancing beneath her charming umbrage her ruffles were the same as her mob her apron a flowered lawn her coat white sattin quilted blue sattin her shoes braided with the same colour without lace for what need has the prettiest foot in the world of ornament neat buckles in them and on her charming arms a pair of black velvet glovelike muffs of her own invention for she makes and gives fashions as she pleases her hands velvet of themselves thus uncovered the freer to be grasped by those of her adorer i have told thee what were my transports when the undrawn bolt presented to me my longexpected goddess her emotions were more sweetly feminine after the first moments for then the fire of her starry eyes began to sink into a less dazzling languor she trembled nor knew she how to support the agitations of a heart she had never found so ungovernable she was even fainting when i clasped her in my supporting arms what a precious moment that how near how sweetly near the throbbing partners by her dress i saw as i observed before how unprepared she was for a journey and not doubting her intention once more to disappoint me i would have drawn her after me then began a contention the most vehement that ever i had with woman it would pain thy friendly heart to be told the infinite trouble i had with her i begged i prayed on my knees yet in vain i begged and prayed her to answer her own appointment and had i not happily provided for such a struggle knowing whom i had to deal with i had certainly failed in my design and as certainly would have accompanied her in without thee and thy brethren and who knows what might have been the consequence but my honest agent answering my signal though not quite so soon as i expected in the manner thou knowest i had prescribed they are coming they are coming fly fly my beloved creature cried i drawing my sword with a flourish as if i would have slain half an hundred of the supposed intruders and seizing her trembling hands i drew her after me so swiftly that my feet winged by love could hardly keep pace with her feet agitated by fear and so i became her emperor ill tell thee all when i see thee and thou shalt then judge of my difficulties and of her perverseness and thou wilt rejoice with me at my conquest over such a watchful and openeyed charmer but seest thou not now as i think i do the wind outstripping fair one flying from her love to her love is there not such a game nay flying from her friends she was resolved not to abandon to the man she was determined not to go off with the sex the sex all over charming contradiction hah hah hah hah i must here i must here lay down my pen to hold my sides for i must have my laugh out now the fit is upon me i believe i believe hah hah hah i believe jack my dogs conclude me mad for here has one of them popt in as if to see what ailed me or whom i had with me hah hah hah an impudent dog o jack knewest thou my conceit and were but thy laugh joined to mine i believe it would hold me for an hour longer but o my best beloved fair one repine not thou at the arts by which thou suspectest thy fruitless vigilence has been over watched take care that thou provokest not new ones that may be still more worthy of thee if once thy emperor decrees thy fall thou shalt greatly fall thou shalt have cause if that come to pass which may come to pass for why wouldst thou put off marriage to so long a day as till thou hadst reason to be convinced of my reformation dearest thou shalt have cause never fear to sit down more dissatisfied with the stars than with thyself and come the worst to the worst glorious terms will i give thee thy garrison with general prudence at the head and governor watchfulness bringing up the rear shall be allowed to march out with all the honours due to so brave a resistance and all thy sex and all mine that hear of my stratagems and of thy conduct shall acknowledge the fortress as nobly won as defended thou wilt not dare methinks i hear thee say to attempt to reduce such a goddess as this to a standard unworthy of her excellencies it is impossible lovelace that thou shouldst intent to break through oaths and protestations so solemn that i did not intend it is certain that i do intend it i cannot my heart my reverence for her will not let me say but knowest thou not my aversion to the state of shackles and is she not in my power and wilt thou lovelace abuse that power which which what belford which i obtained not by her own consent but against it but which thou never hadst obtained had she not esteemed thee above all men and which i had never taken so much pains to obtain had i not loved her above all women so far upon a par jack and if thou pleadest honour ought not honour to be mutual if mutual does it not imply mutual trust mutual confidence and what have i had of that from her to boast of thou knowest the whole progress of our warfare for a warfare it has truly been and far very far from an amorous warfare too doubts mistrusts upbraidings on her part humiliations the most abject on mine obliged to assume such airs of reformation that every varlet of ye has been afraid i should reclaim in good earnest and hast thou not thyself frequently observed to me how awkwardly i returned to my usual gayety after i had been within a mile of her fathers gardenwall although i had not seen her does she not deserve to pay for all this to make an honest fellow look like an hypocrite what a vile thing is that then thou knowest what a false little rogue she has been how little conscience she has made of disappointing me hast thou not been a witness of my ravings on this score have i not in the height of them vowed revenge upon the faithless charmer and if i must be forsworn whether i answer her expectations or follow my own inclinations and if the option be in my own power can i hesitate a moment which to choose then i fancy by her circumspection and her continual grief that she expects some mischief from me i dont care to disappoint any body i have a value for but o the noble the exalted creature who can avoid hesitating when he thinks of an offence against her who can but pity yet on the other hand so loth at last to venture though threatened to be forced into the nuptial fetters with a man whom to look upon as a rival is to disgrace myself so sullen now she has ventured what title has she to pity and to a pity which her pride would make her disclaim but i resolve not any way i will see how her will works and how my will leads me on i will give the combatants fair play and yet every time i attend her i find that she is less in my power i more in hers yet a foolish little rogue to forbid me to think of marriage till i am a reformed man till the implacables of her family change their natures and become placable it is true when she was for making those conditions she did not think that without any she should be cheated out of herself for so the dear soul as i may tell thee in its place phrases it how it swells my pride to have been able to outwit such a vigilant charmer i am taller by half a yard in my imagination than i was i look down upon every body now last night i was still more extravagant i took off my hat as i walked to see if the lace were not scorched supposing it had brushed down a star and before i put it on again in mere wantonness and hearts ease i was for buffeting the moon in short my whole soul is joy when i go to bed i laugh myself asleep and i awake either laughing or singing yet nothing nearly in view neither for why i am not yet reformed enough i told thee at the time if thou rememberest how capable this restriction was of being turned upon the overscrupulous dear creature could i once get her out of her fathers house and were i disposed to punish her for her familys faults and for the infinite trouble she herself had given me little thinks she that i have kept an account of both and that when my heart is soft and all her own i can but turn to my memoranda and harden myself at once o my charmer look to it abate of thy haughty airs value not thyself upon thy sincerity if thou art indifferent to me i will not bear it now art thou not in my power nor if thou lovest me think that the female affectation of denying thy love will avail thee now with a heart so proud and so jealous as mine remember moreover that all thy family sins are upon thy head but ah jack when i see my angel when i am admitted to the presence of this radiant beauty what will become of all this vapouring but be my end what it may i am obliged by thy penetration fair one to proceed by the sap fair and softly a wife at any time marriage will be always in my power when put to the university the same course of initial studies will qualify the yonker for the one line or the other the genius ought to point out the future lawyer divine or physician so the same cautious conduct with such a vigilance will do either for the wife or for the nowife when i reform ill marry tis time enough for the one the lady must say for the other say i but how i ramble this is to be in such a situation that i know not what to resolve upon ill tell thee my inclinings as i proceed the pros and the cons ill tell thee but being got too far from the track i set out in i will close here i may however write every day something and send it as opportunity offers regardless nevertheless i shall be in all i write of connection accuracy or of any thing but of my own imperial will and pleasure letter viii miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe wednesday night april i have your narrative my dear you are the same noble creature you ever were above disguise above art above attempting to extenuate a failing the only family in the world yours surely that could have driven such a daughter upon such extremities but you must not be so very much too good for them and for the case you lay the blame so properly and so unsparingly upon your meeting him that nothing can be added to that subject by your worst enemies were they to see what you have written i am not surprised now i have read your narrative that so bold and so contriving a man i am forced to break off you stood it out much better and longer here again comes my bustling jealous mother dont be angry at yourself did you not do for the best at the time as to your first fault the answering his letters it was always incumbent upon you to assume the guardianship of such a family when the bravo of it had run riot as he did and brought himself into danger except your mother who has no will of her own have any of them common sense forgive me my dear here is that stupid uncle antony of yours a pragmatical conceited positive he came yesterday in a fearful pucker and puffed and blowed and stumped about our hall and parlour while his message was carried up my mother was dressing these widows are as starched as the old bachelors she would not see him in a dishabille for the world what can she mean by it his errand was to set her against you and to shew her their determined rage on your going away the issue proved too evidently that this was the principal end of his visit the odd creature desired to speak with her alone i am not used to such exceptions whenever any visits are made to my mother when she was primed out down she came to him they locked themselves in the two positive heads were put together close together i suppose for i listened but could hear nothing distinctly though they both seemed full of their subject i had a good mind once or twice to have made them open the door could i have been sure of keeping but tolerably my temper i would have demanded admittance but i was afraid if i had obtained it that i should have forgot it was my mothers house and been for turning him out of it to come to rave against and abuse my dearest dearest faultless friend and the ravings to be encouraged and perhaps joined in in order to justify themselves the one for contributing to drive that dear friend out of her fathers house the other for refusing her a temporary asylum till the reconciliation could have been effected which her dutiful heart was set upon and which it would have become the love which my mother had ever pretended for you to have mediated for could i have had patience the issue as i said shewed what the errand was its fusty appearance after the old fusty fellow was marched off you must excuse me my dear was in a kind of gloomy harlowelike reservedness in my mother which upon a few resenting flirts of mine was followed by a rigorous prohibition of correspondence this put us you may suppose upon terms not the most agreeable i desired to know if i were prohibited dreaming of you for my dear you have all my sleeping as well as waking hours i can easily allow for your correspondence with your wretch at first and yet your notions were excellent by the effect this prohibition has upon me since if possible it has made me love you better than before and i am more desirous than ever of corresponding with you but i have nevertheless a much more laudable motive i should think myself the unworthiest of creatures could i be brought to slight a dear friend and such a meritorious one in her distress i would die first and so i told my mother and i have desired her not to watch me in my retired hours nor to insist upon my lying with her constantly which she now does more earnestly than ever twere better i told her that the harlowebetty were borrowed to be set over me mr hickman who so greatly honours you has unknown to me interposed so warmly in your favour with my mother that it makes for him no small merit with me i cannot at present write to every particular unless i would be in set defiance tease tease tease for ever the same thing though answered fifty times over in every hour to be repeated lord bless me what a life must my poor father but let me remember to whom i am writing if this everactive evermischievous monkey of a man this lovelace contrived as you suspect but here comes my mother again ay stay a little longer my mamma if you please i can but be suspected i can but be chidden for making you wait and chidden i am sure to be whether i do or not in the way you my good mamma are antonyd into bless me how impatient she is how she thunders at the door this moment madam how came i to doublelock myself if what have i done with the key duce take the key dear madam you flutter one so you may believe my dear that i took care of my papers before i opened the door we have had a charming dialogue she flung from me in a passion so whats now to be done sent for down in a very peremptory manner i assure you what an incoherent letter will you have when i get it to you but now i know where to send it mr hickman shall find me a messenger yet if he be detected poor soul he will be harlowedoff as well as his meek mistress thursday april i have this moment your continuationletter and am favoured at present with the absence of my arguseyes mother dear creature i can account for all your difficulties a young lady of your delicacy and with such a man i must be brief the mans a fool my dear with all his pride and with all his complaisance and affected regards to your injunctions yet his ready inventions sometimes i think you should go to lady bettys i know not what to advise you to do i should if you were not so intent upon reconciling yourself to your relations yet they are implacable you can have no hopes of them your uncles errand to my mother may convince you of that ad if you have an answer to your letter to your sister that will confirm you i dare say you need not to have been afraid of asking me whether upon reading your narrative i thought any extenuation could lie for what you have done i have as above before i had your question told you my mind as to that and i repeat i think your provocations and inducements considered that ever young creature was who took such a step but you took it not you were driven on one side and possibly tricked on the other if any woman on earth shall be circumstanced as you were and shall hold out so long as you did against her persecutors on one hand and her seducer on the other i will forgive her for all the rest of her conduct be it what it will all your acquaintance you may suppose talk of nobody but you some indeed bring your admirable character for a plea against you but nobody does or can acquit your father and uncles every body seems apprized of your brothers and sisters motives your flight is no doubt the very thing they aimed to drive you to by the various attacks they made upon you unhoping as they must do all the time the success of their schemes in solmess behalf they knew that if once you were restored to favour the suspended love of your father and uncles like a river breaking down a temporary obstruction would return with double force and that then you would expose and triumph over all their arts and now i hear they enjoy their successful malice your father is all rage and violence he ought i am sure to turn his rage inward all your family accuse you of acting with deep art and are put upon supposing that you are actually every hour exulting over them with your man in the success of it they all pretend now that your trial of wednesday was to be the last advantage would indeed my mother owns have been taken of your yielding if you had yielded but had you not been prevailed upon they would have given up their scheme and taken your promise for renouncing lovelace believe them who will they own however that a minister was to be present mr solmes was to be at hand and your father was previously to try his authority over you in order to make you sign the settlements all of it a romantic contrivance of your wildheaded foolish brother i make no doubt it is likely that he and bell would have given way to your restoration to favour supposing it in their power to hinder it on any other terms than those their hearts had been so long set upon how they took your flight when they found it out may be better supposed than described your aunt hervey it seems was the first that went down to the ivy summerhouse in order to acquaint you that their search was over betty followed her and they not finding you there went on towards the cascade according to a hint of yours returning by the gardendoor they met a servant they dont say it was joseph leman but it is very likely that it was he running as he said from pursuing mr lovelace a great hedgestake in his hand and out of breath to alarm the family if it were this fellow and if he were employed in the double agency of cheating them and cheating you what shall we think of the wretch you are with run away from him my dear if so no matter to whom or marry him if you cannot your aunt and all your family were accordingly alarmed by this fellow evidently when too late for pursuit they got together and when a posse ran to the place of interview and some of them as far as to the tracks of the chariot wheels without stopping and having heard the mans tale upon the spot a general lamentation a mutual upbraiding and rage and grief were echoed from the different persons according to their different tempers and conceptions and they returned like fools as they went your brother at first ordered horses and armed men to be got ready for a pursuit solmes and your uncle tony were to be of the party but your mother and your aunt hervey dissuaded them from it for fear of adding evil to evil not doubting but lovelace had taken measures to support himself in what he had done and especially when the servant declared that he saw you run with him as fast as you could set foot to the ground and that there were several armed men on horseback at a small distance off my mothers absence was owing to her suspicion that the knollys were to assist in our correspondence she made them a visit upon it she does every thing at once and they have promised that no more letters shall be left there without her knowledge but mr hickman has engaged one filmer a husbandman in the lane we call finchlane near us to receive them thither you will be pleased to direct yours under cover to mr john soberton and mr hickman himself will call for them there and there shall leave mine it goes against me too to make him so useful to me he looks already so proud upon it i shall have him who knows give himself airs he had best consider that the favour he has been long aiming at may put him into a very dangerous a very ticklish situation he that can oblige may disoblige happy for some people not to have it in their power to offend i will have patience if i can for a while to see if these bustlings in my mother will subside but upon my word i will not long bear this usage sometimes i am ready to think that my mother carries it thus on purpose to tire me out and to make me the sooner marry if i find it to be so and that hickman in order to make a merit with me is in the low plot i will never bear him in my sight plotting wretch as i doubt your man is i wish to heaven that you were married that you might brave them all and not be forced to hide yourself and be hurried from one inconvenient place to another i charge you omit not to lay hold on any handsome opportunity that may offer for that purpose here again comes my mother we look mighty glum upon each other i can tell you she had not best harlowe me at this rate i wont bear it i have a vast deal to write i know not what to write first yet my mind is full and ready to run over i am got into a private corner of the garden to be out of her way lord help these mothers do they think they can prevent a daughters writing or doing any thing she has a mind to do by suspicion watchfulness and scolding they had better place a confidence in one by half a generous mind scorns to abuse a generous confidence you have a nice a very nice part to act with this wretch who yet has i think but one plain path before him i pity you but you must make the best of the lot you have been forced to draw yet i see your difficulties but if he do not offer to abuse your confidence i would have you seem at least to place some in him if you think not of marrying soon i approve of your resolution to fix somewhere out of his reach and if he know not where to find you so much the better yet i verily believe they would force you back could they but come at you if they were not afraid of him i think by all means you should demand of both your trustees to be put in possession of your own estate mean time i have sixty guineas at your service i beg you will command them before they are gone ill take care you shall be further supplied i dont think youll have a shilling or a shillings worth of your own from your relations unless you extort it from them as they believe you went away by your own consent they are it seems equally surprised and glad that you have left your jewels and money behind you and have contrived for clothes so ill very little likelihood this shews of their answering your requests indeed every one who knows not what i now know must be at a loss to account for your flight as they will call it and how my dear can one report it with any tolerable advantage to you to say you did not intend it when you met him who will believe it to say that a person of your known steadiness and punctilio was overpersuaded when you gave him the meeting how will that sound to say you were tricked out of yourself and people were given credit to it how disreputable and while unmarried and yet with him the man a man of such a character what would it not lead a censuring world to think i want to see how you put it in your letter for your clothes as you may depend upon all the little spiteful things they can offer instead of sending what you write for pray accept the sum that i tender what will seen guineas do and i will find a way to send you also any of my clothes and linen for present supply i beg my dear clarissa that you will not put your anna howe upon a footing with lovelace in refusing to accept of my offer if you do not oblige me i shall be apt to think you rather incline to be obliged to him than to favour me and if i find this i shall not know how to reconcile it with your delicacy in other respects pray inform me of every thing that passes between you and him my cares for you however needless from your own prudence make me wish you to continue to be every minute if any thing occur that you would tell me of if i were present fail not to put it down in writing although from your natural diffidence it should not appear to you altogether so worthy of your pen or my knowing a standerby may see more of the game than one that plays great consequences like great folks generally owe their greatness to small causes and little incidents upon the whole i do not now think it is in your power to dismiss him when you please i apprized you beforehand that it would not i repeat therefore that were i you i would at least seem to place some confidence in him so long as he is decent you may very visibly observable to such delicacy as yours must be that behaviour in him which will make him unworthy of some confidence your relations according to what old antony says to my mother and she to me by way of threatening that you will not gain your supposed ends upon them by your flight seem to expect that you will throw yourself into lady bettys protection and that she will offer to mediate for you and they vow that they will never hearken to any terms of accommodation that shall come from that quarter for i dare aver that your brother and sister will not let them cool at least till their uncles have made such dispositions and perhaps your father too as they would have them make as this letter will apprize you of an alteration in the place to which you must direct your next i send it by a friend of mr hickman who may be depended upon he has business in the neighbourhood of mrs sorlings and he knows her he will return to mr hickman this night and bring back any letter you shall have ready to send or can get ready it is moonlight hell not mind waiting for you i choose not to send by any of mr hickmans servants at present however every hour is now or may be important and may make an alteration in your resolutions necessary i hear at this instant my mother calling about her and putting every body into motion she will soon i suppose make me and my employment the subjects of her inquiry adieu my dear may heaven preserve you and restore you with honour as unsullied as your mind to your ever affectionate anna howe letter ix miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe thursday afternoon april i am infinitely concerned my ever dear and ever kind friend that i am the sad occasion of the displeasure between your mother and you how many persons have i made unhappy had i not to console myself that my error is not owing to wicked precipitation i should be the most miserable of all creatures as it is i am enough punished in the loss of my character more valuable to me than my life and in the cruel doubts and perplexities which conflicting with my hopes and each getting the victory by turns harrow up my soul between them i think however that you should obey your mother and decline a correspondence with me at least for the present take care how you fall into my error for that begun with carrying on a prohibited correspondence a correspondence which i thought it in my power to discontinue at pleasure my talent is scribbling and i the readier fell into this freedom as i found delight in writing having motives too which i thought laudable and at one time the permission of all my friends to write to him see vol i letter iii yet as to this correspondence what hurt could arise from it if your mother could be prevailed upon to permit it to be continued so much prudence and discretion as you have and you in writing to me lying under no temptation of following so bad an example as i have set my letters too occasionally filled with selfaccusation i thank you my dear most cordially i thank you for your kind offers you may be assured that i will sooner be beholden to you than to any body living to mr lovelace the last do not therefore think that by declining your favours i have an intention to lay myself under obligations to him i am willing to hope notwithstanding what you write that my friends will send me my little money together with my clothes they are too considerate some of them at least to permit that i should be put to such low difficulties perhaps they will not be in haste to oblige me but if not i cannot yet want i believe you think i must not dispute with mr lovelace the expenses of the road and lodgings till i can get a fixed abode but i hope soon to put an end even to those small sort of obligations small hopes indeed of a reconciliation from your account of my uncles visit to your mother in order to set her against an almost friendless creature whom once he loved but is it not my duty to try for it ought i to widen my error by obstinacy and resentment because of their resentment which must appear reasonable to them as they suppose my flight premeditated and as they are made to believe that i am capable of triumphing in it and over them with the man they hate when i have done all in my power to restore myself to their favour i shall have the less to reproach myself with these considerations make me waver about following your advice in relation to marriage and the rather as he is so full of complaisance with regard to my former conditions which he calls my injunctions nor can i now that my friends as you inform me have so strenuously declared against accepting of the mediation of the ladies of mr lovelaces family put myself into their protection unless i am resolved to give up all hopes of a reconciliation with my own yet if any happy introduction could be thought of to effect this desirable purpose how shall terms be proposed to my father while this man is with me or near me on the other hand should they in his absence get me back by force and this you are of opinion they would attempt to do but in fear of him how will their severest acts of compulsion be justified by my flight from them mean while to what censures as you remind me do i expose myself while he and i are together and unmarried yet can i with patience ask the question is it in my power o my dear miss howe and am i so reduced as that to save the poor remains of my reputation in the worlds eye i must watch the gracious motion from this mans lips were my cousin morden in england all might still perhaps be determined happily if no other mediation than this can be procured to set on foot the wishedfor reconciliation and if my situation with mr lovelace alter not in the interim i must endeavour to keep myself in a state of independence till he arrive that i may be at liberty to govern myself by his advice and direction i will acquaint you as you desire with all that passes between mr lovelace and me hitherto i have not discovered any thing in his behaviour that is very exceptionable yet i cannot say that i think the respect he shews me an easy unrestrained and natural respect although i can hardly tell where the fault is but he has doubtless an arrogant and encroaching spirit nor is he so polite as his education and other advantages might have made one expect him to be he seems in short to be one who has always had too much of his own will to study to accommodate himself to that of others as to the placing of some confidence in him i shall be as ready to take your advice in this particular as in all others and as he will be to deserve it but tricked away as i was by him not only against my judgment but my inclination can he or any body expect that i should immediately treat him with complaisance as if i acknowledged obligation to him for carrying me away if i did must he not either think he a vile dissembler before he gained that point or afterwards indeed indeed my dear i could tear my hair on reconsidering what you write as to the probability that the dreaded wednesday was more dreaded than it needed to be to think that i should be thus tricked by this man and that in all likelihood through his vile agent joseph leman so premeditated and elaborate a wickedness as it must be must i not with such a man be wanting to myself if i were not jealous and vigilant yet what a life to live for a spirit so open and naturally so unsuspicious as mine i am obliged to mr hickman for the assistance he is so kindly ready to give to our correspondence he is so little likely to make to himself an additional merit with the daughter upon it that i shall be very sorry if he risk any thing with the mother by it i am now in a state of obligation so must rest satisfied with whatever i cannot help whom have i the power once so precious to me of obliging what i mean my dear is that i ought perhaps to expect that my influences over you are weakened by my indiscretion nevertheless i will not if i can help it desert myself nor give up the privilege you used to allow me of telling you what i think of such parts of your conduct as i may not approve you must permit me therefore severe as your mother is against an undesigning offender to say that i think your liveliness to her inexcusable to pass over for this time what nevertheless concerns me not a little the free treatment you almost indiscriminately give to my relations if you will not for your dutys sake forbear your tauntings and impatience let me beseech you that you will for mine since otherwise your mother may apprehend that my example like a leaven is working itself into the mind of her beloved daughter and may not such an apprehension give her an irreconcilable displeasure against me i enclose the copy of my letter to my sister which you are desirous to see you will observe that although i have not demanded my estate in form and of my trustees yet that i have hinted at leave to retire to it how joyfully would i keep my word if they would accept of the offer i renew it was not proper i believe you will think on many accounts to own that i was carried off against my inclination i am my dearest friend your ever obliged and affectionate cl harlowe letter x to miss arabella harlowe enclosed to miss howe in the preceding st albans apr my dear sister i have i confess been guilty of an action which carries with it a rash and undutiful appearance and i should have thought it an inexcusable one had i been used with less severity than i have been of late and had i not had too great reason to apprehend that i was to be made a sacrifice to a man i could not bear to think of but what is done is done perhaps i could wish it had not and that i had trusted to the relenting of my dear and honourable parents yet this from no other motives but those of duty to them to whom i am ready to return if i may not be permitted to retire to the grove on conditions which i before offered to comply with nor shall i be in any sort of dependence upon the person by whose means i have taken this trulyreluctant step inconsistent with any reasonable engagement i shall enter into if i am not further precipitated let me not have it to say now at this important crisis that i have a sister but not a friend in that sister my reputation dearer to me than life whatever you may imagine from the step i have taken is suffering a little lenity will even yet in a great measure restore it and make that pass for a temporary misunderstanding only which otherwise will be a stain as durable as life upon a creature who has already been treated with great unkindness to use no harsher a word for your own sake therefore for my brothers sake by whom i must say i have been thus precipitated and for all the familys sake aggravate not my fault if on recollecting every thing you think it one nor by widening the unhappy difference expose a sister for ever prays your affectionate cl harlowe i shall take it for a very great favour to have my clothes directly sent me together with fifty guineas which you will find in my escritoire of which i enclose the key as also of the divinity and miscellany classes of my little library and if it be thought fit my jewels directed for me to be left till called for at mr osgoods near sohosquare letter xi mr lovelace to john belford esq mr lovelace in continuation of his last letter no vii gives an account to his friend pretty much to the same effect with the ladys of all that passed between them at the inns in the journey and till their fixing at mrs sorlings to avoid repetition those passages in his narrative are extracted which will serve to embellish hers to open his views or to display the humourous talent he was noted for at their alighting at the inn at st albans on monday night thus he writes the people who came about us as we alighted seemed by their jawfallen faces and goggling eyes to wonder at beholding a charming young lady majesty in her air and aspect so composedly dressed yet with features so discomposed come off a journey which made the cattle smoke and the servants sweat i read their curiosity in their faces and my beloveds uneasiness in hers she cast a conscious glance as she alighted upon her habit which was no habit and repulsively as i may say quitting my assisting hand hurried into the house ovid was not a greater master of metamorphoses than thy friend to the mistress of the house i instantly changed her into a sister brought off by surprise from a near relations where she had wintered to prevent her marrying a confounded rake i love always to go as near the truth as i can whom her father and mother her elder sister and all her loving uncles aunts and cousins abhorred this accounted for my charmers expected sullens for her displeasure when she was to join me again were it to hold for her unsuitable dress upon the road and at the same time gave her a proper and seasonable assurance of my honourable views upon the debate between the lady and him and particularly upon that part where she upbraids him with putting a young creature upon making a sacrifice of her duty and conscience he write all these and still more mortifying things she said i heard her in silence but when it came to my turn i pleaded i argued i answered her as well as i could and when humility would not do i raised my voice and suffered my eyes to sparkle with anger hoping to take advantage of that sweet cowardice which is so amiable in the sex and to which my victory over this proud beauty is principally owing she was not intimidated however and was going to rise upon me in her temper and would have broken in upon my defence but when a man talks to a woman upon such subjects let her be ever so much in alt tis strange if he cannot throw out a tub to the whale that is to say if he cannot divert her from resenting one bold thing by uttering two or three full as bold but for which more favourable interpretations will lie to that part where she tells him of the difficulty she made to correspond with him at first thus he writes very true my precious and innumerable have been the difficulties thou hast made me struggle with but one day thou mayest wish that thou hadst spared this boast as well as those other pretty haughtinesses that thou didst not reject solmes for my sake that my glory if i valued myself upon carrying thee off was thy shame that i have more merit with myself than with thee or any body else what a coxcomb she makes me jack that thou wishest thyself in thy fathers house again whatever were to be the consequence if i forgive thee charmer for these hints for these reflections for these wishes for these contempts i am not the lovelace i have been reputed to be and that thy treatment of me shews that thou thinkest i am in short her whole air throughout this debate expressed a majestic kind of indignation which implied a believed superiority of talents over the person to whom she spoke thou hast heard me often expatiate upon the pitiful figure a man must make whose wife has or believes she has more sense than himself a thousand reasons could i give why i ought not to think of marrying miss clarissa harlowe at least till i can be sure that she loves me with the preference i must expect from a wife i begin to stagger in my resolutions ever averse as i was to the hymeneal shackles how easily will prejudices recur heaven give me the heart to be honest to my clarissa theres a prayer jack if i should not be heard what a sad thing would that be for the most admirable of women yet as i do no often trouble heaven with my prayers who knows but this may be granted but there lie before me such charming difficulties such scenery for intrigue for stratagem for enterprize what a horrible thing that my talents point all that way when i know what is honourable and just and would almost wish to be honest almost i say for such a varlet am i that i cannot altogether wish it for the soul of me such a triumph over the whole sex if i can subdue this lady my maiden vow as i may call it for did not the sex begin with me and does this lady spare me thinkest thou jack that i should have spared my rosebud had i been set at defiance thus her grandmother besought me at first to spare her rosebud and when a girl is put or puts herself into a mans power what can he wish for further while i always considered opposition and resistance as a challenge to do my worst see vol i letter xxxiv why why will the dear creature take such pains to appear all ice to me why will she by her pride awaken mine hast thou not seen in the above how contemptibly she treats me what have i not suffered for her and even from her ought i to bear being told that she will despise me if i value myself above that odious solmes then she cuts me short in all my ardours to vow fidelity is by a cursed turn upon me to shew that there is reason in my own opinion for doubt of it the very same reflection upon me once before see vol ii letter xiii in my power or out of my power all one to this lady so belford my poor vows are crammed down my throat before they can well rise to my lips and what can a lover say to his mistress if she will neither let him lie nor swear one little piece of artifice i had recourse to when she pushed so hard for me to leave her i made a request to her upon a condition she could not refuse and pretended as much gratitude upon her granting it as if it were a favour of the last consequence and what was this but to promise what she had before promised never to marry any other man while i am living and single unless i should give her cause for high disgust against me this you know was promising nothing because she could be offended at any time and was to be the sole judge of the offence but it shewed her how reasonable and just my expectations were and that i was no encroacher she consented and asked what security i expected her word only she gave me her word but i besought her excuse for sealing it and in the same moment since to have waited for consent would have been asking for a denial saluted her and believe me or not but as i hope to live it was the first time i had the courage to touch her charming lips with mine and this i tell thee belford that that single pressure as modestly put too as if i were as much a virgin as herself that she might not be afraid of me another time delighted me more than ever i was delighted by the ultimatum with any other woman so precious do awe reverence and apprehended prohibition make a favour and now belford i am only afraid that i shall be too cunning for she does not at present talk enough for me i hardly know what to make of the dear creature yet i topt the brothers part on monday night before the landlady at st albans asking my sisters pardon for carrying her off so unprepared for a journey prated of the joy my father and mother and all our friends would have in receiving her and this with so many circumstances that i perceived by a look she gave me that went through my very reins that i had gone too far i apologized for it indeed when alone but could not penetrate for the soul of me whether i made the matter better or worse by it but i am of too frank a nature my success and the joy i have because of the jewel i am half in possession of has not only unlocked my bosom but left the door quite open this is a confounded sly sex would she but speak out as i do but i must learn reserves of her she must needs be unprovided of money but has too much pride to accept of any from me i would have had her go to town to town if possible must i get her to consent to go in order to provide herself with the richest of silks which that can afford but neither is this to be assented to and yet as my intelligencer acquaints me her implacable relations are resolved to distress her all they can these wretches have been most gloriously raving ever since her flight and still thank heaven continue to rave and will i hope for a twelvemonth to come now at last it is my day bitterly do they regret that they permitted her poultryvisits and gardenwalks which gave her the opportunity to effect an escape which they suppose preconcerted for as to her dining in the ivybower they had a cunning design to answer upon her in that permission as betty told joseph her lover vol ii letter xlvii paragr they lost they say and excellent pretence for confining her more closely on my threatening to rescue her if they offered to carry her against her will to old antonys moated house for this as i told thee at the hart and as i once hinted to the dear creature herself they had it in deliberation to do apprehending that i might attempt to carry her off either with or without her consent on some one of those connivedat excursions ibid let xxxvi and let xxxix par i ibid let xxxvi par see also let xv par but here my honest joseph who gave me the information was of admirable service to me i had taught him to make the harlowes believe that i was as communicative to my servants as their stupid james was to joseph joseph as they supposed by tampering with will got all my secrets and was acquainted with all my motions and having also undertaken to watch all those of his young lady the wise family were secure and so was my beloved and so was i ibid letter xlvii par and this will be farther explained in letter xxi of this volume see vol i letters xxxi and xxxiv i once had it in my head and i hinted it to thee in a former in case such a step should be necessary to attempt to carry her off by surprise from the woodhouse as it is remote from the dwellinghouse this had i attempted i should have certainly effected by the help of the confraternity and it would have been an action worthy of us all but josephs conscience as he called it stood in my way for he thought it must have been known to be done by his connivance i could i dare say have overcome this scruple as easily as i did many of the others had i not depended at one time upon her meeting me at midnight or late hour and if she had she never would have gone back at other times upon the cunning familys doing my work for me equally against their knowledge or their wills see vol i letter xxxv for well i knew that james and arabella were determined never to leave off their foolish trials and provocations till by tiring her out they had either made her solmess wife or guilty of some such rashness as should throw her for ever out of the favour of both her uncles though they had too much malice in their heads to intend service to me by their persecutions of her letter xii mr lovelace to john belford esq in continuation i obliged the dear creature highly i could perceive by bringing mrs greme to attend her and to suffer that good womans recommendation of lodgings to take place on her refusal to go to the lawn she must believe all my views to be honourable when i had provided for her no particular lodgings leaving it to her choice whether she would go to m hall to the lawn to london or to either of the dowagers of my family she was visibly pleased with my motion of putting mrs greme into the chaise with her and riding on horseback myself some people would have been apprehensive of what might pass between her and mrs greme but as all my relations either know or believe the justice of my intentions by her i was in no pain on that account and the less as i have always been above hypocrisy or wishing to be thought better than i am and indeed what occasion has a man to be an hypocrite who has hitherto found his views upon the sex better answered for his being known to be a rake why even my beloved here denied not to correspond with me though her friends had taught her to think me a libertine who then would be trying a new and worse character and then mrs greme is a pious matron and would not have been biased against truth on any consideration she used formerly while there were any hopes of my reformation to pray for me she hardly continues the good custom i doubt for her worthy lord makes no scruple occasionally to rave against me to man woman and child as they come in his way he is very undutiful as thou knowest surely i may say so since all duties are reciprocal but for mrs greme poor woman when my lord has the gout and is at the lawn and the chaplain not to be found she prays by him or reads a chapter to him in the bible or some other good book was it not therefore right to introduce such a good sort of woman to the dear creature and to leave them without reserve to their own talk and very busy in talk i saw they were as they rode and felt it too for most charmingly glowed my cheeks i hope i shall be honest i once more say but as we frail mortals are not our own masters at all times i must endeavour to keep the dear creature unapprehensive until i can get her to our acquaintances in london or to some other safe place there should i in the interim give her the least room for suspicion or offer to restrain her she can make her appeals to strangers and call the country in upon me and perhaps throw herself upon her relations on their own terms and were i now to lose her how unworthy should i be to be the prince and leader of such a confraternity as ours how unable to look up among men or to shew my face among women as things at present stand she dare not own that she went off against her own consent and i have taken care to make all the implacables believe that she escaped with it she has received an answer from miss howe to the letter written to her from st albans see vol ii letter xlviii whatever are the contents i know not but she was drowned in tears on the perusal of it and i am the sufferer miss howe is a charming creature too but confoundedly smart and spiritful i am a good deal afraid of her her mother can hardly keep her in i must continue to play off old antony by my honest joseph upon that mother in order to manage that daughter and oblige my beloved to an absolute dependence upon myself see vol i letter xxxi mrs howe is impatient of contradiction so is miss a young lady who is sensible that she has all the materials requisites herself to be under maternal controul fine ground for a man of intrigue to build upon a mother overnotable a daughter oversensible and their hickman who is overneither but merely a passive only that i have an object still more desirable yet how unhappy that these two young ladies lived so near each other and are so well acquainted else how charmingly might i have managed them both but one man cannot have every woman worth having pity though when the man is such a very clever fellow letter xiii mr lovelace to john belford esq in continuation never was there such a pair of scribbling lovers as we yet perhaps whom it so much concerns to keep from each other what each writes she wont have any thing else to do i would if shed let me i am not reformed enough for a husband patience is a virtue lord m says slow and sure is another of his sentences if i had not a great deal of that virtue i should not have waited the harlowes own time of ripening into execution my plots upon themselves and upon their goddess daughter my beloved has been writing to her saucy friend i believe all that has befallen her and what has passed between us hitherto she will possibly have fine subjects for her pen if she be as minute as i am i would not be so barbarous as to permit old antony to set mrs howe against her did i not dread the consequences of the correspondence between the two young ladies so lively the one so vigilant so prudent both who would not wish to outwit such girls and to be able to twirl them round his finger my charmer has written to her sister for her clothes for some gold and for some of her books what books can tell her more than she knows but i can so she had better study me she may write she must be obliged to me at last with all her pride miss howe indeed will be ready enough to supply her but i question whether she can do it without her mother who is as covetous as the grave and my agents agent old antony has already given the mother a hint which will make her jealous of pecuniaries besides if miss howe has money by her i can put her mother upon borrowing it of her nor blame me jack for contrivances that have their foundation in generosity thou knowest my spirit and that i should be proud to lay an obligation upon my charmer to the amount of half nay to the whole of my estate lord m has more for me than i can ever wish for my predominant passion is girl not gold nor value i this but as it helps me to that and gives me independence i was forced to put it into the sweet novices head as well for my sake as for hers lest we should be traceable by her direction whither to direct the sending of her clothes if they incline to do her that small piece of justice if they do i shall begin to dread a reconciliation and must be forced to muse for a contrivance or two to prevent it and to avoid mischief for that as i have told honest joseph leman is a great point with me thou wilt think me a sad fellow i doubt but are not all rakes sad fellows and art not thou to thy little power as bad as any if thou dost all thats in thy head and in thy heart to do thou art worse than i for i do not i assure you i proposed and she consented that her clothes or whatever else her relations should think fit to send her should be directed to thy cousin osgoods let a special messenger at my charge bring me any letter or portable parcel that shall come if not portable give me notice of it but thoult have no trouble of this sort from her relations i dare be sworn and in this assurance i will leave them i think to act upon their own heads a man would have no more to answer for than needs must but one thing while i think of it which is of great importance to be attended to you must hereafter write to me in character as i shall do to you it would be a confounded thing to be blown up by a train of my own laying and who knows what opportunities a man in love may have against himself in changing a coat or waistcoat something might be forgotten i once suffered that way then for the sexs curiosity it is but remembering in order to guard against it that the name of their common mother was eve another thing remember i have changed my name changed it without an act of parliament robert huntingford it is now continue esquire it is a respectable addition although every sorry fellow assumes it almost to the banishment of the usual traveling one of captain to be left till called for at the posthouse at hertford upon naming thee she asked thy character i gave thee a better than thou deservest in order to do credit to myself yet i told her that thou wert an awkward fellow and this to do credit to thee that she may not if ever she be to see thee expect a cleverer man than shell find yet thy apparent awkwardness befriends thee not a little for wert thou a sightly mortal people would discover nothing extraordinary in thee when they conversed with thee whereas seeing a bear they are surprised to find in thee any thing that is like a man felicitate thyself then upon thy defects which are evidently thy principal perfections and which occasion thee a distinction which otherwise thou wouldst never have the lodgings we are in at present are not convenient i was so delicate as to find fault with them as communicating with each other because i knew she would and told her that were i sure she was safe from pursuit i would leave her in them since such was her earnest desire and expectation and go to london she must be an infidel against all reason and appearances if i do not banish even the shadow of mistrust from her heart here are two young likely girls daughters of the widow sorlings thats the name of our landlady i have only at present admired them in their dairyworks how greedily do the sex swallow praise did i not once in the streets of london see a welldressed handsome girl laugh bridle and visibly enjoy the praises of a sooty dog a chimneysweeper who with his empty sack across his shoulder after giving her the way stopt and held up his brush and shovel in admiration of her egad girl thought i i despise thee as lovelace but were i the chimneysweeper and could only contrive to get into thy presence my life to thy virtue i would have thee so pleased was i with the young sorlings for the elegance of her works that i kissed her and she made me a courtesy for my condescension and blushed and seemed sensible all over encouraging yet innocently she adjusted her handkerchief and looked towards the door as much as to say she would not tell were i to kiss her again her eldest sister popt upon her the conscious girl blushed again and looked so confounded that i made an excuse for her which gratified both mrs betty said i i have been so much pleased with the neatness of your dairyworks that i could not help saluting your sister you have your share of merit in them i am sure give me leave good souls i like them both she courtesied too how i love a grateful temper o that my clarissa were but half so acknowledging i think i must get one of them to attend my charmer when she removes the mother seems to be a notable woman she had not best however be too notable since were she by suspicion to give me a face of difficulty to the matter it would prepare me for a trial with one or both the daughters allow me a little rhodamantade jack but really and truly my heart is fixed i can think of no creature breathing of the sex but my gloriana letter xiv mr lovelace to john belford esq in continuation this is wednesday the day that i was to have lost my charmer for ever to the hideous solmes with what high satisfaction and heartsease can i now sit down and triumph over my men in straw at harloweplace yet tis perhaps best for them that she got off as she did who knows what consequences might have followed upon my attending her in or if she had not met me upon my projected visit followed by my myrmidons but had i even gone in with her unaccompanied i think i had but little reason for apprehension for well thou knowest that the tame spirits which value themselves upon reputation and are held within the skirts of the law by political considerations only may be compared to an infectious spider which will run into his hole the moment one of his threads is touched by a finger that can crush him leaving all his toils defenceless and to be brushed down at the will of the potent invader while a silly fly that has neither courage nor strength to resist no sooner gives notice by its buz and its struggles of its being entangled but out steps the selfcircumscribed tyrant winds round and round the poor insect till he covers it with his bowelspun toils and when so fully secured that it can neither move leg nor wing suspends it as if for a spectacle to be exulted over then stalking to the door of his cell turns about glotes over it at a distance and sometimes advancing sometimes retiring preys at leisure upon its vitals but now i think of it will not this comparison do as well for the entangled girls as for the tame spirits better o my conscience tis but comparing the spider to us brave fellows and it quadrates whatever our hearts are in our heads will follow begin with spiders with flies with what we will girl is the centre of gravity and we all naturally tend to it nevertheless to recur i cannot but observe that these tame spirits stand a poor chance in a fairly offensive war with such of us mad fellows as are above all law and scorn to sculk behind the hypocritical screen of reputation thou knowest that i never scruple to throw myself amongst numbers of adversaries the more the safer one or two no fear will take the part of a single adventurer if not intentionally in fact holding him in while others hold in the principal antagonist to the augmentation of their mutual prowess till both are prevailed upon to compromise or one to be absent so that upon the whole the lawbreakers have the advantage of the lawkeepers all the world over at least for a time and till they have run to the end of their race add to this in the question between me and the harlowes that the whoe family of them must know that they have injured me must therefore be afraid of me did they not at their own church cluster together like bees when they saw me enter it nor knew they which should venture out first when the service was over james indeed was not there if he had he would perhaps have endeavoured to look valiant but there is a sort of valour in the face which shews fear in the heart just such a face would james harlowes have been had i made them a visit when i have had such a face and such a heart as i have described to deal with i have been all calm and serene and left it to the friends of the blusterer as i have done to the harlowes to do my work for me i am about mustering up in my memory all that i have ever done that has been thought praiseworthy or but barely tolerable i am afraid thou canst not help me to many remembrances of this sort because i never was so bad as since i have known thee have i not had it in my heart to do some good that thou canst not remind me of study for me jack i have recollected some instances which i think will tell in but see if thou canst not help me to some which i may have forgot this i may venture to say that the principal blot in my escutcheon is owing to these girls these confounded girls but for them i could go to church with a good conscience but when i do there they are every where does satan spread his snares for me but how i think of it what if our governor should appoint churches for the women only and others for the men full as proper i think for the promoting of true piety in both much better than the synagoguelattices as separate boarding schools for their education there are already male and female dedications of churches st swithins st stephens st thomass st georges and so forth might be appropriated to the men and santa catharinas santa annas santa marias santa margarettas for the women yet were it so and life to be the forfeiture of being found at the female churches i believe that i like a second clodius should change my dress to come at my portia or pompeia though one the daughter of a cato the other the wife of a caesar but how i excurse yet thou usedst to say thou likedst my excursions if thou dost thoult have enow of them for i never had a subject i so much adored and with which i shall probably be compelled to have so much patience before i strike the blow if the blow i do strike but let me call myself back to my recordationsubject thou needest not remind me of my rosebud i have her in my head and moreover have contrived to give my fairone an hint of that affair by the agency of honest joseph leman although i have not reaped the hopedfor credit of her acknowledgement see vol ii letter xxvii thats the devil and it was always my hard fate every thing i do that is good is but as i ought every thing of a contrary nature is brought into the most glaring light against me is this fair ought not a balance to be struck and the credit carried to my account yet i must own too that i half grudge johnny this blooming maiden for in truth i think a fine woman too rich a jewel to hang about a poor mans neck surely jack if i am guilty of a fault in my universal adorations of the sex the women in general ought to love me the better for it and so they do i thank them heartily except here and there a covetous little rogue comes cross me who under the pretence of loving virtue for its own sake wants to have me all to herself i have rambled enough adieu for the present letter xv miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe thursday night april i always loved writing and my unhappy situation gives me now enough of it and you i fear too much i have had another very warm debate with mr lovelace it brought on the subject which you advised me not to decline when it was handsomely offered and i want to have either your acquittal or blame for having suffered it to go off without effect the impatient wretch sent up to me several times while i was writing my last to you to desire my company yet his business nothing particular only to hear him talk the man seems pleased with his own volubility and whenever he has collected together abundance of smooth things he wants me to find an ear for them yet he need not for i dont often gratify him either with giving him the praise for his verboseness or shewing the pleasure in it that he would be fond of when i had finished the letter and given it to mr hickmans friend i was going up again and had got up half a dozen stairs when he besought be to stop and hear what he had to say nothing as i said to any new purpose had he to offer but complainings and those in a manner and with an air as i thought that bordered upon insolence he could not live he told me unless he had more of my company and of my indulgence too that i had yet given him hereupon i stept down and into the parlour not a little out of humour with him and the more as he has very quietly taken up his quarters here without talking of removing as he had promised we began instantly our angry conference he provoked me and i repeated several of the plainest things i had said in our former conversations and particularly told him that i was every hour more and more dissatisfied with myself and with him that he was not a man who in my opinion improved upon acquaintance and that i should not be easy till he had left me to myself he might be surprised at my warmth perhaps but really the man looked so like a simpleton hesitating and having nothing to say for himself or that should excuse the peremptoriness of his demand upon me when he knew i had been writing a letter which a gentleman waited for that i flung from him declaring that i would be mistress of my own time and of my own actions and not to be called to account for either he was very uneasy till he could again be admitted into my company and when i was obliged to see him which was sooner than i liked never did the man put on a more humble and respectful demeanor he told me that he had upon this occasion been entering into himself and had found a great deal of reason to blame himself for an impertinency and inconsideration which although he meant nothing by it must be very disagreeable to one of my delicacy that having always aimed at a manly sincerity and openness of heart he had not till now discovered that both were very consistent with that true politeness which he feared he had too much disregarded while he sought to avoid the contrary extreme knowing that in me he had to deal with a lady who despised an hypocrite and who was above all flattery but from this time forth i should find such an alteration in his whole behaviour as might be expected from a man who knew himself to be honoured with the presence and conversation of a person who had the most delicate mind in the world that was his flourish i said that he might perhaps expect congratulation upon the discovery he had just now made to wit that true politeness and sincerity were reconcilable but that i who had by a perverse fate been thrown into his company had abundant reason to regret that he had not sooner found this out since i believed very few men of birth and education were strangers to it he knew not neither he said that he had so badly behaved himself as to deserve so very severe a rebuke perhaps not i replied but he might if so make another discovery from what i had said which might be to my own disadvantage since if he had so much reason to be satisfied with himself he would see what an ungenerous person he spoke to who when he seemed to give himself airs of humility which perhaps he thought beneath him to assume had not the civility to make him a compliment upon them but was ready to take him at his word he had long with infinite pleasure the pretended flatteryhater said admired my superior talents and a wisdom in so young a lady perfectly suprising let me madam said he stand ever so low in your opinion i shall believe all you say to be just and that i have nothing to do but to govern myself for the future by your example and by the standard you shall be pleased to give me i know better sir replied i than to value myself upon your volubility of speech as you pretend to pay so preferable a regard to sincerity you shall confine yourself to the strict rules of truth when you speak of me to myself and then although you shall be so kind as to imagine that you have reason to make me a compliment you will have much more to pride yourself in those arts which have made so extraordinary a young creature so great a fool really my dear the man deserves not politer treatment and then has he not made a fool an egregious fool of me i am afraid he himself thinks he has i am surprised i am amazed madam returned he at so strange a turn upon me i am very unhappy that nothing i can do or say will give you a good opinion of me would to heaven that i knew what i can do to obtain the honour of your confidence i told him that i desired his absence of all things i saw not i said that my friends thought it worth their while to give me disturbance therefore if he would set out for london or berkshire or whither he pleased it would be most agreeable to me and most reputable too he would do so he said he intended to do so the moment i was in a place to my liking in a place convenient for me this sir will be so said i when you are not here to break in upon me and make the apartments inconvenient he did not think this place safe he replied and as i intended not to stay here he had not been so solicitous as otherwise he should have been to enjoin privacy to his servants nor to mrs greme at her leaving me that there were two or three gentlemen at the neighbourhood he said with whose servants his gossiping fellows had scraped acquaintance so that he could not think of leaving me here unguarded and unattended but fix upon any place in england where i could be out of danger and he would go to the furthermost part of the kings dominions if by doing so he could make me easy i told him plainly that i should never be in humour with myself for meeting him nor with him for seducing me away that my regrets increased instead of diminished that my reputation was wounded that nothing i could do would now retrieve it and that he must not wonder if i every hour grew more and more uneasy both with myself and him that upon the whole i was willing to take care of myself and when he had left me i should best know what to resolve upon and whither to go he wished he said he were at liberty without giving me offence or being thought to intend to infringe the articles i had stipulated and insisted upon to make one humble proposal to me but the sacred regard he was determined to pay to all my injunctions reluctantly as i had on monday last put it into his power to serve me would not permit him to make it unless i would promise to excuse him if i did not approve of it i asked in some confusion what he would say he prefaced and paraded on and then out came with great diffidence and many apologies and a bashfulness which sat very awkwardly upon him a proposal of speedy solemnization which he said would put all right and make my first three or four months which otherwise must be passed in obscurity and apprehension a round of visits and visitings to and from all his relations to miss howe to whom i pleased and would pave the way to the reconciliation i had so much at heart your advice had great weight with me just then as well as his reasons and the consideration of my unhappy situation but what could i say i wanted somebody to speak for me the man saw i was not angry at his motion i only blushed and that i am sure i did up to the ears and looked silly and like a fool he wants not courage would he have had me catch at his first at his very first word i was silent too and do not the bold sex take silence for a mark of a favour then so lately in my fathers house having also declared to him in my letters before i had your advice that i would not think of marriage till he had passed through a state of probation as i may call it how was it possible i could encourage with very ready signs of approbation such an early proposal especially so soon after the free treatment he had provoked from me if i were to die i could not he looked at me with great confidence as if notwithstanding his contradictory bashfulness he would look me through while my eye but nowandthen could glance at him he begged my pardon with great humility he was afraid i would think he deserved no other answer but that of a contemptuous silence true love was fearful of offending take care mr lovelace thought i how yours is tried by that rule indeed so sacred a regard foolish man would he have to all my declarations made before i honoured him i would hear him no further but withdrew in a confusion too visible and left him to make his nonsensical flourishes to himself i will only add that if he really wishes for a speedy solemnization he never could have had a luckier time to press for my consent to it but he let it go off and indignation has taken place of it and now it shall be a point with me to get him at a distance from me i am my dearest friend your ever faithful and obliged cl h letter xvi mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday apr why jack thou needest not make such a wonderment as the girls say if i should have taken large strides already towards reformation for dost thou not see that while i have been so assiduously night and day pursuing this single charmer i have infinitely less to answer for than otherwise i should have had let me see how many days and nights forty i believe after open trenches spent in the sap only and never a mine sprung yet by a moderate computation a dozen kites might have fallen while i have been only trying to ensnare this single lark nor yet do i see when i shall be able to bring her to my lure more innocent days yet therefore but reformation for my stalkinghorse i hope will be a sure though a slow method to effect all my purposes then jack thou wilt have a merit too in engaging my pen since thy time would be otherwise worse employed and after all who knows but by creating new habits at the expense of the old a real reformation may be brought about i have promised it and i believe there is a pleasure to be found in being good reversing that of nat lees madman which none but good men know by all this seest thou not how greatly preferable it is on twenty accounts to pursue a difficult rather than an easy chace i have a desire to inculcate this pleasure upon thee and to teach thee to fly at nobler game than daws crows and widgeons i have a mind to shew thee from time to time in the course of the correspondence thou hast so earnestly wished me to begin on this illustrious occasion that these exalted ladies may be abased and to obviate one of the objections that thou madest to me when we were last together that the pleasure which attends these nobler aims remunerates not the pains they bring with them since like a paltry fellow as thou wert thou assertedst that all women are alike thou knowest nothing jack of the delicacies of intrigue nothing of the glory of outwitting the witty and the watchful of the joys that fill the mind of the inventive or contriving genius ruminating which to use of the different webs that offer to him for the entanglement of a haughty charmer who in her day has given him unnumbered torments thou jack who like a dog at his ease contentest thyself to growl over a bone thrown out to thee dost not know the joys of a chace and in pursuing a winding game these i will endeavour to rouse thee to and then thou wilt have reason doubly and trebly to thank me as well because of thy present delight as with regard to thy prospect beyond the moon to this place i had written purely to amuse myself before i was admitted to my charmer but now i have to tell thee that i was quite right in my conjecture that she would set up for herself and dismiss me for she has declared in so many words that such was her resolution and why because to be plain with me the more she saw of me and of my ways the less she liked of either this cut me to the heart i did not cry indeed had i been a woman i should though and that most plentifully but i pulled out a white cambrick handkerchief that i could command but not my tears she finds fault with my protestations with my professions with my vows i cannot curse a servant the only privilege a master is known by but i am supposed to be a trooper i must not say by my soul nor as i hope to be saved why jack how particular this is would she not have me think i have a precious soul as well as she if she thinks my salvation hopeless what a devil another exceptionable word does she propose to reform me for so i have not an ardent expression left me see letter vi of this volume what can be done with a woman who is above flattery and despises all praise but that which flows from the approbation of her own heart well jack thou seest it is high time to change my measures i must run into the pious a little faster than i had designed what a sad thing it would be were i after all to lose her person as well as her opinion the only time that further acquaintance and no blow struck nor suspicion given ever lessened me in a ladys favour a cursed mortification tis certain i can have no pretence for holding her if she will go no such thing as force to be used or so much as hinted at lord send us safe at london thats all i have for it now and yet it must be the least part of my speech but why will this admirable creature urge her destiny why will she defy the power she is absolutely dependent upon why will she still wish to my face that she had never left her fathers house why will she deny me her company till she makes me lose my patience and lay myself open to her resentment and why when she is offended does she carry her indignation to the utmost length that a scornful beauty in the very height of her power and pride can go is it prudent thinkest thou in her circumstances to tell me repeatedly to tell me that she is every hour more and more dissatisfied with herself and me that i am not one who improve upon her in my conversation and address couldst thou jack bear this from a captive that she shall not be easy while she is with me that she knows better than to value herself upon my volubility that if i think she deserves the compliments i make her i may pride myself in those arts by which i have made a fool of so extraordinary a person that she shall never forgive herself for meeting me nor me for seducing her away her very words that her regrets increase instead of diminish that she will take care of herself and since her friends thing it not worth while to pursue her she will be left to her own care that i shall make mrs sorlingss house more agreeable by my absence and go to berks to town or wherever i will to the devil i suppose with all her heart the impolitic charmer to a temper so vindictive as she thins mine to a freeliver as she believes me to be who has her in his power i was before as thou knowest balancing now this scale now that the heaviest i only waited to see how her will would work how mine would lead me on thou seest what bias here takes and wilt thou doubt that mine will be determined by it were not her faults before this numerous enough why will she put me upon looking back i will sit down to argue with myself byandby and thou shalt be acquainted with the result if thou didst but know if thou hadst but beheld what an abject slave she made me look like i had given myself high airs as she called them but they were airs that shewed my love for her that shewed i could not live out of her company but she took me down with a vengeance she made me look about me so much advantage had she over me such severe turns upon me by my soul jack i had hardly a word to say for myself i am ashamed to tell thee what a poor creature she made me look like but i could have told her something that would have humbled her pretty pride at the instant had she been in a proper place and proper company about her to such a place then and where she cannot fly me and then to see how my will works and what can be done with the amorous seesaw now humble now proud now expecting or demanding now submitting or acquiescing till i have tried resistance but these hints are at present enough i may further explain myself as i go along and as i confirm or recede in my future motions if she will revive past disobligations if she will but no more no more as i said at present of threatenings letter xvii mr lovelace to john belford esq in continuation and do i not see that i shall need nothing but patience in order to have all power with me for what shall we say if all these complaints of a character wounded these declarations of increasing regrets for meeting me of resentments never to be got over for my seducing her away these angry commands to leaver her what shall we say if all were to mean nothing but matrimony and what if my forbearing to enter upon that subject come out to be the true cause of their petulance and uneasiness i had once before played about the skirts of the irrevocable obligation but thought myself obliged to speak in clouds and to run away from the subject as soon as she took my meaning lest she should imagine it to be ungenerously urged now she was in some sort in my power as she had forbid me beforehand to touch upon it till i were in a state of visible reformation and till a reconciliation with her friends were probable but now outargued outtalented and pushed so vehemently to leave one of whom i had no good pretence to hold if she would go and who could so easily if i had given her cause to doubt have thrown herself into other protection or have returned to harloweplace and solmes i spoke out upon the subject and offered reasons although with infinite doubt and hesitation lest she should be offended at me belford why she should assent to the legal tie and make me the happiest of men and o how the mantle cheek the downcast eye the silent yet trembling lip and the heaving bosom a sweet collection of heightened beauties gave evidence that the tender was not mortally offensive charming creature thought i but i charge thee that thou let not any of the sex know my exultation is it so soon come to this am i already lord of the destiny of a clarissa harlowe am i already the reformed man thou resolvest i should be before i had the least encouragement given me is it thus that the more thou knowest me the less thou seest reason to approve of me and can art and design enter into a breast so celestial to banish me from thee to insist so rigorously upon my absence in order to bring me closer to thee and make the blessing dear well do thy arts justify mine and encourage me to let loose my plotting genius upon thee mr lovelace might have spared this caution on this occasion since many of the sex we mention it with regret who on the first publication had read thus far and even to the ladys first escape have been readier to censure her for overniceness as we have observed in a former note page than him for artifices and exultations not less cruel and ungrateful than ungenerous and unmanly but let me tell thee charming maid if thy wishes are at all to be answered that thou hast yet to account to me for thy reluctance to go off with me at a crisis when thy going off was necessary to avoid being forced into the nuptial fetters with a wretch that were he not thy aversion thou wert no more honest to thy own merit than to me i am accustomed to be preferred let me tell thee by thy equals in rank too though thy inferiors in merit but who is not so and shall i marry a woman who has given me reason to doubt the preference she has for me no my dearest love i have too sacred a regard for thy injunctions to let them be broken through even by thyself nor will i take in thy full meaning by blushing silence only nor shalt thou give me room to doubt whether it be necessity or love that inspires this condescending impulse upon these principles what had i to do but to construe her silence into contemptuous displeasure and i begged her pardon for making a motion which i had so much reason to fear would offend her for the future i would pay a sacred regard to her previous injunctions and prove to her by all my conduct the truth of that observation that true love is always fearful of offending and what could the lady say to this methinks thou askest say why she looked vexed disconcerted teased was at a loss as i thought whether to be more angry with herself or with me she turned about however as if to hide a starting tear and drew a sigh into two or three but just audible quavers trying to suppress it and withdrew leaving me master of the field tell me not of politeness tell me not of generosity tell me not of compassion is she not a match for me more than a match does she not outdo me at every fair weapon has she not made me doubt her love has she not taken officious pains to declare that she was not averse to solmes for any respect she had to me and her sorrow for putting herself out of his reach that is to say for meeting me then what a triumph would it be to the harlowe pride were i now to marry this lady a family beneath my own no one in it worthy of an alliance with but her my own estate not contemptible living within the bounds of it to avoid dependence upon their betters and obliged to no man living my expectations still so much more considerable my person my talents not to be despised surely yet rejected by them with scorn obliged to carry on an underhand address to their daughter when two of the most considerable families in the kingdom have made overtures which i have declined partly for her sake and partly because i never will marry if she be not the person to be forced to steal her away not only from them but from herself and must i be brought to implore forgiveness and reconciliation from the harlowes beg to be acknowledged as the son of a gloomy tyrant whose only boast is his riches as a brother to a wretch who has conceived immortal hatred to me and to a sister who was beneath my attempts or i would have had her in my own way and that with a tenth part of the trouble and pains that her sister has cost me and finally as a nephew to uncles who value themselves upon their acquired fortunes would insult me as creeping to them on that account forbid it in the blood of the lovelaces that your last and let me say not the meanest of your stock should thus creep thus fawn thus lick the dust for a wife proceed anon letter xviii mr lovelace to john belford esq in continuation but is it not the divine clarissa harlowe let me not say my soul spurns them all but her whom i am thus by application threatening if virtue be the true nobility how is she ennobled and how shall an alliance with her ennoble were not contempt due to the family from whom she sprang and prefers to me but again let me stop is there not something wrong has there not been something wrong in this divine creature and will not the reflections upon that wrong what though it may be construed in my favour make me unhappy when novelty has lost its charms and when mind and person she is all my own libertines are nicer if at all nice than other men they seldom meet with the stand of virtue in the women whom they attempt and by the frailty of those they have triumphed over they judge of all the rest importunity and opportunity no woman is proof against especially from the persevering lover who knows how to suit temptations to inclinations this thou knowest is a prime article of the rakes creed the particular attention of such of the fair sex as are more apt to read for the same of amusement than instruction is requested to this letter of mr lovelace and what methinks thou askest with surprise dost thou question this most admirable of women the virtue of a clarissa dost thou question i do not i dare not question it my reverence for her will not let me directly question it but let me in my turn ask thee is not may not her virtue be founded rather in pride than in principle whose daughter is she and is she not a daughter if impeccable how came she by her impeccability the pride of setting an example to her sex has run away with her hitherto and may have made her till now invincible but is not that pride abated what may not both men and women be brought to do in a mortified state what mind is superior to calamity pride is perhaps the principal bulwark of female virtue humble a woman and may she not be effectually humbled then who says miss clarissa harlowe is the paragon of virtue is virtue itself all who know her and have heard of her it will be answered common bruit is virtue to be established by common bruit only has her virtue ever been proved who has dared to try her virtue i told thee i would sit down to argue with myself and i have drawn myself into argumentation before i was aware let me enter into a strict discussion of this subject i know how ungenerous an appearance what i have said and what i have further to say on this topic will have from me but am i not bringing virtue to the touchstone with a view to exalt it if it come out to be proof avaunt then for one moment all consideration that may arise from a weakness which some would miscall gratitude and is oftentimes the corrupter of a heart most ignoble to the test then and i will bring this charming creature to the strictest test that all the sex who may be shewn any passages in my letters and i know thou cheerest the hearts of all thy acquaintance with such detached parts of mine as tend not to dishonour characters or reveal names and this gives me an appetite to oblige thee by interlardment that all the sex i say may see what they ought to be what is expected from them and if they have to deal with a person of reflection and punctilio of pride if thou wilt how careful they ought to be by a regular and uniform conduct not to give him cause to think lightly of them for favours granted which may be interpreted into natural weakness for is not a wife the keeper of a mans honour and do not her faults bring more disgrace upon a husband than even upon herself it is not for nothing jack that i have disliked the life of shackles to the test then as i said since now i have the question brought home to me whether i am to have a wife and whether she be to be a wife at the first or at the second hand i will proceed fairly i do the dear creature not only strict but generous justice for i will try her by her own judgment as well as by our principles she blames herself for having corresponded with me a man of free character and one indeed whose first view it was to draw her into this correspondence and who succeeded in it by means unknown to herself now what were her inducements to this correspondence if not what her niceness makes her think blameworthy why does she blame herself has she been capable of error of persisting in that error whoever was the tempter that is not the thing nor what the temptation the fact the error is now before us did she persist in it against parental prohibition she owns she did was a daughter ever known who had higher notions of the filial duty of the parental authority never what must be the inducements how strong that were too strong for duty in a daughter so dutiful what must my thoughts have been of these inducements what my hopes built upon them at the time taken in this light well but it will be said that her principal view was to prevent mischief between her brother and her other friends and the man vilely insulted by them all but why should she be more concerned for the safety of others than they were for their own and had not the rencounter then happened was a person of virtue to be prevailed upon to break through her apparent her acknowledged duty upon any consideration and if not was she to be so prevailed upon to prevent an apprehended evil only thou lovelace the tempter thou wilt again break out and say to be the accuser but i am not the accuser i am the arguer only and in my heart all the time acquit and worship the divine creature but let me nevertheless examine whether the acquital be owing to her merit or to my weakness weakness the true name of love but shall we suppose another motive and that is love a motive which all the world will excuse her for but let me tell all the world that do not because they ought but because all the world is apt to be misled by it let love then be the motive love of whom a lovelace is the answer is there but one lovelace in the world may not more lovelaces be attracted by so fine a figure by such exalted qualities it was her character that drew me to her and it was her beauty and good sense that rivetted my chains and now all together make me think her a subject worthy of my attempts worthy of my ambition but has she had the candour the openness to acknowledge that love she has not well then if love be at the bottom is there not another fault lurking beneath the shadow of that love has she not affectation or is it pride of heart and what results is then the divine clarissa capable of loving a man whom she ought not to love and is she capable of affectation and is her virtue founded in pride and if the answer to these questions be affirmative must she not then be a woman and can she keep this love at bay can she make him who has been accustomed to triumph over other women tremble can she conduct herself as to make him at times question whether she loves him or any man yet not have the requisite command over the passion itself in steps of the highest consequence to her honour as she thinks i am trying her jack by her own thoughts but suffer herself to be provoked to promise to abandon her fathers house and go off with him knowing his character and even conditioning not to marry till improbably and remote contingencies were to come to pass what though the provocations were such as would justify any other woman yet was a clarissa to be susceptible to provocations which she thinks herself highly censurable for being so much moved by but let us see the dear creature resolved to revoke her promise yet meeting her lover a bold and intrepid man who was more than once before disappointed by her and who comes as she knows prepared to expect the fruits of her appointment and resolved to carry her off and let us see him actually carrying her off and having her at his mercy may there not be i repeat other lovelaces other like intrepid persevering enterprizers although they may not go to work in the same way and has then a clarissa herself her judge failed in such great points failed and may she not further fail fail in the greatest point to which all the other points in which she has failed have but a natural tendency nor say thou that virtue in the eye of heaven is as much a manly as a womanly grace by virtue in this place i mean chastity and to be superior to temptation my clarissa out of the question nor ask thou shall the man be guilty yet expect the woman to be guiltless and even unsuspectible urge thou not these arguments i say since the wife by a failure may do much more injury to the husband than the husband can do to the wife and not only to her husband but to all his family by obtruding another mans children into his possessions perhaps to the exclusion of at least to a participation with his own he believing them all the time to be his in the eye of heaven therefore the sin cannot be equal besides i have read in some places that the woman was made for the man not the man for the woman virtue then is less to be dispensed with in the woman than in the man thou lovelace methinks some better man than thyself will say to expect such perfection in a woman yes i may i answer was not the great caesar a great rake as to women was he not called by his very soldiers on one of his triumphant entries into rome the baldpated lecher and warning given of him to the wives as well as to the daughter of his fellowcitizens yet did not caesar repudiate his wife for being only in company with clodius or rather because clodius though by surprise upon her was found in hers and what was the reason he gave for it it was this though a rake himself as i have said and only this the wife of caesar must not be suspected caesar was not a prouder man than lovelace go to then jack nor say nor let any body say in thy hearing that lovelace a man valuing himself upon his ancestry is singular in his expectations of a wifes purity though not pure himself as to my clarissa i own that i hardly think there ever was such an angel of a woman but has she not as above already taken steps which she herself condemns steps which the world and her own family did not think her capable of taking and for which her own family will not forgive her nor think it strange that i refuse to hear any thing pleaded in behalf of a standard virtue from high provocations are not provocations and temptations the tests of virtue a standard virtue must not be allowed to be provoked to destroy or annihilate itself may not then the success of him who could carry her thus far be allowed to be an encouragement for him to try to carry her farther tis but to try who will be afraid of a trail for this divine creature thou knowest that i have more than once twice or thrice put to the fiery trial young women of name and character and never yet met with one who held out a month nor indeed so long as could puzzle my invention i have concluded against the whole sex upon it and now if i have not found a virtue that cannot be corrupted i will swear that there is not one such in the whole sex is not then the whole sex concerned that this trial should be made and who is it that knows this lady that would not stake upon her head the honour of the whole let her who would refuse it come forth and desire to stand in her place i must assure thee that i have a prodigious high opinion of virtue as i have of all those graces and excellencies which i have not been able to attain myself every freeliver would not say this nor think thus every argument he uses condemnatory of his own actions as some would think but ingenuousness was ever a signal part of my character satan whom thou mayest if thou wilt in this case call my instigator put the good man of old upon the severest trial to his behaviour under these trials that good man owed his honour and his future rewards an innocent person if doubted must wish to be brought to a fair and candid trial rinaldo indeed in ariosto put the mantua knights cup of trial from him which was to be the proof of his wifes chastity this was his argument for forbearing the experiment why should i seek a think i should be loth to find my wife is a woman the sex is frail i cannot believe better of her than i do it will be to my own loss if i find reason to think worse but rinaldo would not have refused the trial of the lady before she became his wife and when he might have found his account in detecting her the story tells us that whoever drank of this cup if his wife were chaste could drink without spilling if otherwise the contrary for my part i would not have put the cup from me though married had it been but in hope of finding reason to confirm my good opinion of my wifes honour and that i might know whether i had a snake or a dove in my bosom to my point what must that virtue be which will not stand a trial what that woman who would wish to shun it well then a trial seems necessary for the furthest establishment of the honour of so excellent a creature and who shall put her to this trial who but the man who has as she thinks already induced her in lesser points to swerve and this for her own sake in a double sense not only as he has been able to make some impression but as she regrets the impression made and so may be presumed to be guarded against his further attempts the situation she is at present in it must be confessed is a disadvantageous one to her but if she overcome that will redound to her honour shun not therefore my dear soul further trials nor hate me for making them for what woman can be said to be virtuous till she has been tried nor is one effort one trial to be sufficient why because a womans heart may at one time be adamant at another wax as i have often experienced and so no doubt hast thou a fine time of it methinks thou sayest would the woman have if they were all to be tried but jack i am not for that neither though i am a rake i am not a rakes friend except thine and companys and be this one of the morals of my tedious discussion let the little rogues who would not be put to the question as i may call it choose accordingly let them prefer to their favour good honest sober fellows who have not been used to play dogs tricks who will be willing to take them as they offer and who being tolerable themselves are not suspicious of others but what methinks thou askest is to become of the lady if she fail what why will she not if once subdued be always subdued another of our libertine maxims and what an immense pleasure to a marriage hater what rapture to thought to be able to prevail upon such a woman as miss clarissa harlowe to live with him without real change of name but if she resist if nobly she stand her trial why then i will marry her and bless my starts for such an angel of a wife but will she not hate thee will she not refuse no no jack circumstanced and situated as we are i am not afraid of that and hate me why should she hate the man who loves her upon proof and then for a little hint at reprisal am i not justified in my resolutions of trying her virtue who is resolved as i may say to try mine who has declared that she will not marry me till she has hopes of my reformation and now to put an end to this sober argumentation wilt thou not thyself whom i have supposed an advocate for the lady because i know that lord m has put thee upon using the interest he thinks thou hast in me to persuade me to enter the pale wilt thou not thyself allow me to try if i cannot awaken the woman in her to try if she with all that glowing symmetry of parts and that full bloom of vernal graces by which she attracts every eye be really inflexible as to the grand article let me begin then as opportunity presents i will and watch her every step to find one sliding one her every moment to find the moment critical and the rather as she spares me not but takes every advantage that offers to puzzle and plague me nor expect nor thinks me to be a good man if she be a woman and love me i shall surely catch her once tripping for love was ever a traitor to its harbourer and love within and i without she will be more than woman as the poet says or i less than man if i succeed not now belford all is out the lady is mine shall be more mine marriage i see is in my power now she is so else perhaps it had not if i can have her without marriage who can blame me for trying if not great will be her glory and my future confidence and well will she merit the sacrifice i shall make her of my liberty and from all her sex honours next to divine for giving a proof that there was once a woman whose virtue no trials no stratagems no temptations even from the man she hated not could overpower now wilt thou see all my circulation as in a glass wilt thou see it cabala however is the word nor let the secret escape thee even in thy dreams this word whenever used by any of these gentlemen was agreed to imply an inviolable secret nobody doubts that she is to be my wife let her pass for such when i give the word mean time reformation shall be my stalkinghorse some one of the women in london if i can get her hither my bird and so much for this time letter xix miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe in answer to letters ix xv do not be so much concerned my dearest friend at the bickerings between my mother and me we love one another dearly notwithstanding if my mother had not me to find fault with she must find fault with somebody else and as to me i am a very saucy girl and were not this occasion there would be some other to shew it you have heard me say that this was always the case between us you could not otherwise have known it for when you was with us you harmonized us both and indeed i was always more afraid of you than of my mother but then that awe is accompanied with love your reproofs as i have always found are so charmingly mild and instructive so evidently calculated to improve and not to provoke that a generous temper must be amended by them but hear now mind my good mamma when you are not with us you shall i tell you nancy i will have it so dont i know best i wont be disobeyed how can a daughter of spirits bear such language such looks too with the language and not have a longing mind to disobey dont advise me my dear to subscribe to my mothers prohibition of correspondence with you she has no reason for it nor would she of her own judgment have prohibited it that odd old ambling soul your uncle whose visits are frequenter than ever instigated by your malicious and selfish brother and sister in the occasion and they have only borrowed my mothers lips at the distance they are from you for a sort of speaking trumpet for them the prohibition once more i say cannot come from her heart but if it did is so much danger to be apprehended from my continuing to write to one of my own sex as if i wrote to one of the other dont let dejection and disappointment and the course of oppression which you have run through weaken your mind my dearest creature and make you see inconveniencies where there possibly cannot be any if your talent is scribbling as you call it so is mine and i will scribble on at all opportunities and to you let them say what they will nor let your letters be filled with the selfaccusations you mention there is no cause for them i wish that your anna howe who continues in her mothers house were but half so good as miss clarissa harlowe who has been driven out of her fathers i will say nothing upon your letter to your sister till i see the effect it will have you hope you tell me that you shall have your money and clothes sent you notwithstanding my opinion to the contrary i am sorry to have it to acquaint you that i have just now heard that they have sat in council upon your letter and that your mother was the only person who was for sending you your things and was overruled i charge you therefore to accept of my offer as by my last and give me particular directions for what you want that i can supply you with besides dont set your thought so much upon a reconciliation as to prevent your laying hold of any handsome opportunity to give yourself a protector such a one as the man will be who i imagine husbandlike will let nobody insult you but himself what could he mean by letting slip such a one as that you mention i dont know how to blame you for how you go beyond silence and blushes when the foolish fellow came with his observances of the restrictions which you laid him under when in another situation but as i told you above you really strike people into awe and upon my word you did not spare him i repeat what i said in my last that you have a very nice part to act and i will add that you have a mind that is much too delicate for your part but when the lover is exalted the lady must be humbled he is naturally proud and saucy i doubt you must engage his pride which he calls his honour and that you must throw off a little more of the veil and i would have you restrain your wishes before him that you had not met him and the like what signifies wishing my dear he will not bear it you can hardly expect that he will nevertheless it vexed me to the very bottom of my pride that any wretch of that sex should be able to triumph over clarissa i cannot however but say that i am charmed with your spirit so much sweetness where sweetness is requisite so much spirit where spirit is called for what a true magnanimity but i doubt in your present circumstances you must endeavour after a little more of the reserve in cases where you are displeased with him and palliate a little that humility which he puts on when you rise upon him is not natural to him methinks i see the man hesitating and looking like the fool you paint him under your corrective superiority but he is not a fool dont put him upon mingling resentment with his love you are very serious my dear in the first of the two letters before me in relation to mr hickman and me and in relation to my mother and me but as to the latter you must not be too grave if we are not well together at one time we are not ill together at another and while i am able to make her smile in the midst of the most angry fit she ever fell into on the present occasion though sometimes she would not if she could help it it is a very good sign a sign that displeasure can never go deep or be lasting and then a kind word or kind look to her favourite hickman sets the one into raptures and the other in tolerable humour at any time but your case pains me at heart and with all my levity both the good folks most sometimes partake of that pain nor will it be over as long as you are in a state of uncertainty and especially as i was not able to prevail for that protection for you which would have prevented the unhappy step the necessity for which we both with so much reason deplore i have only to add and yet it is needless to tell you that i am and will ever be your affectionate friend and servant anna howe letter xx miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe you tell me my dear that my clothes and the little sum of money i left behind me will not be sent me but i will still hope it is yet early days when their passions subside they will better consider of the matter and especially as i have my ever dear and excellent mother for my friend in this request o the sweet indulgence how has my heart bled and how does it still bleed for her you advise me not to depend upon a reconciliation i do not i cannot depend upon it but nevertheless it is the wish next my heart and as to this man what can i do you see that marriage is not absolutely in my own power if i were inclined to prefer it to the trial which i think i ought to have principally in view to make for a reconciliation you say he is proud and insolent indeed he is but can it be your opinion that he intends to humble me down to the level of his mean pride and what mean you my dear friend when you say that i must throw off a little more of the veil indeed i never knew that i wore one let me assure you that if i never see any thing in mr lovelace that looks like a design to humble me his insolence shall never make me discover a weakness unworthy of a person distinguished by your friendship that is to say unworthy either of my sex or of my former self but i hope as i am out of all other protection that he is not capable of mean or low resentments if he has had any extraordinary trouble on my account may he not thank himself for it he may and lay it if he pleases to his character which as i have told him gave at least a pretence to my brother against him and then did i ever make him any promises did i ever profess a love for him did i ever wish for the continuance of his address had not my brothers violence precipitated matters would not my indifference to him in all likelihood as i designed it should have tired out his proud spirit and make him set out for london where he used chiefly to reside and if he had would not there have been an end of all his pretensions and hopes for no encouragement had i given him nor did i then correspond with him nor believe me should i have begun to do so the fatal rencounter not having then happened which drew me in afterwards for others sakes fool that i was and not for my own and can you think or can he that even this but temporarilyintended correspondence which by the way my mother connived at would have ended thus had i not been driven on one hand and teased on the other to continue it the occasion which had at first induced it continuing what pretence then has he were i to be absolutely in his power to avenge himself on me for the faults of others and through which i have suffered more than he it cannot cannot be that i should have cause to apprehend him to be so ungenerous so bad a man see voli letter iv you bid me not to be concerned at the bickerings between your mother and you can i avoid concern when those bickerings are on my account that they are raised instigated shall i say by my uncle and my other relations surely must add to my concern but i must observe perhaps too critically for the state my mind is in at present that the very sentences you give from your mother as in so many imperatives which you take amiss are very severe reflections upon yourself for instance you shall i tell you nancy implies that you had disputed her will and so of the rest and further let me observe with respect to what you say that there cannot be the same reason for a prohibition of correspondence with me as there was of mine with mr lovelace that i thought as little of bad consequences from my correspondence with him at the time as you can do from yours with me now but if obedience be a duty the breach of it is a fault however circumstances may differ surely there is no merit in setting up our own judgment against the judgments of our parents and if it is punishable so to do i have been severely punished and that is what i warned you of from my own dear experience yet god forgive me i advise thus against myself with very great reluctance and to say truth have not strength of mind at present to decline it myself but if my occasion go not off i will take it into further consideration you give me very good advice in relation to this man and i thank you for it when you bid me be more upon the reserve with him in expressing my displeasure perhaps i may try for it but to palliate as you call it that my dearest miss howe cannot be done by your own clarissa harlowe letter xxi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe you may believe my dear miss howe that the circumstances of the noise and outcry within the gardendoor on monday last gave me no small uneasiness to think that i was in the hands of a man who could by such vile premeditation lay a snare to trick me out of myself as i have so frequently called it whenever he came in my sight the thought of this gave me an indignation that made his presence disgustful to me and the more as i fancied i beheld in his face a triumph which reproached my weakness on that account although perhaps it was only the same vivacity and placidness that generally sit upon his features i was resolved to task him upon this subject the first time i could have patience to enter upon it with him for besides that it piqued me excessively from the nature of the artifice i expected shuffling and evasion if he were guilty that would have incensed me and if not confessedly guilty such unsatisfactory declarations as still would have kept my mind doubtful and uneasy and would upon every new offence that he might give me sharpen my disgust to me i have had the opportunity i waited for and will lay before you the result he was making his court to my good opinion in very polite terms and with great seriousness lamenting that he had lost it declaring that he knew not how he had deserved to do so attributing to me an indifference to him that seemed to his infinite concern hourly to increase and he besought me to let him know my whole mind that he might have an opportunity either to confess his faults and amend them or clear his conduct to my satisfaction and thereby entitle himself to a greater share of my confidence i answered him with quickness then mr lovelace i will tell you one thing with a frankness that is perhaps more suitable to my character than to yours he hoped not he said which gives me a very bad opinion of you as a designing artful man i am all attention madam i never can think tolerably of you while the noise and voice i heard at the gardendoor which put me into the terror you took so much advantage of remains unaccounted for tell me fairly tell me candidly the whole of that circumstance and of your dealings with that wicked joseph leman and according to your explicitness in this particular i shall form a judgment of your future professions i will without reserve my dearest life said he tell you the whole and hope that my sincerity in the relation will atone for any thing you may think wrong in the fact i knew nothing said he of this man this leman and should have scorned a resort to so low a method as bribing the servant of any family to let me into the secrets of that family if i had not detected him in attempting to corrupt a servant of mine to inform him of all my motions of all my supposed intrigues and in short of every action of my private life as well as of my circumstances and engagements and this for motives too obvious to be dwelt upon my servant told me of his offers and i ordered him unknown to the fellow to let me hear a conversation that was to pass between them in the midst of it and just as he had made an offer of money for a particular piece of intelligence promising more when procured i broke in upon them and by bluster calling for a knife to cut off his ears one of which i took hold of in order to make a present of it as i said to his employers i obliged him to tell me who they were your brother madam and your uncle antony he named it was not difficult when i had given him my pardon on naming them after i had set before him the enormity of the task he had undertaken and the honourableness of my intentions to your dear self to prevail upon him by a larger reward to serve me since at the same time he might preserve the favour of your uncle and brother as i desired to know nothing but what related to myself and to you in order to guard us both against the effects of an illwill which all his fellowservants as well as himself as he acknowledged thought undeserved by this means i own to you madam i frequently turned his principals about upon a pivot of my own unknown to themselves and the fellow who is always calling himself a plain man and boasting of his conscience was the easier as i condescended frequently to assure him of my honourable views and as he knew that the use i made of his intelligence in all likelihood prevented fatal mischiefs i was the more pleased with his services as let me acknowledge to you madam they procured to you unknown to yourself a safe and uninterrupted egress which perhaps would not otherwise have been continued to you so long as it was to the garden and woodhouse for he undertook to them to watch all your motions and the more cheerfully for the fellow loves you as it kept off the curiosity of others see volii letter xxxvi so my dear it comes out that i myself was obliged to this deep contriver i sat in silent astonishment and thus he went on as to the circumstance for which you think so hardly of me i do freely confess that having a suspicion that you would revoke your intention of getting away and in that case apprehending that we should not have the time together that was necessary for that purpose i had ordered him to keep off every body he could keep off and to be himself within a view of the gardendoor for i was determined if possible to induce you to adhere to your resolution but pray sir interrupting him how came you to apprehend that i should revoke my intention i had indeed deposited a letter to that purpose but you had it not and how as i had reserved to myself the privilege of a revocation did you know but i might have prevailed upon my friends and so have revoked upon good grounds i will be very ingenuous madam you had made me hope that if you changed your mind you would give me a meeting to apprize me of the reasons for it i went to the loose bricks and i saw the letter there and as i knew your friends were immovably fixed in their schemes i doubted not but the letter was to revoke or suspend your resolution and probably to serve instead of a meeting too i therefore let it lie that if you did revoke you might be under the necessity of meeting me for the sake of the expectation you had given me and as i came prepared i was resolved pardon me madam whatever were your intentions that you should not go back had i taken your letter i must have been determined by the contents of it for the present at least but not having received it and you having reason to think i wanted not resolution in a situation so desperate to make your friends a personal visit i depended upon the interview you had bid me hope for wicked wretch said i it is my grief that i gave you opportunity to take so exact a measure of my weakness but would you have presumed to visit the family had i not met you indeed i would i had some friends in readiness who were to have accompanied me to them and had your father refused to give me audience i would have taken my friends with me to solmes and what did you intend to do to mr solmes not the least hurt had the man been passive but had he not been passive as you call it what would you have done to mr solmes he was loth he said to tell me yet not the least hurt to his person i repeated my question if he must tell me he only proposed to carry off the poor fellow and to hide him for a month or two and this he would have done let what would have been the consequence was ever such a wretch heard of i sighed from the bottom of my heart but bid him proceed from the part i had interrupted him at i ordered the fellow as i told you madam said he to keep within view of the gardendoor and if he found any parley between us and any body coming before you could retreat undiscovered whose coming might be attended with violent effects he should cry out and this not only in order to save himself from their suspicions of him but to give me warning to make off and if possible to induce you i own it madam to go off with me according to your own appointment and i hope all circumstances considered and the danger i was in of losing you for ever that the acknowledgement of that contrivance or if you had not met me that upon solmes will not procure me your hatred for had they come as i expected as well as you what a despicable wretch had i been could i have left you to the insults of a brother and other of your family whose mercy was cruelty when they had not the pretence with which this detected interview would have furnished them what a wretch said i but if sir taking your own account of this strange matter to be fact any body were coming how happened it that i saw only that man leman i thought it was he out at the door and at a distance look after us very lucky said he putting his hand first in one pocket then in another i hope i have not thrown it away it is perhaps in the coat i had on yesterday little did i think it would be necessary to be produced but i love to come to a demonstration whenever i can i may be giddy i may be heedless i am indeed but no man as to you madam ever had a sincerer heart he then stepping to the parlourdoor called his servant to bring him the coat he had on yesterday the servant did and in the pocket rumpled up as a paper he regarded not he pulled out a letter written by that joseph dated monday night in which he begs pardon for crying out so soon says that his fears of being discovered to act on both sides had made him take the rushing of a little dog that always follows him through the phyllireahedge for bettys being at hand or some of his masters and that when he found his mistake he opened the door by his own key which the contriving wretch confessed he had furnished him with and inconsiderately ran out in a hurry to have apprized him that his crying out was owing to his fright only and he added that they were upon the hunt for me by the time he returned see his letter to joseph leman voliii noiii towards the end where he tells him he would contrive for him a letter of this nature to copy i shook my head deep deep deep said i at the best o mr lovelace god forgive and reform you but you are i see plainly upon the whole of your own account a very artful a very designing man love my dearest life is ingenious night and day have i racked my stupid brain o sir thought i not stupid twere well perhaps if it were to contrive methods to prevent the sacrifice designed to be made of you and the mischief that must have ensued upon it so little hold in your affections such undeserved antipathy from your friends so much danger of losing you for ever from both causes i have not had for the whole fortnight before last monday half an hours rest at a time and i own to you madam that i should never have forgiven myself had i omitted any contrivance or forethought that would have prevented your return without me again i blamed myself for meeting him and justly for there were many chances to one that i had not met him and if i had not all his fortnights contrivances as to me would have come to nothing and perhaps i might nevertheless have escaped solmes yet had he resolved to come to harloweplace with his friends and been insulted as he certainly would have been what mischiefs might have followed but his resolutions to run away with and to hide the poor solmes for a month or so o my dear what a wretch have i let run away with me instead of solmes i asked him if he thought such enormities as these such defiances of the laws of society would have passed unpunished he had the assurance to say with one of his usual gay airs that he should by this means have disappointed his enemies and saved me from a forced marriage he had no pleasure in such desperate pushes solmes he would not have personally hurt he must have fled his country for a time at least and truly if he had been obliged to do so as all his hopes of my favour must have been at an end he would have had a fellow traveller of his own sex out of our family whom i little thought of was ever such a wretch to be sure he meant my brother and such sir said i in high resentment are the uses you make of your corrupt intelligencer my corrupt intelligencer madam interrupted me he is to this hour your brothers as well as mine by what i have ingenuously told you you may see who began this corruption let me assure you madam that there are many free things which i have been guilty of as reprisals in which i would not have been the aggressor all that i shall further say on this head mr lovelace is this that as this vile doublefaced wretch has probably been the cause of great mischief on both sides and still continues as you own his wicked practices i think it would be but just to have my friends apprized what a creature he is whom some of them encourage what you please madam as to that my service as well as your brothers is now almost over for him the fellow has made a good hand of it he does not intend to stay long in his place he is now actually in treaty for an inn which will do his business for life i can tell you further that he makes love to your sisters betty and that by my advice they will be married when he is established an innkeepers wife is every mans mistress and i have a scheme in my head to set some engines at work to make her repent her saucy behaviour to you to the last day of her life what a wicked schemer you are sir who shall avenge upon you the still greater evils which you have been guilty of i forgive betty with all my heart she was not my servant and but too probably in what she did obeyed the commands of her to whom she owed duty better than i obeyed those to whom i owed more no matter for that the wretch said to be sure my dear he must design to make me afraid of him the decree was gone out betty must smart smart too by an act of her own choice he loved he said to make bad people their own punishers nay madam excuse me but if the fellow if this joseph in your opinion deserves punishment mine is a complicated a man and his wife cannot well suffer separately and it may come home to him too i had no patience with him i told him so i see sir said i i see what a man i am with your rattle warns me of the snake and away i flung leaving him seemingly vexed and in confusion letter xxii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe my plaindealing with mr lovelace on seeing him again and the free dislike i expressed to his ways his manners and his contrivances as well as to his speeches have obliged him to recollect himself a little he will have it that the menaces which he threw out just now against my brother and mr solmes are only the effect of an unmeaning pleasantry he has too great a stake in his country he says to be guilty of such enterprises as should lay him under a necessity of quitting it for ever twenty things particularly he says he has suffered joseph leman to tell him of that were not and could not be true in order to make himself formidable in some peoples eyes and this purely with a view to prevent mischief he is unhappy as far as he knows in a quick invention in hitting readily upon expedients and many things are reported of him which he never said and many which he never did and others which he has only talked of as just now and which he has forgot as soon as the words have passed his lips this may be so in part my dear no one man so young could be so wicked as he has been reported to be but such a man at the head of such wretches as he is said to have at his beck all men of fortune and fearlessness and capable of such enterprises as i have unhappily found him capable of what is not to be apprehended from him his carelessness about his character is one of his excuses a very bad one what hope can a woman have of a man who values not his own reputation these gay wretches may in mixed conversation divert for an hour or so but the man of probity the man of virtue is the man that is to be the partner for life what woman who could help it would submit it to the courtesy of a wretch who avows a disregard to all moral sanctions whether he will perform his part of the matrimonial obligation and treat her with tolerable politeness with these notions and with these reflections to be thrown upon such a man myself would to heaven but what avail wishes now to whom can i fly if i would fly from him letter xxiii mr lovelace to john belford esq friday april never did i hear of such a parcel of foolish toads as these harlowes why belford the lady must fall if every hair of her head were a guardian angel unless they were to make a visible appearance for her or snatching her from me at unawares would draw her after them into the starry regions all i had to apprehend was that a daughter so reluctantly carried off would offer terms to her father and would be accepted upon a mutual concedence they to give up solmes she to give up me and so i was contriving to do all i could to guard against the latter but they seem resolved to perfect the work they have begun what stupid creatures are there in the world this foolish brother not to know that he who would be bribed to undertake a base thing by one would be overbribed to retort the baseness especially when he could be put into the way to serve himself by both thou jack wilt never know one half of my contrivances he here relates the conversation between him and the lady upon the subject of the noise and exclamations his agent made at the garden door to the same effect as in the ladys letter no xxi and proceeds exulting what a capacity for glorious mischief has thy friend yet how near the truth all of it the only derivation my asserting that the fellow made the noises by mistake and through fright and not by previous direction had she known the precise truth her anger to be so taken in would never have let her forgive me had i been a military hero i should have made gunpowder useless for i should have blown up all my adversaries by dint of stratagem turning their own devices upon them but these fathers and mothers lord help em were not the powers of nature stronger than those of discretion and were not that busy dea bona to afford her genial aids till tardy prudence qualified parents to manage their future offspring how few people would have children james and arabella may have their motives but what can be said for a father acting as this father has acted what for a mother what for an aunt what for uncles who can have patience with such fellows and fellowesses soon will the fair one hear how high their foolish resentments run against her and then will she it is to be hoped have a little more confidence in me then will i be jealous that she loves me not with the preference my heart builds upon then will i bring her to confessions of grateful love and then will i kiss her when i please and not stand trembling as now like a hungry hound who sees a delicious morsel within his reach the froth hanging upon his vermilion jaws yet dares not leap at it for his life but i was originally a bashful mortal indeed i am bashful still with regard to this lady bashful yet know the sex so well but that indeed is the reason that i know it so well for jack i have had abundant cause when i have looked into myself by way of comparison with the other sex to conclude that a bashful man has a good deal of the soul of a woman and so like tiresias can tell what they think and what they drive at as well as themselves the modest ones and i particularly are pretty much upon a par the difference between us is only what they think i act but the immodest ones outdo the worst of us by a bars length both in thinking and acting one argument let me plead in proof of my assertion that even we rakes love modesty in a woman while the modest woman as they are accounted that is to say the slyest love and generally prefer an impudent man whence can this be but from a likeness in nature and this made the poet say that ever woman is a rake in her heart it concerns them by their actions to prove the contrary if they can thus have i read in some of the philosophers that no wickedness is comparable to the wickedness of a woman canst thou tell me jack who says this was it socrates for he had the devil of a wife or who or is it solomon king solomon thou remembrest to have read of such a king dost thou not solomon i learned in my infant state my mother was a good woman to answer when asked who was the wisest man but my indulgent questioner never asked me how he came by the uninspired part of his wisdom mr lovelace is as much out in his conjecture of solomon as of socrates the passage is in ecclesiasticus chap xxv come come jack you and i are not so very bad could we but stop where we are he then gives the particulars of what passed between him and the lady on his menaces relating to her brother and mr solmes and of his design to punish betty barnes and joseph leman letter xxiv miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe friday apr i will now give you the particulars of a conversation that has just passed between mr lovelace and me which i must call agreeable it began with his telling me that he had just received intelligence that my friends were on a sudden come to a resolution to lay aside all thoughts of pursuing me or of getting me back and that therefore he attended me to know of my pleasure and what i would do or have him do i told him that i would have him leave me directly and that when it was known to every body that i was absolutely independent of him it would pass that i had left my fathers house because of my brothers ill usage of me which was a plea that i might make with justice and to the excuse of my father as well as of myself he mildly replied that if we could be certain that my relations would adhere to this their new resolution he could have no objection since such was my pleasure but as he was well assured that they had taken it only from apprehensions that a more active one might involve my brother who had breathed nothing but revenge in some fatal misfortune there was too much reason to believe that they would resume their former purpose the moment they should think they safely might this madam said he is a risque i cannot run you would think it strange if i could and yet as soon as i knew they had so given out i thought it proper to apprize you of it and take your commands upon it let me hear said i willing to try if he had any particular view what you think most advisable tis very easy to say that if i durst if i might not offend you if it were not to break conditions that shall be inviolable with me say then sir what you would say i can approve or disapprove as i think fit had not the man a fine opportunity here to speak out he had and thus he used it to wave madam what i would say till i have more courage to speak out more courage mr lovelace more courage my dear i will only propose what i think will be most agreeable to you suppose if you choose not to go to lady bettys that you take a turn cross the country to windsor why to windsor because it is a pleasant place because it lies in the way either to berkshire to oxford or to london berkshire where lord m is at present oxford in the neighbourhood of which lives lady betty london whither you may retire at your pleasure or if you will have it so whither i may go you staying at windsor and yet be within an easy distance of you if any thing should happen or if your friends should change their newtaken resolution this proposal however displeased me not but i said my only objection was the distance of windsor from miss howe of whom i should be glad to be always within two or three hours reach of by messenger if possible if i had thoughts of any other place than windsor or nearer to miss howe he wanted but my commands and would seek for proper accommodations but fix as i pleased farther or nearer he had servants and they had nothing else to do but to obey me a grateful thing then he named to me to send for my hannah as soon as i shall be fixed unless i would choose one of the young gentlewomen here to attend me both of whom as i had acknowledged were very obliging and he knew i had generosity enough to make it worth their while see his reasons for proposing windsor letter xxv and her hannah letter xxvi this of hannah he might see i took very well i said i had thoughts of sending for her as soon as i got to more convenient lodgings as to these young gentlewomen it were pity to break in upon that usefulness which the whole family were of to each other each having her proper part and performing it with an agreeable alacrity insomuch that i liked them all so well that i could even pass my days among them were he to leave me by which means the lodgings would be more convenient to me than now they were he need not repeat his objections to this place he said but as to going to windsor or wherever else i thought fit or as to his personal attendance or leaving me he would assure me he very agreeably said that i could propose nothing in which i thought my reputation and even my punctilio concerned that he would not cheerfully come into and since i was so much taken up with my pen he would instantly order his horse to be got ready and would set out not to be off my caution have you any acquaintance at windsor said i know you of any convenient lodgings there except the forest replied he where i have often hunted i know the least of windsor of any place so noted and so pleasant indeed i have not a single acquaintance there upon the whole i told him that i thought his proposal of windsor not amiss and that i would remove thither if i could get a lodging only for myself and an upper chamber for hannah for that my stock of money was but small as was easy to be conceived and i should be very loth to be obliged to any body i added that the sooner i removed the better for that then he could have no objection to go to london or berkshire as he pleased and i should let every body know my independence he again proposed himself in very polite terms for my banker but i as civilly declined his offer this conversation was to be all of it in the main agreeable he asked whether i would choose to lodge in the town of windsor or out of it as near the castle i said as possible for the convenience of going constantly to the public worship an opportunity i had been very long deprived of he should be very glad he told me if he could procure me accommodations in any one of the canons houses which he imagined would be more agreeable to me than any other on many accounts and as he could depend upon my promise never to have any other man but himself on the condition to which he had so cheerfully subscribed he should be easy since it was now his part in earnest to set about recommending himself to my favour by the only way he knew it would be done adding with a very serious air i am but a young man madam but i have run a long course let not your purity of mind incline you to despise me for the acknowledgement it is high time to be weary of it and to reform since like solomon i can say there is nothing new under the sun but that it is my belief that a life of virtue can afford such pleasures on reflection as will be for ever blooming for ever new i was agreeably surprised i looked at him i believe as if i doubted my ears and my eyes his aspect however became his words i expressed my satisfaction in terms so agreeable to him that he said he found a delight in this early dawning of a better day to him and in my approbation which he had never received from the success of the most favoured of his pursuits surely my dear the man must be in earnest he could not have said this he could not have thought it had he not what followed made me still readier to believe him in the midst of my wild vagaries said he i have ever preserved a reverence for religion and for religious men i always called another cause when any of my libertine companions in pursuance of lord shaftesburys test which is a part of the rakes creed and what i may call the whetstone of infidelity endeavoured to turn the sacred subject into ridicule on this very account i have been called by good men of the clergy who nevertheless would have it that i was a practical rake the decent rake and indeed i had too much pride in my shame to disown the name of rake this madam i am the readier to confess as it may give you hope that the generous task of my reformation which i flatter myself you will have the goodness to undertake will not be so difficult a one as you may have imagined for it has afforded me some pleasure in my retired hours when a temporary remorse has struck me for any thing i have done amiss that i should one day delight in another course of life for unless we can i dare say no durable good is to be expected from the endeavour your example madam must do all must confirm all that he proposes one day to reform and that he has sometimes good motions see voli letter xxxiv the divine grace or favour mr lovelace must do all and confirm all you know not how much you please me that i can talk to you in this dialect and i then thought of his generosity to his pretty rustic and of his kindness to his tenants yet madam be pleased to remember one thing reformation cannot be a sudden work i have infinite vivacity it is that which runs away with me judge dearest madam by what i am going to confess that i have a prodigious way to journey on before a good person will think me tolerable since though i have read in some of our perfectionists enough to make a better man than myself either run into madness or despair about the grace you mention yet i cannot enter into the meaning of the word nor into the modus of its operation let me not then be checked when i mention your example for my visible reliance and instead of using such words till i can better understand them suppose all the rest included in the profession of that reliance i told him that although i was somewhat concerned at his expression and surprised at so much darkness as for want of another word i would call it in a man of his talents and learning yet i was pleased with his ingenuousness i wished him to encourage this way of thinking i told him that his observation that no durable good was to be expected from any new course were there was not a delight taken in it was just but that the delight would follow by use and twenty things of this sort i even preached to him taking care however not to be tedious nor to let my expanded heart give him a contracted or impatient blow and indeed he took visible pleasure in what i said and even hung upon the subject when i to try him once or twice seemed ready to drop it and proceeded to give me a most agreeable instance that he could at times think both deeply and seriously thus it was he was once he said dangerously wounded in a duel in the left arm baring it to shew me the scar that this notwithstanding a great effusion of blood it being upon an artery was followed by a violent fever which at last fixed upon his spirits and that so obstinately that neither did he desire life nor his friends expect it that for a month together his heart as he thought was so totally changed that he despised his former courses and particularly that rashness which had brought him to the state he was in and his antagonist who however was the aggressor into a much worse that in this space he had thought which at times still gave him pleasure to reflect upon and although these promising prospects changed as he recovered health and spirits yet he parted with them with so much reluctance that he could not help shewing it in a copy of verses truly blank ones he said some of which he repeated and advantaged by the grace which he gives to every thing he repeats i thought them very tolerable ones the sentiments however much graver than i expected from him he has promised me a copy of the lines and then i shall judge better of their merit and so shall you the tendency of them was that since sickness only gave him a proper train of thinking and that his restored health brought with it a return to his evil habits he was ready to renounce those gifts of nature for those of contemplation he farther declared that although these good motions went off as he had owned on his recovery yet he had better hopes now from the influence of my example and from the reward before him if he persevered and that he was the more hopeful that he should as his present resolution was made in a full tide of health and spirits and when he had nothing to wish for but perseverance to entitle himself to my favour i will not throw cold water mr lovelace said i on a rising flame but look to it for i shall endeavour to keep you up to this spirit i shall measure your value of me by this test and i would have you bear those charming lines of mr rowe for ever in your mind you who have by your own confession so much to repent of and as the scar indeed you shewed me will in one instance remind you to your dying day the lines my dear are from the poets ulysses you have heard me often admire them and i repeated them to him habitual evils change not on a sudden but many days must pass and many sorrows conscious remorse and anguish must be felt to curb desire to break the stubborn will and work a second nature in the soul ere virtue can resume the place she lost tis else dissimulation he had often read these lines he said but never tasted them before by his soul the unmortified creature swore and as he hoped to be saved he was now in earnest in his good resolutions he had said before i repeated those lines from rowe that habitual evils could not be changed on a sudden but he hoped he should not be thought a dissembler if he were not enabled to hold his good purposes since ingratitude and dissimulation were vices that of all others he abhorred may you ever abhor them said i they are the most odious of all vices i hope my dear miss howe i shall not have occasion in my future letters to contradict these promising appearances should i have nothing on his side to combat with i shall be very far from being happy from the sense of my fault and the indignation of all my relations so shall not fail of condign punishment for it from my inward remorse on account of my forfeited character but the least ray of hope could not dart in upon me without my being willing to lay hold of the very first opportunity to communicate it to you who take so generous a share in all my concerns nevertheless you may depend upon it my dear that these agreeable assurances and hopes of his begun reformation shall not make me forget my caution not that i think at worst any more than you that he dare to harbour a thought injurious to my honour but he is very various and there is an apparent and even an acknowledged unfixedness in his temper which at times gives me uneasiness i am resolved therefore to keep him at a distance from my person and my thoughts as much as i can for whether all men are or are not encroachers i am sure mr lovelace is one hence it is that i have always cast about and will continue to cast about what ends he may have in view from this proposal or from that report in a word though hopeful of the best i will always be fearful of the worst in every thing that admits of doubt for it is better in such a situation as mine to apprehend without cause than to subject myself to surprise for want of forethought mr lovelace is gone to windsor having left two servants to attend me he purposes to be back tomorrow i have written to my aunt hervey to supplicate her interest in my behalf for my clothes books and money signifying to her that if i may be restored to the favour of my family and allowed a negative only as to any man who may be proposed to me and be used like a daughter a niece and a sister i will stand by my offer to live single and submit as i ought to a negative from my father intimating nevertheless that it were perhaps better after the usage i have received from my brother and sister that i may be allowed to be distant from them as well for their sakes as for my own meaning as i suppose it will be taken at my dairyhouse offering to take my fathers directions as to the manner i shall live in the servants i shall have and in every thing that shall shew the dutiful subordination to which i am willing to conform my aunt will know by my letter to my sister how to direct to me if she be permitted to favour me with a line i am equally earnest with her in this letter as i was with my sister in that i wrote to her to obtain for me a speedy reconciliation that i not be further precipitated intimating that by a timely lenity all may pass for a misunderstanding only which otherwise will be thought equally disgraceful to them and to me appealing to her for the necessity i was under to do what i did had i owned that i was overreached and forced away against my intention might they not as a proof of the truth of my assertion have insisted upon my immediate return to them and if i did not return would they not have reason to suppose that i had now altered my mind if such were my mind or had not the power to return then were i to have gone back must it not have been upon their own terms no conditioning with a father is a maxim with my father and with my uncles if i would have gone mr lovelace would have opposed it so i must have been under his controul or have run away from him as it is supposed i did to him from harloweplace in what a giddy light would this have made me appear had he constrained me could i have appealed to my friends for their protection without risking the very consequences to prevent which setting up myself presumptuously as a middle person between flaming spirits i have run into such terrible inconveniencies but after all must it not give me great anguish of mind to be forced to sanctify as i may say by my seeming afterapprobation a measure i was so artfully tricked into and which i was so much resolved not to take how one evil brings on another is sorrowfully witnessed to by your everobliged and affectionate cl harlowe letter xxv mr lovelace to john belford esq friday apr thou hast often reproached me jack with my vanity without distinguishing the humourous turn that accompanies it and for which at the same time that thou robbest me of the merit of it thou admirest me highly envy gives thee the indistinction nature inspires the admiration unknown to thyself it inspires it but thou art too clumsy and too shortsighted a mortal to know how to account even for the impulses by which thou thyself art moved well but this acquits thee not of my charge of vanity lovelace methinks thou sayest and true thou sayest for i have indeed a confounded parcel of it but if men of parts may not be allowed to be in vain who should and yet upon second thoughts men of parts have the least occasion of any to be vain since the world so few of them are there in it are ready to find them out and extol them if a fool can be made sensible that there is a man who has more understanding than himself he is ready enough to conclude that such a man must be a very extraordinary creature and what at this rate is the general conclusion to be drawn from the premises is it not that no man ought to be vain but what if a man cant help it this perhaps may be my case but there is nothing upon which i value myself so much as upon my inventions and for the soul of me i cannot help letting it be seen that i do yet this vanity may be a mean perhaps to overthrow me with this sagacious lady she is very apprehensive of me i see i have studied before her and miss howe as often as i have been with them to pass for a giddy thoughtless creature what a folly then to be so expatiatingly sincere in my answer to her home put upon the noises within the garden but such success having attended that contrivance success jack has blown many a man up my cursed vanity got uppermost and kept down my caution the menace to have secreted solmes and that other that i had thoughts to run away with her foolish brother and of my project to revenge her upon the two servants so much terrified the dear creature that i was forced to sit down to muse after means to put myself right in her opinion some favourable incidents at the time tumbled in from my agent in her family at least such as i was determined to make favourable and therefore i desired admittance and this before she could resolve any thing against me that is to say while her admiration of my intrepidity kept resolution in suspense accordingly i prepared myself to be all gentleness all obligingness all serenity and as i have now and then and always had more or less good motions pop up in my mind i encouraged and collected every thing of this sort that i had ever had from novicehood to maturity not long in recollecting jack in order to bring the dear creature into good humour with me and who knows thought i if i can hold it and proceed but i may be able to lay a foundation fit to build my grand scheme upon love thought i is not naturally a doubter fear is i will try to banish the latter nothing then but love will remain credulity is the god of loves prime minister and they never are asunder he had said letter xviii that he would make reformation his stalking horse c he then acquaints his friend with what passed between him and the lady in relation to his advices from harloweplace and to his proposal about lodgings pretty much to the same purpose as in her preceding letter when he cones to mention his proposal of the windsor lodgings thus he expresses himself now belford can it enter into thy leaden head what i meant by this proposal i know it cannot and so ill tell thee to leave her for a day or two with a view to serve her by my absence would as i thought look like a confiding in her favour i could not think of leaving her thou knowest while i had reason to believe her friends would pursue us and i began to apprehend that she would suspect that i made a pretence of that intentional pursuit to keep about her and with her but now that they had declared against it and that they would not receive her if she went back a declaration she had better hear first from me than from miss howe or any other what should hinder me from giving her this mark of my obedience especially as i could leave will who is a clever fellow and can do any thing but write and spell and lord ms jonas not as guards to be sure but as attendants only the latter to be dispatched to me occasionally by the former whom i could acquaint with my motions then i wanted to inform myself why i had not congratulatory letters from lady sarah and lady betty and from my cousins montague to whom i had written glorying in my beloveds escape which letters if properly worded might be made necessary to shew her as matters proceed as to windsor i had no design to carry her particularly thither but somewhere it was proper to name as she condescended to ask my advice about it london i durst not but very cautiously and so as to make it her own option for i must tell thee that there is such a perverseness in the sex that when they ask your advice they do it only to know your opinion that they may oppose it though had not the thing in question been your choice perhaps it had been theirs i could easily give reasons against windsor after i had pretended to be there and this would have looked the better as it was a place of my own nomination and shewn her that i had no fixed scheme never was there in woman such a sagacious such an allalive apprehension as in this yet it is a grievous thing to an honest man to be suspected then in my going or return i can call upon mrs greme she and my beloved had a great deal of talk together if i knew what it was about and that either upon their first acquaintance was for benefiting herself by the other i might contrive to serve them both without hurting myself for these are the most prudent ways of doing friendships and what are not followed by regrets though the served should prove ingrateful then mrs greme corresponds by penandink with her farmer sister where we are something may possibly arise that way either of a convenient nature which i may pursue or of an inconvenient nature which i may avoid always be careful of back doors is a maxim with me in all my exploits whoever knows me knows that i am no proud man i can talk as familiarly to servants as to principals when i have a mind to make it worth their while to oblige me in any thing then servants are but as the common soldiers in an army they do all the mischief frequently without malice and merely good souls for mischiefsake i am most apprehensive about miss howe she has a confounded deal of wit and wants only a subject to shew as much roguery and should i be outwitted with all my sententious boasting of conceit of my own nostrum mongership i love to plague thee who art a pretender to accuracy and a surfaceskimmer in learning with outoftheway words and phrases i should certainly hang drown or shoot myself poor hickman i pity him for the prospect he has with such a virago but the fellows a fool god wot and now i think of it it is absolutely necessary for complete happiness in the married state that one should be a fool an argument i once held with this very miss howe but then the fool should know the others superiority otherwise the obstinate one will disappoint the wise one but my agent joseph has helped me to secure this quarter as i have hinted to thee more than once letter xxvi mr lovelace to john belford esq in continuation but is it not a confounded thing that i cannot fasten an obligation upon this proud beauty i have two motives in endeavouring to prevail upon her to accept of money and raiment from me one the real pleasure i should have in the accommodating of the haughty maid and to think there was something near her and upon her that i could call mine the other in order to abate her severity and humble her a little nothing more effectually brings down a proud spirit than a sense of lying under pecuniary obligations this has always made me solicitous to avoid laying myself under any such yet sometimes formerly have i been put to it and cursed the tardy resolution of the quarterly periods and yet i ever made shift to avoid anticipation i never would eat the calf in the cows belly as lord ms phrase is for what is that but to hold our lands upon tenantcourtesy the vilest of all tenures to be denied a foxchace for breaking down a fence upon my own grounds to be clamoured at for repairs studied for rather than really wanted to be prated to by a bumpkin with his hat on and his arms folded as if he defied your expectations of that sort his foot firmly fixed as if upon his own ground and you forced to take his arch leers and stupid gybes he intimating by the whole of his conduct that he had had it in his power to oblige you and if you behave civilly may oblige you again i who think i have a right to break every mans head i pass by if i like not his looks to bear this no more could i do it then i could borrow of an insolent uncle or inquisitive aunt who would thence think themselves entitled to have an account of all my life and actions laid before them for their review and censure my charmer i see has a pride like my own but she has no distinction in her pride nor knows the pretty fool that there is nothing nobler nothing more delightful than for loves to be conferring and receiving obligations from each other in this very farmyard to give thee a familiar instance i have more than once seen this remark illustrated a strutting rascal of a cock have i beheld chuck chuck chuck chucking his mistress to him when he has found a single barleycorn taking it up with his bill and letting it drop five or six times still repeating his chucking invitation and when two or three of his feathered ladies strive who shall be the first for it o jack a cock is a grand signor of a bird he directs the bill of the foremost to it and when she has got the dirty pearl he struts over her with an erected crest cling round her with dropt wings sweeping the dust in humble courtship while the obliged she halfshy halfwilling by her cowering tail prepared wings yet seemingly affrighted eyes and contracted neck lets one see that she knows the barleycorn was not all he called her for when he comes to that part of his narrative where he mentions of the proposing of the ladys maid hannah or one of the young sorlings to attend her thus he writes now belford canst thou imagine what i meant by proposing hannah or one of the girls here for her attendant ill give thee a month to guess thou wilt not pretend to guess thou sayst well then ill tell thee believing she would certainly propose to have that favourite wench about her as soon as she was a little settled i had caused the girl to be inquired after with an intent to make interest some how or other that a months warning should be insisted on by her master or mistress or by some other means which i had not determined upon to prevent her coming to her but fortune fights for me the wench is luckily ill a violent rheumatic disorder which has obliged her to leave her place confines her to her chamber poor hannah how i pity the girl these things are very hard upon industrious servants i intend to make the poor wench a small present on the occasion i know it will oblige my charmer and so jack pretending not to know any thing of the matter i pressed her to send for hannah she knew i had always a regard for this servant because of her honest love to her lady but now i have greater regard for her than ever calamity though a poor servants calamity will rather increase than diminish good will with a truly generous master or mistress as to one of the young sorlings attendance there was nothing at all in proposing that for if either of them had been chosen by her and permitted by the mother two chances in that it would have been only till i had fixed upon another and if afterwards they had been loth to part i could easily have given my beloved to a jealousy which would have done the business or to the girl who would have quitted her country dairy such a relish for a london one and as would have made it very convenient for her to fall in love with will or perhaps i could have done still better for her with lord ms chaplain who is very desirous of standing well with his lords presumptive heir a blessing on thy honest heart lovelace thoult say for thou art for providing for every body he gives an account of the serious part of their conversation with no great variation from the ladys account of it and when he comes to that part of it where he bids her remember that reformation cannot be a sudden thing he asks his friend is not this fair play is it not dealing ingenuously then the observation i will be bold to say is founded in truth and nature but there was a little touch of policy in it besides that the lady if i should fly out again should not think me too gross an hypocrite for as i plainly told her i was afraid that my fits of reformation were but fits and sallies but i hoped her example would fix them into habits but it is so discouraging a thing to have my monitress so very good i protest i know not how to look up at her now as i am thinking if i could pull her down a little nearer to my own level that is to say could prevail upon her to do something that would argue imperfection something to repent of we should jog on much more equally and be better able to comprehend one another and so the comfort would be mutual and the remorse not all on one side he acknowledges that he was greatly affected and pleased with the ladys serious arguments at the time but even then was apprehensive that his temper would not hold thus he writes this lady says serious things in so agreeable a manner and then her voice is all harmony when she touches a subject she is pleased with that i could have listened to her for half a day together but yet i am afraid if she falls as they call it she will lose a good deal of that pathos of that noble selfconfidence which gives a good person as i now see a visible superiority over one not so good but after all belford i would fain know why people call such free livers as you and me hypocrites thats a word i hate and should take it very ill to be called by it for myself i have as good motions and perhaps have them as frequently as any body all the business is they dont hold or to speak more in character i dont take the care some do to conceal my lapses letter xxvii miss howe to mis clarissa harlowe saturday april though pretty much pressed in time and oppressed by my mothers watchfulness i will write a few lines upon the new light that has broken in upon your gentleman and send it by a particular hand i know not what to think of him upon it he talks well but judge him by rowes lines he is certainly a dissembler odious as the sin of hypocrisy and as he says that other of ingratitude are to him and pray my dear let me ask could he have triumphed as it is said he has done over so many of our sex had he not been egregiously guilty of both sins his ingenuousness is the thing that staggers me yet is he cunning enough to know that whoever accuses him first blunts the edge of an adversarys accusation he is certainly a man of sense there is more hope of such a one than a fool and there must be a beginning to a reformation these i will allow in his favour but this that follows i think is the only way to judge of his specious confessions and selfaccusations does he confess any thing that you knew not before or that you are not likely to find out from others if nothing else what does he confess to his own disadvantage you have heard of his duels you have heard of his seductions all the world has he owns therefore what it would be to no purpose to conceal and his ingenuousness is a salvo why this madam is no more than mr lovelace himself acknowledges well but what is now to be done you must make the best of your situation and as you say so he has proposed to you of windsor and his canons house his readiness to leave you and go himself in quest of a lodging likewise looks well and i think there is nothing can be so properly done as whether you get to a canons house or not that the canon should join you together in wedlock as soon as possible i much approve however of all your cautions of all your vigilance and of every thing you have done but of your meeting him yet in my disapprobation of that i judge by that event only for who would have divined it would have been concluded as it did but he is the devil by his own account and had he run away with the wretched solmes and your more wretched brother and himself been transported for life he should have had my free consent for all three what use does he make of that joseph leman his ingenuousness i must more than once say confounds me but if my dear you can forgive your brother for the part he put that fellow upon acting i dont know whether you ought to be angry at lovelace yet i have wished fifty times since lovelace got you away that you were rid of him whether it were by a burning fever by hanging by drowning or by a broken neck provided it were before he laid you under a necessity to go into mourning for him i repeat my hitherto rejected offer may i send it safely by your old man i have reasons for not sending it by hickmans servant unless i had a bank note inquiring for such may cause distrust my mother is so busy so inquisitive i dont love suspicious tempers and here she is continually in and out i must break off mr hickman begs his most respectful compliments to you with offer of his services i told him i would oblige him because minds in trouble take kindly any bodys civilities but that he was not to imagine that he particularly obliged me by this since i should think the man or woman either blind or stupid who admired not a person of your exalted merit for your own sake and wished not to serve you without view to other reward than the honour of serving you to be sure that was his principal motive with great daintiness he said it but with a kiss of his hand and a bow to my feet he hoped that a fine ladys being my friend did not lessen the merit of the reverence he really had for her believe me ever what you my dear shall ever find me your faithful and affectionate anna howe letter xxviii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe sat afternoon i detain your messenger while i write an answer to yours the poor old man not being very well you dishearten me a good deal about mr lovelace i may be too willing from my sad circumstances to think the best of him if his pretences to reformation are but pretences what must be his intent but can the heart of man be so very vile can he dare he mock the almighty but i may not from one very sad reflection think better of him that i am thrown too much into his power to make it necessary for him except he were to intend the very utmost villany by me to be such a shocking hypocrite he must at least be in earnest at the time he gives the better hopes surely he must you yourself must join with me in this hope or you could not wish me to be so dreadfully yoked but after all i had rather much rather be independent of him and of his family although i have an high opinion of them at least till i see what my own may be brought to otherwise i think it were best for me at once to cast myself into lady bettys protection all would then be conducted with decency and perhaps many mortifications would be spared me but then i must be his at all adventures and be thought to defy my own family and shall i not first see the issue of one application and yet i cannot make this till i am settled somewhere and at a distance from him mrs sorlings shewed me a letter this morning which she had received from her sister greme last night in which mrs greme hoping i would forgive her forward zeal if her sister thinks fit to shew her letter to me wishes and that for all the noble familys sake and she hopes she may say for my own that i will be pleased to yield to make his honour as she calls him happy she grounds her officiousness as she calls it upon what he was so condescending her word also to say to her yesterday in his way to windsor on her presuming to ask if she might soon give him joy that no man ever loved a woman as he loves me that no woman ever so well deserved to be beloved that he loves me with such a purity as he had never believed himself capable of or that a mortal creature could have inspired him with looking upon me as all soul as an angel sent down to save his and a great deal more of this sort but that he apprehends my consent to make him happy is at a greater distance than he wishes and complained of too severe restrictions i had laid upon him before i honoured him with my confidence which restrictions must be as sacred to him as if they were parts of the marriage contract c what my dear shall i say to this how shall i take it mrs greme is a good woman mrs sorlings is a good woman and this letter agrees with the conversation between mr lovelace and me which i thought and still think so agreeable yet what means the man by foregoing the opportunities he has had to declare himself what mean his complaints of my restrictions to mrs greme he is not a bashful man but you say i inspire people with an awe of me an awe my dear as how this letter mrs greme with no bad design on her part was put upon writing by mr lovelace himself as will be seen in letter xxxv i am quite petulant fretful and peevish with myself at times to find that i am bound to see the workings of the subtle or this giddy spirit which shall i call it how am i punished as i frequently think for my vanity in hoping to be an example to young persons of my sex let me be but a warning and i will now be contented for be my destiny what it may i shall never be able to hold up my head again among my best friends and worthiest companions it is one of the cruelest circumstances that attends the faults of the inconsiderate that she makes all who love her unhappy and gives joy only to her own enemies and to the enemies of her family what an useful lesson would this afford were it properly inculcated at the time that the tempted mind was balancing upon a doubtful adventure you know not my dear the worth of a virtuous man and nobleminded as you are in most particulars you partake of the common weakness of human nature in being apt to slight what is in your own power you would not think of using mr lovelace were he your suitor as you do the much worthier mr hickman would you you know who says in my mothers case much will bear much shall bear all the world through mr hickman i fancy would be glad to know the ladys name who made such an observation he would think it hardly possible but such a one should benefit by her own remark and would be apt to wish his miss howe acquainted with her see voli letter x gentleness of heart surely is not despicable in a man why if it be is the highest distinction a man can arrive at that of a gentleman a distinction which a prince may not deserve for manners more than birth fortune or title are requisite in this character manners are indeed the essence of it and shall it be generally said and miss howe not be an exception to it as you once wrote that our sex are best dealt with by boisterous and unruly spirits see volii letter iii forgive me my dear and love me as you used to do for although my fortunes are changed my heart is not nor ever will while it bids my pen tell you that it must cease to bear when it is not as much yours as your cl harlowe letter xxix miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe saturday evening mr lovelace has seen divers apartments at windsor but not one he says that he thought fit for me and which at the same time answered my description he has been very solicitous to keep to the letter of my instructions which looked well and the better i like him as although he proposed that town he came back dissuading me from it for he said that in his journey from thence he had thought windsor although of his own proposal a wrong choice because i coveted privacy and that was a place generally visited and admired this inference of the lady in his favour is exactly what he had hoped for see letter xxv of this volume i told him that if mrs sorlings thought me not an incumbrance i would be willing to stay here a little longer provided he would leave me and go to lord ms or to london which ever he thought best he hoped he said that he might suppose me absolutely safe from the insults or attempts of my brother and therefore if it should make me easier he would obey for a few days at least he again proposed to send for hannah i told him i designed to do so through you and shall i beg of you my dear to cause the honest creature to be sent to your faithful robert i think knows where she is perhaps she will be permitted to quit her place directly by allowing a months wages which i will repay her he took notice of the serious humour he found me in and of the redness of my eyes i had just been answering your letter and had he not approached me on his coming off his journey in a very respectful manner had he not made an unexceptionable report of his inquiries and been so ready to go from me at the very first word i was prepared notwithstanding the good terms we parted upon when he set out for windsor to have given him a very unwelcome reception for the contents of your last letter had so affected me that the moment i saw him i beheld with indignation the seducer who had been the cause of all the evils i suffer and have suffered he hinted to me that he had received a letter from lady betty and another as i understood him from one of the miss montagues if they take notice of my in them i wonder that he did not acquaint me with the contents i am afraid my dear that his relations are among those who think i have taken a rash and inexcusable step it is not to my credit to let even them know how i have been frighted out of myself and yet perhaps they would hold me unworthy of their alliance if they were to think my flight a voluntary one o my dear how uneasy to us are our reflections upon every doubtful occurrence when we know we have been prevailed upon to do a wrong thing sunday morning ah this man my dear we have had warmer dialogues than ever yet we have had at fair argument i find i need not fear him but he is such a wild such an ungovernable creature he reformed that i am half afraid of him see this confirmed by mr lovelace letter xi of this volume he again on my declaring myself uneasy at his stay with me here proposed that i would put myself into lady bettys protection assuring me that he thought he could not leave me at mrs sorlingss with safety to myself and upon my declining to do that for the reasons i gave you in my last he urged me to make a demand of my estate see letter xxviii of this volume he knew it i told him to be my resolution not to litigate with my father nor would he put me upon it he replied but as the last thing but if my spirit would not permit me to be obliged as i called it to any body and yet if my relations would refuse me my own he knew not how i could keep up that spirit without being put to inconveniences which would give him infinite concern unless unless unless he said hesitating as if afraid to speak out unless i would take the only method i could take to obtain the possession of my own what is that sir sure the man saw by my looks when he came with his creeping unlesss that i guessed what he meant ah madam can you be at a loss to know what that method is they will not dispute with a man that right which they contest with you why said he with a man instead of with him yet he looked as if he wanted to be encouraged to say more so sir you would have me employ a lawyer would you notwithstanding what i have ever declared as to litigating with my father no i would not my dearest creature snatching my hand and pressing it with his lips except you would make me the lawyer had he said me at first i should have been above the affectation of mentioning a lawyer i blushed the man pursued not the subject so ardently but that it was more easy as well as more natural to avoid it than to fall into it would to heaven he might without offending but i so overawed him overawed him your notion my dear and so the overawed bashful man went off from the subject repeating his proposal that i would demand my own estate or empower some man of the law to demand it if i would not he put in empower a happier man to demand it but it could not be amiss he thought to acquaint my two trustees that i intended to assume it see letter xix of this volume i should know better what to do i told him when he was at a distance from me and known to be so i suppose sir that if my father propose my return and engage never to mentions solmes to me nor any other man but by my consent and i agree upon that condition to think no more of you you will acquiesce i was willing to try whether he had the regard to all of my previous declarations which he pretended to have to some of them he was struck all of a heap what say you mr lovelace you know all you mean is for my good surely i am my own mistress surely i need not ask your leave to make what terms i please for myself so long as i break none with you he hemmd twice or thrice why madam why madam i cannot say then pausing and rising from his seat with petulance i see plainly enough said he the reason why none of my proposals can be accepted at last i am to be a sacrifice to your reconciliation with your implacable family it has always been your respectful way mr lovelace to treat my family in this free manner but pray sir when you call others implacable see that you deserve not the same censure yourself he must needs say there was no love lost between some of my family and him but he had not deserved of them what they had of him yourself being judge i suppose sir all the world you yourself madam being judge then sir let me tell you had you been less upon your defiances they would not have been irritated so much against you but nobody ever heard that avowed despite to the relations of a person was a proper courtship either to that person or to her friends well madam all that i know is that their malice against me is such that if you determine to sacrifice me you may be reconciled when you please and all i know sir is that if i do give my father the power of a negative and he will be contented with that it will be but my duty to give it him and if i preserve one to myself i shall break through no obligation to you your duty to your capricious brother not to your father you mean madam if the dispute lay between my brother and me at first surely sir a father may choose which party he will take he may madam but that exempts him not from blame for all that if he take the wrong different people will judge differently mr lovelace of the right and the wrong you judge as you please shall not others as they please and who has a right to controul a fathers judgment in his own family and in relation to his own child i know madam there is no arguing with you but nevertheless i had hoped to have made myself some little merit with you so as that i might not have been the preliminary sacrifice to a reconciliation your hope sir had been better grounded if you had had my consent to my abandoning of my fathers house always madam and for ever to be reminded of the choice you would have made of that damnd solmes rather than not so hasty not so rash mr lovelace i am convinced that there was no intention to marry me to that solmes on wednesday so i am told they now give out in order to justify themselves at your expense every body living madam is obliged to you for your kind thoughts but i excuse me good mr lovelace waving my hand and bowing that i am willing to think the best of my father charming creature said he with what a bewitching air is that said and with a vehemence in his manner would have snatched my hand but i withdrew it being much offended with him i think madam my sufferings for your sake might have entitled me to some favour my sufferings sir for your impetuous temper set against your sufferings for my sake i humbly conceive leave me very little your debtor lord madam assuming a drawling air what have you suffered nothing but what you can easily forgive you have been only made a prisoner in your fathers house by way of doing credit to your judgment you have only had an innocent and faithful servant turned out of your service because you loved her you have only had your sisters confident servant set over you with leave to tease and affront you very well sir you have only had an insolent brother take upon him to treat you like a slave and as insolent a sister to undermine you in every bodys favour on pretence to keep you out of hands which if as vile as they vilely report are not however half so vile and cruel as their own go on sir if you please you have only been persecuted in order to oblige you to have a sordid fellow whom you have professed to hate and whom every body despises the license has been only got the parson has only been had in readiness the day a near a very near day had been only fixed and you were only to be searched for your correspondencies and still closer confined till the day came in order to deprive you of all means of escaping the snare laid for you but all this you can forgive you can wish you had stood all this inevitable as the compulsion must have been and the man who at the hazard of his life had delivered you from all these mortifications is the only person you cannot forgive cant you go on sir you see i have patience to hear you cant you go on sir i can madam with my sufferings which i confess ought not to be mentioned were i at last to be rewarded in the manner i hoped your sufferings then if you please sir affrontingly forbidden your fathers house after encouragement given without any reasons they knew not before to justify the prohibition forced upon a rencounter i wished to avoid the first i ever so provoked wished to avoid and that because the wretch was your brother wretch sir and my brother this could be from no man breathing but from him before me pardon me madam but oh how unworthy to be your brother the quarrel grafted upon an old one when at college he universally known to be the aggressor and revived for views equally sordid and injurious both to yourself and me giving life to him who would have taken away mine your generosity this sir not your sufferings a little more of your sufferings if you please i hope you do not repent that you did not murder my brother my private life hunted into my morals decried some of the accusers not unfaulty thats an aspersion sir spies set upon my conduct one hired to bribe my own servants fidelity perhaps to have poisoned me at last if the honest fellow had not facts mr lovelace do you want facts in the display of your sufferings none of your perhapss i beseech you menaces every day and defiances put into every ones mouth against me forced to creep about in disguises and to watch all hours and in all weathers i suppose sir that i remember was once your grievance in all weathers sir and all these hardships arising from yourself not imposed by me see letter vi of this volume like a thief or an eavesdropper proceeded he and yet neither by birth nor alliances unworthy of their relation whatever i may be and am of their admirable daughter of whom they every one of them are at least as unworthy these madam i call sufferings justly call so if at last i am to be sacrificed to an imperfect reconciliation imperfect i say for can you expect to live so much as tolerably under the same roof after all that has passed with that brother and sister o sir sir what sufferings have yours been and all for my sake i warrant i can never reward you for them never think of me more i beseech you how can you have patience with me nothing has been owing to your own behaviour i presume nothing to your defiances for defiances nothing to your resolution declared more than once that you would be related to a family which nevertheless you would not stoop to ask a relation of nothing in short to courses which every body blamed you for you not thinking it worth your while to justify yourself had i not thought you used in an ungentlemanly manner as i have heretofore told you you had not had my notice by pen and ink that notice gave you a supposed security and you generously defied my friends the more for it and this brought upon me perhaps not undeservedly my fathers displeasure without which my brothers private pique and selfish views would have wanted a foundation to build upon so that for all that followed of my treatment and your redundant onlys i might thank you principally as you may yourself for all your sufferings your mighty sufferings and if voluble sir you have founded any merit upon them be so good as to revoke it and look upon me with my forfeited reputation as the only sufferer for what pray hear me out sir for he was going to speak have you suffered in but your pride your reputation could not suffer that it was beneath you to be solicitous about and had you not been an unmanageable man i should not have been driven to the extremity i now every hour as the hour passes deplore with this additional reflection upon myself that i ought not to have begun or having begun not continued a correspondence with one who thought it not worth his while to clear his own character for my sake or to submit to my father for his own in a point wherein every father ought to have an option see letter vi of this volume darkness light light darkness by my soul just as you please to have it o charmer of my heart snatching my hand and pressing it between both of his to his lips in a strange wild way take me take me to yourself mould me as you please i am wax in your hands give me your own impression and seal me for ever yours we were born for each other you to make me happy and save a soul i am all error all crime i see what i ought to have done but do you think madam i can willingly consent to be sacrificed to a partial reconciliation in which i shall be so great so irreparable a sufferer any thing but that include me in your terms prescribe to me promise for me as you please put a halter about my neck and lead me by it upon condition of forgiveness on that disgraceful penance and of a prostration as servile to your fathers penance your brother absent and i will beg his consent at his feet and bear any thing but spurning from him because he is your father but to give you up upon cold conditions dn me said the shocking wretch if i either will or can these were his words as near as i can remember them for his behaviour was so strangely wild and fervent that i was perfectly frighted i thought he would have devoured my hand i wished myself a thousand miles distant from him i told him i by no means approved of his violent temper he was too boisterous a man for my liking i saw now by the conversation that had passed what was his boasted regard to my injunctions and should take my measures accordingly as he should soon find and with a half frighted earnestness i desired him to withdraw and leave me to myself he obeyed and that with extreme complaisance in his manner but with his complexion greatly heightened and a countenance as greatly dissatisfied but on recollecting all that passed i plainly see that he means not if he can help it to leave me to the liberty of refusing him which i had nevertheless preserved a right to do but looks upon me as his by a strange sort of obligation for having run away with me against my will yet you see he but touches upon the edges of matrimony neither and that at a time generally when he has either excited ones passions or apprehensions so that one cannot at once descend but surely this cannot be his design and yet such seemed to be his behaviour to my sister when he provoked her to refuse him and so tamely submitted as he did to her refusal but he dare not what can one say of so various a man i am now again out of conceit with him i wish i were fairly out of his power see voli letters ii and iii he has sent up three times to beg admittance in the two last with unusual earnestness but i have sent him word i will finish what i am about what to do about going from this place i cannot tell i could stay here with all my heart as i have said to him the gentlewoman and her daughters are desirous that i will although not very convenient for them i believe neither but i see he will not leave me while i do so i must remove somewhere i have long been sick of myself and now i am more and more so but let me not lose your good opinion if i do that loss will complete the misfortunes of your cl harlowe letter xxx miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe sunday night april i may send to you although you are forbid to write to me may i not for that is not a correspondence is it where letters are not answered i am strangely at a loss what to think of this man he is a perfect proteus i can but write according to the shape he assumes at the time dont think me the changeable person i beseech you if in one letter i contradict what i wrote in another nay if i seem to contradict what i said in the same letter for he is a perfect camelion or rather more variable than the camelion for that it is said cannot assume the red and the white but this man can and though black seems to be his natural colour yet has he taken great pains to make me think him nothing but white but you shall judge of him as i proceed only if i any where appear to you to be credulous i beg you to set me right for you are a standerby as you say in a former would to heaven i were not to play for i think after all i am held to a desperate game see letter viii of this volume before i could finish my last to you he sent up twice more to beg admittance i returned for answer that i would see him at my own time i would neither be invaded nor prescribed to considering how we parted and my delaying his audience as he sometimes calls it i expected him to be in no very good humour when i admitted of his visit and by what i wrote you will conclude that i was not yet mine soon changed when i saw his extreme humility at his entrance and heard what he had to say i have a letter madam said he from lady betty lawrance and another from my cousin charlotte but of these more byandby i came now to make my humble acknowledgement to you upon the arguments that passed between us so lately i was silent wondering what he was driving at i am a most unhappy creature proceeded he unhappy from a strange impatiency of spirit which i cannot conquer it always brings upon me deserved humiliation but it is more laudable to acknowledge than to persevere when under the power of conviction i was still silent i have been considering what you proposed to me madam that i should acquiesce with such terms as you should think proper to comply with in order to a reconciliation with your friends well sir and i find all just all just on your side and all impatience all inconsideration on mine i stared you may suppose whence this change sir and so soon i am so much convinced that you must be in the right in all you think fit to insist upon that i shall for the future mistrust myself and if it be possible whenever i differ with you take an hours time for recollection before i give way to that vehemence which an opposition to which i have not been accounted too often gives me all this is mighty good sir but to what does it tend why madam when i came to consider what you had proposed as to the terms of reconciliation with your friends and when i recollected that you had always referred to yourself to approve or reject me according to my merits or demerits i plainly saw that it was rather a condescension in you than that you were imposing a new law and i now madam beg your pardon for my impatience whatever terms you think proper to come into with your relations which will enable you to honour me with the conditional effect of your promise to me to these be pleased to consent and if i lose you insupportable as that thought is to me yet as it must be by my own fault i ought to thank myself for it what think you miss howe do you believe he can have any view in this i cannot see any he could have and i thought it best as he put it in so right a manner to appear not to doubt the sincerity of his confession and to accept of it as sincere he then read to me part of lady bettys letter turning down the beginning which was a little too severe upon him he said for my eye and i believe by the style the remainder of it was in a corrective strain it was too plain i told him that he must have great faults that none of his relations could write to him but with a mingled censure for some bad action and it is as plain my dearest creature said he that you who know not of any such faults but by surmise are equally ready to condemn me will not charity allow you to infer that their charges are no better grounded and that my principal fault has been carelessness of my character and too little solicitude to clear myself when aspersed which i do assure you is the case lady betty in her letter expresses herself in the most obliging manner in relation to me she wishes him so to behave as to encourage me to make him soon happy she desires her compliments to me and expresses her impatience to see as her niece so celebrated a lady those are her high words she shall take it for an honour she says to be put into a way to oblige me she hopes i will not too long delay the ceremony because that performed will be to her and to lord m and lady sarah a sure pledge of her nephews merits and good behaviour she says she was always sorry to hear of the hardships i had met with on his account that he will be the most ungrateful of me if he make it not all up to me and that she thinks it incumbent upon all their family to supply to me the lost favour of my own and for her part nothing of that kind she bids him assure me shall be wanting her ladyship observes that the treatment he had received from my family would have been much more unaccountable than it was with such natural and accidental advantages as he had had it not been owing to his own careless manners but she hopes that he will convince the harlowe family that they had thought worse of him than he had deserved since now it was in his power to establish his character for ever this she prays to god to enable him to do as well for his own honour as for the honour of their house was the magnificent word she concludes with desiring to be informed of our nuptials the moment they are celebrated that she may be with the earliest in felicitating me on the happy occasion but her ladyship gives me no direct invitation to attend her before the marriage which i might have expected from what he had told me he then shewed me part of miss montagues more sprightly letter congratulating him upon the honour he had obtained of the confidence of so admirable a lady these are her words confidence my dear nobody indeed as you say will believe otherwise were they to be told the truth and you see that miss montague and all his family i suppose think that the step i have taken an extraordinary one she also wishes for his speedy nuptials and to see her new cousin at m hall as do lord m she tells him and her sister and in general all the wellwishers of their family whenever this happy day shall be passed she proposes she says to attend me and to make one in my train to m hall if his lordship shall continue as ill of the gout as he is at present but that should he get better he will himself attend me she is sure and conduct me thither and afterwards quit either of his three seats to us till we shall be settled to our mind this young lady says nothing in excuse for not meeting me on the road or st albans as he had made me expect she would yet mentions her having been indisposed mr lovelace had also told me that lord m was ill of the gout which miss montagues letter confirms but why did not the man show me these letters last night was he afraid of giving me too much pleasure letter xxxi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe you may believe my dear that these letters put me in good humour with him he saw it in my countenance and congratulated himself upon it yet i cannot but repeat my wonder that i could not have the contents of them communicated to me last night the reader will see how miss howe accounts for this in letter xxxv he then urged me to go directly to lady bettys on the strength of her letter but how said i can i do that were i even out of all hope of a reconciliation with my friends which yet however unlikely to be effected is my duty to attempt as her ladyship has given me no particular invitation that he was sure was owing to her doubt that it would be accepted else she had done it with the greatest pleasure in the world that doubt itself i said was enough to deter me since her ladyship who knew so well the boundaries to the fit and the unfit by her not expecting i would accept of the invitation had she given it would have reason to think me very forward if i had accepted it and much more forward to go without it then said i i thank you sir i have no clothes fit to go any where or to be seen by any body o i was fit to appear in the drawingroom were full dress and jewels to be excused and should make the most amiable he must mean extraordinary figure there he was astonished at the elegance of my dress by what art he knew not but i appeared to such advantage as if i had a different suit every day besides his cousins montague would supply me with all i wanted for the present and he would write to miss charlotte accordingly if i would give him leave do you think me the jay in the fable said i would you have me visit the owners of the borrowed dresses in their own clothes surely mr lovelace you think i have either a very low or a very confident mind would i choose to go to london for a very few days only in order to furnish myself with clothes not at your expense sir said i in an angry tone i could not have appeared in earnest to him in my displeasure at his artful contrivances to get me away if i were not occasionally to shew my real fretfulness upon the destitute condition to which he has reduced me when people set out wrong together it is very difficult to avoid recriminations he wished he knew but my mind that should direct him in his proposals and it would be his delight to observe it whatever it were my mind is that you sir should leave me out of hand how often must i tell you so if i were any where but here he would obey me he said if i insisted upon it but if i would assert my right that would be infinitely preferable in his opinion to any other measure but one which he durst only hint at for then admitting his visits or refusing them as i pleased granting a correspondence by letter only it would appear to all the world that what i had done was but in order to do myself justice how often mr lovelace must i repent that i will not litigate with my father do you think that my unhappy circumstances will alter my notions of my own duty so far as i shall be enabled to perform it how can i obtain possession without litigation and but by my trustees one of them will be against me the other is abroad then the remedy proposed by this measure were i disposed to fall in with it will require time to bring it into effect and what i want is present independence and your immediate absence upon his soul the wretch swore he did not think it safe for the reasons he had before given to leave me here he wished i would think of some place to which i should like to go but he must take the liberty to say that he hoped his behaviour had not been so exceptionable as to make me so very earnest for his absence in the interim and the less surely as i was almost eternally shutting up myself from him although he presumed to assure me that he never went from me but with a corrected heart and with strengthened resolutions of improving by my example externally shutting myself up from you repeated i i hope sir that i expect to be uninvaded in my retirements i hope you do not think me so weak a creature novice as you have found me in a very capital instance as to be fond of occasions to hear your fond speeches especially as no differing circumstances require your overfrequent visits nor that i am to be addressed to as if i thought hourly professions needful to assure me of your honour he seemed a little disconcerted you know mr lovelace proceeded i why i am so earnest for your absence it is that i may appear to the world independent of you and in hopes by that means to find it less difficult to set on foot a reconciliation with my friends and now let me add in order to make you easier as to the terms of that hopedfor reconciliation that since i find i have the good fortune to stand so well with your relations i will from time to time acquaint you by letter when you are absent with every step i shall take and with every overture that shall be made to me but not with an intention to render myself accountable to you neither as to my acceptance or nonacceptance of those overtures they know that i have a power given me by my grandfathers will to bequeath the estate he left me with other of his bounties in a way that may affect them though not absolutely from them this consideration i hope will procure me some from them when their passion subsides and when they know i am independent of you charming reasoning and let him tell me that the assurance i had given him was all he wished for it was more than he could ask what a happiness to have a woman of honour and generosity to depend upon had he on his first entrance into the world met with such a one he had never been other than a man of strict virtue but all he hoped was for the best since in that case he had never perhaps had the happiness he now had in view because his relations had always been urging him to marry and that before he had the honour to know me and now as he had not been so bad as some peoples malice reported him to be he hoped he should have near as much merit in his repentance as if he had never erred a fine rakish notion and hope and too much encouraged i doubt my dear by the generality of our sex this brought on a more serious question or two youll see by it what a creature an unmortified libertine is i asked him if he knew what he had said alluded to a sentence in the best of books that there as more joy in heaven he took the words out of my mouth over one sinner that repenteth than over ninetyandnine just persons which need no repentance were his words luke xv the parable is concerning the ninetynine sheep not the prodigal son as mr lovelace erroneously imagines yes madam i thought of it as soon as i said it but not before i have read the story of the prodigal son ill assure you and one day when i am settled as i hope to be will write a dramatic piece on the subject i have at times had it in my head and you will be too ready perhaps to allow me to be qualified fro it you so lately sir stumbled at a word with which you must be better acquainted ere you can be thoroughly master of such a subject that i am amazed you should know any thing of the scripture and be so ignorant of that see letter xxiv of this volume o madam i have read the bible as a fine piece of ancient history but as i hope to be saved it has for some years past made me so uneasy when i have popped upon some passages in it that i have been forced to run to music or company to divert myself poor wretch lifting up my hands and eyes the denunciations come so slapdash upon one so unceremoniously as i may say without even the byyourleave of a rude london chairman that they overturn one horse and man as st paul was overturned theres another scripture allusion madam the light in short as his was is too glaring to be borne o sir do you want to be complimented into repentance and salvation but pray mr lovelace do you mean any thing at all when you swear so often as you do by your soul or bind an asseveration with the words as you hope to be saved o my beloved creature shifting his seat let us call another cause why sir dont i neither use ceremony enough with you dearest madam forbear for the present i am but in my noviciate your foundation must be laid brick by brick youll hinder the progress of the good work you would promote if you tumble in a whole wagonload at once upon me lord bless me thought i what a character is that of a libertine what a creature am i who have risked what i have risked with such a one what a task before me if my hopes continue of reforming such a wild indian as this nay worse than a wild indian for a man who errs with his eyes open and against conviction is a thousand times worse for what he knows and much harder to be reclaimed than if he had never known any thing at all i was equally shocked at him and concerned for him and having laid so few bricks to speak to his allusion and those so illcemented i was as willing as the gay and inconsiderate to call another cause as he termed it another cause too more immediately pressing upon me from my uncertain situation i said i took it for granted that he assented to the reasoning he seemed to approve and would leave me and then i asked him what he really and in his most deliberate mind would advise me to in my present situation he must needs see i said that i was at a great loss what to resolve upon entirely a stranger to london having no adviser no protector at present himself he must give me leave to tell him greatly deficient in practice if not in the knowledge of those decorums which i had supposed were always to be found in a man of birth fortune and education he imagines himself i find to be a very polite man and cannot bear to be thought otherwise he put up his lip i am sorry for it madam a man of breeding a man of politeness give me leave to say colouring is much more of a black swan with you than with any lady i ever met with then that is your misfortune mr lovelace as well as mine at present every woman of discernment i say as i say i had a mind to mortify a pride that i am sure deserves to be mortified that your politeness is not regular nor constant it is not habit it is too much seen by fits and starts and sallies and those not spontaneous you must be reminded into them o lord o lord poor i was the light yet the halfangry wretchs selfpitying expression i proceeded upon my word sir you are not the accomplished man which your talents and opportunities would have led one to expect you to be you are indeed in your noviciate as to every laudable attainment letter xxxii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe in continuation as this subject was introduced by himself and treated so lightly by him i was going on to tell him more of my mind but he interrupted me dear dear madam spare me i am sorry that i have lived to this hour for nothing at all but surely you could not have quitted a subject so much more agreeable and so much more suitable i will say to your present situation if you had not too cruel a pleasure in mortifying a man who the less needed to be mortified as he before looked up to you with a diffidence in his own merits too great to permit him to speak half of his mind to you be pleased but to return to the subject we were upon and at another time i will gladly embrace correction from the only lips in the world so qualified to give it you talk of reformation sometimes mr lovelace and in so talking acknowledge errors but i see you can very ill bear the reproof for which perhaps you are not solicitous to avoid giving occasion far be it from me to take delight in finding fault i should be glad for both our sakes since my situation is what it is that i could do nothing but praise you but failures which affect a mind that need not be very delicate to be affected by them are too grating to be passed over in silence by a person who wises to be though in earnest in her own duties i admire your delicacy madam again interrupted he although i suffer by it yet would i not have it otherwise indeed i would not when i consider of it it is an angelic delicacy which sets you above all our sex and even above your own it is natural to you madam so you may think it extraordinary but there is nothing like it on earth said the flatterer what company has he kept but let us return to the former subject you were so good as to ask me what i would advise you to do i want but to make you easy i want but to see you fixed to your liking your faithful hannah with you your reconciliation with those to whom you wish to be reconciled set on foot and in a train and now let me mention to you different expedients in hopes that some one of them may be acceptable to you i will go to mrs howe or to miss howe or to whomsoever you would have me to go and endeavour to prevail upon them to receive you the reader perhaps need not be reminded that he had taken care from the first see vol i letter xxxi to deprive her of any protection from mrs howe see in his next letter a repeated account of the same artifices and his exultations upon his inventions to impose upon the two such watchful ladies as clarissa and miss howe do you incline to go to florence to your cousin morden i will furnish you with an opportunity of going thither either by sea to leghorn or by land through france perhaps i may be able to procure one of the ladies of my family to attend you either charlotte or patty would rejoice in such an opportunity of seeing france and italy as for myself i will only be your escort in disguise if you will have it so even in your livery that your punctilio may not receive offence by my attendance i told him i would consider of all he had said but that i hoped for a line or two from my aunt hervey if not from my sister to both of whom i had written which if i were to be so favoured might help to determine me mean time if he would withdraw i would particularly consider of this proposal of his in relation to my cousin morden and if it held its weight with me so far as to write for your opinion upon it he should know my mind in an hours time he withdrew with great respect and in an hours time returned and i then told him it was unnecessary to trouble you for your opinion about it my cousin morden was soon expected if he were not i could not admit him to accompany me to him upon any condition it was highly improbable that i should obtain the favour of either of his cousins company and if that could be brought about it would be the same thing in the worlds eye as if he went himself this led us into another conversation which shall be the subject of my next letter xxxiii miss clarissa harlowe in continuation mr lovelace told me that on the supposition that his proposal in relation to my cousin morden might not be accepted he had been studying to find out if possible some other expedient that might be agreeable in order to convince me that he preferred my satisfaction to his own he then offered to go himself and procure my hannah to come and attend me as i had declined the service of either of the young misses sorlings he was extremely solicitous he said that i should have a servant in whose integrity i might confide i told him that you would be so kind as to send to engage hannah if possible if any thing he said should prevent hannah from coming suppose he himself waited upon miss howe to desire her to lend me her servant till i was provided to my mind i said your mothers high displeasure at the step i had taken as she supposed voluntarily had deprived me of an open assistance of that sort from you he was amazed so much as mrs howe herself used to admire me and so great an influence as miss howe was supposed and deserved to have over her mother that mrs howe should take upon herself to be so much offended with me he wished that the man who took such pains to keep up and enflame the passions of my father and uncles were not at the bottom of this mischief too i was afraid i said that my brother was or else my uncle antony i dared to say would not have taken such pains to set mrs howe against me as i understood he had done since i had declined visiting lady sarah and lady betty he asked me if i should accept of a visit from his cousin montague and accept of a servant of hers for the present that was not i said an acceptable proposal but i would first see if my friends would send me my clothes that i might not make such a giddy and runaway appearance to any of his relations if i pleased he would take another journey to windsor to make a more particular inquiry amongst the canons or in any worthy family were not his objections as to the publicness of the place i asked him as strong now as before i remember my dear in one of your former letters you mentioned london as the most private place to be in and i said that since he made such pretences against leaving me here as shewed he had no intention to do so and since he engaged to go from me and leave me to pursue my own measures if i were elsewhere and since his presence made these lodgings inconvenient to me i should not be disinclined to go to london did i know any body there see vol ii letter xxxvii as he had several times proposed london to me i expected that he would eagerly have embraced that motion from me but he took not ready hold of it yet i thought his eye approved of it we are both great watchers of each others eyes and indeed seem to be more than half afraid of each other he then made a grateful proposal to me that i would send for my norton to attend me the reader is referred to mr lovelaces next letter for his motives in making the several proposals of which the lady is willing to think so well he saw by my eyes he said that he had at last been happy in an expedient which would answer the wishes of us both why says he did i not think of it before and snatching my hand shall i write madam shall i send shall i go and fetch the worthy woman myself after a little consideration i told him that this was indeed a grateful motion but that i apprehended it would put her to a difficulty which she would not be able to get over as it would make a woman of her known prudence appear to countenance a fugitive daughter in opposition to her parents and as her coming to me would deprive her of my mothers favour without its being in my power to make it up to her o my beloved creature said he generously enough let not this be an obstacle i will do every thing for mrs norton you wish to have done let me go for her more coolly than perhaps his generosity deserved i told him it was impossible but i must soon hear from my friends i should not mean time embroil any body with them not mrs norton especially from whose interest in and mediation with my mother i might expect some good were she to keep herself in a neutral state that besides the good woman had a mind above her fortune and would sooner want than be beholden to any body improperly improperly said he have not persons of merit a right to all the benefits conferred upon them mrs norton is so good a woman that i shall think she lays me under an obligation if she will put it in my power to serve her although she were not to augment it by giving me the opportunity at the same time of contributing to your pleasure and satisfaction how could this man with such powers of right thinking be so far depraved by evil habits as to disgrace his talents by wrong acting is there not room after all thought i at the time to hope as he so lately led me to hope that the example it will behove me for both our sakes to endeavour to set him may influence him to a change of manners in which both may find our account give me leave sir said i to tell you there is a strange mixture in your mind you must have taken pains to suppress many good motions and reflections as they arose or levity must have been surprisingly predominant in it but as to the subject we were upon there is no taking any resolutions till i hear from my friends well madam i can only say i would find out some expedient if i could that should be agreeable to you but since i cannot will you be so good as to tell me what you would wish to have done nothing in the world but i will comply with excepting leaving you here at such a distance from the place i shall be in if any thing should happen and in a place where my gossiping rascals have made me in a manner public for want of proper cautions at first these vermin added he have a pride they can hardly reinin when they serve a man of family they boast of their masters pedigree and descent as if they were related to him nor is any thing they know of him or of his affairs a secret to one another were it a matter that would hang him if so thought i men of family should take care to give them subjects worth boasting of i am quite at a loss said i what to do or where to go would you mr lovelace in earnest advise me to think of going to london and i looked at him with stedfastness but nothing could i gather from his looks at first madam said he i was for proposing london as i was then more apprehensive of pursuit but as your relations seem cooler on that head i am the more indifferent about the place you go to so as you are pleased so as you are easy i shall be happy this indifference of his to london i cannot but say made me incline the more to go thither i asked him to hear what he would say if he could recommend me to any particular place in london no he said none that was fit for me or that i should like his friend belford indeed had very handsome lodgings near sohosquare at a relations whose wife was a woman of virtue and honour these as mr belford was generally in the country he could borrow till i was better accommodated i was resolved to refuse these at the first mention as i should any other he had named nevertheless i will see thought i if he has really thought of these for me if i break off the talk here and he resume this proposal with earnestness in the morning i shall apprehend that he is less indifferent than he seems to be about my going to london and that he has already a lodging in his eye for me and then i will not go at all but after such generous motions from him i really think it a little barbarous to act and behave as if i thought him capable of the blackest and most ungrateful baseness but his character his principles are so faulty he is so light so vain so various that there is no certainty that he will be next hour what he is this then my dear i have no guardian now no father no mother only god and my vigilance to depend upon and i have no reason to expect a miracle in my favour well sir said i rising to leave him something must be resolved upon but i will postpone this subject till tomorrow morning he would fain have engaged me longer but i said i would see him as early as he pleased in the morning he might think of any convenient place in london or near it in mean time and so i retired from him as i do from my pen hoping for better rest for the few hours that remain of this night than i have had of a long time clarissa harlowe letter xxxiv miss clarissa harlowe in continuation monday morning april late as i went to bed i have had very little rest sleep and i have quarreled and although i court it it will not be friends i hope its fellowirreconcilables at harloweplace enjoy its balmy comforts else that will be an aggravation of my fault my brother and sister i dare say want it not mr lovelace who is an early riser as well as i joined me in the garden about six and after the usual salutations asked me to resume our last nights subject it was upon lodgings at london he said i think you mentioned one to me sir did you not yes madam but watching the turn of my countenance rather as what you would be welcome to than perhaps approve of i believe so too to go to town upon an uncertainty i own is not agreeable but to be obliged to any persons of your acquaintance when i want to be thought independent of you and to a person especially to whom my friends are to direct to me if they vouchsafe to take notice of me at all is an absurd thing to mention he did not mention it as what he imagined i would accept but only to confirm to me what he had said that he himself knew of none fit for me has not your family madam some one tradesman they deal with who has conveniences of this kind i would make it worth such a persons while to keep his secret of your being at his house traders are dealers in pins said he and will be more obliged by a penny customer than by a pound present because it is in their way yet will refuse neither any more than a lawyer or a man of office his fee my fathers tradesmen i said would no doubt be the first employed to find me out so that that proposal was as wrong as the other and who is it that a creature so lately in favour with all her friends can apply to in such a situation as mine but must be at least equally the friends of her relations we had a good deal of discourse upon the same topic but at last the result was this he wrote a letter to one mr doleman a married man of fortune and character i excepting to mr belford desiring him to provide decent apartments ready furnished i had told him what they should be for a single woman consisting of a bedchamber another for a maidservant with the use of a diningroom or parlour this letter he gave me to peruse and then sealed it up and dispatched it away in my presence by one of his own servants who having business in town is to bring back an answer i attend the issue of it holding myself in readiness to set out for london unless you my dear advise the contrary letter xxxv mr lovelace to john belford esq sat sunday monday he gives in several letters the substance of what is contained in the last seven of the ladys he tells his friend that calling at the lawn in his way to m hall for he owns that he went not to windsor he found the letters from lady betty lawrance and his cousin montague which mrs greme was about sending to him by a special messenger he gives the particulars from mrs gremes report of what passed between the lady and her as in letter vi and makes such declarations to mrs greme of his honour and affection to the lady as put her upon writing the letter to her sister sorlings the contents of which are in letter xxviii he then accounts as follows for the serious humour he found her in on his return upon such good terms when we parted i was surprised to find so solemn a brow upon my return and her charming eyes red with weeping but when i had understood she had received letters from miss howe it was natural to imagine that that little devil had put her out of humour with me it is easy for me to perceive that my charmer is more sullen when she receives and has perused a letter from that vixen than at other times but as the sweet maid shews even then more of passive grief than of active spirit i hope she is rather lamenting than plotting and indeed for what now should she plot when i am become a reformed man and am hourly improving in my morals nevertheless i must contrive some way or other to get at their correspondence only to see the turn of it thats all but no attempt of this kind must be made yet a detected invasion in an article so sacred would ruin me beyond retrieve nevertheless it vexes me to the heart to think that she is hourly writing her whole mind on all that passes between her and me i under the same roof with her yet kept at such awful distance that i dare not break into a correspondence that may perhaps be a mean to defeat all my devices would it be very wicked jack to knock her messenger on the head as he is carrying my beloveds letters or returning from miss howes to attempt to bribe him and not succeed would utterly ruin me and the man seems to be one used to poverty one who can sit down satisfied with it and enjoy it contented with handtomouth conveniencies and not aiming to live better tomorrow than he does today and than he did yesterday such a one is above temptation unless it could come clothed in the guise of truth and trust what likelihood of corrupting a man who has no hope no ambition yet the rascal has but half life and groans under that should i be answerable in his case for a whole life but hang the fellow let him live were i king or a minister of state an antonio perez it were another thing and yet on second thoughts am i not a rake as it is called and who ever knew a rake stick at any thing but thou knowest jack that the greatest half of my wickedness is vapour to shew my invention and to prove that i could be mischievous if i would antonio perez was first minister of philip ii king of spain by whose command he caused don juan de escovedo to be assassinated which brought on his own ruin through the perfidy of his viler master geddes tracts when he comes to that part where the lady says letter xxix in a sarcastic way waving her hand and bowing excuse me good mr lovelace that i am willing to think the best of my father he gives a description of her air and manner greatly to her advantage and says i could hardly forbear taking her into my arms upon it in spite of an expected tempest so much wit so much beauty such a lively manner and such exceeding quickness and penetration o belford she must be nobodys but mine i can now account for and justify herods command to destroy his mariamne if he returned not alive from his interview with caesar for were i to know that it were but probable that any other man were to have this charming creature even after my death the very thought would be enough to provoke me to cut that mans throat were he a prince i may be deemed by this lady a rapid a boisterous lover and she may like me the less for it but all the ladies i have met with till now loved to raise a tempest and to enjoy it nor did they ever raise it but i enjoyed it too lord send us once happily to london mr lovelace gives the following account of his rude rapture when he seized her hand and put her by his wild manner as she expresses it letter xxxix into such terror darkness and light i swore were convertible at her pleasure she could make any subject plausible i was all error she all perfection and i snatched her hand and more than kissed it i was ready to devour it there was i believe a kind of phrensy in my manner which threw her into a panic like that of semele perhaps when the thunderer in all his majesty surrounded with ten thousand celestial burningglasses was about to scorch her into a cinder had not my heart misgiven me and had i not just in time recollected that she was not so much in my power but that she might abandon me at her pleasure having more friends in that house than i had i should at that moment have made offers that would have decided all one way or other but apprehending that i had shewn too much meaning in my passion i gave it another turn but little did the charmer think that an escape either she or i had as the event might have proved from that sudden gust of passion which had like to have blown me into her arms she was born i told her to make me happy and to save a soul he gives the rest of his vehement speech pretty nearly in the same words as the lady gives them and then proceeds i saw she was frighted and she would have had reason had the scene been london and that place in london which i have in view to carry her to she confirmed me in my apprehension that i had alarmed her too much she told me that she saw what my boasted regard to her injunctions was and she would take proper measures upon it as i should find that she was shocked at my violent airs and if i hoped any favour from her i must that instant withdraw and leave her to her recollection she pronounced this in such a manner as shewed she was set upon it and having stepped out of the gentle and polite part i had so newly engaged to act i thought ready obedience was the best atonement and indeed i was sensible from her anger and repulses that i wanted time myself for recollection and so i withdrew with the same veneration as a petitioning subject would withdraw from the presence of his sovereign but o belford had she had but the least patience with me had she but made me think she would forgive this initiatory ardour surely she will not be always thus guarded i had not been a moment by myself but i was sensible that i had half forfeited my newlyassumed character it is exceedingly difficult thou seest for an honest man to act in disguises as the poet says thrust nature back with a pitchfork it will return i recollected that what she had insisted upon was really a part of that declared will before she left her fathers house to which in another case to humble her i had pretended to have an inviolable regard and when i had remembered her words of taking her measures accordingly i was resolved to sacrifice a leg or an arm to make all up again before she had time to determine upon any new measures how seasonably to this purpose have come in my aunts and cousins letters i have sent in again and again to implore her to admit me to her presence but she will conclude a letter she is writing to miss howe before she will see me i suppose to give her an account of what has just passed curse upon her perverse tyranny how she makes me wait for an humble audience though she has done writing for some time a prince begging for her upon his knees should not prevail upon me to spare her if i can but get her to london oons jack i believe i have bit my lip through for vexation but one day hers shall smart for it mr lovelace beginning a new date gives an account of his admittance and of the conversation that followed which differing only in style from that of the lady gives in the next letter is omitted he collects the ladys expressions which his pride cannot bear such as that he is a stranger to the decorums which she thought inseparable from a man of birth and education and that he is not the accomplished man he imagines himself to be and threatens to remember them against her he values himself upon his proposals and speeches which he gives to his friend pretty much to the same purpose that the lady does in her four last letters after mentioning his proposal to her that she would borrow a servant from miss howe till hannah could come he writes as follows thou seest belford that my charmer has no notion that miss howe herself is but a puppet danced upon my wires at second or third hand to outwit and impel as i please two such girls as these who think they know every thing and by taking advantage of the pride and illnature of the old ones of both families to play them off likewise at the very time they think they are doing me spiteful displeasure what charming revenge then the sweet creature when i wished that her brother was not at the bottom of mrs howes resentment to tell me that she was afraid he was or her uncle would not have appeared against her to that lady pretty dear how innocent but dont think me the cause neither of her familys malice and resentment it is all in their hearts i work but with their materials they if left to their own wicked direction would perhaps express their revenge by fire and faggot that is to say by the private dagger or by lord chief justices warrants by law and so forth i only point the lightning and teach it where to dart without the thunder in other words i only guide the effects the cause is in their malignant hearts and while i am doing a little mischief i prevent a great deal thus he exults on her mentioning london i wanted her to propose london herself this made me again mention windsor if you would have a woman do one thing you must always propose another and that the very contrary the sex the very sex as i hope to be saved why jack they lay a man under a necessity to deal doubly with them and when they find themselves outwitted they cry out upon an honest fellow who has been too hard for them at their own weapons i could hardly contain myself my heart was at my throat down down said i to myself exuberant exultation a sudden cough befriended me i again turned to her all as indifferenced over as a girl at the first longexpected question who waits for two more i heard out the rest of her speech and when she had done instead of saying any thing to her for london i advised her to send for mrs norton as i knew she would be afraid of lying under obligation i could have proposed to do so much for the good woman and her son as would have made her resolve that i should do nothing this however not merely to avoid expense but there was no such thing as allowing of the presence of mrs norton i might as well have had her mother or her aunt hervey with her hannah had she been able to come and had she actually come i could have done well enough with what do i keep fellows idling in the country for but to fall in love and even to marry those whom i would have them marry nor upon second thoughts would the presence of her norton or of her aunt or even of her mother have saved the dear creature had i decreed her fall how unequal is a modest woman to the adventure when she throws herself into the power of a rake punctilio will at any time stand for reason with such an one she cannot break through a welltested modesty none but the impudent little rogues who can name the parson and the church before you think of either and undress and go to bed before you the next hour should think of running away with a man i am in the right train now every hour i doubt not will give me an increasing interest in the affections of this proud beauty i have just carried unpoliteness far enough to make her afraid of me and to shew her that i am no whiner every instance of politeness now will give me double credit with her my next point will be to make her acknowledge a lambent flame a preference of me to all other men at least and then my happy hour is not far off an acknowledged reciprocality in love sanctifies every little freedom and little freedoms beget greater and if she call me ungenerous i can call her cruel the sex love to be called cruel many a time have i complained of cruelty even in the act of yielding because i knew it gratified the fair ones pride mentioning that he had only hinted at mr belfords lodgings as an instance to confirm what he had told her that he knew of none in london fit for her he says i had a mind to alarm her with something furthest from my purpose for as much as she disliked my motion i intend nothing by it mrs osgood is too pious a woman and would have been more her friend than mine i had a view moreover to give her an high opinion of her own sagacity i love when i dig a put to have my prey tumble in with secure feet and open eyes then a man can look down upon her with an oho charmer how came you there monday april i have just now received a fresh piece of intelligence from my agent honest joseph leman thou knowest the history of poor miss betterton of nottingham james harlowe is plotting to revive the resentments of her family against me the harlowes took great pains some time ago to endeavour to get to the bottom of that story but now the foolish devils are resolved to do something in it if they can my head is working to make this booby squire a plotter and a clever fellow in order to turn his plots to my advantage supposing his sister shall aim to keep me at arms length when in town and to send me from her but i will in proper time let thee see josephs letter and what i shall answer to it to know in time a designed mischief is with me to disappoint it and to turn it upon the contrivers head see letters xlvii xlviii of this volume joseph is plaguy squeamish again but i know he only intends by his qualms to swell his merits with me o belford belford what a vile corruptible rogue whether in poor or rich is human nature letter xxxvi miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe in answer to letters xxviii xxxiv inclusive tuesday april you have a most implacable family another visit from your uncle antony has not only confirmed my mother an enemy to our correspondence but has almost put her upon treading in their steps but to other subjects you plead generously for mr hickman perhaps with regard to him i may have done as i have often done in singing begun a note or key too high and yet rather than begin again proceed though i strain my voice or spoil my tune but this is evident the man is the more observant for it and you have taught me that the spirit which is the humbler for ill usage will be insolent upon better so good and grave mr hickman keep your distance a little longer i beseech you you have erected an altar to me and i hope you will not refuse to bow to it but you ask me if i would treat mr lovelace were he to be in mr hickmans place as i do mr hickman why really my dear i believe i should not i have been very sagely considering this point of behaviour in general on both sides in courtship and i will very candidly tell you the result i have concluded that politeness even to excess is necessary on the mens part to bring us to listen to their first addresses in order to induce us to bow our necks to a yoke so unequal but upon my conscience i very much doubt whether a little intermingled insolence is not requisite from them to keep up that interest when once it has got footing men must not let us see that we can make fools of them and i think that smooth love that is to say a passion without rubs in other words a passion without passion is like a sleepy stream that is hardly seen to give motion to a straw so that sometimes to make us fear and even for a short space to hate the wretch is productive of the contrary extreme if this be so lovelace than whom no man was ever more polite and obsequious at the beginning has hit the very point for his turbulence since his readiness to offend and his equal readiness to humble himself as must keep a womans passion alive and at last tire her into a nonresistance that shall make her as passive as a tyranthusband would wish her to be i verily think that the different behaviour of our two heroes to their heroines make out this doctrine to demonstration i am so much accustomed for my own part to hickmans whining creeping submissive courtship that i now expect nothing but whine and cringe from him and am so little moved with his nonsense that i am frequently forced to go to my harpsichord to keep me awake and to silence his humdrum whereas lovelace keeps up the ball with a witness and all his address and conversation is one continual game at raquet your frequent quarrels and reconciliations verify this observation and i really believe that could hickman have kept my attention alive after the lovelace manner only that he had preserved his morals i should have married the man by this time but then he must have set out accordingly for now he can never never recover himself thats certain but must be a dangler to the end of the courtshipchapter and what is still worse for him a passive to the end of his life poor hickman perhaps youll say i have been called your echo poor hickman say i you wonder my dear that mr lovelace took not notice to you overnight of the letters of lady betty and his cousin i dont like his keeping such a material and relative circumstance as i may call it one moment from you by his communicating the contents of them to you next day when you was angry with him it looks as if he withheld them for occasional pacifiers and if so must he not have had a forethought that he might give you cause for anger of all the circumstances that have happened since you have been with him i think i like this the least this alone my dear small as it might look to an indifferent eye in mine warrants all your caution yet i think that mrs gremes letter to her sister sorlings his repeated motions for hannahs attendance and for that of one of the widow sorlingss daughters and above all for that of mrs norton are agreeable counterbalances were it not for these circumstances i should have said a great deal more of the other yet what a foolish fellow to let you know overnight that he had such letters i cant tell what to make of him i am pleased with the contents of these ladies letters and the more as i have caused the family to be again sounded and find that they are all as desirous as ever of your alliance they really are every one of them your very great admirers and as for lord m he is so much pleased with you and with the confidence as he calls it which you have reposed in his nephew that he vows he will disinherit him if he reward it not as he ought you must take care that you lose not both families i hear mrs norton is enjoined as she values the favour of the other family not to correspond either with you or with me poor creatures but they are your yet they are not your relations neither i believe had you had any other nurse i should have concluded you had been changed i suffer by their low malice excuse me therefore you really hold this man to his good behaviour with more spirit than i thought you mistress of especially when i judged of you by that meekness which you always contended for as the proper distinction of the female character and by the love which think as you please you certainly have for him you may rather be proud of than angry at the imputation since you are the only woman i ever knew read or heard of whose love was so much governed by her prudence but when once the indifference of the husband takes place of the ardour of the lover it will be your turn and if i am not mistaken this man who is the only selfadmirer i ever knew who was not a coxcomb will rather in his day expect homage than pay it your handsome husbands my dear make a wifes heart ache very often and though you are as fine a person of a woman at the least as he is of a man he will take too much delight in himself to think himself more indebted to your favour than you are to his distinction and preference of you but no man take your finer mind with your very fine person can deserve you so you must be contented should your merit be underrated since that must be so marry whom you will perhaps you will think i indulge these sort of reflections against your narcissuss of men to keep my mothers choice for me of hickman in countenance with myself i dont know but there is something in it at least enough to have given birth to the reflection i think there can be no objection to your going to london there as in the centre you will be in the way of hearing from every body and sending to any body and then you will put all his sincerity to the test as to his promised absence and such like but indeed my dear i think you have nothing for it but marriage you may try that you may say you have tried what your relations can be brought to but the moment they refuse your proposals submit to the yoke and make the best of it he will be a savage indeed if he makes you speak out yet it is my opinion that you must bend a little for he cannot bear to be thought slightly of this was one of his speeches once i believe designed for me a woman who means one day to favour her lover with her hand should show the world for her own sake that she distinguishes him from the common herd shall i give you another very fine sentence of his and in the true libertine style as he spoke it throwing out his challenging hand d n him if he would marry the first princess on earth if he but thought she balanced a minute in her choice of him or of an emperor all the world in short expect you to have this man they think that you left your fathers house for this very purpose the longer the ceremony is delayed the worse appearance it will have in the worlds eye and it will not be the fault of some of your relations if a slur be not thrown upon your reputation while you continue unmarried your uncle antony in particular speaks rough and vile things grounded upon the morals of his brother orson but hitherto your admirable character has antidoted the poison the detractor is despised and every ones indignation raised against him i have written through many interruptions and you will see the first sheet creased and rumpled occasioned by putting it into my bosom on my mothers sudden coming upon me we have had one very pretty debate i will assure you but it is not worth while to trouble you with the particulars but upon my world no matter though your hannah cannot attend you the poor girl left her place about a fortnight ago on account of the rheumatic disorder which has confined her to her room ever since she burst into tears when kitty carried to her your desire of having her with you and called herself doubly unhappy that she could not wait upon a mistress whom she so dearly loved had my mother answered my wishes i should have been sorry mr lovelace had been the first proposer of my kitty for your attendant till hannah should come to be altogether among strangers and a stranger to attend you every time you remove is a very disagreeable thing but your considerateness and bounty will make you faithful ones wherever you go you must take your own way but if you suffer any inconvenience either as to clothes or money that it is in my power to remedy i will never forgive you my mother if that is your objection need not know any thing of the matter we have all our defects we have often regretted the particular fault which though in venerable characters we must have been blind not to see i remember what you once said to me and the caution was good let us my nancy were your words let us who have not the same failings as those we censure guard against other and greater in ourselves nevertheless i must needs tell you that my mother has vexed me a little very lately by some instances of her jealous narrowness i will mention one of them though i did not intend it she wanted to borrow thirty guineas of me only while she got a note changed i said i could lend her but eight or ten eight or ten would not do she thought i was much richer i could have told her i was much cunninger than to let her know my stock which on a review i find ninetyfive guineas and all of them most heartily at your service i believe your uncle tony put her upon this wise project for she was out of cash in an hour after he left her if he did you will judge that they intend to distress you if it will provoke you to demand your own in a legal way i wish they would since their putting you upon that course will justify the necessity of your leaving them and as it is not for your credit to own that you were tricked away contrary to your intention this would afford a reason for your going off that i should make very good use of youll see that i approve of lovelaces advice upon this subject i am not willing to allow the weight of your answer to him on that head which perhaps ought to be allowed it see letter xxxi of this volume you must be the less surprised at the inventions of this man because of his uncommon talents whatever he had turned his head to he would have excelled in or been or done things extraordinary he is said to be revengeful a very bad quality i believe indeed he is a devil in every thing but his foot this therefore is my repeated advice provoke him not too much against yourself but unchain him and let him loose upon your sister betty and your brothers joseph leman this is resenting low but i know to whom i write or else i would go a good deal higher ill assure you your next i suppose will be from london pray direct it and your future letters till further notice to mr hickman at his own house he is entirely devoted to you dont take so heavily my mothers partiality and prejudices i hope i am past a baby heaven preserve you and make you as happy as i think you deserve to be prays your ever affectionate anna howe letter xxxvii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe wedn morning april i am glad my dear friend that you approve of my removal to london the disagreement between your mother and you gives me inexpressible affliction i hope i think you both more unhappy than you are but i beseech you let me know the particulars of the debate you call a very pretty one i am well acquainted with your dialect when i am informed of the whole let your mother have been ever so severe upon me i shall be easier a great deal faulty people should rather deplore the occasion they have given for anger than resent it if i am to be obliged to any body in england for money it shall be to you your mother need not know of your kindness to me you say but she must know it if it be done and if she challenge my beloved friend upon it for would you either falsify or prevaricate i wish your mother could be made easy on this head forgive me my dear but i know yet once she had a better opinion of me o my inconsiderate rashness excuse me once more i pray you pride when it is native will shew itself sometimes in the midst of mortifications but my stomach is down already i am unhappy that i cannot have my worthy hannah i am sorry for the poor creatures illness as for my own disappointment by it come my dear miss howe since you press me to be beholden to you and would think me proud if i absolutely refused your favour pray be so good as to send her two guineas in my name if i have nothing for it as you say but matrimony it yields little comfort that his relations do not despise the fugitive as persons of their rank and qualitypride might be supposed to do for having been a fugitive but o my cruel thrice cruel uncle to suppose but my heart checks my pen and will not let it proceed on an intimation so extremely shocking as that which he supposes yet if thus they have been persuaded no wonder if they are irreconcilable this is all my hardhearted brothers doings his surmisings god forgive him prays his injured sister letter xxxviii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe thursday april mr lovelaces servant is already returned with an answer from his friend mr doleman who has taken pains in his inquiries and is very particular mr lovelace brought me the letter as soon as he had read it and as he now knows that i acquaint you with every thing that he offers i desired him to let me send it to you for your perusal be pleased to return it by the first opportunity you will see by it that his friends in town have a notion that we are actually married to robert lovelace esq tuesday night april dear sir i am extremely rejoiced to hear that we shall so soon have you in town after so long an absence you will be the more welcome still if what report says be true which is that you are actually married to the fair lady upon whom we have heard you make such encomiums mrs doleman and my sister both wish you joy if you are and joy upon your near prospect if you are not i have been in town for this week past to get help if i could from my paralytic complaints and am in a course for them which nevertheless did not prevent me from making the desired inquiries this is the result you may have a first floor well furnished at a mercers in belford street coventgarden with conveniencies for servants and these either by the quarter or month the terms according to the conveniences required mrs doleman has seen lodgings in norfolkstreet and others in cecil street but though the prospects to the thames and surreyhills look inviting from both these streets yet i suppose they are too near the city the owner of those in norfolkstreet would have half the house go together it would be too much for your description therefore and i suppose tat when you think fit to declare your marriage you will hardly be in lodgings those in cecilstreet are neat and convenient the owner is a widow of a good character and she insists that you take them for a twelvemonth certain you may have good accommodations in doverstreet at a widows the relict of an officer in the guards who dying soon after he had purchased his commission to which he had a good title by service and which cost him most part of what he had she was obliged to let lodgings this may possibly be an objection but she is very careful she says that she takes no lodgers but of figure and reputation she rents two good houses distant from each other only joined by a large handsome passage the innerhouse is the genteelest and very elegantly furnished but you may have the use of a very handsome parlour in the outerhouse if you choose to look into the street a little garden belongs to the innerhouse in which the old gentlewoman has displayed a true female fancy having crammed it with vases flower pots and figures without number as these lodgings seemed to me the most likely to please you i was more particular in my inquiries about them the apartments she has to let are in the innerhouse they are a diningroom two neat parlours a withdrawingroom two or three handsome bedchambers one with a pretty light closet in it which looks into the little garden all furnished in taste a dignified clergyman his wife and maiden daughter were the last who lived in them they have but lately quitted them on his being presented to a considerable church preferment in ireland the gentlewoman says that he took the lodgings but for three months certain but liked them and her usage so well that he continued in them two years and left them with regret though on so good an account she bragged that this was the way of all the lodgers she ever had who staid with her four times as long as they at first intended i had some knowledge of the colonel who was always looked upon as a man of honour his relict i never saw before i think she has a masculine air and is a little forbidding at first but when i saw her behaviour to two agreeable gentlewomen her husbands nieces whom for that reason she calls doubly hers and heard their praises of her i could imputer her very bulk to good humour since we seldom see your sour peevish people plump she lives reputably and is as i find aforehand in the world if these or any other of the lodgings i have mentioned be not altogether to your ladys mind she may continue in them the less while and choose others for herself the widow consents that you shall take them for a month only and what of them you please the terms she says she will not fall out upon when she knows what your lady expects and what her servants are to do or yours will undertake for she observed that servants are generally worse to deal with than their masters or mistresses the lady may board or not as she pleases as we suppose you were married but that you have reason from family differences to keep it private for the present i thought it not amiss to hint as much to the widow but as uncertainty however and asked her if she could in that case accommodate you and your servants as well as the lady and hers she said she could and wished by all means it were to be so since the circumstance of a persons being single it not as well recommended as this lady was one of the usual exceptions if none of these lodgings please you need not doubt very handsome ones in or near hanoversquare sohosquare goldensquare or in some of the new streets about grosvenorsquare and mrs doleman her sister and myself most cordially join to offer to your good lady the best accommodations we can make for her at uxbridge and also for you if you are the happy man we wish you to be till she fits herself more to her mind let me add that the lodgings at the mercers those in cecilstreet those at the widows in doverstreet any of them may be entered upon at a days warning i am my dear sir your sincere and affectionate friend and servant tho doleman you will easily guess my dear when you have read the letter which lodgings i made choice of but first to try him as in so material a point i thought i could not be too circumspect i seemed to prefer those in norfolkstreet for the very reason the writer gives why he thought i would not that is to say for its neighbourhood to a city so well governed as london is said to be nor should i have disliked a lodging in the heart of it having heard but indifferent accounts of the liberties sometimes taken at the other end of the town then seeming to incline to the lodgings in cecilstreet then to the mercers but he made no visible preference and when i asked his opinion of the widow gentlewomans he said he thought those the most to my taste and convenience but as he hoped that i would think lodgings necessary but for a very little while he knew not which to give his vote for i then fixed upon the widows and he has written accordingly to mr doleman making my compliments to his lady and sister for their kind offer i am to have the diningroom the bedchamber with the lightcloset of which if i stay any time at the widows i shall make great use and a servants room and we propose to set out on saturday morning as for a maid servant poor hannahs illness is a great disappointment to me but as he observes i can make the widow satisfaction for one of hers till i can get a servant to my mind and you know i want not much attendance mr lovelace has just now of his own accord given me five guineas for poor hannah i send them inclosed be so good as to cause them to be conveyed to her and to let her know from whom they came he has obliged me much by this little mark of his considerateness indeed i have the better opinion of him ever since he proposed her return to me i have just now another instance of his considerateness he came to me and said that on second thoughts he could not bear that i should go up to town without some attendant were it but for the look of the thing to the london widow and her nieces who according to his friends account lived so genteelly and especially as i required him to leave me so soon after i arrived there and so would be left alone among strangers he therefore sought that i might engage mrs sorlings to lend me one of her two maids or let one of her daughters go up with me and stay till i were provided and if the latter the young gentlewoman no doubt would be glad of so good an opportunity to see the curiosities of the town and would be a proper attendant on the same occasions i told him as i had done before that the two young gentlewomen were so equally useful in their way and servants in a busy farm were so little to be spared that i should be loth to take them off their laudable employments nor should i think much of diversions for one while and so the less want an attendant out of doors and now my dear lest any thing should happen in so variable which at present are more promising than ever yet they have been since i quitted harloweplace i will snatch the opportunity to subscribe myself your not unhoping and everobliged friend and servant cl harlowe letter xxxix mr lovelace to john belford esq thursday april he begins with communicating to him the letter he wrote to mr doleman to procure suitable lodgings in town and which he sent away by the ladys approbation and then gives him a copy of the answer to it see p upon which he thus expresses himself thou knowest the widow thou knowest her nieces thou knowest the lodgings and didst thou ever read a letter more artfully couched than this of tom doleman every possible objection anticipated every accident provided against every tittle of it plotproof who could forbear smiling to see my charmer like a farcical dean and chapter choose what was before chosen for her and sagaciously as they go in form to prayers that heaven would direct their choice pondering upon the different proposals as if she would make me believe she had a mind for some other the dear sly rogue looking upon me too with a view to discover some emotion in me emotions i had but i can tell her that they lay deeper than her eye could reach though it had been a sun beam no confidence in me fair one none at all tis plain thou wilt not if i were inclined to change my views encourage me by a generous reliance on my honour and shall it be said that i a master of arts in love shall be overmatched by so unpractised a novice but to see the charmer so far satisfied with my contrivance as to borrow my friends letter in order to satisfy miss howe likewise silly little rogues to walk out into byepaths on the strength of their own judgment when nothing but experience can enable them to disappoint us and teach them grandmotherwisdom when they have it indeed then may they sit down like so many cassandras and preach caution to others who will as little mind them as they did their instructresses whenever a fine handsome confidant young fellow such a one as thou knowest who comes across them but belford didst thou not mind that sly rogue dolemans naming dover street for the widows place of abode what dost thou think could be meant by that tis impossible thou shouldst guess so not to puzzle thee about it suppose the widow sinclairs in doverstreet should be inquired after by some officious person in order to come at characters miss howe is as sly as the devil and as busy to the full and neither such a name nor such a house can be found in that street nor a house to answer the description then will not the keenest hunter in england be at a fault but how wilt thou do methinks thou askest to hinder the lady from resenting the fallacy and mistrusting thee the more on that account when she finds it out to be in another street pho never mind that either i shall have a way for it or we shall thoroughly understand one another by that time or if we dont shell know enough of me not to wonder at such a peccadilla but how wilt thou hinder the lady from apprizing her friend of the real name she must first know it herself monkey must she not well but how wilt thou do to hinder her from knowing the street and her friend from directing letters thither which will be the same thing as if the name were known let me alone for that too if thou further objectest that tom doleman is too great a dunce to write such a letter in answer to mine canst thou not imagine that in order to save honest tom all this trouble i who know the town so well could send him a copy of what he should write and leave him nothing to do but transcribe what now sayest thou to me belford and suppose i had designed this task of inquiry for thee and suppose the lady excepted against thee for no other reason in the world but because of my value for thee what sayest thou to the lady jack this it is to have leisure upon my hands what a matchless plotter thy friend stand by and let me swell i am already as big as an elephant and ten times wiser mightier too by far have i not reason to snuff the moon with my proboscis lord help thee for a poor for a very poor creature wonder not that i despise thee heartily since the man who is disposed immoderately to exalt himself cannot do it but by despising every body else in proportion i shall make good use of the dolemanic hint of being married but i will not tell thee all at once nor indeed have i thoroughly digested that part of my plot when a general must regulate himself by the motions of a watchful adversary how can he say beforehand what he will or what he will not do widow sinclair didst thou not say lovelace ay sinclair jack remember the name sinclair i repeat she has no other and her features being broad and fullblown i will suppose her to be of highland extraction as her husband the colonel mind that too was a scot as brave as honest i never forget the minutiae in my contrivances in all matters that admit of doubt the minutiae closely attended to and provided for are of more service than a thousand oaths vows and protestations made to supply the neglect of them especially when jealousy has made its way in the working mind thou wouldst wonder if thou knewest one half of my providences to give thee but one i have already been so good as to send up a list of books to be procured for the ladys closet mostly at second hand and thou knowest that the women there are all well read but i will not anticipate besides it looks as if i were afraid of leaving any thing to my old friend chance which has many a time been an excellent second to me and ought not be affronted or despised especially by one who has the art of making unpromising incidents turn out in his favour letter xl miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe wednesday april i have a piece of intelligence to give you which concerns you much to know your brother having been assured that you are not married has taken a resolution to find you out waylay you and carry you off a friend of his a captain of a ship undertakes to get you on shipboard and to sail away with you either to hull or leith in the way to one of your brothers houses they are very wicked for in spite of your virtue they conclude you to be ruined but if they can be assured when they have you that you are not they will secure you till they can bring you out mrs solmes mean time in order to give mr lovelace full employment they talk of a prosecution which will be set up against him for some crime they have got a notion of which they think if it do not cost him his life will make him fly his country this is very early news miss bell told it in confidence and with mighty triumph over lovelace to miss lloyd who is at present her favourite though as much you admirer as ever miss lloyd being very apprehensive of the mischief which might follow such an attempt told it to me with leave to apprize you privately of it and yet neither she nor i would be sorry perhaps if lovelace were to be fairly hanged that is to say if you my dear had no objection to it but we cannot bear that such an admirable creature should be made the tennisball of two violent spirits much less that you should be seized and exposed to the brutal treatment of wretches who have no bowels if you can engage mr lovelace to keep his temper upon it i think you should acquaint him with it but not to mention miss lloyd perhaps his wicked agent may come at the intelligence and reveal it to him but leave it to your own discretions to do as you think fit in it all my concern is that this daring and foolish project if carried on will be a mean of throwing you more into his power than ever but as it will convince you that there can be no hope of a reconciliation i wish you were actually married let the cause for prosecution hinted at be what it will short of murder or a rape your hannah was very thankful for your kind present she heaped a thousand blessings upon you for it she has mr lovelaces too by this time i am pleased with mr hickman i can tell you for he has sent her two guineas by the person who carries mr lovelaces five as from an unknown hand nor am i or you to know it but he does a great many things of this sort and is as silent as the night in his charities for nobody knows of them till the gratitude of the benefited will not let them be concealed he is now and then my almoner and i believe always adds to my little benefactions but his time is not come to be praised to his face for these things nor does he seem to want that encouragement the man certainly has a good mind nor can we expect in one man every good quality but he is really a silly fellow my dear to trouble his head about me when he sees how much i despise his whole sex and must of course make a common man look like a fool were he not to make himself look like one by wishing to pitch his tent so oddly our likings and dislikings as i have often thought are seldom governed by prudence or with a view to happiness the eye my dear the wicked eye has such a strict alliance with the heart and both have such enmity to the judgment what an unequal union the mind and body all the senses like the family at harloweplace in a confederacy against that which would animate and give honour to the whole were it allowed its proper precedence permit me i beseech you before you go to london to send you fortyeight guineas i mention that sum to oblige you because by accepting back the two to hannah i will hold you indebted to me fifty surely this will induce you you know that i cannot want the money i told you that i had near double that sum and that the half of it is more than my mother knows i am mistress of you are afraid that my mother will question me on this subject and then you think i must own the truth but little as i love equivocation and little as you would allow of it in your anna howe it is hard if i cannot were i to be put to it ever so closely find something to say that would bring me off as you have what can you do at such a place as london you dont know what occasion you may have for messengers intelligence and suchlike if you dont oblige me i shall not think your stomach so much down as you say it is and as in this one particular i think it ought to be as to the state of things between my mother and me you know enough of her temper not to need to be told that she never espouses or resents with indifference yet will she not remember that i am her daughter no truly i am all my papas girl she was very sensible surely of the violence of my poor fathers temper that she can so long remember that when acts of tenderness and affection seem quite forgotten some daughters would be tempted to think that controul sat very heavy upon a mother who can endeavour to exert the power she has over a child and regret for years after death that she had not the same over a husband if this manner of expression becomes not me of my mother the fault will be somewhat extenuated by the love i always bore to my father and by the reverence i shall ever pay to his memory for he was a fond father and perhaps would have been as tender a husband had not my mother and he been too much of a temper to agree the misfortune was in short that when one was out of humour the other would be so too yet neither of their tempers comparatively bad notwithstanding all which i did not imagine girl as i was in my fathers lifetime that my mothers part of the yoke sat so heavy upon her neck as she gives me room to think it did whenever she is pleased to disclaim her part of me both parents as i have often thought should be very careful if they would secure to themselves the undivided love of their children that of all things they should avoid such durable contentions with each other as should distress their children in choosing their party when they would be glad to reverence both as they ought but here is the thing there is not a better manager of affairs in the sex than my mother and i believe a notable wife is more impatient of controul than an indolent one an indolent one perhaps thinks she has some thing to compound for while women of the other character i suppose know too well their own significance to think highly of that of any body else all must be their own way in one word because they are useful they will be more than useful i do assure you my dear were i man and a man who loved my quiet i would not have one of these managing wives on any consideration i would make it a matter of serious inquiry beforehand whether my mistresss qualifications if i heard she was notable were masculine or feminine ones if indeed i were an indolent supine mortal who might be in danger of perhaps choosing to marry for the qualifications of a steward but setting my mother out of the question because she is my mother have i not seen how lady hartley pranks up herself above all her sex because she knows how to manage affairs that do not belong to her sex to manage affairs that do no credit to her as a woman to understand practically i mean for the theory of them may not be amiss to be known indeed my dear i do not think a manwoman a pretty character at all and as i said were i a man i would sooner choose a dove though it were fit for nothing but as the play says to go tame about house and breed than a wife that is setting at work my insignificant self present perhaps every busy our my neverresting servants those of the stud not excepted and who with a besom in her hand as i may say would be continually filling my with apprehensions that she wanted to sweep me out of my own house as useless lumber were indeed the mistress of a family like the wonderful young lady i so much and so justly admire to know how to confine herself within her own respectable rounds of the needle the pen the housekeepers bills the dairy for her amusement to see the poor fed from superfluities that would otherwise be wasted and exert herself in all the reallyuseful branches of domestic management then would she move in her proper sphere then would she render herself amiably useful and respectably necessary then would she become the mistresswheel of the family whatever you think of your anna howe i would not have her be the masterwheel and every body would love her as every body did you before your insolent brother came back flushed with his unmerited acquirements and turned all things topsyturvy if you will be informed of the particulars of our contention after you have known in general that your unhappy affair was the subject why then i think i must tell you yet how shall ii feel my cheek glow with mingled shame and indignation know then my dear that i have been as i may say that i have been beaten indeed tis true my mother thought fit to slap my hands to get from me a sheet of a letter she caught me writing to you which i tore because she should not read it and burnt it before her face i know this will trouble you so spare yourself the pains to tell me it does mr hickman came in presently after i would not see him i am either too much a woman to be beat or too much a child to have an humble servant so i told my mother what can one oppose but sullens when it would be unpardonable so much as to think of lifting up a finger in the harlowe style she will be obeyed she says and even mr hickman shall be forbid the house if he contributes to the carrying on of a correspondence which she will not suffer to be continued poor man he stands a whimsical chance between us but he knows he is sure of my mother but not of me tis easy then for him to choose his party were it not his inclination to serve you as it surely is and this makes him a merit with me which otherwise he would not have had notwithstanding the good qualities which i have just now acknowledged in his favour for my dear let my faults in other respects be what they may i will pretend to say that i have in my own mind those qualities which i praised him for and if we are to come together i could for that reason better dispense with them in him so if a husband who has a bountifultempered wife is not a niggard nor seeks to restrain her but has an opinion of all she does that is enough for him as on the contrary if a bountifultempered husband has a frugal wife it is best for both for one to give and the other to give except they have prudence and are at so good an understanding with each other as to compare notes they may perhaps put it out of their power to be just good frugal doctrine my dear but this way of putting it is middling the matter between what i have learnt of my mothers overprudent and your enlarged notions but from doctrine to fact i shut myself up all that day and what little i did eat eat alone but at night she sent up kitty with a command upon my obedience to attend her at supper i went down but most gloriously in the sullens yes and no were great words with me to every thing she asked for a good while that behaviour she told me should not do for her beating should not do for me i said my bold resistance she told me had provoked her to slap my hand and she was sorry to have been so provoked but again insisted that i would either give up my correspondence absolutely or let her see all that passed in it i must not do either i told her it was unsuitable both to my inclination and to my honour at the instigation of base minds to give up a friend in distress she rung all the maternal changes upon the words duty obedience filial obligation and so forth i told her that a duty too rigorously and unreasonably exacted had been your ruin if you were ruined if i were of age to be married i hope she would think me capable of making or at least of keeping my own friendships such a one especially as this with a woman too and one whose friendship she herself till this distressful point of time had thought the most useful and edifying that i had ever contracted the greater the merit the worse the action the finer the talents the more dangerous the example there were other duties i said besides the filial one and i hoped i need not give up a suffering friend especially at the instigation of those by whom she suffered i told her that it was very hard to annex such a condition as that to my duty when i was persuaded that both duties might be performed without derogating from either that an unreasonable command she must excuse me i must say it though i were slapped again was a degree of tyranny and i could not have expected that at these years i should be allowed now will no choice of my own where a woman only was concerned and the devilish sex not in the question what turned most in favour of her argument was that i desired to be excused from letting her read all that passes between us she insisted much upon this and since she said you were in the hands of the most intriguing man in the world and a man who had made a jest of her favourite hickman as she had been told she knows not what consequences unthought of by your or me may flow from such a correspondence so you see my dear that i fare the worse on mr hickmans account my mother might see all that passes between us did i not know that it would cramp your spirit and restrain the freedom of your pen as it would also the freedom of mine and were she not moreover so firmly attached to the contrary side that inferences consequences strained deductions censures and constructions the most partial would for ever to be haled in to tease me and would perpetually subject us to the necessity of debating and canvassing besides i dont choose that she should know how much this artful wretch has outwitted as i may call it a person so much his superior in all the nobler qualities of the human mind the generosity of your heart and the greatness of your soul full well i know but do offer to dissuade me from this correspondence mr hickman immediately on the contention above offered his service and i accepted of it as you will see by my last he thinks though he has all honour for my mother that she is unkind to us both he was pleased to tell me with an air as i thought that he not only approved of our correspondence but admired the steadiness of my friendship and having no opinion of your man but a great one of me thinks that my advice or intelligence from time to time may be of use to you and on this presumption said that it would be a thousand pities that you should suffer for want of either mr hickman pleased me in the main of his speech and it is well the general tenor of it was agreeable otherwise i can tell him i should have reckoned with him for his word approve for it is a style i have not yet permitted him to talk to me in and you see my dear what these men are no sooner do they find that you have favoured them with the power of doing you an agreeable service but they take upon them to approve forsooth of your actions by which is implied a right to disapprove if they think fit i have told my mother how much you wish to be reconciled to your relations and how independent you are upon lovelace mark the end of the latter assertion she says and as to reconciliation she knows that nothing will do and will have it that nothing ought to do but your returning back without presuming to condition with them and this if you do she says will best show your independence on lovelace you see my dear what your duty is in my mothers opinion i suppose your next directed to mr hickman at his own house will be from london heaven preserve you in honour and safety is my prayer what you do for change of clothes i cannot imagine it is amazing to me what your relations can mean by distressing you as they seem resolved to do i see they will throw you into his arms whether you will or not i send this by robert for dispatchsake and can only repeat the hithertorejected offer of my best services adieu my dearest friend believe me ever your affectionate and faithful anna howe letter xli miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe tuesday april i should think myself utterly unworthy of your friendship did not my own concerns heavy as they are so engross me that i could not find leisure for a few lines to declare to my beloved friend my sincere disapprobation of her conduct in an instance where she is so generously faulty that the consciousness of that very generosity may hide from her the fault which i more than any other have reason to deplore as being the unhappy occasion of it you know you say that your account of the contentions between your mother and you will trouble me and so you bid me spare myself the pains to tell you that they do you did not use my dear to forbid me thus beforehand you were wont to say you loved me the better for my expostulations with you on that acknowledged warmth and quickness of your temper which your own good sense taught you to be apprehensive of what though i have so miserably fallen and am unhappy if ever i had any judgment worth regarding it is now as much worth as ever because i can give it as freely against myself as against any body else and shall i not when there seems to be an infection in my fault and that it leads you likewise to resolve to carry on a correspondence against prohibition expostulate with you upon it when whatever consequences flow from your disobedience they but widen my error which is as the evil root from which such sad branches spring the mind that can glory in being capable of so noble so firm so unshaken friendship as that of my dear miss howe a friendship which no casualty or distress can lessen but which increases with the misfortunes of its friend such a mind must be above taking amiss the wellmeant admonitions of that distinguished friend i will not therefore apologize for my freedom on this subject and the less need i when that freedom is the result of an affection in the very instance so absolutely disinterested that it tends to deprive myself of the only comfort left me your acknowledged sullens your tearing from your mothers hands the letter she thought she had a right to see and burning it as you own before her face your refusal to see the man who is so willing to obey you for the sake of your unhappy friend and this purely to vex your mother can you think my dear upon this brief recapitulation of hardly one half of the faulty particulars you give that these faults are excusable in one who so well knows her duty your mother had a good opinion of me once is not that a reason why she should be more regarded now when i have as she believes so deservedly forfeited it a prejudice in favour is as hard to be totally overcome as a prejudice in disfavour in what a strong light then must that error appear to her that should so totally turn her heart against me herself not a principal in the case there are other duties you say besides the filial duty but that my dear must be a duty prior to all other duties a duty anterior as i may say to you very birth and what duty ought not to give way to that when they come in competition you are persuaded that the duty to your friend and the filial duty may be performed without derogating from either your mother thinks otherwise what is the conclusion to be drawn from these premises when your mother sees how much i suffer in my reputation from the step i have taken from whom she and all the world expected better things how much reason has she to be watchful over you one evil draws on another after it and how knows she or any body where it may stop does not the person who will vindicate or seek to extenuate a faulty step in another in this light must your mother look upon the matter in question between her and you give an indication either of a culpable will or a weak judgment and may not she apprehend that the censorious will think that such a one might probably have equally failed under the same inducements and provocations to use your own words as applied to me in a former letter can there be a stronger instance in human lie than mine has so early furnished within a few months past not to mention the uncommon provocations to it which i have met with of the necessity of the continuance of a watchful parents care over a daughter let that daughter have obtained ever so great a reputation for her prudence is not the space from sixteen to twentyone that which requires this care more than at any time of a young womans life for in that period do we not generally attract the eyes of the other sex and become the subject of their addresses and not seldom of their attempts and is not that the period in which our conduct or misconduct gives us a reputation or disreputation that almost inseparably accompanies us throughout our whole future lives are we not likewise then most in danger from ourselves because of the distinction with which we are apt to behold particulars of that sex and when our dangers multiply both from within and without do not our parents know that their vigilance ought to be doubled and shall that necessary increase of care sit uneasy upon us because we are grown up to stature and womanhood will you tell me if so what is the precise stature and age at which a good child shall conclude herself absolved from the duty she owes to a parent and at which a parent after the example of the dams of the brute creation is to lay aside all care and tenderness for her offspring is it so hard for you my dear to be treated like a child and can you not think it is hard for a good parent to imagine herself under the unhappy necessity of so treating her womangrown daughter do you think if your mother had been you and you your mother and your daughter had struggled with you as you did with her that you would not have been as apt as your mother was to have slapped your daughters hands to have made her quit her hold and give up the prohibited letter your mother told you with great truth that you provoked her to this harshness and it was a great condescension in her and not taken notice of by you as it deserved to say that she was sorry for it at every age on this side matrimony for then we come under another sort of protection though that is far from abrogating the filial duty it will be found that the wings of our parents are our most necessary and most effectual safeguard from the vultures the hawks the kites and other villainous birds of prey that hover over us with a view to seize and destroy is the first time we are caught wandering out of the eye or care of our watchful and natural guardians and protectors hard as you may suppose it to be denied to continuance of a correspondence once so much approved even by the venerable denier yet if your mother think my fault to be of such a nature as that a correspondence with me will cast a shade upon your reputation all my own friends having given me up that hardship is to be submitted to and must it not make her the more strenuous to support her own opinion when she sees the first fruits of this tenaciousness on your side is to be gloriously in the sullens as you call it and in a disobedient opposition i know that you have a humourous meaning in that expression and that this turn in most cases gives a delightful poignancy both to your conversation and correspondence but indeed my dear this case will not bear humour will you give me leave to add to this tedious expostulation that i by no means approve of some of the things you write in relation to the manner in which your father and mother lived at times lived only at times i dare day though perhaps too often your mother is answerable to any body rather than to her child for whatever was wrong in her conduct if any thing was wrong towards mr howe a gentleman of whose memory i will only say that it ought to be revered by you but yet should you not examine yourself whether your displeasure at your mother had no part in your revived reverence for your father at the time you wrote no one is perfect and although your mother may not be right to remember disagreeableness against the departed yet should you not want to be reminded on whose account and on what occasion she remembered them you cannot judge nor ought you to attempt to judge of what might have passed between both to embitter and keep awake disagreeable remembrances in the survivor letter xlii miss clarissa harlowe in continuation but this subject must not be pursued another might with more pleasure though not with more approbation upon one of your lively excursions it is upon the high airs you give yourself upon the word approve how comes it about i wonder that a young lady so noted for predominating generosity should not be uniformly generous that your generosity should fail in an instance where policy prudence gratitude would not permit it to fail mr hickman as you confess had indeed a worthy mind if i had not long ago known that he would never have found an advocate in me for my anna howes favour to him often and often have i been concerned when i was your happy guest to see him after a conversation in which he had well supported his part in your absence sink at once into silence the moment you came into company i have told you of this before and i believe i hinted to you once that the superciliousness you put on only to him was capable of a construction which at the time would have very little gratified your pride to have had made since it would have been as much in his favour as if your disfavour mr hickman my dear is a modest man i never see a modest man but i am sure if he has not wanted opportunities that he has a treasure in his mind which requires nothing but the key of encouragement to unlock it to make him shine while a confident man who to be confident must think as meanly of his company as highly of himself enters with magisterial airs upon any subject and depending upon his assurance to bring himself off when found out talks of more than he is master of but a modest man o my dear shall not a modest woman distinguish and wish to consort with a modest man a man before whom and to whom she may open her lips secure of his good opinion of all she says and of his just and polite regard for her judgment and who must therefore inspire her with an agreeable selfconfidence what a lot have i drawn we are all indeed apt to turn teachers but surely i am better enabled to talk to write upon these subjects than ever i was but i will banish myself if possible from an address which when i began to write i was determined to confide wholly to your own particular my dearest dearest friend how ready are you to tell us what others should do and even what a mother should have done but indeed you once i remember advanced that as different attainments required different talents to master them so in the writing way a person might not be a bad critic upon the works of others although he might himself be unable to write with excellence but will you permit me to account for all this readiness of finding fault by placing it to human nature which being sensible of the defects of human nature that is to say of its own defects loves to be correcting but in exercising that talent chooses rather to turn its eye outward than inward in other words to employ itself rather in the outdoor search than in the indoor examination and here give me leave to add and yet it is with tender reluctance that although you say very pretty things of notable wives and although i join with you in opinion that husbands may have as many inconveniencies to encounter with as conveniencies to boast of from women of that character yet lady hartley perhaps would have had milder treatment from your pen had it not been dipped in gall with a mother in your eye as to the money you so generously and repeatedly offer dont be angry with me if i again say that i am very desirous that you should be able to aver without the least qualifying or reserve that nothing of that sort has passed between us i know your mothers strong way of putting the question she is intent upon having answered but yet i promise that i will be obliged to nobody but you when i have occasion letter xliii miss clarissa harlowe in continuation and now my dear a few words as to the prohibition laid upon you a subject that i have frequently touched upon but cursorily because i was afraid to trust myself with it knowing that my judgment if i did would condemn my practice you command me not to attempt to dissuade you from this correspondence and you tell me how kindly mr hickman approves of it and how obliging he is to me to permit it to be carried on under cover to him but this does not quite satisfy me i am a very bad casuist and the pleasure i take in writing to you who are the only one to whom i can disburden my mind may make me as i have hinted very partial to my own wishes else if it were not an artful evasion beneath an open and frank heart to wish to be complied with i would be glad methinks to be permitted still to write to you and only to have such occasional returns by mr hickmans pen as well as cover as might set me right when i am wrong confirm me when right and guide me where i doubt this would enable me to proceed in the difficult path before me with more assuredness for whatever i suffer from the censure of others if i can preserve your good opinion i shall not be altogether unhappy let what will befall me and indeed my dear i know not how to forbear writing i have now no other employment or diversion and i must write on although i were not to send it to any body you have often heard he own the advantages i have found from writing down every thing of moment that befalls me and of all i think and of all i do that may be of future use to me for besides that this helps to form one to a style and opens and expands the ductile mind every one will find that many a good thought evaporates in thinking many a good resolution goes off driven out of memory perhaps by some other not so good but when i set down what i will do or what i have done on this or that occasion the resolution or action is before me either to be adhered to withdrawn or amended and i have entered into compact with myself as i may say having given it under my own hand to improve rather than to go backward as i live longer i would willingly therefore write to you if i might the rather as it would be the more inspiriting to have some end in view in what i write some friend to please besides merely seeking to gratify my passion for scribbling but why if your mother will permit our correspondence on communicating to her all that passes in it and if she would condescend to one only condition may it not be complied with would she not do you think my dear be prevailed upon to have the communication made to her in confidence if there were any prospect of a reconciliation with my friends i should not have so much regard for my pride as to be afraid of any bodys knowing how much i have been outwitted as you call it i would in that case when i had left mr lovelace acquaint your mother and all my own friends with the whole of my story it would behove me so to do for my own reputation and for their satisfaction but if i have no such prospect what will the communication of my reluctance to go away with mr lovelace and of his arts to frighten me away avail me your mother has hinted that my friends would insist upon my returning home to them as a proof of the truth of my plea to be disposed of without condition at their pleasure if i scrupled this my brother would rather triumph over me than keep my secret mr lovelace whose pride already so ill brooks my regrets for meeting him when he thinks if i had not i must have been mr solmess wife would perhaps treat me with indignity and thus deprived of all refuge and protection i should become the scoff of men of intrigue a disgrace to my sex while that avowed loved however indiscreetly shown which is followed by marriage will find more excuses made for it than generally it ought to find but if your mother will receive the communication in confidence pray shew her all that i have written or shall write if my past conduct in that case shall not be found to deserve heavy blame i shall then perhaps have the benefit of her advice as well as your and if after a reestablishment in her favour i shall wilfully deserve blame for the time to come i will be content to be denied yours as well as hers for ever as to cramping my spirit as you call it were i to sit down to write what i know your mother must see that my dear is already cramped and do not think so unhandsomely of your mother as to fear that she would make partial constructions against me neither you nor i can doubt but that had she been left unprepossessedly to herself she would have shown favour to me and so i dare say would my uncle antony nay my dear i can extend my charity still farther for i am sometimes of opinion that were my brother and sister absolutely certain that they had so far ruined me in the opinion of both my uncles as that they need not be apprehensive of my clashing with their interests they would not oppose a pardon although they might not wish a reconciliation especially if i would make a few sacrifices to them which i assure you i should be inclined to make were i wholly free and independent on this man you know i never valued myself upon worldly acquisitions but as they enlarged my power to do things i loved to do and if i were denied the power i must as i now do curb my inclination do not however thing me guilty of an affectation in what i have said of my brother and sister severe enough i am sure it is in the most favourable sense and an indifferent person will be of opinion that they are much better warranted than ever for the sake of the family honour to seek to ruin me in the favour of all my friends but to the former topic try my dear if your mother will upon the condition above given permit our correspondence on seeing all we write but if she will not what a selfishness would there be in my love to you were i to wish you to forego your duty for my sake and now one word as to the freedom i have treated you with in this tedious expostulary address i presume upon your forgiveness of it because few friendships are founded on such a basis as ours which is freely to give reproof and thankfully to receive it as occasions arise that so either may have opportunity to clear up mistakes to acknowledge and amend errors as well in behaviour as in words and deeds and to rectify and confirm each other in the judgment each shall form upon persons things and circumstances and all this upon the following consideration that it is much more eligible as well as honourable to be corrected with the gentleness that may be expected from an undoubted friend than by continuing either blind or wilful to expose ourselves to the censures of an envious and perhaps malignant world but it is as needless i dare say to remind you of this as it is to repeat my request so often repeated that you will not in your turn spare the follies and the faults of your ever affectionate cl harlowe subjoined to the above i said that i would avoid writing any thing of my own particular affairs in the above address if i could i will write one letter more to inform you how i stand with this man but my dear you must permit that one and your answer to it for i want your advice upon the contents of mine and the copy of one i have written to my aunt to be the last that shall pass between us while the prohibition continues i fear i very much fear that my unhappy situation will draw me in to being guilty of evasion of little affectations and of curvings from the plain simple truth which i was wont to delight in and prefer to every other consideration but allow me to say and this for your sake and in order to lessen your mothers fears of any ill consequences that she might apprehend from our correspondence that if i am at any time guilty of a failure in these respects i will not go on in it but endeavour to recover my lost ground that i may not bring error into habit i have deferred going to town at mrs sorlingss earnest request but have fixed my removal to monday as i shall acquaint you in my next i have already made a progress in that next but having an unexpected opportunity will send this by itself letter xliv miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe friday morning april my mother will not comply with your condition my dear i hinted it to her as from myself but the harlowes excuse me have got her entirely in with them it is a scheme of mine she told me formed to draw her into your party against your parents which for your own sake she is very careful about dont be so much concerned about my mother and me once more i beg of you we shall do well enough together now a falling out now a falling in it used to be so when you were not in the question yet do i give you my sincere thanks for every line of your reprehensive letters which i intend to read as often as i find my temper rises i will freely own however that i winced a little at first reading them but i see that on every reperusal i shall love and honour you still more if possible than before yet i think i have one advantage over you and which i will hold through this letter and through all my future letters that is that i will treat you as freely as you treat me and yet will never think an apology necessary to you for my freedom but that you so think with respect to me is the effect of your gentleness of temper with a little sketch of implied reflection on the warmth of mine gentleness in a woman you hold to be no fault nor do i a little due or provoked warmth but what is this but praising on both sides what what neither of us can help nor perhaps wish to help you can no more go out of your road than i can go out of mine it would be a pain to either to do so what then is it in eithers approving of her own natural bias but making a virtue of necessity but one observation i will add that were your character and my character to be truly drawn mine would be allowed to be the most natural shades and lights are equally necessary in a fine picture yours would be surrounded with such a flood of brightness with such a glory that it would indeed dazzle but leave one heartless to imitate it o may you not suffer from a base world for your gentleness while my temper by its warmth keeping all imposition at a distance though less amiable in general affords me not reason as i have mentioned heretofore to wish to make an exchange with you i should indeed be inexcusable to open my lips by way of contradiction to my mother had i such a fine spirit as yours to deal with truth is truth my dear why should narrowness run away with the praises due to a noble expansion of heart if every body would speak out as i do that is to say give praise where only praise is due dispraise where due likewise shame if not principle would mend the world nay shame would introduce principle in a generation or two very true my dear do you apply i dare not for i fear you almost as much as i love you i will give you an instance nevertheless which will anew demonstrate that none but very generous and nobleminded people ought to be implicitly obeyed you know what i said above that truth is truth inconveniencies will sometimes arise from having to do with persons of modest and scrupulousness mr hickman you say is a modest man he put your corrective packet into my hand with a very fine bow and a self satisfied air well consider what you say of this honest man byandby my dear his strut was no gone off when in came my mother as i was reading it when some folks find their anger has made them considerable they will be always angry or seeking occasions for anger why now mr hickman why now nancy as i was huddling in the packet between my gown and my stays at her entrance you have a letter brought you this instant while the modest man with his pausing brayings madda maddam looked as if he knew not whether to fight it out or to stand his ground and see fair play it would have been poor to tell a lie for it she flung away i went out at the opposite door to read the contents leaving mr hickman to exercise his white teeth upon his thumbnails when i had read your letters i went to find out my mother i told her the generous contents and that you desired that the prohibition might be adhered to i proposed your condition as for myself and was rejected as above she supposed she was finely painted between two young creatures who had more wit than prudence and instead of being prevailed upon by the generosity of your sentiments made use of your opinion only to confirm her own and renewed her prohibitions charging me to return no other answer but that she did renew them adding that they should stand till your relations were reconciled to you hinting as if she had engaged for as much and expected my compliance i thought of your reprehensions and was meek though not pleased and let me tell you my dear that as long as i can satisfy my own mind that good is intended and that it is hardly possible that evil should ensue from our correspondence as long as i know that this prohibition proceeds originally from the same spiteful minds which have been the occasion of all these mischiefs as long as i know that it is not your fault if your relations are not reconciled to you and that upon conditions which no reasonable people would refuse you must give me leave with all deference to your judgment and to your excellent lessons which would reach almost every case of this kind but the present to insist upon your writing to me and that minutely as if this prohibition had not been laid it is not from humour from perverseness that i insist upon this i cannot express how much my heart is in your concerns and you must in short allow me to think that if i can do you service by writing i shall be better justified in continuing to write than my mother is in her prohibition but yet to satisfy you all i can i will as seldom return answers while the interdict lasts as may be consistent with my notions of friendship and with the service i owe you and can do you as to your expedient of writing by hickman and now my dear your modest man comes in and as you love modesty in that sex i will do my endeavour by holding him at a proper distance to keep him in your favour i know what you mean by it my sweet friend it is to make that man significant with me as to the correspondence that shall go on i do assure you be as scrupulous as you please so that that will not suffer if i do not close with your proposal as to him i must tell you that i think it will be honour enough for him to have his name made use of so frequently betwixt us this of itself is placing a confidence in him that will make him walk bolt upright and display his white hand and his fine diamond ring and most mightily lay down his services and his pride to oblige and his diligence and his fidelity and his contrivances to keep our secret and his excuses and his evasions to my mother when challenged by her with fifty anas beside and will it not moreover give him pretence and excuse oftener than ever to padnag it hither to good mrs howes fair daughter but to admit him into my company teteatete and into my closet as often as i would wish to write to you i only dictate to his pen my mother all the time supposing that i was going to be heartily in love with him to make him master of my sentiments and of my heart as i may say when i write to you indeed my dear i wont nor were i married to the best he in england would i honour him with the communication of my correspondences no my dear it is sufficient surely for him to parade in the character of our letterconveyor and to be honoured in a cover and never fear but modest as you think him he will make enough of that you are always blaming me for want of generosity to this man and for abuse of power but i profess my dear i cannot tell how to help it do dear now let me spread my plumes a little and nowandthen make myself feared this is my time you know since it would be no more to my credit than to his to give myself those airs when i am married he has a joy when i am pleased with him that he would not know but for the pain my displeasure gives him men no more than women know how to make a moderate use of power is not that seen every day from the prince to the peasant if i do not make hickman quake nowandthen he will endeavour to make me fear all the animals in the creation are more or less in a state of hostility with each other the wolf that runs away from a lion will devour a lamb the next moment i remember that i was once so enraged at a game chicken that was continually pecking at another a poor humble one as i thought him that i had the offender caught and without more ado in a pet of humanity wrung his neck off what followed this execution why that other grew insolent as soon as his insulter was gone and was continually pecking at one or two under him peck and be hanged said i i might as well have preserved the first for i see it is the nature of the beast excuse my flippancies i wish i were with you i would make you smile in the midst of your gravest airs as i used to do o that you had accepted of my offer to attend you but nothing that i offer will you accepttake care you will make me very angry with you and when i am you know i value nobody for dearly as i love you i must be and cannot always help it your saucy anna howe letter xlv miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe friday april mr lovelace communicated to me this morning early from his intelligencer the news of my brothers scheme i like him the better for making very light of it and for his treating it with contempt and indeed had i not had the hint of it from you i should have suspected it to be some contrivance of his in order to hasten me to town where he has long wished to be himself he read me the passage in that lemans letter which is pretty much to the effect of what you wrote to me from miss lloyd with this addition that one singleton a master of a scots vessel is the man who is to be the principal in this act of violence i have seen him he had been twice entertained at harloweplace as my brothers friend he has the air of a very bold and fearless man and i fancy it must be his project as my brother i suppose talks to every body of the rash step i have taken for he did not spare me before he had this seeming reason to censure me this singleton lives at leith so perhaps i am to be carried to my brothers house not far from that port putting these passages together i am not a little apprehensive that the design lightly as mr lovelace from his fearless temper treats it may be attempted to be carried into execution and of the consequences that may attend it if it be i asked mr lovelace seeing him so frank and cool what he would advise me to do shall i ask you madam what are your own thoughts why i return the question said he is because you have been so very earnest that i should leave you as soon as you are in london that i know not what to propose without offending you my opinion is said i that i should studiously conceal myself from the knowledge of every body but miss howe and that you should leave me out of hand since they will certainly conclude that where one is the other is not far off and it is easier to trace you than me you would not surely wish said he to fall into your brothers hands by such a violent measure as this i propose not to throw myself officiously in their way but should they have reason to think i avoided them would not that whet their diligence to find you and their courage to attempt to carry you off and subject me to insults that no man of spirit can bear lord bless me said i to what had this one fatal step that i have been betrayed into dearest madam let me beseech you to forbear this harsh language when you see by this new scheme how determined they were upon carrying their old ones had you not been betrayed as you call it have i offered to defy the laws of society as this brother of yours must do if any thing be intended by this project i hope you will be pleased to observe that there are as violent and as wicked enterprisers as myself but this is so very wild a project that i think there can be no room for apprehensions from it i know your brother well when at college he had always a romantic turn but never had a head for any thing but to puzzle and confound himself a halfinvention and a whole conceit but not master of talents to do himself good or others harm but as those others gave him the power by their own folly this is very volubly run off sir but violent spirits are but too much alike at least in their methods of resenting you will not presume to make yourself a less innocent man surely who had determined to brave my whole family in person if my folly had not saved you the rashness and them the insult dear madam still must it be folly rashness it is as impossible for you to think tolerably of any body out of your own family as it is for any one in your family to deserve your love forgive me dearest creature if i did not love you as never man loved a woman i might appear more indifferent to preferences so undeservedly made but let me ask you madam what have you borne from me what cause have i given you to treat me with so much severity and so little confidence and what have you not borne from them malice and illwill sitting in judgment upon my character may not give sentence in my favour but what of your own knowledge have you against me spirited questions were they not my dear and they were asked with as spirited an air i was startled but i was resolved not to desert myself is this a time mr lovelace is this a proper occasion taken to give yourself these high airs to me a young creature destitute of protection it is a surprising question you ask me had i aught against you of my own knowledge i can tell you sir and away i would have flung he snatched my hand and besought me not to leave him in displeasure he pleaded his passion for me and my severity to him and partiality for those from whom i had suffered so much and whose intended violence he said was now the subject of our deliberation i was forced to hear him you condescended dearest creature said he to ask my advice it was very easy give me leave to say to advise you what to do i hope i may on this new occasion speak without offence notwithstanding your former injunctions you see that there can be no hope of reconciliation with your relations can you madam consent to honour with your hand a wretch whom you have never yet obliged with one voluntary favour what a recriminating what a reproachful way my dear was this of putting a question of this nature i expected not from him at the time and just as i was very angry with him either the question or the manner i am ashamed to recollect the confusion i was thrown into all your advice in my head at the moment yet his words so prohibitory he confidently seemed to enjoy my confusion indeed my dear he knows not what respectful love is and gazed upon me as if he would have looked me through he was still more declarative afterwards as i shall mention byandby but it was half extorted from him my heart struggled violently between resentment and shame to be thus teased by one who seemed to have all his passions at command at a time when i had very little over mine till at last i burst into tears and was going from him in high disgust when throwing his arms about me with an air however the most tenderly respectful he gave a stupid turn to the subject it was far from his heart he said to take so much advantage of the streight which the discovery of my brothers foolish project had brought me into as to renew without my permission a proposal which i had hitherto discountenanced and which for that reason and then he came with his halfsentences apologizing for what he had not so much as halfproposed surely he had not the insolence to intend to tease me to see if i could be brought to speak what became me not to speak but whether he had or not it did tease me insomuch that my very heart was fretted and i broke out at last into fresh tears and a declaration that i was very unhappy and just then recollecting how like a tame fool i stood with his arms about me i flung from him with indignation but he seized my hand as i was going out of the room and upon his knees besought my stay for one moment and then in words the most clear and explicit tendered himself to my acceptance as the most effectual means to disappoint my brothers scheme and set all right but what could i say to this extorted from him as it seemed to me rather as the effect of his compassion than his love what could i say i paused i looked silly i am sure i looked very silly he suffered me to pause and look silly waiting for me to say something and at last ashamed of my confusion and aiming to make an excuse for it i told him that i desired he would avoid such measures as might add to the uneasiness which it must be visible to him i had when he reflected upon the irreconcilableness of my friends and upon what might follow from this unaccountable project of my brother he promised to be governed by me in every thing and again the wretch instead of pressing his former question asked me if i forgave him for the humble suit he had made to me what had i to do but to try for a palliation of my confusion since it served me not i told him i had hopes it would not be long before mr morden arrived and doubted not that that gentleman would be the readier to engage in my favour when he found that i made no other use of his mr lovelaces assistance than to free myself from the addresses of a man so disagreeable to me as mr solmes i must therefore wish that every thing might remain as it was till i could hear from my cousin this although teased by him as i was was not you see my dear a denial but he must throw himself into a heat rather than try to persuade which any other man in his situation i should think would have done and this warmth obliged me to adhere to my seeming negative this was what he said with a vehemence that must harden any womans mind who had a spirit above being frighted into passiveness good god and will you madam still resolve to show me that i am to hope for no share in your favour while any the remotest prospect remains that you will be received by my bitterest enemies at the price of my utter rejection this was what i returned with warmth and with a salving art too you should have seen mr lovelace how much my brothers violence can affect me but you will be mistaken if you let loose yours upon me with a thought of terrifying me into measures the contrary of which you have acquiesced with he only besought me to suffer his future actions to speak for him and if i saw him worthy of any favour that i would not let him be the only person within my knowledge who was not entitled to my consideration you refer to a future time mr lovelace so do i for the future proof of a merit you seem to think for the past time wanting and justly you think so and i was again going from him one word more he begged me to hear he was determined studiously to avoid all mischief and every step that might lead to mischief let my brothers proceedings short of a violence upon my person be what they would but if any attempt that should extend to that were to be made would i have had him to be a quiet spectator of my being seized or carried back or on board by this singleton or in case of extremity was he not permitted to stand up in my defence stand up in my defence mr lovelace i should be very miserable were there to be a call for that but do you think i might not be safe and private in london by your friends description of the widows house i should think i might be safe there the widows house he replied as described by his friend being a back house within a front one and looking to a garden rather than to a street had the appearance of privacy but if when there it was not approved it would be easy to find another more to my liking though as to his part the method he would advise should be to write to my uncle harlowe as one of my trustees and wait the issue of it here at mrs sorlingss fearlessly directing it to be answered hither to be afraid of little spirits was but to encourage insults he said the substance of the letter should be to demand as a right what they would refuse if requested as a courtesy to acknowledge that i had put myself too well he said did their treatment justify me into the protection of the ladies of his family by whose orders and lord ms he himself would appear to act but that upon my own terms which were such that i was under no obligation to those ladies for the favour it being no more than they would have granted to any one of my sex equally distressed if i approved not of his method happy should he think himself he said if i would honour him with the opportunity of making such a claim in his own name but this was a point with his buts again in the same breath that he durst but just touch upon he hoped however that i would think their violence a sufficient inducement for me to take such a wishedfor resolution inwardly vexed i told him that he himself had proposed to leave me when i was in town that i expected he would and that when i was known to be absolutely independent i should consider what to write and what to do but that while he was with me i neither would nor could he would be very sincere with me he said this project of my brothers had changed the face of things he must before he left me see whether i should or should not approve of the london widow and her family if i chose to go thither they might be people whom my brother might buy but if he saw they were persons of integrity he then might go for a day or two or so but he must needs say he could not leave me longer at a time do you propose sir said i to take up your lodgings in the house where i shall lodge he did not he said as he knew the use i intended to make of his absence and my punctilio and yet the house where he had lodgings was newfronting and not in condition to receive him but he could go to his friend belfords in soho or perhaps he might reach to the same gentlemans house at edgware over night and return on the mornings till he had reason to think this wild project of my brothers laid aside but to no greater distance till then should he care to venture the result of all was to set out on monday next for town i hope it will be in a happy hour cl harlowe letter xlvi mr lovelace to john belford esq friday april as it was not probable that the lady could give so particular an account of her own confusion in the affecting scene she mentions on mr lovelaces offering himself to her acceptance the following extracts are made from his letter of the above date and now belford what wilt thou say if like the fly buzzing about the bright taper i had like to have singed the silken wings of my liberty never was man in greater danger of being caught in his own snares all my views anticipated all my schemes untried the admirable creature no brought to town nor one effort made to know if she be really angel or woman i offered myself to her acceptance with a suddenness tis true that gave her no time to wrap herself in reserves and in terms less tender than fervent tending to upbraid her for her past indifference and to remind her of her injunctions for it was the fear of her brother not her love of me that had inclined her to dispense with those injunctions i never beheld so sweet a confusion what a glory to the pencil could it do justice to it and to the mingled impatience which visibly informed every feature of the most meaning and most beautiful face in the world she hemmed twice or thrice her look now so charmingly silly then so sweetly significant till at last the lovely teaser teased by my hesitating expectation of her answer out of all power of articulate speech burst into tears and was turning from me with precipitation when presuming to fold her in my happy arms o think not best beloved of my heart said i think not that this motion which you may believe to be so contrary to your former injunctions proceeds from a design to avail myself of the cruelty of your relations if i have disobliged you by it and you know with what respectful tenderness i have presumed to hint it it shall be my utmost care for the future there i stopped then she spoke but with vexation i am i am very unhappy tears trickling down her crimson cheeks and her sweet face as my arms still encircled the finest waist in the world sinking upon my shoulder the dear creature so absent that she knew not the honour she permitted me but why but why unhappy my dearest life said i all the gratitude that ever overflowed the heart of the most obliged of men justice to myself there stopped my mouth for what gratitude did i owe her for obligations so involuntary then recovering herself and her usual reserves and struggling to free herself from my clasping arms how now sir said she with a cheek more indignantly glowing and eyes of fiercer lustre i gave way to her angry struggle but absolutely overcome by so charming a display of innocent confusion i caught hold of her hand as she was flying from me and kneeling at her fee o my angel said i quite destitute of reserve and hardly knowing the tenor of my own speech and had a parson been there i had certainly been a gone man receive the vows of your faithful lovelace make him yours and only yours for ever this will answer every end who will dare to form plots and stratagems against my wife that you are not so is the ground of all their foolish attempts and of their insolent hopes in solmess favour o be mine i beseech you thus on my knee i beseech you to be mine we shall then have all the world with us and every body will applaud an event that every body expects was the devil in me i no more intended all this ecstatic nonsense than i thought the same moment of flying in the air all power is with this charming creature it is i not she at this rate that must fail in the arduous trial didst thou ever before hear of a man uttering solemn things by an involuntary impulse in defiance of premeditation and of all his proud schemes but this sweet creature is able to make a man forego every purpose of his heart that is not favourable to her and i verily think i should be inclined to spare her all further trial and yet what trial has she had were it not for the contention that her vigilance has set on foot which shall overcome the other thou knowest my generosity to my uncontending rosebud and sometimes do i qualify my ardent aspirations after even this very fine creature by this reflection that the most charming woman on earth were she an empress can excel the meanest in the customary visibles only such is the equality of the dispensation to the prince and the peasant in this prime gift woman well but what was the result of this involuntary impulse on my part wouldst thou not think i was taken at my offer an offer so solemnly made and on one knee too no such thing the pretty trifler let me off as easily as i could have wished her brothers project and to find that there were no hopes of a reconciliation for her and the apprehension she had of the mischiefs that might ensue these not my offer nor love of me were the causes to which she ascribed all her sweet confusion an ascription that is high treason against my sovereign pride to make marriage with me but a secondplace refuge and as good as to tell me that her confusion was owing to her concern that there were no hopes that my enemies would accept of her intended offer to renounce a man who had ventured his life for her and was still ready to run the same risque in her behalf i reurged her to make me happy but i was to be postponed to her cousin mordens arrival on him are now placed all her hopes i raved but to no purpose another letter was to be sent or had been sent to her aunt hervey to which she hoped an answer yet sometimes i think that fainter and fainter would have been her procrastinations had i been a man of courage but so fearful was i of offending a confounded thing the man to be so bashful the woman to want so much courting how shall two such come together no kind mediatress in the way but i must be contented tis seldom however that a love so ardent as mine meets with a spirit so resigned in the same person but true love i am now convinced only wishes nor has it any active will but that of the adored object but o the charming creature again of herself to mention london had singletons plot been of my own contriving a more happy expedient could not have been thought of to induce her to resume her purpose of going thither nor can i divine what could be her reason for postponing it i enclose the letter from joseph leman which i mentioned to thee in mine of monday last with my answer to it i cannot resist the vanity that urges me to the communication otherwise it were better perhaps that i suffer thee to imagine that this ladys stars fight against her and dispense the opportunities in my favour which are only the consequences of my own invention letter xlvii to robert lovelace esq his honner sat april may it please your honner this is to let you honner kno as how i have been emploied in a bisness i would have

joseph leman april and letter xlviii mr lovelace to joseph leman monday april honest joseph you have a worse opinion of your invention than you ought to have i must praise it again of a plain mans head i have not known many better than yours how often have your forecast and discretion answered my wishes in cases which i could not foresee not knowing how my general directions would succeed or what might happen in the execution of them you are too doubtful of your own abilities honest joseph thats your fault but it being a fault that is owing to natural modesty you ought rather to be pitied for it than blamed the affair of miss betterton was a youthful frolic i love dearly to exercise my invention i do assure you joseph that i have ever had more pleasure in my contrivances than in the end of them i am no sensual man but a man of spirit one woman is like another you understand me joseph in coursing all the sport is made by the winding hare a barndoor chick is better eating now you take me joseph miss betterton was but a tradesmans daughter the family indeed was grown rich and aimed at a new line of gentry and were unreasonable enough to expect a man of my family would marry her i was honest i gave the young lady no hope of that for she put it to me she resented kept up and was kept up a little innocent contrivance was necessary to get her out but no rape in the case i assure you joseph she loved me i loved her indeed when i got her to the inn i asked her no question it is cruel to ask a modest woman for her consent it is creating difficulties to both had not her friends been officious i had been constant and faithful to her to this day as far as i know for then i had not known my angel i went not abroad upon her account she loved me too well to have appeared against me she refused to sign a paper they had drawn up for her to found a prosecution upon and the brutal creatures would not permit the midwifes assistance till her life was in danger and i believe to this her death was owing i went into mourning for her though abroad at the time a distinction i have ever paid to those worthy creatures who dies in childbed by me i was ever nice in my loves these were the rules i laid down to myself on my entrance into active life to set the mother above want if her friends were cruel and if i could not get her a husband worthy of her to shun common women a piece of justice i owed to innocent ladies as well as to myself to marry off a former mistress if possible before i took to a new one to maintain a lady handsomely in her lyingin to provide for the littleone if it lived according to the degree of its mother to go into mourning for the mother if she died and the promise of this was a great comfort to the pretty dears as they grew near their times all my errors all my expenses have been with and upon women so i could acquit my conscience acting thus honourably by them as well as my discretion as to point of fortune all men love women and find me a man of more honour in these points if you can joseph no wonder the sex love me as they do but now i am strictly virtuous i am reformed so i have been for a long time resolving to marry as soon as i can prevail upon the most admirable of women to have me i think of nobody else it is impossible i should i have spared very pretty girls for her sake very true joseph so set your honest heart at rest you see the pains i take to satisfy your qualms but as to miss betterton no rape in the case i repeat rapes are unnatural things and more are than are imagined joseph i should be loth to be put to such a streight i never was miss betterton was taken from me against her own will in that case her friends not i committed the rape i have contrived to see the boy twice unknown to the aunt who takes care of him loves him and would not now part with him on any consideration the boy is a fine boy i thank god no father need be ashamed of him he will be well provided for if not i would take care of him he will have his mothers fortune they curse the father ungrateful wretches but bless the boy upon the whole there is nothing vile in this matter on my side a great deal on the bettertons wherefore joseph be not thou in pain either for my head or for thy own neck nor for the blue boar nor for the pretty sow i love your jesting jesting better becomes a poor man than qualms i love to have you jest all we say all we do all we wish for is a jest he that makes life itself not so is a sad fellow and has the worst of it i doubt not joseph but you have had your joys as you say as well as your betters may you have more and more honest joseph he that grudges a poor man joy ought to have none himself jest on therefore jesting i repeat better becomes thee than qualms i had no need to tell you of miss betterton did i not furnish you with stories enough without hers against myself to augment your credit with your cunning masters besides i was loth to mention miss betterton her friends being all living and in credit i loved her too for she was taken from me by her cruel friends while our joys were young but enough of dear miss betterton dear i say for death endears rest to her worthy soul there joseph off went a deep sigh to the memory of miss betterton as to the journey of little titus i now recollect the fellow by his name let that take its course a lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago no process begun in her lifetime refusing herself to give evidence against me while she lived pretty circumstances to found an indictment for a rape upon as to your young lady the everadmirable miss clarissa harlowe i always courted her for a wife others rather expected marriage from the vanity of their own hearts than from my promises for i was always careful of what i promised you know joseph that i have gone beyond my promises to you i do to every body and why because it is the best way of showing that i have no grudging or narrow spirit a promise is an obligation a just man will keep his promise a generous man will go beyond it this is my rule if you doubt my honour to your young lady it is more than she does she would not stay with me an hour if she did mine is the steadiest heart in the world hast thou not reason to think it so why this squeamishness then honest joseph but it is because thou art honest so i forgive thee whoever loves my divine clarissa loves me let james harlowe call me what names he will for his sisters sake i will bear them do not be concerned for me her favour will make me rich amends his own vilely malicious heart will make his blood boil over at any time and when it does thinkest thou that i will let it touch thine ah joseph joseph what a foolish teaser is thy conscience such a conscience as gives a plain man trouble when he intends to do for the best is weakness not conscience but say what thou wilt write all thou knowest or hearest of to me ill have patience with every body why should i not when it is as much the desire of my heart as it is of thine to prevent mischief so now joseph having taken all this pains to satisfy thy conscience and answer all thy doubts and to banish all thy fears let me come to a new point your endeavours and mine which were designed by roundabout ways to reconcile all even against the wills of the most obstinate have not we see answered the end we hoped they would answer but on the contrary have widened the differences between our families but this has not been either your fault or mine it is owing to the black pitchlike blood of your venomoushearted young master boiling over as he owns that our honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated yet we must proceed in the same course we shall tire them out in time and they will propose terms and when they do they shall find out how reasonable mine shall be little as they deserve from me persevere therefore joseph honest joseph persevere and unlikely as you may imagine the means our desires will at last be obtained we have nothing for it now but to go through with our work in the way we have begun for since as i told you in my last my beloved mistrusts you she will blow you up if she be not mine if she be i can and will protect you and as if there will be any fault in her opinion it will be rather mine than yours she must forgive you and keep her husbands secrets for the sake of his reputation else she will be guilty of a great failure in her duty so now you have set your hand to the plough joseph there is no looking back and what is the consequence of all this one labour more and that will be all that will fall to your lot at least of consequence my beloved is resolved not to think of marriage till she has tried to move her friends to a reconciliation with her you know they are determined not to be reconciled she has it in her head i doubt not to make me submit to the people i hate and if i did they would rather insult me than receive my condescension as they ought she even owns that she will renounce me if they insist upon it provided they will give up solmes so to all appearance i am still as far as ever from the happiness of calling her mine indeed i am more likely than ever to lose her if i cannot contrive some way to avail myself of the present critical situation and then joseph all i have been studying and all you have been doing will signify nothing at the place where we are we cannot long be private the lodgings are inconvenient for us while both together and while she refuses to marry she wants to get me at a distance from her there are extraordinary convenient lodgings in my eye in london where we could be private and all mischief avoided when there if i get her thither she will insist that i leave her miss howe is for ever putting her upon contrivances that you know is the reason i have been obliged by your means to play the family off at harloweplace upon mrs howe and mrs howe upon her daughter ah joseph little need for your fears for my angel i only am in danger but were i the freeliver i am reported to be all this could i get over with a wet finger as the saying is but by the help of one of your hints i have thought of an expedient which will do ever thing and raise your reputation though already so high higher still this singleton i hear is a fellow who loves enterprising the view he has to get james harlowe to be his principal owner in a large vessel which he wants to be put into the command of may be the subject of their present close conversation but since he is taught to have so good an opinion of you joseph cannot you still pretending an abhorrence of me and of my contrivances propose to singleton to propose to james harlowe who so much thirsts for revenge upon me to assist him with his whole ships crew upon occasion to carry off his sister to leith where both have houses or elsewhere you may tell them that if this can be effected it will make me raving mad and bring your young lady into all their measures you can inform them as from my servant of the distance she keeps me at in hopes of procuring her fathers forgiveness by cruelly giving me up if insisted upon you can tell them that as the only secret my servant has kept from you is the place we are in you make no doubt that a twoguinea bribe will bring that out and also an information when i shall be at a distance from her that the enterprise may be conducted with safety you may tell them still as from my servant that we are about to remove from inconvenient lodgings to others more convenient which is true and that i must be often absent from her if they listen to your proposal you will promote your interest with betty by telling it to her as a secret betty will tell arabella of it arabella will be overjoyed at any thing that will help forward her revenge upon me and will reveal it if her brother do not to her uncle antony he probably will whisper it to mrs howe she can keep nothing from her daughter though they are always jangling her daughter will acquaint my beloved with it and if it will not or if it will come to my ears from some of those you can write it to me as in confidence by way of preventing msicheif which is the study of us both i can then show it to my beloved then will she be for placing a greater confidence in me that will convince me of her love which i am now sometimes ready to doubt she will be for hastening to the safer lodgings i shall have a pretence to stay about her person as a guard she will be convinced that there is no expectation to be had of a reconciliation you can give james harlowe and singleton continual false scents as i shall direct you so that no mischief can possibly happen and what will be the happy happy thrice happy consequence the lady will be mine in an honourable way we shall all be friends in good time the two guineas will be an agreeable addition to the many gratuities i have helped you to by the like contrivances from this stingy family your reputation both for head and heart as i hinted before will be heightened the blue boar also will be yours nor shall you have the least difficulty about raising money to buy the stock if it be worth your while to have it betty will likewise then be yours you have both saved money it seems the whole harlowe family whom you have so faithfully served tis serving them surely to prevent the mischief which their violent son would have brought upon them will throw you in somewhat towards housekeeping i will still add to your store so nothing but happiness before you crow joseph crow a dunghill of thy own in view servants to snub at thy pleasure a wife to quarrel with or to love as thy humour leads thee landlord and landlady at every word to be paid instead of paying for thy eating and drinking but not thus happy only in thyself happy in promoting peace and reconciliation between two good families in the long run without hurting any christian soul o joseph honest joseph what envy wilt thou raise and who would be squeamish with such prospects before him this one labour i repeat crowns the work if you can get but such a design entertained by them whether they prosecute it or not it will be equally to the purpose of your loving friend r lovelace letter xlix miss clarissa harlowe to mrs hervey enclosed in her last to miss howe thursday april honoured madam having not had the favour of an answer to a letter i took the liberty to write to you on the th i am in some hopes that it may have miscarried for i had much rather it should than to have the mortification to think that my aunt hervey deemed me unworthy of the honour of her notice in this hope having kept a copy of it and not become able to express myself in terms better suited to the unhappy circumstances of things i transcribe and enclose what i then wrote and i humbly beseech you to favour the contents of it with your interest the contents of the letter referred to are given in letter xxiv of this volume hitherto it is in my power to perform what i undertake for in this letter and it would be very grievous to me to be precipitated upon measures which may render the desirable reconciliation more difficult if madam i were permitted to write to you with the hopes of being answered i could clear my intention with regard to the step i have taken although i could not perhaps acquit myself to some of my severest judges of an imprudence previous to it you i am sure would pity me if you knew all i could say and how miserable i am in the forfeiture of the good opinion of all my friends i flatter myself that their favour is yet retrievable but whatever be the determination at harloweplace do not you my dearest aunt deny me the favour of a few lines to inform me if there can be any hope of a reconciliation upon terms less shocking than those heretofore endeavoured to be imposed upon me or if which god forbid i am to be for ever reprobated at least my dear aunt procure for me the justice of my wearing apparel and the little money and other things which i wrote to my sister for and mention in the enclosed to you that i may not be destitute of common conveniencies or be under a necessity to owe an obligation for such where at present however i would least of all owe it allow me to say that had i designed what happened i might as to the money and jewels at least have saved myself some of the mortification which i have suffered and which i still further apprehend if my request be not complied with if you are permitted to encourage an eclaircissment of what i hint i will open my whole heart to you and inform you of every thing if it be any pleasure to have me mortified be pleased to let it be known that i am extremely mortified and yet it is entirely from my own reflections that i am so having nothing to find fault with in the behaviour of the person from whom every evil was to be apprehended the bearer having business your way will bring me your answer on saturday morning if you favour me according to my hopes i knew not that i should have this opportunity till i had written the above i am my dearest aunt your ever dutiful cl harlowe be pleased to direct for me if i am to be favoured with a few lines to be left at mr osgoods near sohosquare and nobody shall ever know of your goodness to me if you desire it to be kept a secret letter l miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe saturday april i cannot for my life account for your wretchs teasing ways but he certainly doubts your love of him in this he is a modest man as well as somebody else and tacitly confesses that he does not deserve it your israelitish hankerings after the egyptian onion testified still more in your letter to your aunt your often repeated regrets for meeting him for being betrayed by him these he cannot bear i have been looking back on the whole of his conduct and comparing it with his general character and find that he is more consistently more uniformly mean revengeful and proud than either of us once imagined from his cradle as i may say as an only child and a boy humoursome spoiled mischievous the governor of his governors a libertine in his riper years hardly regardful of appearances and despising the sex in general for the faults of particulars of it who made themselves too cheap to him what has been his behaviour in your family a clarissa in view from the time your foolish brother was obliged to take a life from him but defiance for defiances getting you into his power by terror by artifice what politeness can be expected from such a man well but what in such a situation is to be done why you must despise him you must hate him if you can and run away from him but whither whither indeed now that your brother is laying foolish plots to put you in a still worse condition as it may happen but if you cannot despise and hate him if you care not to break with him you must part with some punctilios and if the so doing bring not on the solemnity you must put yourself into the protection of the ladies of his family their respect for you is of itself a security for his honour to you if there could be any room for doubt and at least you should remind him of his offer to bring one of the miss montagues to attend you at your new lodgings in town and accompany you till all is happily over this youll say will be as good as declaring yourself to be his and so let it you ought not now to think of any thing else but to be his does not your brothers project convince you more and more of this give over then my dearest friend any thoughts of this hopeless reconciliation which has kept you balancing thus long you own in the letter before me that he made very explicit offers though you give me not the very words and he gave his reasons i perceive with his wishes that you should accept them which very few of the sorry fellows do whose plea is generally but a compliment to our selflove that we must love them however presumptuous and unworthy because they love us were i in your place and had your charming delicacies i should perhaps do as you do no doubt but i should expect that the man should urge me with respectful warmth that he should supplicate with constancy and that all his words and actions should tend to the one principal point nevertheless if i suspected art or delay founded upon his doubts of my love i would either condescend to clear up is doubts or renounce him for ever and in my last case i your anna howe would exert myself and either find you a private refuge or resolve to share fortunes with you what a wretch to be so easily answered by your reference to the arrival of your cousin morden but i am afraid that you was too scrupulous for did he not resent that reference could we have his account of the matter i fancy my dear i should think you over nice over delicate had you laid hold of his acknowledged explicitness he would have been as much in your power as now you seem to be in his you wanted not to be told that the person who had been tricked into such a step as you had taken must of necessity submit to many mortifications the reader who has seen his account which miss howe could not have seen when she wrote thus will observe that it was not possible for a person of her true delicacy of mind to act otherwise than she did to a man so cruelly and so insolently artful but were it to me a girl of spirit as i am thought to be i do assure you i would in a quarter of an hour all the time i would allow to punctilio in such a case as yours know what he drives at since either he must mean well or ill if ill the sooner you know it the better if well whose modesty is it he distresses but that of his own wife and methinks you should endeavour to avoid all exasperating recriminations as to what you have heard of his failure in morals especially while you are so happy as not to have occasion to speak of them by experience i grant that it gives a worthy mind some satisfaction in having borne its testimony against the immoralities of a bad one but that correction which is unseasonably given is more likely either to harden or make an hypocrite than to reclaim i am pleased however as well as you with his making light of your brothers wise project poor creature and must master jemmy harlowe with his halfwit pretend to plot and contrive mischief yet rail at lovelace for the same things a witty villain deserves hanging at once and without ceremony if you please but a halfwitted one deserves broken bones first and hanging afterwards i think lovelace has given his character in a few words see letter xlv of this volume be angry at me if you please but as sure as you are alive now that this poor creature whom some call your brother finds he has succeeded in making you fly your fathers house and that he has nothing to fear but your getting into your own and into an independence of him he thinks himself equal to any thing and so he has a mind to fight lovelace with his own weapons dont you remember his pragmatical triumph as told you by your aunt and prided in by that saucy betty barnes from his own foolish mouth see volii letter xlvii i expect nothing from your letter to your aunt i hope lovelace will never know the contents of it in every one of yours i see that he as warmly resents as he dares the little confidence you have in him i should resent it too were i he and knew that i deserved better dont be scrupulous about clothes if you think of putting yourself into the protection of the ladies of his family they know how matters stand between you and your relations and love you never the worse for the silly peoples cruelty i know you wont demand possession of your estate but give him a right to demand it for you and that will be still better adieu my dear may heaven guide and direct you in all your steps is the daily prayer of your ever affectionate and faithful anna howe letter li mr belford to robert lovelace esq friday april thou lovelace hast been long the entertainer i the entertained nor have i been solicitous to animadvert as thou wentest along upon thy inventions and their tendency for i believed that with all thy airs the unequalled perfections and fine qualities of this lady would always be her protection and security but now that i find thou hast so far succeeded as to induce her to come to town and to choose her lodgings in a house the people of which will too probably damp and suppress any honourable motions which may arise in thy mind in her favour i cannot help writing and that professedly in her behalf my inducements to this are not owing to virtue but if they were what hope could i have of affecting thee by pleas arising from it nor would such a man as thou art be deterred were i to remind thee of the vengeance which thou mayest one day expect if thou insultest a woman of her character family and fortune neither are gratitude and honour motives to be mentioned in a womans favour to men such as we are who consider all those of the sex as fair prize over honour in the general acceptation of the word are two things what then is my motive what but the true friendship that i bear thee lovelace which makes me plead thy own sake and thy familys sake in the justice thou owest to this incomparable creature who however so well deserves to have her sake to be mentioned as the principal consideration last time i was at m hall thy noble uncle so earnestly pressed me to use my interest to persuade thee to enter the pale and gave me so many family reasons for it that i could not help engaging myself heartily on his side of the question and the rather as i knew that thy own intentions with regard to this fine woman were then worthy of her and of this i assured his lordship who was half afraid of thee because of the ill usage thou receivedst from her family but now that the case is altered let me press the matter home to thee from other considerations by what i have heard of this ladys perfections from every mouth as well as from thine and from every letter thou hast written where wilt thou find such another woman and why shouldst thou tempt her virtue why shouldst thou wish to try where there is no reason to doubt were i in thy case and designed to marry and if i preferred a woman as i know thou dost this to all the women in the world i should read to make further trial knowing what we know of the sex for fear of succeeding and especially if i doubted not that if there were a woman in the world virtuous at heart it is she and let me tell thee lovelace that in this ladys situation the trial is not a fair trial considering the depth of thy plots and contrivances considering the opportunities which i see thou must have with her in spite of her own heart all her relations follies acting in concert though unknown to themselves with thy wicked scheming head considering how destitute of protection she is considering the house she is to be in where she will be surrounded with thy implements specious wellbred and genteel creatures not easily to be detected when they are disposed to preserve appearances especially by the young inexperienced lady wholly unacquainted with the town considering all these things i say what glory what cause of triumph wilt thou have if she should be overcome thou too a man born for intrigue full of invention intrepid remorseless able patiently to watch for thy opportunity not hurried as most men by gusts of violent passion which often nip a project in the bud and make the snail that was just putting out his horns to meet the inviter withdraw into its shell a man who has no regard to his word or oath to the sex the lady scrupulously strict to her word incapable of art or design apt therefore to believe well of others it would be a miracle if she stood such an attempter such attempts and such snares as i see will be laid for her and after all i see not when men are so frail without importunity that so much should be expected from women daughters of the same fathers and mothers and made up of the same brittle compounds education all the difference nor where the triumph is in subduing them may there not be other lovelaces thou askest who attracted by her beauty may endeavour to prevail with her see letter xviii of this volume no there cannot i answer be such another man person mind fortune and thy character as above given taken in if thou imaginest there could such is thy pride that thou wouldst think the worse of thyself but let me touch upon thy predominant passion revenge for love is but second to that as i have often told thee though it has set thee into raving at me what poor pretences for revenge are the difficulties thou hadst in getting her off allowing that she had run a risque of being solmess wife had she staid if these are other than pretences why thankest thou not those who by their persecutions of her answered thy hopes and threw her into thy power besides are not the pretences thou makest for further trial most ungratefully as well as contradictorily founded upon the supposition of error in her occasioned by her favour to thee and let me for the utter confusion of thy poor pleas of this nature ask thee would she in thy opinion had she willingly gone off with thee have been entitled to better quarter for a mistress indeed she might but how wouldst thou for a wife have had cause to like her half so well as now has she not demonstrated that even the highest provocations were not sufficient to warp her from her duty to her parents though a native and as i may say an originally involuntary duty because native and is not this a charming earnest that she will sacredly observe a still higher duty into which she proposes to enter when she does enter by plighted vows and entirely as a volunteer that she loves thee wicked as thou art and cruel as a panther there is no reason to doubt yet what a command has she over herself that such a penetrating selfflatterer as thyself is sometimes ready to doubt it though persecuted on the one hand as she was by her own family and attracted on the other by the splendour of thine every one of whom courts her to rank herself among them thou wilt perhaps think that i have departed from my proposition and pleaded the ladys sake more than thine in the above but no such thing all that i have written is more in thy behalf than in hers since she may make thee happy but it is next to impossible i should think if she preserve her delicacy that thou canst make her so what is the love of a rakish heart there cannot be peculiarity in it but i need not give my further reasons thou wilt have ingenuousness enough i dare say were there occasion for it to subscribe to my opinion i plead not for the state from any great liking to it myself nor have i at present thoughts of entering into it but as thou art the last of thy name as thy family is of note and figure in thy country and as thou thyself thinkest that thou shalt one day marry is it possible let me ask thee that thou canst have such another opportunity as thou now hast if thou lettest this slip a woman in her family and fortune not unworthy of thine own though thou art so apt from pride of ancestry and pride of heart to speak slightly of the families thou dislikest so celebrated for beauty and so noted at the same time for prudence for soul i will say instead of sense and for virtue if thou art not so narrowminded an elf as to prefer thine own single satisfaction to posterity thou who shouldst wish to beget children for duration wilt not postpone till the rakes usual time that is to say till diseases or years or both lay hold of thee since in that case thou wouldst entitle thyself to the curses of thy legitimate progeny for giving them a being altogether miserable a being which they will be obliged to hold upon a worse tenure than that tenantcourtesy which thou callest the worst to wit upon the doctors courtesy thy descendants also propagating if they shall live and be able to propagate a wretched race that shall entail the curse or the reason for it upon remote generations wicked as the sober world accounts you and me we have not yet it is to be hoped got over all compunction although we find religion against us we have not yet presumed those who do and we know better than to be even doubters in short we believe a future state of rewards and punishments but as we have so much youth and health in hand we hope to have time for repentance that is to say in plain english nor think thou me too grave lovelace thou art grave sometimes though not often we hope to live to sense as long as sense can relish and purpose to reform when we can sin no longer and shall this admirable woman suffer for her generous endeavours to set on foot thy reformation and for insisting upon proofs of the sincerity of thy professions before she will be thine upon the whole matter let me wish thee to consider well what thou art about before thou goest a step farther in the path which thou hast chalked out for thyself to tread and art just going to enter upon hitherto all is so far right that if the lady mistrusts thy honour she has no proofs be honest to her then in her sense of the word none of thy companions thou knowest will offer to laugh at what thou dost and if they should of thy entering into a state which has been so much ridiculed by thee and by all of us thou hast one advantage it is this that thou canst not be ashamed deferring to the postday to close my letter i find one left at my cousin osgoods with directions to be forwarded to the lady it was brought within these two hours by a particular hand and has a harlowe seal upon it as it may therefore be of importance i dispatch it with my own by my servant posthaste this letter was from miss arabella harlowe see let lv i suppose you will soon be in town without the lady i hope farewell be honest and be happy j belford sat april letter lii mrs hervey to miss clarissa harlowe in answer to letter xviii dear niece it would be hard not to write a few lines so much pressed to write to one i ever loved your former letter i received yet was not at liberty to answer it i break my word to answer you now strange informations are every day received about you the wretch you are with we are told is every hour triumphing and defying must not these informations aggravate you know the uncontroulableness of the man he loves his own humour better than he loves you though so fine a creature as you are i warned you over and over no young lady was ever more warned miss clarissa harlowe to do such a thing you might have given your friends the meeting if you had held your aversion it would have been complied with as soon as i was intrusted myself with their intention to give up the point i gave you a hint a dark one perhaps but who would have thought o miss such an artful flight such cunning preparations but you want to clear up things what can you clear up are you not gone off with a lovelace too what my dear would you clear up you did not design to go you say why did you meet him then chariot and six horsemen all prepared by him o my dear how art produces art will it be believed if it would what power will he be thought to have had over you he who lovelace the vilest of libertines over whom a clarissa was your love for such a man above your reason above your resolution what credit would a belief of this if believed bring you how mend the matter oh that you had stood the next morning ill tell you all that was intended if you had it was indeed imagined that you would not have been able to resist your fathers entreaties and commands he was resolved to be all condescension if anew you had not provoked him i love my clary harlowe said he but an hour before the killing tidings were brought him i love her as my life i will kneel to her if nothing else will do to prevail upon her to oblige me your father and mother the reverse of what should have been would have humbled themselves to you and if you could have denied them and refused to sign the settlements previous to the meeting they would have yielded although with regret but it was presumed so naturally sweet your temper so selfdenying as they thought you that you could not have withstood them notwithstanding all your dislike of the one man without a greater degree of headstrong passion for the other than you had given any of us reason to expect from you if you had the meeting on wednesday would have been a lighter trial to you you would have been presented to all your assembled friends with a short speech only that this was the young creature till very lately faultless condescending and obliging now having cause to glory in a triumph over the wills of father mother uncles the most indulgent over familyinterests familyviews and preferring her own will to every bodys and this for a transitory preference to person only there being no comparison between the men in their morals thus complied with and perhaps blessed by your father and mother and the consequences of your disobedience deprecated in the solemnest manner by your inimitable mother your generosity would have been appealed to since your duty would have been fount too weak an inducement and you would have been bid to withdraw for one half hours consideration then would the settlements have been again tendered for your signing by the person least disobliging to you by your good norton perhaps she perhaps seconded by your father again and if again refused you would have again have been led in to declare such your refusal some restrictions which you yourself had proposed would have been insisted upon you would have been permitted to go home with me or with your uncle antony with which of us was not agreed upon because they hoped you might be persuaded there to stay till the arrival of your cousin morden or till your father could have borne to see you or till assured that the views of lovelace were at an end this the intention your father so set upon your compliance so much in hopes that you would have yielded that you would have been prevailed upon by methods so condescending and so gentle no wonder that he in particular was like a distracted man when he heard of your flight of your flight so premeditated with your ivy summerhouse dinings your arts to blind me and all of us naughty naughty young creature i for my part would not believe it when told of it your uncle hervey would not believe it we rather expected we rather feared a still more desperate adventure there could be but one more desperate and i was readier to have the cascade resorted to than the garden backdoor your mother fainted away while her heart was torn between the two apprehensions your father poor man your father was beside himself for near an hour what imprecations what dreadful imprecations to this day he can hardly bear your name yet can think of nobody else your merits my dear but aggravate your fault something of fresh aggravation every hour how can any favour be expected i am sorry for it but am afraid nothing you ask will be complied with why mention you my dear the saving you from mortifications who have gone off with a man what a poor pride is it to stand upon any thing else i dare not open my lips in your favour nobody dare your letter must stand by itself this has caused me to send it to harloweplace expect therefore great severity may you be enabled to support the lot you have drawn o my dear how unhappy have you made every body can you expect to be happy your father wishes you had never been born your poor mother but why should i afflict you there is now no help you must be changed indeed if you are not very unhappy yourself in the reflections your thoughtful mind must suggest to you you must now make the best of your lot yet not married it seems it is in your power you say to perform whatever you shall undertake to do you may deceive yourself you hope that your reputation and the favour of your friends may be retrieved never never both i doubt if either every offended person and that is all who loved you and are related to you must join to restore you when can these be of one mind in a case so notoriously wrong it would be very grievous you say to be precipitated upon measures that may make the desirable reconciliation more difficult is it now my dear a time for you to be afraid of being precipitated at present if ever there can be no thought of reconciliation the upshot of your precipitation must first be seen there may be murder yet as far as we know will the man you are with part willingly with you if not what may be the consequence if he will lord bless me what shall we think of his reasons for it i will fly this thought i know your purity but my dear are you not out of all protection are you not unmarried have you not making your daily prayers useless thrown yourself into temptation and is not the man the most wicked of plotters you have hitherto you say and i think my dear with an air unbecoming to your declared penitence no fault to find with the behaviour of a man from whom every evil was apprehended like caesar to the roman augur which i heard you tell of who had bid him beware the ides of march the ides of march said caesar seeing the augur among the crowd as he marched in state to the senatehouse from which he was never to return alive the ides of march are come but they are not past the augur replied make the application my dear may you be able to make this reflection upon his good behaviour to the last of your knowledge of him may he behave himself better to you than he ever did to any body else over whom he had power amen no answer i beseech you i hope your messenger will not tell any body that i have written to you and i dare say you will not show what i have written to mr lovelace for i have written with the less reserve depending upon your prudence you have my prayers my dolly knows not that i write nobody does not even mr hervey notwithstanding what mrs hervey here says it will be hereafter seen that this severe letter was written in private concert with the implacable arabella dolly would have several times written but having defended your fault with heat and with a partiality that alarmed us such a fall as yours my dear must be alarming to all parents she has been forbidden on pain of losing our favour for ever and this at your familys request as well as by her fathers commands you have the poor girls hourly prayers i will however tell you though she knows not what i do as well as those of your truly afflicted aunt d hervey friday april letter liii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe with the preceding sat morn april i have just now received the enclosed from my aunt hervey be pleased my dear to keep her secret of having written to the unhappy wretch her niece i may go to london i see or where i will no matter what becomes of me i was the willinger to suspend my journey thither till i heard from harloweplace i thought if i could be encouraged to hope for a reconciliation i would let this man see that he should not have me in his power but upon my own terms if at all but i find i must be his whether i will or not and perhaps through still greater mortifications than those great ones which i have already met with and must i be so absolutely thrown upon a man with whom i am not at all satisfied my letter is sent you see to harloweplace my heart aches for the reception it may meet with there one comfort only arises to me from its being sent that my aunt will clear herself by the communication from the supposition of having corresponded with the poor creature whom they have all determine to reprobate it is no small part of my misfortune that i have weakened the confidence one dear friend has in another and made one look cool upon another my poor cousin dolly you see has reason to regret on this account as well as my aunt miss howe my dear miss howe is but too sensible of the effects of my fault having had more words with her mother on my account than ever she had on any other yet the man who has drawn me into all this evil i must be thrown upon much did i consider much did i apprehend before my fault supposing i were to be guilty of it but i saw it not in all its shocking lights and now to know that my father an hour before he received the tidings of my supposed flight owned that he loved me as his life that he would have been all condescension that he would oh my dear how tender how mortifyingly tender now in him my aunt need not have been afraid that it should be known that she has sent me such a letter as this a father to kneel to his child there would not indeed have been any bearing of that what i should have done in such a case i know not death would have been much more welcome to me than such a sight on such an occasion in behalf of a man so very very disgustful to me but i had deserve annihilation had i suffered my father to kneel in vain yet had but the sacrifice of inclination and personal preference been all less than kneeling should have been done my duty should have been the conqueror of my inclination but an aversion an aversion so very sincere the triumph of a cruel and ambitious brother ever so uncontroulable joined with the insults of an envious sister bringing wills to theirs which otherwise would have been favourable to me the marriageduties so absolutely indispensable so solemnly to be engaged for the marriageintimacies permit me to say to you my friend what the purest although with apprehension must think of so very intimate myself one who has never looked upon any duty much less a voluntary vowed one with indifference could it have been honest in me to have given my hand to an odious hand and to have consented to such a more than reluctant such an immiscible union if i may so call it for life too did not i think more and deeper than most young creatures think did i not weigh did i not reflect i might perhaps have been less obstinate delicacy may i presume to call it thinking weighing reflection are not blessings i he not found them such in the degree i have them i wish i had been able in some very nice cases to have known what indifference was yet not to have my ignorance imputable to me as a fault oh my dear the finer sensibilities if i may suppose mine to be such make not happy what a method had my friends intended to take with me this i dare say was a method chalked out by my brother he i suppose was to have presented me to all my assembled friends as the daughter capable of preferring her own will to the wills of them all it would have been a sore trial no doubt would to heaven however i had stood it let the issue have been what it would would to heaven i had stood it there may be murder my aunt says this looks as if she knew of singletons rash plot such an upshot as she calls it of this unhappy affair heaven avert she flies a thought that i can less dwell upon a cruel thought but she has a poor opinion of the purity she compliments me with if she thinks that i am not by gods grace above temptation from this sex although i never saw a man whose person i could like before this man yet his faulty character allowed me but little merit from the indifference i pretended to on his account but now i see him in nearer lights i like him less than ever unpolite cruel insolent unwise a trifler with his own happiness the destroyer of mine his last treatment my fate too visibly in his power master of his own wishes shame to say it if he knew what to wish for indeed i never liked him so little as now upon my word i think i could hate him if i do not already hate him sooner than any man i ever thought tolerably of a good reason why because i have been more disappointed in my expectations of him although they never were so high as to have made him my choice in preference to the single life had that been permitted me still if the giving him up for ever will make my path to reconciliation easy and if they will signify as much to me they shall see that i never will be his for i have the vanity to think my soul his souls superior you will say i rave forbidden to write to my aunt and taught to despair of reconciliation you my dear must be troubled with my passionate resentments what a wretch was i to give him a meeting since by that i put it out of my power to meet my assembled friends all would now if i had met them been over and who can tell when my present distresses will rid of both men i had been now perhaps at my aunt herveys or at my uncle antonys wishing for my cousin mordens arrival who might have accommodated all i intended indeed to have stood it and if i had how know i by whose name i might now have been called for how should i have resisted a condescending a kneeling father had he been able to have kept his temper with me yet my aunt say he would have relented if i had not perhaps he would have been moved by my humility before he could have shown such undue condescension such temper as he would have received me with might have been improved upon in my favour and that he had designed ultimately to relent how it clears my friends at least to themselves and condemns me o why were my aunts hints i remember them now so very dark yet i intended to have returned after the interview and then perhaps she would have explained herself o this artful this designing lovelace yet i must repeat that most ought i to blame myself for meeting him but far far be banished from me fruitless recrimination far banished because fruitless let me wrap myself about in the mantle of my own integrity and take comfort in my unfaulty intention since it is now too late to look back let me collect all my fortitude and endeavour to stand those shafts of angry providence which it will not permit me to shun that whatever the trials may be which i am destined to undergo i may not behave unworthily in them and may come out amended by them join with me in this prayer my beloved friend for your own honours sake as well as for loves sake join with me in it lest a deviation on my side should with the censorious cast a shade upon a friendship which has no levity in it and the basis of which is improvement as well in the greater as lesser duties cl harlowe letter liv miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe saturday afternoon april o my best my only friend now indeed is my heart broken it has received a blow it never will recover think not of corresponding with a wretch who now seems absolutely devoted how can it be otherwise if a parents curses have the weight i always attributed to them and have heard so many instances in confirmation of that weight yes my dear miss howe superadded to all my afflictions i have the consequences of a fathers curse to struggle with how shall i support this reflection my past and my present situation so much authorizing my apprehensions i have at last a letter from my unrelenting sister would to heaven i had not provoked it by my second letter to my aunt hervey it lay ready for me it seems the thunder slept till i awakened it i enclose the letter itself transcribe it i cannot there is no bearing the thoughts of it for shocking reflection the curse extends to the life beyond this i am in the depth of vapourish despondency i can only repeat shun fly correspond not with a wretch so devoted as cl harlowe letter lv to miss clarissa harlowe to be left at mr osgoods near sohosquare friday april it was expected you would send again to me or to my aunt hervey the enclosed has lain ready for you therefore by direction you will have no answer from any body write to whom you will and as often as you will and what you will it was designed to bring you back by proper authority or to send you whither the disgraces you have brought upon us all should be in the likeliest way after a while to be forgotten but i believe that design is over so you may range securely nobody will think it worth while to give themselves any trouble about you yet my mother has obtained leave to send you your clothes of all sorts but your clothes only this is a favour youll see by the within letter not designed you and now not granted for your sake but because my poor mother cannot bear in her sight any thing you used to wear read the enclosed and tremble arabella harlowe to the most ungrateful and undutiful of daughters harloweplace april sister that was for i know not what name you are permitted or choose to go by you have filled us all with distraction my father in the first agitations of his mind on discovering your wicked your shameful elopement imprecated on his knees a fearful curse upon you tremble at the recital of it no less than that you may meet your punishment both here and hereafter by means of the very wretch in whom you have chosen to place your wicked confidence your clothes will not be sent you you seen by leaving them behind you to have been secure of them whenever you demanded them but perhaps you could think of nothing but meeting your fellow nothing but how to get off your forward self for every thing seems to have been forgotten but what was to contribute to your wicked flight yet you judged right perhaps that you would have been detected had you endeavoured to get away with your clothes cunning creature not to make one step that we would guess at you by cunning to effect your own ruin and the disgrace of all the family but does the wretch put you upon writing for your things for fear you should be too expensive to him thats it i suppose was there ever a giddier creature yet this is the celebrated the blazing clarissa clarissa what harlowe no doubt and harlowe it will be to the disgrace of us all your drawings and your pieces are all taken down as is also your whole length picture in the vandyke taste from your late parlour they are taken down and thrown into your closet which will be nailed up as if it were not a part of the house there to perish together for who can bear to see them yet how did they use to be shown to every body the former for the magnifying of your dainty fingerworks the latter for the imputed dignity dignity now in the dust of your boasted figure and this by those fond parents from whom you have run away with so much yet with so little contrivance my brother vows revenge upon your libertine for the familys sake he vows it not for yours for he will treat you he declares like a common creature if ever he sees you and doubts not that this will be your fate my uncle harlowe renounces you for ever so does my uncle antony so does my aunt hervey so do i base unworthy creature the disgrace of a good family and the property of an infamous rake as questionless you will soon find yourself if you are not already your books since they have not taught you what belongs to your family to your sex and to your education will not be sent to you your money neither nor yet the jewels so undeservedly made yours for it is wished you may be seen a beggar along londonstreets if all this is heavy lay your hand to your heart and ask yourself why you have deserved it every man whom your pride taught you to reject with scorn mr solmes excepted who however has reason to rejoice that he missed you triumphs in your shameful elopement and now knows how to account for his being refused your worthy norton is ashamed of you and mingles her tears with your mothers both reproaching themselves for their shares in you and in so fruitless an education every body in short is ashamed of you but none more than arabella harlowe letter lvi miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe tuesday april be comforted be not dejected do not despond my dearest and best beloved friend god almighty is just and gracious and gives not his assent to rash and inhuman curses can you think that heaven will seal to the black passions of its depraved creatures if it did malice envy and revenge would triumph and the best of the human race blasted by the malignity of the worst would be miserable in both worlds this outrageousness shows only what manner of spirit they are of and how much their sordid views exceed their parental love tis all owing to rage and disappointment disappointment in designs proper to be frustrated if you consider this malediction as it ought to be considered a person of your piety must and will rather pity and pray for your rash father than terrify yourself on the occasion none bug god can curse parents or others whoever they be can only pray to him to curse and such prayers can have no weight with a just and allperfect being the motives to which are unreasonable and the end proposed by them cruel has not god commanded us to bless and curse not pray for your father then i repeat that he incur not the malediction he has announced on you since he has broken as you see a command truly divine while you by obeying that other precept which enjoins us to pray for them that persecute and curse us will turn the curse into a blessing my mother blames them for this wicked letter of your sister and she pities you and of her own accord wished me to write to comfort you for this once for she says it is pity your heart which was so noble and when the sense of your fault and the weight of a parents curse are so strong upon you should be quite broken lord bless me how your aunt writes can there be two rights and two wrongs in palpable cases but my dear she must be wrong so they all have been justify themselves now as they will they can only justify themselves to themselves from selfish principles resolving to acquit not fairly to try themselves did your unkind aunt in all the tedious progress of your contentions with them give you the least hope of their relenting her dark hints now i recollect as well as you but why was any thing good or hopeful to be darkly hinted how easy was it for her who pretended always to love you for her who can give such flowing license to her pen for your hurt to have given you one word one line in confidence of their pretended change of measures but do not mind their afterpretences my dear all of them serve but for tacit confessions of their vile usage of you i will keep your aunts secret never fear i would not on any consideration that my mother should see her letter you will now see that you have nothing left but to overcome all scrupulousness and marry as son as you have an opportunity determine to do so my dear i will give you a motive for it regarding myself for this i have resolved and this i have vowed o friend the best beloved of my heart be not angry with me for it that so long as your happiness is in suspence i will never think of marrying in justice to the man i shall have i have vowed this for my dear must i not be miserable if you are so and what an unworthy wife must i be to any man who cannot have interest enough in my heart to make his obligingness a balance for an affliction he has not caused i would show lovelace your sisters abominable letter were it to me i enclose it it shall not have a place in this house this will enter him of course into the subject which you now ought to have most in view let him see what you suffer for him he cannot prove base to such an excellence i should never enjoy my head or my senses should this man prove a villain to you with a merit so exalted you may have punishment more than enough for your involuntary fault in that husband i would not have you be too sure that their project to seize you is over the words intimating that it is over in the letter of that abominable arabella seem calculated to give you security she only says she believes that design is over and i do not yet find from miss lloyd that it is disavowed so it will be best when you are in london to be private and for fear of the worst to let every direction to be a third place for i would not for the world have you fall into the hands of such flaming and malevolent spirits by surprize i will myself be content to direct you at some third place and i shall then be able to aver to my mother or to any other if occasion be that i know not where you are besides this measure will make you less apprehensive of the consequences of their violence should they resolve to attempt to carry you of in spite of lovelace i would have you direct to mr hickman even your answer to this i have a reason for it besides my mother notwithstanding this particular indulgence is very positive they have prevailed upon her i know to give her word to this purpose spiteful poor wretches how i hate in particular your foolish uncle antony i would not have your thought dwell on the contents of your sisters shocking letter but pursue other subjects the subjects before you and let me know your progress with lovelace and what he says to this diabolical curse so far you may enter into this hateful subject i expect that this will aptly introduce the grant topic between you without needing a mediator come my dear when things are at worst they will mend good often comes when evil is expected but if you despond there can be no hopes of cure dont let them break your heart for that is plain to me is now what some people have in view for you to do how poor to withhold from you your books your jewels and your money as money is all you can at present want since they will vouchsafe to send your clothes i send fifty guineas by the bearer enclosed in single papers in my norriss miscellanies i charge you as you love me return them not i have more at your service so if you like not your lodgings or his behaviour when you get to town leave both them and him out of hand i would advise you to write to mr morden without delay if he intends for england it may hasten him and you will do very well till he can come but surely lovelace will be infatuated if he secure not his happiness by your consent before that of mr mordens is made needful on his arrival once more my dear let me beg of you to be comforted manage with your usual prudence the stake before you and all will still be happy suppose yourself to be me and me to be you you may for your distress is mine and then you will add full day to these but glimmering lights which are held out to you by your ever affectionate and faithful anna howe i hurry this away by robert i will inquire into the truth of your aunts pretences about the change of measures which she says they intended in case you had not gone away letter lvii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe wednesday morning april your letter my beloved miss howe gives me great comfort how sweetly do i experience the truth of the wise mans observation that a faithful friend is the medicine of life your messenger finds me just setting out for london the chaise at the door already i have taken leave of the good widow who has obliged me with the company of her eldest daughter at mr lovelaces request while he rides by us the young gentlewoman is to return in two or three days with the chaise in its way to my lord ms hertfordshire seat i received my sisters dreadful letter on sunday when mr lovelace was out he saw on his return my extreme anguish and dejection and he was told how much worse i had been for i had fainted away more than once i think the contents of it have touched my head as well as my heart he would fain have seen it but i would not permit that because of the threatenings he would have found in it against himself as it was the effect it had upon me made him break out into execrations and menaces i was so ill that he himself advised me to delay going to town on monday as i proposed to do he is extremely regardful and tender of me all that you supposed would follow the violent letter from him has followed it he has offered himself to my acceptance in so unreserved a manner that i am concerned i have written so freely and diffidently of him pray my dearest friend keep to yourself every thing that may appear disreputable of him from me i must acquaint you that his kind behaviour and my lowspiritedness cooperating with your former advice and my unhappy situation made me that very sunday evening receive unreservedly his declarations and now indeed i am more in his power than ever he presses me every hour indeed as needlessly as unkindly for fresh tokens of my esteem for him and confidence in him and as i have been brought to some verbal concessions if he should prove unworthy i am sure i shall have great reason to blame this violent letter for i have no resolution at all abandoned thus of all my natural friends of whose returning favour i have now no hopes and only you to pity me and you restrained as i may say i have been forced to turn my desolate heart to such protection as i could find all my comfort is that your advice repeatedly given me to the same purpose in your kind letter before me warrants me i now set out the more cheerfully to london on that account for before a heavy weight hung upon my heart and although i thought it best and safest to go yet my spirits sunk i know not why at every motion i made towards a preparation for it i hope no mischief will happen on the road i hope these violent spirits will not meet every one is waiting for me pardon me my best my kindest friend that i return your norris in these more promising prospects i cannot have occasion for your favour besides i have some hope that with my clothes they will send me the money i wrote for although it is denied me in the letter if they do not and if i should have occasion i can but signify my wants to so ready a friend and i have promised to be obliged only to you but i had rather methinks you should have it still to say if challenged that nothing of this nature has been either requested or done i say this with a view entirely to my future hopes of recovering your mothers favour which next to that of my own father and mother i am most solicitous to recover i must acquaint you wit one thing more notwithstanding my hurry and that is that mr lovelace offered either to attend me to lord ms or to send for his chaplain yesterday he pressed me to consent to this proposal most earnestly and even seemed desirous rather to have the ceremony pass here than at london for when there i had told him it was time enough to consider of so weighty and important a matter now upon the receipt of your kind your consolatory letter methinks i could almost wish it had been in my power to comply with his earnest solicitations but this dreadful letter has unhinged my whole frame then some little punctilio surely is necessary no preparation made no articles drawn no license ready grief so extreme no pleasure in prospect nor so much as in wish o my dear who could think of entering into so solemn an engagement who so unprepared could seem to be so ready if i could flatter myself that my indifference to all the joys of this life proceeded from proper motives not rather from the disappointments and mortifications my pride has met with how much rather i think should i choose to be wedded to my shroud than to any man on earth indeed i have at present no pleasure but in your friendship continue that to me i beseech you if my heart rises hereafter to a capacity of more it must be built on that foundation my spirits sink again on setting out excuse this depth of vapourish dejection which forbids me even hope the cordial that keeps life from stagnating and which never was denied me till within these eightand forty hours but tis time to relieve you adieu my best beloved and kindest friend pray for your clarissa letter lviii miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe thursday april i am sorry you sent back my norris but you must be allowed to do as you please so must i in my turn we must neither of us perhaps expect absolutely of the other what is the rightest thing to be done and yet few folks so young as we are better know what the rightest is i cannot separate myself from you although i give a double instance of my vanity in joining myself with you in this particular assertion i am most heartily rejoiced that your prospects are so much mended and that as i hoped good has been produced out of evil what must the man have been what must have been his views had he not taken such a turn upon a letter so vile and upon a treatment so unnatural himself principally the occasion of it you know best your motives for suspending but i wish you could have taken him at offers so earnest why should you not have permitted him to send for lord ms chaplain if punctilio only was in the way and want of a license and of proper preparations and such like my service to you my dear and there is ceremony tantamount to your ceremony mr lovelace in his next letter tells his friend how extremely ill the lady was recovering from fits to fall into stronger fits and nobody expecting her life she had not he says acquainted miss howe how very ill she was in the next letter she tells miss howe that her motives for suspending were not merely ceremonious ones do not do not my dear friend again be so very melancholy a decliner as to prefer a shroud when the matter you wish for is in your power and when as you have justly said heretofore persons cannot die when they will but it is a strange perverseness in human nature that we slight that when near us which at a distance we wish for you have now but one point to pursue that is marriage let that be solemnized leave the rest to providence and to use your own words in a former letter follow as that leads you will have a handsome man a genteel man he would be a wise man if he were not vain of his endowments and wild and intriguing but while the eyes of many of our sex taken by so specious a form and so brilliant a spirit encourage that vanity you must be contented to stay till grey hairs and prudence enter upon the stage together you would not have every thing in the same man i believe mr hickman treads no crooked paths but he hobbles most ungracefully in a straight one yet mr hickman though he pleases not my eye nor diverts my ear will not as i believe disgust the one nor shock the other your man as i have lately said will always keep up attention you will always be alive with him though perhaps more from fears than hopes while mr hickman will neither say any thing to keep one awake nor yet by shocking adventures make ones slumbers uneasy i believe i now know which of the two men so prudent a person as you would at first have chosen nor doubt i that you can guess which i would have made choice of if i might but proud as we are the proudest of us all can only refuse and many of us accept the but halfworthy for fear a still worse should offer if men had chosen their mistresses for spirits like their own although mr lovelace at the long run may have been too many for me i dont doubt but i should have given heartach for heartach for one halfyear at least while you with my dullswift would have glided on as serenely as calmly as unaccountably as the succeeding seasons and varying no otherwise than they to bring on new beauties and conveniencies to all about you i was going on in this style but my mother broke in upon me with a prohibitory aspect she gave me leave for one letter only she had just parted with your odious uncle and they have been in close conference again she has vexed me i must lay this by till i hear from you again not knowing whither to send it direct me to a third place as i desired in my former i told my mother on her challenging me that i was writing indeed and to you but it was only to amuse myself for i protested that i knew not where to send to you i hope that your next may inform me of your nuptials although the next to that were to acquaint me that he was the most ungratefullest monster on earth as he must be if not the kindest husband in it my mother has vexed me but so on revising i wrote before but she has unhinged me as you call it pretended to catechise hickman i assure you for contributing to our supposed correspondence catechised him severely too upon my word i believe i have a sneaking kindness for the sneaking fellow for i cannot endure that any body should treat him like a fool but myself i believe between you and me the good lady forgot herself i heard her loud she possibly imagined that my father was come to life again yet the meekness of the man might have soon convinced her i should have thought for my father it seems would talk as loud as she i suppose though within a few yards of each other as if both were out of their way and were hallooing at half a miles distance to get in again i know youll blame me for this sauciness but i told you i was vexed and if i had not a spirit my parentage on both sides might be doubted you must not chide me too severely however because i have learned of you not to defend myself in an error and i own i am wrong and thats enough you wont be so generous in this case as you are in every other if you dont think it is adieu my dear i must i will love you and love you for ever so subscribes your anna howe letter lix from miss howe enclosed in the above thursday april i have been making inquiry as i told you i would whether your relations had really before you left them resolved upon that change of measures which your aunt mentions in her letter and by laying together several pieces of intelligence some drawn from my mother through your uncle antonys communications some from miss lloyd by your sisters and some by a third way that i shall not tell you of i have reason to think the following a true state of the case that there was no intention of a change of measures till within two or three days of your going away on the contrary your brother and sister though they had no hope of prevailing with you in solmess favour were resolved never to give over their persecutions till they had pushed you upon taking some step which by help of their good offices should be deemed inexcusable by the halfwitted souls they had to play upon but that at last your mother tired with and perhaps ashamed of the passive part she had acted thought fit to declare to miss bell that she was determined to try to put an end to the family feuds and to get your uncle harlowe to second her endeavours this alarmed your brother and sister and then a change of measures was resolved upon solmess offers were however too advantageous to be given up and your fathers condescension was now to be their sole dependence and as they give it out the trying of what that would do with you their last effort and indeed my dear this must have succeeded i verily think with such a daughter as they had to deal with could that father who never i dare say kneeled in his life but to his god have so far condescended as your aunt writes he would but then my dear what would this have done perhaps you would have given lovelace this meeting in hopes to pacify him and prevent mischief supposing that they had given you time and not hurried you directly into the state but if you had not met him you see that he was resolved to visit them and well attended too and what must have been the consequence so that upon the whole we know not but matters may be best as they are however disagreeable that best is i hope your considerate and thoughtful mind will make a good use of this hint who would not with patience sustain even a great evil if she could persuade herself that it was kindly dispensed in order to prevent a still greater especially if she could sit down as you can and acquit her own heart permit me one further observation do we not see from the above state of the matter what might have been done before by the worthy person of your family had she exerted the mother in behalf of a child so meritorious yet so much oppressed adieu my dear i will be ever yours anna howe clarissa in her answer to the first of the two last letters chides her friend for giving so little weight to her advice in relation to her behaviour to her mother it may be proper to insert here the following extracts from that answer though a little before the time you assume my dear says she your usual and everagreeable style in what you write of the two gentlemen and how unaptly you think they have chosen mr hickman in addressing you mr lovelace me but i am inclinable to believe that with a view to happiness however two mild tempers might agree two high ones would make sad work of it both at one time violent and unyielding you two might indeed have raqueted the ball betwixt you as you say but mr hickman by his gentle manners seems formed for you if you go not too far with him if you do it would be a tameness in him to bear it which would make a man more contemptible than mr hickman can ever deserve to be made nor is it a disgrace for even a brave man who knows what a woman is to vow to him afterwards to be very obsequious beforehand see letter xxxv and letter xxxvi of this volume see letter xxxvi of this volume do you think it is to the credit of mr lovelaces character that he can be offensive and violent does he not as all such spirits must subject himself to the necessity of making submissions for his excesses far more mortifying to a proud hear than those condescensions which the high spirited are so apt to impute as a weakness of mind in such a man as mr hickman let me tell you my dear that mr hickman is such a one as would rather bear an affront from a lady than offer one to her he had rather i dare say that she should have occasion to ask his pardon than he hers but my dear you have outlived your first passion and had the second man been an angel he would not have been more than indifferent to you my motives for suspending proceeds she were not merely ceremonious ones i was really very ill i could not hold up my head the contents of my sisters letters had pierced my heart indeed my dear i was very ill and was i moreover to be as ready to accept his offer as if i were afraid he never would repeat it i see with great regret that your mamma is still immovably bent against our correspondence what shall i do about it it goes against me to continue it or to wish you to favour me with returns yet i have so managed my matters that i have no friend but you to advise with it is enough to make one indeed wish to be married to this man though a man of errors as he has worthy relations of my own sex and i should have some friends i hope and having some i might have more for as money is said to increase money so does the countenance of persons of character increase friends while the destitute must be destitute it goes against my heart to beg of your to discontinue corresponding with me and yet it is against my conscience to carry it on against parental prohibition but i dare not use all the arguments against it that i could use and why for fear i should convince you and you should reject me as the rest of my friends have done i leave therefore the determination of this point upon you i am not i find to be trusted with it but be mine all the fault and all the punishment if it be punishable and certainly it must when it can be the cause of the letter i have before me and which i must no farther animadvert upon because you forbid me to do so to the second letter among other things she says so my dear you seem to think that there was a fate in my error the cordial the considerate friendship is seen in the observation you make on this occasion yet since things have happened as they have would to heaven i could hear that all the world acquitted my father or at least my mother whose character before these family feuds broke out was the subject of everyones admiration dont let any body say from you so that it may come to her ear that she might from a timely exertion of her fine talents have saved her unhappy child you will observe my dear that in her own good time when she saw there was not likely to be an end to my brothers persecutions she resolved to exert herself but the pragmatical daughter by the fatal meeting precipitated all and frustrated her indulgent designs o my love i am now convinced by dear experience that while children are so happy as to have parents or guardians whom they may consult they should not presume no not with the best and purest intentions to follow their own conceits in material cases a ray of hope of future reconciliation darts in upon my mind from the intention you tell me my mother had to exert herself in my favour had i not gone away and my hope is the stronger as this communication points out to me that my uncle harlowes interest is likely in my mothers opinion to be of weight if it could be engaged it will behove me perhaps to apply to that dear uncle if a proper occasion offer letter lx mr lovelace to john belford esq monday april fate is weaving a whimsical web for thy friend and i see not but i shall be inevitably manacled here have i been at work dig dig dig like a cunning miner at one time and spreading my snares like an artful fowler at another and exulting in my contrivances to get this inimitable creature absolutely into my power every thing made for me her brother and uncles were but my pioneers her father stormed as i directed him to storm mrs howe was acted by the springs i set at work her daughter was moving for me yet imagined herself plumb against me and the dear creature herself had already run her stubborn neck into my gin and knew not that she was caught for i had not drawn my sprindges close about her and just as all this was completed wouldst thou believe that i should be my own enemy and her friend that i should be so totally diverted from all my favourite purposes as to propose to marry her before i went to town in order to put it out of my own power to resume them when thou knowest this wilt thou not think that my black angel plays me booty and has taken it into his head to urge me on to the indissoluble tie that he might be more sure of me from the complex transgressions to which he will certainly stimulate me when wedded than perhaps he thought he could be from the simple sins in which i have so long allowed myself that they seem to have the plea of habit thou wilt be still the more surprised when i tell thee that there seems to be a coalition going forward between the black angels and the white ones for here has hers induced her in one hour and by one retrograde accident to acknowledge what the charming creature never before acknowledged a preferable favour for me she even avows an intention to be mine mine without reformationconditions she permits me to talk of love to her of the irrevocable ceremony yet another extraordinary postpones that ceremony chooses to set out for london and even to go to the widows in town well but how comes all this about methinks thou askest thou lovelace dealest in wonders yet aimest not at the marvellous how did all this come about i will tell thee i was in danger of losing my charmer for ever she was soaring upward to her native skies she was got above earth by means too of the earthborn and something extraordinary was to be done to keep her with us sublunaries and what so effectually as the soothing voice of love and the attracting offer of matrimony from a man not hated can fix the attention of the maiden heart aching with uncertainty and before impatient of the questionable question this in short was the case while she was refusing all manner of obligation to me keeping me at haughty distance in hopes that her cousin mordens arrival would soon fix her in a full and absolute independence of me disgusted likewise at her adorer for holding himself the reins of his own passions instead of giving them up to her controul she writes a letter urging an answer to a letter before sent for her apparel her jewels and some gold which she had left behind her all which was to save her pride from obligation and to promote the independence her heart was set upon and what followed but a shocking answer made still more shocking by the communication of a fathers curse upon a daughter deserving only blessings a curse upon the cursers heart and a double one upon the transmitters the spiteful the envious arabella absent when it came on my return i found her recovering from fits again to fall into stronger fits and nobody expecting her life half a dozen messengers dispatched to find me out nor wonder at her being so affected she whose filial piety gave her dreadful faith in a fathers curses and the curse of this gloomy tyrant extending to use her own words when she could speak to both worlds o that it had turned in the moment of its utterance to a mortal quinsy and sticking in his gullet had choked the old execrator as a warning to all such unnatural fathers what a miscreant had i been not to have endeavoured to bring her back by all the endearments by all the vows by all the offers that i could make her i did bring her back more than a father to her for i have given her a life her unnatural father had wellnigh taken away shall i not cherish the fruits of my own benefaction i was earnest in my vows to marry and my ardour to urge the present time was a real ardour but extreme dejection with a mingled delicacy that in her dying moments i doubt not she will preserve have caused her to refuse me the time though not the solemnity for she has told me that now she must be wholly in my protection being destitute of every other more indebted still thy friend as thou seest to her cruel relations than to herself for her favour she has written to miss howe an account of their barbarity but has not acquainted her how very ill she was low very low she remains yet dreading her stupid brothers enterprise she wants to be in london where but for this accident and wouldst thou have believed it for my persuasions seeing her so very ill she would have been this night and we shall actually set out on wednesday morning if she be not worse and now for a few words with thee on the heavy preachment of saturday last thou art apprehensive that the lady is now truly in danger and it is a miracle thou tellest me if she withstand such an attempter knowing what we know of the sex thou sayest thou shouldst dread wert thou me to make further trial lest thou shouldst succeed and in another place tellest me that thou pleadest not for the state for any favour thou hast for it what an advocate art thou for matrimony thou wert ever an unhappy fellow at argument does the trite stuff with which the rest of thy letter abounds in favour of wedlock strike with the force that this which i have transcribed does against it thou takest great pains to convince me and that from the distresses the lady is reduced to chiefly by her friends persecutions and implacableness i hope thou wilt own and not from me as yet that the proposed trial will not be a fair trial but let me ask thee is not calamity the test of virtue and wouldst thou not have me value this charming creature upon proof of her merits do i not intend to reward her by marriage if she stand that proof but why repeat i what i have said before turn back thou egregious arguer turn back to my long letter of the th and thou wilt there find every syllable of what thou hast written either answered or invalidated see letter xviii of this volume but i am not angry with thee jack i love opposition as gold is tried by fire and virtue by temptation so is sterling wit by opposition have i not before thou settest out as an advocate for my fairone often brought thee in as making objections to my proceedings for no other reason than to exalt myself by proving thee a man of straw as homer raises up many of his champions and gives them terrible names only to have them knocked on the head by his heroes however take to thee this one piece of advice evermore be sure of being in the right when thou presumest to sit down to correct thy master and another if thou wilt never offer to invalidate the force which a virtuous education ought to have in the sex by endeavouring to find excuses for their frailty from the frailty of ours for are we not devils to each other they tempt us we tempt them because we men cannot resist temptation is that a reason that women ought not when the whole of their education is caution and warning against our attempts do not their grandmothers give them one easy rule men are to ask women are to deny well but to return to my principal subject let me observe that be my future resolutions what they will as to this lady the contents of the violent letter she has received have set me at least a month forward with her i can now as i hinted talk of love and marriage without controul or restriction her injunctions no more my terror in this sweetly familiar way shall we set out together for london mrs sorlingss eldest daughter at my motion is to attend her in the chaise while i ride by way of escort for she is extremely apprehensive of the singleton plot and has engaged me to be all patience if any thing should happen on the road but nothing i am sure will happen for by a letter received just now from joseph i understand that james harlowe has already laid aside his stupid project and this by the earnest desire of all those of his friends to whom he had communicated it who were afraid of the consequences that might attend it but it is not over with me however although i am not determined at present as to the uses i may make of it my beloved tells me she shall have her clothes sent her she hopes also her jewels and some gold which she left behind her but joseph says clothes only will be sent i will not however tell her that on the contrary i say there is no doubt but they will send all she wrote for the greater her disappointment from them the greater must be her dependence on me but after all i hope i shall be enabled to be honest to a merit so transcendent the devil take thee though for thy opinion given so malapropos that she may be overcome if thou designest to be honest methinkst thou sayest why should not singletons plot be over with thee as it is with her brother because if i must answer thee where people are so modestly doubtful of what they are able to do it is good to leave a loophole and let me add that when a mans heart is set upon a point and any thing occurs to beat him off he will find it very difficult when the suspending reason ceases to forbear resuming it letter lxi mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday april all hands at work in preparation for london what makes my heart beat so strong why rises it to my throat in such halfchoking flutters when i think of what this removal may do for me i am hitherto resolved to be honest and that increases my wonder at these involuntary commotions tis a plotting villain of a heart it ever was and ever will be i doubt such a joy when any roguery is going forward i so little its master a head likewise so well turned to answer the triangular varlets impulses no matter i will have one struggle with thee old friend and if i cannot overcome thee now i never will again attempt to conquer thee the dear creature continues extremely low and dejected tender blossom how unfit to contend with the rude and ruffling winds of passion and haughty and insolent control never till now from under the wing it is not enough to say of indulging but of admiring parents the mothers bosom only fit to receive this charming flower this was the reflection that with mingled compassion and augmented love arose to my mind when i beheld the charmer reposing her lovely face upon the bosom of the widow sorlings from a recovered fit as i entered soon after she had received her execrable sisters letter how lovely in her tears and as i entered her uplifted face significantly bespeaking my protection as i thought and can i be a villain to such an angel i hope not but why belford why once more puttest thou me in mind that she may be overcome and why is her own reliance on my honour so late and so reluctantly shown but after all so low so dejected continues she to be that i am terribly afraid i shall have a vapourish wife if i do marry i should then be doubly undone not that i shall be much at home with her perhaps after the first fortnight or so but when a man has been ranging like the painful bee from flower to flower perhaps for a month together and the thoughts of home and a wife begin to have their charms with him to be received by a niobe who like a wounded vine weeps her vitals away while she but involuntary curls about him how shall i be able to bear that may heaven restore my charmer to health and spirits i hourly pray that a man may see whether she can love any body but her father and mother in their power i am confident it will be at any time to make her husband joyless and that as i hate them so heartily is a shocking thing to reflect upon something more than woman an angel in some things but a baby in others so fathersick so familyfond what a poor chance stands a husband with such a wife unless forsooth they vouchsafe to be reconciled to her and continue reconciled it is infinitely better for her and for me that we should not marry what a delightful manner of life o that i could persuade her to it would the life of honour be with such a woman the fears the inquietudes the uneasy days the restless nights all arising from doubts of having disobliged me every absence dreaded to be an absence for ever and then how amply rewarded and rewarding by the rapture causing return such a passion as this keeps love in a continual fervour makes it all alive the happy pair instead of sitting dozing and nodding at each other in opposite chimneycorners in a winter evening and over a wintry love always new to each other and having always something to say thou knowest in my verses to my stella my mind on this occasion i will lay those verses in her way as if undesignedly when we are together at the widows that is to say if we do not soon go to church by consent she will thence see what my notions are of wedlock if she receives them with any sort of temper that will be a foundation and let me alone to build upon it many a girl has been carried who never would have been attempted had she showed a proper resentment when her ears or her eyes were first invaded i have tried a young creature by a bad book a light quotation or an indecent picture and if she has borne that or only blushed and not been angry and more especially if she has leered and smiled that girl have i and old satan put down for our own o how i could warn these little rogues if i would perhaps envy more than virtue will put me upon setting up beacons for them when i grow old and joyless tuesday afternoon if you are in london when i get thither you will see me soon my charmer is a little better than she was her eyes show it and her harmonious voice hardly audible last time i saw her now begins to cheer my heart once more but yet she has no love no sensibility there is no addressing her with those meaning yet innocent freedoms innocent at first setting out they may be called which soften others of her sex the more strange this as she now acknowledges preferable favour for me and is highly susceptible of grief grief mollifies and enervates the grieved mind looks round it silently implores consolation and loves the soother grief is ever an inmate with joy though they wont show themselves at the same window at one time yet they have the whole house in common between them letter lxii mr lovelace to john belford esq wedn april at last my lucky star has directed us into the desired port and we are safely landed well says rowe the wise and active conquer difficulties by daring to attempt them sloth and folly shiver and shrink at sight of toil and hazard and make th impossibility they fear but in the midst of my exultation something i know not what to call it checks my joys and glooms over my brighter prospects if it be not conscience it is wondrously like what i thought so many many years ago surely lovelace methinks thou sayest thy good motions are not gone off already surely thou wilt not now at last be a villain to this lady i cant tell what to say to it why would not the dear creature accept of me when i so sincerely offered myself to her acceptance things already appear with a very different face now i have got her here already have our mother and her daughters been about me charming lady what a complexion what eyes what majesty in her person o mr lovelace you are a happy man you owe us such a lady then they remind me of my revenge and of my hatred to her whole family sally was so struck with her at first sight that she broke out to me in these lines of dryden fairer to be seen than the fair lily on the flowry green more fresh than may herself in blossoms new i sent to thy lodgings within half an hour after our arrival to receive thy congratulation upon it but thou wert at edgeware it seems my beloved who is charmingly amended is retired to her constant employment writing i must content myself with the same amusement till she shall be pleased to admit me to her presence for already have i given to every one her cue and among the rest who dost thou think is to be her maid servant deb butler ah lovelace and ah belford it cant be otherwise but what dost think debs name is to be why dorcas dorcas wykes and wont it be admirable if either through fear fright or good liking we can get my beloved to accept of dorcas wykes for a bedfellow in so many ways will it be now in my power to have the dear creature that i shall not know which of them to choose but here comes the widow with dorcas wykes in her hand and i am to introduce them both to my fairone so the honest girl is accepted of good parentage but through a neglected education plaguy illiterate she can neither write nor read writing a kinswoman of mrs sinclair could not therefore well be refused the widow in person recommending her and the wench only taken till her hannah can come what an advantage has an imposing or forward nature over a courteous one so here may something arise to lead into correspondencies and so forth to be sure a person need not be so wary so cautious of what she writes or what she leaves upon her table or toilette when her attendant cannot read it would be a miracle as thou sayest if this lady can save herself and having gone so far how can i recede then my revenge upon the harlowes to have run away with a daughter of theirs to make her a lovelace to make her one of a family so superior to her own what a triumph as i have heretofore observed to them but to run away with her and to bring her to my lure in the other light what a mortification of their pride what a gratification of my own then these women are continually at me these women who before my whole soul and faculties were absorbed in the love of this single charmer used always to oblige me with the flower and first fruits of their garden indeed indeed my goddess should not have chosen this london widows but i dare say if i had she would not people who will be dealing in contradiction ought to pay for it and to be punished by the consequences of our own choice what a moral lies there what a deal of good may i not be the occasion of from a little evil dorcas is a neat creature both in person and dress her continuance not vulgar and i am in hopes as i hinted above that her lady will accept of her for her bedfellow in a strange house for a week or so but i saw she had a dislike to her at her very first appearance yet i thought the girl behaved very modestly overdid it a little perhaps her ladyship shrunk back and looked shy upon her the doctrine of sympathies and antipathies is a surprising doctrine but dorcas will be excessively obliging and win her ladys favour soon i doubt not i am secure in one of the wenchs qualities however she is not to be corrupted a great point that since a lady and her maid when heartily of one party will be too hard for half a score devils the dear creature was no less shy when the widow first accosted her at her alighting yet i thought that honest dolemans letter had prepared her for her masculine appearance and now i mention that letter why dost thou not wish me joy jack joy of what why joy of my nuptials know then that said is done with me when i have a mind to have it so and that we are actually man and wife only that consummation has not passed bound down to the contrary of that by a solemn vow till a reconciliation with her family take place the women here are told so they know it before my beloved knows it and that thou wilt say is odd but how shall i do to make my fairone keep her temper on the intimation why is she not here at mrs sinclairs but if she will hear reason i doubt not to convince her that she ought to acquiesce she will insist i suppose upon my leaving her and that i shall not take up my lodgings under the same roof but circumstances are changed since i first made her that promise i have taken all the vacant apartments and must carry this point also i hope in a while to get her with me to the public entertainments she knows nothing of the town and has seen less of its diversions than ever woman of her taste her fortune her endowments did see she has indeed a natural politeness which transcends all acquirement the most capable of any one i ever knew of judging what an hundred things are by seeing one of a like nature indeed she took so much pleasure in her own chosen amusements till persecuted out of them that she had neither leisure nor inclination for the town diversions these diversions will amuse and the deuce is in it if a little susceptibility will not put forth now she receives my address especially if i can manage it so as to be allowed to live under one roof with her what though the sensibility be at first faint and reluctant like the appearance of an early springflower in frosty winter which seems afraid of being nipt by an easterly blast that will be enough for me i hinted to thee in a former that i had provided books for the ladys indoor amusement sally and polly are readers my beloveds light closet was their library and several pieces of devotion have been put in bought on purpose at secondhand see letter xxxix of this volume i was always for forming a judgment of the reading part of the sex by their books the observations i have made on this occasion have been of great use to me as well in england as out of it the sagacious lady may possibly be as curious in this point as her lovelace so much for the present thou seest that i have a great deal of business before me yet i will write again soon mr lovelace sends another letter with this in which he takes notice of young miss sorlingss setting out with them and leaving them at barnet but as its contents are nearly the same with those in the ladys next letter it is omitted end of vol
