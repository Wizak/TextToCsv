 willy gorkys coming was announced the institute for temporal research had two hours to prepare the atmosphere as svetz arrived was lowintensity frantic hum of techspeak hum of power three techs swearing quietly over yellow lights on a display some looked up from the guide pit as he and wrona passed nobody particularly wanted to talk to hanville svetz but wrona was still a curiosity the director saw svetz in a corner quietly eating a bowl of dole yeast he said get the dog out svetz nodded and stood he rubbed wrona between her ears home he told her and turned back toward the door she laughed with her tongue lolling home my ass ra chen bellowed i need you here make a decision boss ra chen took two seconds to think wilt and hillary both got along with wrona but svetz could see both techs on duty in the pit they couldnt take her the zoo dogs fought with her the dog stays good idea anyway well have something to show gorky yes sir why are we showing off for willy gorky ra chen looked toward the guide pit it looked impressive and busy he said waldemar the tenth liked extinct animals waldemar the eleventh likes planets and stars they say and hes not a mental deficient svetz flinched nobody would have dared to use that term when waldemar the tenth was secretarygeneral a whisper of wind from outside limousines setting down in the drive the institute for temporal research has been transferred from bureau of history to bureau of the sky domainsthats the new title for space bureau willy gorkys the director hes our new boss are you ready for that svetz smiled sourly time will tell four space bureau guards flitted through the center examining everything one of them appeared ready to shoot wrona as svetz stepped in front of her he found ra chen and zeera at his elbows the guard listened to svetzs assurances but he was looking at wrona wrona looked back on command she sat then lay down snout on paws tie her up the bodyguard said and turned away we will do no such thing ra chen said the guard froze then kept moving discussion must have taken place outside willy gorky entered with three more of his entourage he was svetzs height centimeters shorter than ra chen but thick through the torso arms and legs he was half again svetzs weight ra chen a pleasure to see you again lovely pond he said he meant the rectangular pool outside ra chen said its not an extravagance when were pulling an xcage home we need somewhere to dump the heat otherwise expensive parts melt svetes impression was that gorky barely heard him he bestowed a wonderful smile on one and all and shook their hands svet felt bonebreaking strength held dormant wrona offered her paw gorky didnt notice he was looking into the guide pit the guide pit was inside a kneehigh wooden wall symbol rather than barrier there was room for five to sit and work the instruments that guided extension cages into the past from here the institute could run both xcages at once though that was rare gorky must have heard descriptions it was the heart of the institute and now it was his two men with him wore tech uniforms white coats lined with a score of bulging pockets scanner sets on their heads the woman wore something else a loose onepiece brilliantly patterned and covered with zipped pockets she was an inch shorter than svetz and slender topped with two centimeters of ashblond fuzz she came straight to svetz or maybe to wrona none of bureau of the sky domains seemed to know how to treat wrona theyd never seen a dog im miya thorsven she said smiling at them both hanville svetz pleased to meet you youre an astronaut yes and your companion is a visitor from the past somebody elses past wronas people evolved from wolves the xcages sometimes veer sideways in time when theyre coming home its a quantum mechanical thing svetz said as if he understood it why does she look so much like dog youve been in the vivarium not yet theres a web site that has holograms miya looked wistful tour achievements are wonderful svetz had captured most of the vivariums animals he preened she asked again dog dogs never went extinct theyre contemporary if you think of a dog as a wolf thats been civilized then intelligent beings civilize each other intelligent wolves must have done that too miya nodded happily and svetz thought how strange it was to be lecturing an astronaut on nonhuman intelligence he asked have you met aliens no she said how far have you been mars only mars space bureau techs were examining the center and talking to the institute techs on duty the itr techs were reluctant to answer they looked to ra chen ra chen and willy gorky ignored them all they were both hand wavers svetz saw ra chens arms sweep around him to include the entire center gorky stopped talking then so did miya thorsven she looked to her boss and her worry mirrored his gorky spoke briefly gathered his entourage and left the centers personnel gathered around ra chen good news and bad he said the center really could be shut down gorky wants to save us he says ra chen ignored the collective cynical sigh his ass is on the line too he wants to talk hell bring a man ill bring a man you svetz dont bring wrona zeera can you keep things going here zeera southworth scratched wrona behind the ears you and me she told the dog chapter i always knew that i would see the first man on the moon i never dreamed that i would see the last dr jerry pournelle waldemar the fourth had liked flowers green resources bureau had saved him a few for the garden path that led to the world globe chair gorky walked with miya thorsven a few meters ahead of ra chen and svetz their voices were relaxed tones too low to make out six kinds of orchids lived on vertical slabs of plant nutrient labels floated beside them and followed where the wind moved the flowers holograms projected into a visitors eyes the roses werent doing well but mutations made for marvelous variety broccoli brussels sprouts artichoke virtual labels said that some had considered these plants edible svetz thorsven and gorky had reached the world dome but svetz delayed hed never had a chance to linger here boss do you want to convey your sense of urgency to chair gorky tour point you told me once never negotiate under a deadline were the masters of time ra chens head jerked once yes what are you looking at svetz was watching minuscule motion on a leaf caterpillar the virtual label said it had too many legs to count svetz watched it bend double to cross from one side of a tattered leaf to the other the world globe was new waldemar the tenths last construction project the whole earth was projected onto the interior of a globe updated every few minutes with data from myriads of weather satellites a walk with no railings led through the globe it was large enough that svetz couldnt tell its size miya thorsven and willy gorky walked ahead of them miya glanced back point out something interesting ra chen said or else get moving its like looking at the earth from inside isnt it boss have you spent a lot of time in the garden and the globe never took enough advantage of the perks this could be our last chance it could couldnt it miya dropped back and engaged svetz in conversation ra chen took it as a hint and caught up with gorky oddly lit by the white glare of ice caps above and below and a whorl of hurricane over the pacific the heads of space and time walked ahead of their aides they talked like old friends who hadnt mot in some time cordial and a little cautious svetz heard a little of that gorky speaking ive always been sure that the earth will need to be terraformed more nuclear power or orbiting solar power arrays too late willy those forms of power dont leave residues not even oxides of nitrogen and carbon you stop putting that stuff in the atmosphere people will stop breathing do it earlier time machine the world globe was big svetz looked down at antarctica and wondered how far he would fall the height didnt bother miya he suppressed a sigh when he and miya reached the far end the zoovivariumhad been a favorite place to waldemar the tenth fortyfirst secretarygeneral to the united nations of course it was supervised bureau of history cameras were hidden everywhere but any spy or media camera found here would carry a death penalty the heads would have privacy from all but their own people gorky noticed nothing but the dominance game he was playing with ra chen miyas eyes danced left right further back owl horse snake watched svetz pass svetz bowed snake nodded its regal brilliantly feathered head here a cage was torn open as if some monstrous bird had hatched from it two down was another its shredded roof bowed inward ostrich elephant horses head came up when miya walked past it glared at svetz along its fearsome spiral horn and svetz stepped away from miya thorsven without quite knowing why gorky asked have you done anything about replacing elephant he knew what the torn cages meant ra chen answered we had a pickup mission planned sir whats our budget like call me willy in public too asked ra chen please now i can keep us going for a year bureau of the sky domains and anything connected with space you can have anything you can convince me you need saving money wont help us keeping the time machine in repair that would be normal maintenance another elephant another ostrich well why elephant can wait ra chen agreed and svetz smiled he had not looked forward to trying to get another elephant into the big xcage my thought is extinct lifeforms can wait they arent going anywhere gorky said on a legitimate mission sure bring home anything you like we decide whats a legitimate mission ra chen said waldemar the ninth wanted videos of jack the ripper john f kennedy ted bundy who crime scenes executions we hadnt built the extension cages yet we mounted a vidcamera on the end of a boom and pushed it far enough into the past to record the nicole simpson murder gah we can record anything we have exact time and location for we got some famous riots then the machinery glitched up and we were offline for two years waldemar nine would have shut us down if he hadnt died first waldemar ten wanted animals waldemar the eleventh wants planets and stars they say ra chen waited for gorkys nod willy i dont know how a time machine can give you that i thought i did gorky turned the sudden force of his glare on svetz hanville svetz isnt it svetz none of this is to be spread around do you know what i mean by ftl svetz thought he did you need to go faster than light to reach any star while any one secgen is in power fasterthanlight is fiction fiction huh waldemar the tenth was like a bright child i said i could get us to the stars and he believed it ra chen those books you rescued from california saved our butts we used the science fiction as source material we mocked up computergenerated landscapes and cities from other worlds and aliens too he believed all of it but waldemar the eleventh wont our real power is pitiable ra chen could have dismantled the bureau of the sky domains if hed known that a year ago a time machine could fix that svetz saw all that in ka chens eyes and saw him shrug it off ra chen said beware of wishes granted willy i know a bright secgen who really wants stars i thought i could use the institute to get him that gorky said miya thorsven half whispered to svetz dominance games ive watched a lot of this svetz said director gorky swallowed up ra chens department would ra chen help him justify that svetz told her what he thought ra chen would want her to hear if ra chen couldnt protect what he had theres no point in asking for it back if gorky loses the secgen is likely to dismantle time and space and start over with relatives as his chairs gorky was saying we havent sent anything bigger than a bedsheet to the stars but weve had the planets for a long time hibernation and an ionfission drive took a crew of five to jupiter that technique would take us anywhere given time we could build another jupiter ship and fire it at fourfour if we had the time fourfour pegasi fourth moon of the fourth planet is as close as we can find to another earth for hundreds of lightyears only if s early earth reducing atmosphere weve never found an oxygen world so send a drone package to pegasi move back in time by as long as it takes a thousand years a billion gorky brushed aside their attempts to interrupt algae in the atmosphere starts the terraforming process add higher lifeforms before anything competitive can evolve now launch a manned ship a hundred years to pegasi we can manage that we find earths twin waiting for us drop a hundred and eight years into the past phone home the laser takes eight years to reach earth from fourfour it gets there a month after the ship leaves or a week ra chen i take it that wont work ra chen was openly laughing id be all day telling you whats wrong with that willy did you ever think of asking i thought youd wind up owning me if i asked favors from the institute for temporal research gorky said svetz thought he was probably right but ra chen chortled you see it svetz he thought the extension cages were the time machines ah svetz told gorky no sir the time machine is under the center the whole center is just the top like a lid on a jar with a twisty foldedover quark accelerator underneath the xcage is only the part that moves gorky asked whats its mass svetz didnt know three million eight hundred thousand tons ra chen said with some satisfaction under waldemar eight and nine we built it all as a laboratory after we got it working we built over it to make the center how much could you shrink it unlimited budget were only talking now how much mass can you put into orbit willy with the new heavy lifters four thousand tonnes each flight forget that ra chen said youve been running a gigantic hoax svetz said he missed gorkys fury and ra chens disapproval while he chewed new data what have you got willy sir what have you really got cities on the moon mars asteroids moon and mars miya said mars is just twenty people luna city is two thousand i think but buried not much to see the glass domes we showed waldemar ten came out of a computer anything on the asteroids some automated mining projects that broke down one day well get it right miya said mine the asteroids for metal put all the factories in orbit svetz waved it off heavy lifter gorky said were building it were building four i could ask for forty now but id have to justify the expense eventually will the secretarygeneral wait gorkys jaw set hard hell wait for divine image a year at least do you know what a von neumann device is both men shook their heads miya thorsven lit up its a machine no bigger than your two hands that makes more of itself its called michelangelo i worked on the divine image project michelangelo mines the moon and makes more michelangelos and piles the slag along the earth twilight rim the numbers double over and over in a year and a bit well have trillions of michelangelos theyre carving the near face of the moon into an image of waldemar the eleventh svetz gaped gorky murmured resculpted from waldemar tenth of course ra chen said ambitious if youre processing that much moon you could bake oxygen out of the slag too youd wind up with an atmosphere gorky laughed and clapped a big hand on ra chens shoulder hard right right doubling rate week and a bit but you get all your action near the end dont you for this next year theres nothing to be seen from anywhere on earth just videos of any number of your little mining things crawling over moon rock yes he bought it he did miya was looking at gorky in shocked disappointment gorky said im sorry miya after you came back to earth some of the michelangelos were chewing rock in the wrong places others got blocked up or made junk or just quit well keep fiddling he turned back to ra chen but a year from now well have to show the little buggers operating or else have something to show him or else id better retire to the moon thats real theres been a city in clavius crater since before there were waldemars six hundred years svetz said moon and mars anything else rovers weve got toy boxes crawling over every planet and moon in the solar system hundreds of asteroids and scores of comets taking pictures and samples weve sent forward probes past more than forty stars with more on the way svetz but the forward devices are just silver blankets made of computer elements and launched by light pressure enough laser power to cremate a city in ten minutes gorky said watching to see if ra chen would flinch firing for ten weeks the lasers theyre on the moon yes so youve got the moon and everything else is smoke and mirrors theres mars base one twenty men and women and some vr sets to control a thousand rovers pilgrim model i built it on the equator i was hoping we could experiment with advanced lifting systems orbital towers maybe a pinwheel we never got that far too expensive even life support for cosmonauts is too expensive ra chen said but now youve got a time machine and if i cant use the institute ill have to break you up and sell the parts for what i can get ra chen didnt seem surprised youd get nothing but scrap prices how much do you spend just keeping the center going id save that much it wouldnt save either of us of course chapter on the other side of its glass wall fifty feet of shortlegged lizard half uncoiled lifted its head high above them and spat fire along the glass gorky and ra chen didnt appear to notice miya stared up at the beast in awe and wonder we should change the label on this svetz said now that waldemar the tenth is dead isnt it a gila monster no i found him in another picture book after i caught him dragon you caught she cut herself off because gorky was speaking you can change the past thats scary stuff willy weve done that once or twice by accident ra chen said anyway what would you change right after the first use of a thermonuclear bomb there were experiments with thermonuclear rocket motors in north america sector weve got nuke rockets now we could leave designs on some lab table in the industrial age for the locals to copy why bother like you said youve got them already but they had the wealth ra chen if theyd had nuke rockets then they could have built an orbital solar power system for what they spent on cosmetics with ten years to work and for no more than the price of perfumes and lip goo and stuff to shape their hair into topiary theyd have had free power from the sky and a fleet of spacecraft left over at the end now were living too close to the edge too much farmland turned to dust and blew into the sea over the centuries too little sunlight gets down to us through the industrial goo today that same price would buy about ten million lives people starve or they freeze in the dark when bureaus divert power from the cities we lose thousands of lives when we launch a forward probe and those are cheap the industrial age then was when we should have moved they put twelve men on the moon and then went home for four hundred years i know considerable about the industrial age said ra chen ive been in it hundreds of millions of people with thousands of insanely different lifestyles all of em eleven hundred years dead youd have to get that kind of a mob moving all in one direction to persuade them to put a permanent base on the moon instead of using perfume and lip goo and soap and sunblock which isnt just a cosmetic are you really that persuasive willy go ahead persuade me but tell me this first if you did change the past how would you get the credit the secgens memory would change too youd have nothing to show but a huge bill for electricity you thought of it too ra chen barked laughter everyone thinks of changing the past if it werent for temporal inertia wed have exterminated ourselves once already remember svetz and maybe other times he never told me about miya was gaping and svetz grinned at her gorky must know the story already if he knew about the torn cages ra chen said willy eleven hundred years ago you had thousands of ancestors what if you do something to separate any two of them at the wrong time you might edit yourself out or edit me out and find yourself stranded in the past gorky said nothing the new secretarygeneral wants the solar system you know it could be worse any slip you make anywhere in the past you could wind up with no time machine and a secgen who collects torture devices all right gorky said no changes they walked in silence for a bit everything interesting happened eleven hundred years ago willy gorky said industry exploded across the world human numbers went into the billions highways and railroads and airlines webbed the planet all the feeble lifeforms went extinct but ideas boiled there was every kind of scheme for the conquest of space antimatter rocket engines antigravity solar sails hundreds of tether designs the forward probes orion spacecraft and a thousand things that didnt work but arent genetically impossible ra chen mused lost secrets why not the space elevator that notion came from a country that was still medieval space elev you know what id like to do with mars use the planet as a test bed terraforming experiments of course build a space elevator too build all of the skyhook launch schemes all the ways of getting to orbit without rockets they all have that much in common theyre all dangerous huge potential energies involved you could build them all cheaper in miniature because mars has low mass and a high spin try them on mars where they cant hurt anyone the industrial age is over the world isnt rich anymore and we cant afford to experiment but what have we forgotten what miracles could we find by raiding old libraries if you search through two thousand years of the past youre bound to find something finding it is the problem ra chen agreed i built the big xcage to raid the library of alexandria before julius caesar torched it it turns out that we cant reach back that far but we got to the beverly hills library in plussixtyeight atomic era we scooped it all up just before the quake and the wave why dont you set some of your people searching through those old books i will what about the pentagon or the kremlin they must have had interesting stuff secrets locked up hidden and guarded willy its a mistake to think of armed men as dead the albino whale in its huge tank turned sideways to focus one tiny eye on svetz whale looked better than he had after the capture the broken harpoons were gone scars starting to heal gorky rubbed his eyes im just getting used to thinking in terms of time were still just talking right r aliens i promised aliens to waldemar ten waldemar eleven expects them too can your time machines find weirder animals than this amazing beast ra chen said whales eye turned to look at him we could have billed it as alien from europa maybe willy is there a chance at real aliens we havent found life anywhere mars long ago theres fossil bacteria in martian rocks dating from half a billion years ago its very primitive stuff ra chen mars had seas and a reasonable atmosphere for less than a billion years and maybe what we found evolved then or maybe it all evolved on earth and got to mars embedded in a meteor not an alien at all mars had life later than that miya said they turned toward her svetz caught gorkys indulgent smile miya didnt there was life on mars there was civilization we have sketches made from telescope observations and descriptions from old astronomers schiaparelli and lowell and burroughs hundreds saw channels running across mars too straight to be anything but artificial and it all disappeared over the next sixty years before the first probes reached mars the probes found river valleys but they were dry craters everywhere almost no atmosphere nothing left of the water system nothing left of the water high cirrus and frost at the poles willy gorky told her gently a lot of these discoveries were made through the lowell telescope in arizona have you ever looked through a telescope at mars miya shook her head ive never looked through a telescope most astronomers dont miya dear lowells telescope didnt have camera attachments eyeballs everything was a blur that was the period when they decided mercury was like the moon one face always to the sun they were drawing one face of the planet onto the other and didnt notice those canals he was talking to the back of her head now tired eyes want to connect the dots weve never found anything on mars watching her defeated expression svetz asked what if shes right willy gorky laughed out loud svetz what do you know about other planets miya you dug in those old river valleys what did you find microscopic traces that might have been bacteria nothing else no nothing miya admitted her cheeks flamed her grip on svetzs hand felt like desperation but we havent searched the thousandth part of mars svetz said weve found some amazing surprises in the past miya did this all disappear just as we were going into the industrial age thats right svetz threw up his hands if only we had a time machine chapter singleminded as a spider lowell built his own observatory to map them and spun a whole theory from the web of lines that he created william k hartmann mars underground it should have been just that simple i want to see martian civilization at its height willy gorky told them no futz we could get pictures like that from a computer ra chen show me video of martians holding a funeral then ill send a team there to dig up the tomb in present time k youre right miya if theres a civilization but if you could find anything alive anything alien would get the secgen off our backs for a long time svetz a martian tool would do or an animal weve brought back soil samples from every large body in the solar system to the left of the armory door was a cluster of chairs and little tables and a drink and dole yeast dispenser svetz sipped coffee and waited but ra chen had developed the habit of letting svetz deliver bad news so be it svetz told willy gorky we cant move an extension cage to mars the reach isnt there theres no way to match velocities either willy said we can use rovers and orbiters where can you put an extension cage anywhere on earth ra chen said northern hemisphere and some of the southern beyond that the earths mass orbit havent tried we build the cages like spacecraft though its all space bureau hardware theyll stand up to vacuum whale fitted into the big xcage didnt he we can fit a module in there but not a launcher yes miya ra chen didnt i see antigravity beamers on the xcage yes range how heavy is your probe module pilgrims mass one hundred fifty tonnes rocket and all twentytwo meters long twelve meters diameter i can assemble them in three months if you want them thats tiny compared to whale gorky nodded ill work out how many modules we want well push the small xcage back to before the lowell observations willy will you settle for ae seventeen hundred years ago around five hundred years before lowell middle ages why its when svetz picked up snake before the american continents got into the history books nobody local will bother us if we operate over the open pacific the time machine wouldnt have to be reset that saves us a week and funding too willy you build your pilgrims right theyll just sit on mars with their cameras running right through the lowell and mariner periods all right the large xcage homes on the small one good once youre in orbit youre halfway to anywhere organization was a skill svetz had never tried to learn it wasnt enough that things happen they must happen in the proper order rocket motors must appear before a hull could be closed fuel couldnt just sit in a tank compressors must be ready to produce it at the right time why was timing so difficult for the institute for temporal research svetz sat in on endless discussions now heres the tricky part ra chen told willy gorky we launch the first load then pull the big cage back empty we load your next module inside and we can take our sweet time doing it days weeks a year if theres a budget cut then we send it back to miya and svetz in the moment following the first launch launch again the same way or send it back to ten hours later give them a sleep break you can do that ra chen smiled a fat ruddy smile time travel is wonderful isnt it three months stretched to four and wouldnt stretch further because the secretarygenerals annoyance was becoming overt and one morning they were ready chapter the new extension cage was transparent nearly to invisibility it was no smaller than the old extension cage which had once held svetz and an angry horse but svetz and miya were nestled in the bottom of a spherical shell and that might have felt cramped cozy miya said why isnt one of us in the control chair svetz smiled youll see when we get moving she nudged svetzs bag with her foot what did you bring food medical and the trade kit you he waved at the upper curve where bubble helmets and the pelts of two rubber men were splayed out on stickstrips i havent trained with pressure suits if we have to go eva ill take you through it slow and thorough trust me they lay foottohead waiting while the center milled around them svetz had become very comfortable with miya her head was pillowed on his foot he felt his own long wispy hair brushing her ankle hed considered suggesting greater intimacy butas often in his lifehe was afraid of losing what he had through the open hatch he heard a murmur of techs and hum of the motors and gorky there never were canals on mars miyas always been a bit flaky about canals ra chen willy you should have done this years ago pick up some martians and youll never have a problem with the secgen again youd have martians voting your ticket in the un futz youd want to know what they knew about terraforming too mars wasnt supposed to stay habitable that long was it gorky we should look at saturns rings too theyre recent ka chen how recent gorky a few hundred thousand years never mind this is already costing too much antigravity pfah ka chen antigravity beamers came from space bureau dont you always launch by antigravity gorky oh no it costs four hundred a kilogram to launch with rockets it costs a thousand to lift the same kilogram with untigrav when svetz lifted whale into the big extension cage that must have killed around three thousand people ra chen you said that before killed how willy gorky lights brown out in an operating theater food half spoils but someone eats it anyway somebody cant afford to repair his floater but he has to get to work a construction company buys cli caper supporting girders for a new arcology the money runs out on building a nuclear fission plant but the power has to come from somewhere so they burn coal soot winds up in a hundred million lungs and theres more rads in it than theyd get from the fission plant when wealth goes down the death rate goes up even if you dont have a unique corpse to identify poverty kills most politicians have no idea what things cost its a united nations tradition but waldemar eleven hes very aware of that when a bureau diverts power and resources people die what he really wants even more than that futzed portrait whats in the trade kit miya asked svetz svetz withdrew his attention from the talking heads it turns heavy metals to gold its easier to carry than gold look you just enclose something in this superconducting net part and seal it whats making you so twitchy svetz tried to relax tried to look relaxed i cant see why all this took four months you know you can wait two years for a trip to mars earth and mars have to be placed right and they dont move at your convenience if you miss your window you wait svetz said the last trip i made they pulled me out of bed at just past midnight by live i was on my way waldemar the tenth wanted a spotted owl he wanted it now did he get it miya if the industrial age lists it as a protected species we cant find it unless its a bison or a passenger pigeon i was lucky to find any owl it was somebodys pet and she had some spooky weapons really high tech someone from our future i think id love to think we have a future the paleskinned tech named zat forsman lowered the big curved door and sealed them in svetz said so we spraypainted spots on the owl everything went blurry there was a flow of colors and textures but no detail came through the glass miya started to ask a question then trailed off as gravity changed they floated at the center of the sphere if you were in the chair youd be hanging head down svetz said its reversed when youre coming home how long before we stop mmm two hours you were at the briefing miya asked who were the first human beings to have sex while traveling in time nobody i think no wait there havent been any mixed couples nobody great her hands moved into his clothing svetz had never had an offer that straightforward he asked were going for a record hanny dear captain thale and i werent the first in free fall by a thousand years they hung their clothing on the inverted chair internal gravity pulled them together and held them miya fitted them together as if shed done this before and that left them at right angles in midair hip to hip and laughing like loons chapter that was different isnt this just like free fall in free fall you just float oh are we being recorded hadnt thought of it we can ask said svetz the four months wait hadnt been wasted hightech devices from space bureau had been adapted for the extension cages they had a voice link now but no video svetz pulled himself up lo the control board opened the talker and said svetz here in transit nothing to report testing he heard willy gorkys voice good sir are you videorecording us video and medical but well get the data later the talker only carries audio you have to tell us everything excellent miya caroled and switched off so youve got your record look at me svetz looked four months and you never touched me sure i touched you never this never anything zeera keeps her distance from other men so i wondered but she doesnt brush up against you either i wondered if you had something esoteric going with wrona hey what kept you hanny you could have had me in a bed abed oo think of all the practice we missed we did pretty well they were floating apart svetz said grab something and grabbed at the chair miya grabbed svetz and then they were sliding down the glass curve of the cage in roaring darkness sudden sputtering light illuminated a wilderness of whirling cloud svetz crawled up into the chair and jabbed the talker were here he told listeners in the far future nothing to see were in a hurricane typhoon whatever willy gorky said that was quick svetz heard strangled laughter and rapid explanations he saw miyas lifted eyebrow and said far as theyre concerned we just left im taking us up now they couldnt feel the cage lifting texture in the darkness streamed past them then the moon blazed above a mountain of cloud lightning flickering within the storm dropped away the sun flashed over a horizon now curved miya said wow eight hundred klicks and no problems thousand twelve hundred svetz said dont look at the sun miya know that the earth was a blazing crescent fifteen hundred klicks how high do you want me ra chens voice are they high enough gorky no can you get at least to geosynchronous thats klicks svetz ill try he waited watching the altimeter minutes passed im at stop here ra chen just because you can get higher doesnt mean the bigxcage can svetz stop there were sending the large extension cage a great glass sphere hovered beside them in the instant ra chen finished speaking miya flinched then said what took so long its here svetz told his listeners the first probe module nestled inside the big transparent shell he taptapped and the shell opened like a flower look it over miya its the orbiter we want it in a poletopole orbit around mars she reached past him and activated the launch the probe lifted in seconds it was gone from sight but svetz could see the large extension cage shuddering the antigrav beamers turning to follow it were pulling the large xcage home ra chen said good said svetz and the great mass was gone miya broke a small dark brick and handed half to svetz ration bur she bit into her half she saw his distrust and said its dried dole yeast ive got twenty flavors here he bit not bad the link chimed gorkys voice miya were go for the next lad ready boss how did you never mind she said and laughed willy gorky laughed too quick enough for you took us three weeks to assemble the collector module and get it aboard shall we send it now or give you some nap time now she said and the large extension cage hovered beside them with the collector and fission rocket booster inside the collector was a lowbuilt tractor with a chemically fueled rocket in its belly mechanical arms and a pressure storage bin they launched it then took a break before launching the third and fourth miya kept up a running commentary the orbiter would go poletopole above mars and relay messages from pilgrim probes on the surface when the collector returned a cargo to orbit the orbiter would carry it back to archaic earth and a waiting xcage the third probe held twelve toysized pilgrims those would wander out in twelve directions from the martian equator their senses would watch and listen and taste the soil and the wind hanny im not getting enough thrust here the pilgrims mass too much i cant keep the large xcage ra chen pull it back we needthe large extension cage vanishedmore thrust her small fist whacked his shoulder svetz said talk to her boss miya ra chens voice well put the large cage through maintenance and send it right back the pilgrims will be gone in aoh here it is again she watched the great spheres antigravity beamers turn toward the third probecarrying the pilgrims now far beyond sightto boost it into course for mars i could get used to this the collector would need fuel for takeoff the fourth probe the tanker would land near the peak of mons olympus and use its nuclear power plant to convert martian atmosphere and six tonnes of liquid hydrogen into ninetysix tonnes of methane and liquid oxygen martians werent likely to bother it there why not life on marseven marsprobably evolved in water mons olympus pokes right out of the atmosphere okay hanny its on its way jump us earth and stars blurred like paint in water as the extension cage entered time gravity was outward away from the spheres center as they were pulled toward the present miya looked at him speculatively across the width of the extension cage svetz grinned no time he watched the inertial calendar for a few moments longer then pushed the interrupt well have longer going home yes yes my hopeful swain swain the hurricane was gone from fifteen hundred klicks altitude the earths broad crescent was otherwise unchanged miya took the controls the antenna pattern painted across the surface of the xcage shimmered as it called across three hundred and fifty million klicks to machines that had been crawling across mars for three long years thats done mars is about twenty minutes away at lightspeed forty minutes before we get a signal can you jump us no well have to wait fine were nowhere near that accurate miya we cant place a cage within a year unless its matching locus with another cage forty minutes later all svetz saw was the shimmer in the antennae and miyas hands moving miya called the center she got gorky chair we have message bursts from all four probes bring them home the probes are all waiting for new instructions miya well have to decide what to tell them first come home chapter the norse mythological world tree yggdrasil is an evergreen ash tree which overshadows the whole universe the ash tree from mattiols commentaires lyons the whole of the bureau of history and nearly as many from bureau of the sky domains were crowded into the viewing room there werent enough seats a crowd sat crosslegged ahead of the front row the orbiter view showed red mars strung with threads of graygreen six to eight klicks in width spectra showed lines of chlorophyll and water gorky protested theyre too narrow how could any optical telescope have seen that those old astronomers must have been going on nothing but intuition they got it right though miya said shall we call the secgen not yet willy gorky shifted to the refueling module the tanker they watched the mountains vast crater come up and past the tanker settled onto a wide ledge the fission plant trundled out on an array of skeletal wheels trailing cable and slopped eighty meters away gorky studied the readings full tanks now we know we can bring something home forsman replay that flash instruments on the tanker module had looked into the crater during descent a white flash washed out everything and then the audience saw a skeletal structure of metal tubes and mirrors occupying part of the central crater spidery strutwork supported curved mirror surfaces hundreds of meters across sculpture artificial anyway miya said youve got your aliens good boss do you see that a floating flat something moved into view distant enough to look tiny until gorky zoomed then an open flying vehicle with eight crew possibly manshaped moving around the upper deck pressure suits gorky said no wonder at this altitude but what holds it up lighterthanair craft dont fly without air they watched it glide over the crater rim i wonder if they saw the tanker come down ra chen asked we want to talk to them anyway dont we bring a few home ambassadors to the united nations kidnap we know what happened to mars anyone we can bring out is rescued can you rebuild a vivarium cage to house martians futz yes just fiddle with the programs its already set to make breathable atmosphere for preindustrial plants and animals excellent whats the opposite of genocide ra chen laughed nobodys ever needed one ra chen im wondering what wed find if i sent a team to mons olympus in present time is it an active volcano that could wipe out any traces willy dont do it knowing whats there today would restrict our options in the past what else have we got pilgrim one gave them a breathless run across ochre deserts at high speed a glimpse of something in flight more desert pilgrim two ochre sand a claustrophobic run through a sandstorm then more sand and a line of graygreen miyas breath caught ra chen slowed the view to real time alien greenery so flat that the lowbuilt pilgrim could look straight across six klicks width of drylooking vines a row of small triangular heads peeped out of the web of dustygreen fiber to watch the pilgrim pass infrared showed the heads as red dots wormblooded the plants showed spectra of chlorophyll and water if there was freerunning water it must run beneath the plants mars has had gigatons of water where did it all go miya wondered gorky said the orbiter only found a few small seas most of the water must be already in the canals one of the animals pulled free and charged the pilgrim body like a tenlegged weasel face like nightmare all teeth and hunger ill call willy gorky said to leave the viewing room must have been like pulling his own teeth and he surely heard ra chens chuckle but he hurried nobody else could be allowed to break this news to the secretarygeneral and the rest settled back to watch the show pilgrim two ran fastforward alongside the canal with tenlegged weasels biting at it then turned suddenly ra chen slowed twain to examine a slender arc of freestanding bridge ornately carved pilgrim two crossed watched impassively by an inhumanly tall and slender woman in a golden mask and rolled on into red desert ra chen began flashing from one pilgrim to another he was trying to pull too much data too fast pilgrim three rolled into thick ice at the south pole and froze up pilgrim four was approaching dwellings when creatures on riding beasts attacked and disabled it with swords ra chen froze the frame on dwellings like clusters of crystal pillars elegant and fragile and ancient then on the attackers weapons in three hands out of four bipedal green skin faces like overgrown insects two species unbelievable well have to ra chen trailed off no telling what might be needed at this point or what he would have for resources pilgrim seven was crossing a web of valleys running the record at high speed made everyone seasick ra chen had to stop up down up down valles marineris miya said it was bad enough when it wasnt choked with greenery gorky was back he said sevens not getting anywhere leave it pilgrim eleven rolled out of a sandstorm and found a smooth stone wall it rolled placidly along the wall seeing nothing pilgrim eight rolled among low red hills toward cloudless blue sky a dark vertical line appeared intermittently when the pilgrim was looking up some flaw in the camera ra chen went into fastforward and they bore the motion sickness as pilgrim eight rolled out of the hills and down toward intersecting canals a town looked to have grown up around the base of what was no longer a vertical thread but a slender pillar in pale brown its a tree svetz said the heads turned full around ra chen barked svetz are you sure ive seen trees and so had any of the few allowed into waldemar eights garden but svetz had seen them by hundreds and thousands dozens of kinds of treesmost of them branch out like a family lineage diagram you know but a few just keep going up and up ash does that redwoods you cant hold it in your head its like theyre holding up the sky can you make the pilgrim look straight up how tall is that thing miyas grip was a vise on svetzs wrist hanny not just a tree willy noises outside limousines then chaos rolled into the theater and everything came to a stop gorkys guards were followed by twenty conspicuously armed giants in united nations security uniforms they searched the viewing room and stripsearched its occupants and threw half of them out before they let the secretarygeneral enter svetz saw a crown or headdress rising above the guards it was all svetz could see of the secretarygeneral the middle of the front row was a kind of throne and the space in front of it had been cleared waldemar the eleventh sat down his voice held absolute confidence and a bit of a stutter willy sshow me what youve got chapter its roots trunk and branches bind together heaven earth and the netherworld the ash tree from mattiolis commentaires lyons pilgrim eleven rolled along a wall painted with nightmare figures faded to ominous shadows the wall curved away glass tow r poked above its rim barely glimpsed as the pilgrim rolled into wilderness pilgrim fours last moments showed alien shapes on alien riding beasts and hacking silver blades united nations guards shrank closer around waldemar the eleventh a slender vertical thread became an impossibly tall pillar the center of a township of tall spindly towers pilgrim eight rolled i mist many klicks wide of the town and the great pillar ra chen froze the frame waldemar the eleventh asked how tall is that gorky relayed the order down ra chen we need a better view of that ra chen said formulate your instructions for the pilgrims und well send em do you know what to tell the collector probe i o you know what samples you want sent back to earth gorky said we need a view up id think we want seeds if it makes seeds and a lot more information his eyes flicked toward i he secretarygeneral he would speak on any subject the secgen raised first pilgrim eight ran straight to a canal paused then rolled in finding no easy way out it followed the canal sending out its lightenhanced viewpoint eyeless things fled from motion or the taste of metal queer nearhuman skeletons in skimpy armor and farfromhuman exoskeletons enhanced with miniature frescoes and artificial ribbing lay intermingled along more than a klick of canal bottom pilgrim nine reached the northern ice and froze up gorky felt la chens eyes on him and said we werent expecting significant ice pilgrim ten rolled northeast until a canal blocked its path it allowed the canal to a crossing canal rotated and found a freestanding arched bridge fantastically long and slender it rolled onto the bridge and into a city family groups stopped to watch it pass men women and children they seemed of an unknown human race with scarlet skins and narrow lips and noses in martian cold they dressed in little more than weapon belts and jewels armed nudists looking very mammalian miya whispered into a recorder look for antifreeze in their blood two women pushed a carriage like the cart for a dole beer keg freeze that willy gorky snapped zoom it was rounded the reddishbrown of martian sand about a liter in size an egg nested in fluffy cloth the secretarygeneral spoke and all other sound chopped iff well willy you ddid it aliens alien civilization what next low big is your collector ddevice can you bring me an ambasador ultimately i can bring a whole family mr secretary gorkys eyes flicked to ra chen and saw his nodand house hem in the vivarium but it might take years egg of a martian then something soon waldemar eleven aid and svetz thought in time for the coronation gorky said i dont know how to keep an egg alive easier with n adult martian i think mr secretary id rather get some seeds rom that tree they had seen only one object that might be called a tree the lecgen didnt ask which why it was a strange conversation svetz thought one did not speak a the secretarygeneral without invitation gorky darent even volnteer information and that meant that the secgen himself had to sk all the right questions a rare skill i want a look up willy said mr secretary i think that tree is an orbital tower a beanstalk if it is well take the whole solar system for no more than the budget we were getting from waldemar the tenth square klicks of orbital powersats asteroid nines well set colonies on mars and europa and floating in the iimospheres of jupiter and saturn and venus wed need to plant one of these on earth wed need seeds can you even ffind it again it looked thin as a ddream the len said willy ive been trying to find the mmm outlines of syrtis major and i cant the canals and vegetation change everything measure from mons olympus mr secretary the trees at twentyseven degrees two minutes longitude zero latitude said willy gorky can your collector device climb a tree no maybe well find seeds near the base whats this going to cost me asked the secgen at least two more probes use of the time machine three limes maybe more maybe a manned expedition ra chen they talked money svetz tuned it out miya weve found cities on mars and all theyre talking about is that tree it might be it just might be a beanstalk how else could it stand up at all dont understand the question she started to answer but the secgen was departing in their mania for order his guards were turning all into chaos chapter jesses rod the animating and energizing force or light of jesse a genealogical tree a phallus sometimes represented by a vine thus equating with the beanstalk jacobs ladder or lughs chain dictionary of mythology folklore and symbols by gertrude jobes a man in space bureau uniform lectured the institute people geosynchronous orbit is klicks above the earth whatever you set in orbit at that height will circle the earth in exactly a day its a privileged position because the earth circles itself in exactly a day svetz got lost so he tracked down miya afterward and asked her hanny its a wonderful notion you know what synchronous orbit is its where we put the weather satellites no um suppose youre orbiting just outside the atmosphere you go round the earth in an hour and a half right higher its a bigger circle and youd move slower takes longer as high as the moon it takes almost a month to go around right right somewhere in between is where it takes just twentyfour hours for the earth its km up thats synchronous orbit the earth is spinning as fast as youre moving so you stay above the same point okay i take a coil of good strong rope i set it moving above the equator with its center of mass at synchronous orbit now the coil stays just over a point on the equator right right now i reel the rope out until one end is on the ground and the other end is way out there for balance thats your orbital tower right now i run an elevator up and down the rope i use it to lift cargo for the price of electric current plus any profit i can get away with if i go past the synchronous point and then let something slide up along the rope itll fly off the far end with enough velocity to reach the asteroids its a tree but its hanging from the sky yes exactly svetz rubbed his eyes he said that would cost i cant imagine what it would cost and you think youve found such a thing hanny what made you say it was a tree it reminded me of a redwood it went up and never seemed to stop like yggdrasil like the worldtree from norse legend but no tree could be strong enough steel wouldnt be strong enough no hanny hold on an orbital tower has to be strong right if you build it around mars you get high rotation and a lower mass much lower so it doesnt have to be as long or as strong picture it a hundred thousand klicks long and the only thing strong enough is still carbon crystal fibers or fullerine tubules and those are carbon too i think you were right we cant make such a thing we dont have anything to make it out of so why cant it be a tree life is carbon based trees are good at manipulating carbon and if we had seeds we would go to the planets for nothing more than electricity svetz miya zeera and most of the techs slept on air cots in the center while a composite team of sky domains and history bureau wrote instructions for the probes on archaic mars in the morning they were back in the small extension cage gravity shifted they floated toward each other bumped skewed and pulled themselves around the clothing they stripped off kept floating back like intrusive ghosts they made a game of batting garments away hanny mow many times do we have to do this before im a virgin again svetz laughed ive never gotten less hungry on any trip and later he asked are we going for a record this time mmm duration number intensity not unless i get some rest someday im going to get you in a bed svetz didnt answer miya asked whats the matter i had this notion once miya were going back to before time travel was even a concept once it was fantasy fairytale stuff in the late industrial age thorne and tipler and some other top mathematicians showed that time travel was theoretically possible and did some designs the institute for temporal research came out of those what if everything we collect from before plusthirty atomic era is fantasy hard to picture whale as a fantasy hes too big miya said too scarred too detailed when you pulled him in wasnt there a onelegged sailor still tangled in the lines and harpoons along his flank thats gritty realism that is svetz smiled gila monster would have charred me if id thought he was a fantasy horse tried to spear me like a wine cork so youre an adolescents daydream he told miya she purred into his throat and he said and here we are but weve never made love after plusthirty ae maybe youre my fantasy am i great are you ticklish is this real is it in the old days they had used the time machine to set a twomilligram test mass alongside itself the experiment ate energy equivalent to the test mass times lightspeed squared bringing an xcage to a spacetime it had already occupied would cause a surge n energy consumption that was how it could return to its point of departure the small xcage emerged just too late to watch its self vanish this mission would be cheap they were only messengers the messages already written to the orbiter module a burn to put it in a higher orbit excuse me its in low mars orbit now hanny we dont want it hitting the tree its only luck that hasnt happened yet miya kept working of course the current collector module wont be able to fly that high well instruct the orbiter to dive down and get it and i hope somebodys writing that program the tanker was already fully fueled and awaiting the arrival of a loaded collector no message needed to the pilgrims converge on the skyhook tree at twentyseven degrees two minutes longitude zero latitude pan up and down focus every instrument on the tree to the collector follow the pilgrims where they converge find ii high point and watch them defend against molesters weve already lost four pilgrims we can afford that but we cant lose the collector all right hanny jump us by a year and well collect what they get svetz dipped them into time watched tripped the interrupt theyd jumped over two years miya sent the instructions mars is close only about eighteen minutes this time she said miya doesnt mars have two moons why havent they chewed up the tree miya chewed her underlip she turned to the control board miya im looking the top of the tree doesnt taper off it ends in a knob deimos is further out than that but phobos phobos is below synchronous orbit it has to be it goes around more than twice a day orbits a little skewed but it crosses the equator it cant just keep missing doesnt sound like your space elevator has been in place very long at all miya said tesss hanny you have a knack for ah penetrating fantasies it would have had to grow very fast wouldnt it or arrive already grown message bursts from archaic mars were streaming in miya checked to see that they were recording and then svetz set them moving forward through time to the present chapter lughs chain the milky way chain by which lugh raised men to heaven equated with bifrost jacobs ladder the stem ofjesse watting street celtic mythology dictionary of mythology folklore and symbols by gertrude jobes ae its a tree in proportion its as slender as an ash tree no more but near the ground it bifurcates and spreads scores of nearvertical roots sink deep the sixtyfingered hand covers the green breadth of a canal and a square klick of ochre desert on each side wreckage of a bridge rides high in the tangle of roots other newer bridges in slender martian style stretch around and between other roots wait now that wrecked bridge was lifted as if the trees roots rose from the ground how could a tree grow from the ground to orbit nothing could be that strong paired silver lines rise along a vertical root and far up along the trunk look up the tree rises out of sight silver lines continue as far as the eye can see the secretarygeneral said this is hurting my eyes svetzs eyes tried to twist as he followed pilgrim ones viewpoint odd perspective here the trunk gets thicker as you go higher gorky said in haste we were expecting that your normal tree is wider near the base it wants compression strength you see it doesnt hang this skyhook tree is tapered so that less weight is hanging below any given crosssection that makes it stronger it looked infinitely tall the pilgrim probes were close near the roots and among them pilgrim ones viewpoint zoomed up along the pale brown line of the tree into a dark fringe that began almost at the edge of sight scores of klicks high a ragged collar of foliage already above the atmosphere continued up the trunk as a vertical fringe like mane on horse hard to see anything at all in there not dark green black the secgen asked you wanted seeds the heads took it as an invitation if there are seeds id expect them to fall into the canal ra chen speculated from that high up theyd come down like little meteors gorky said shielded against reentry punch their way through the weed surface into the canal we cant go there ra chen we could theres a town built up where the canals intersect the skyhook tree is in it youre not thinking of a fullscale invasion of mars are you no just send pilgrims to search underwater oh good give me some time to study these records i want lo know if there are seeds higher up the tree id like to search the black fringe you didnt design the collector to climb trees did you willy miya leaned forward in the near dark jaw set her nails sinking into svetzs shoulder he asked softly what she whispered theyll have to use cosmonauts willy gorky himself briefed them the next day ra chen and i cant work out how to tell a computer program what a skyhook seed looks like we dont know ourselves miya svetz youll send instructions as usual then pick up return signals from the mars pilgrims well send six pilgrims underwater they should be safe from the locals at any rate ra chen said well mount a viewer in the small xcage so you can scan whatever they find we should have done that a year ago svetz youve seen every kind of tree you must have seen every kind of seed he overrode svetzs attempt to interrupt our best hope is that youll know a seed when you see it then tell the collector module to go get it chapter eleven hundred years of development had shaped the rovers early versions had explored mars and the moon they had become smaller lighter cheaper more clever later models roved the surfaces of every interesting body in the solar system some climbed like spiders some rolled as spheres with unbalanced weights in them on worlds with no surface at all rovers floated or sank on archaic mars six rovers explored beneath the black waters of a canal they found soft mud and organic substances subsiding into softness and things that tried to eat them they had been told little they examined discreet solid objects and discarded things that were too large or too small they sought shapes that repeated as seeds would when the command came they crawled out of the muck to beam their findings to the orbiter for relay to a point above the earth miya and svetz ran through the murky footage many hours later miya said this is boring svetz stopped the display and lifted tired eyes he said best duty ive ever had really ive been chewed ive been scorched ive been almost eaten almost fried almost perforated over and over i go alone because there has to be room for whatever i bring back theres never been anyone to guard me or rescue me or talk to or love there hed said it every other trip ive been hunting something with teeth i hate used to hate animals wrona seems to have talked me out of that i am having a wonderful time miya sighed and went back to work the xcage had come to meet itself now it hovered above the same fat blueandwhite crescent theyd left behind two trips running only the pattern of stars had shifted the cage was hovering after all it wasnt in an orbit svetz picked out an orange spark among the stars of taurus near the western horizon that was a world he couldnt see it as more than a point if the pilgrims couldnt find seeds someone would have to go to mars and look miya pointed into the projection from pilgrim one look hanny we keep seeing this shape its pottery isnt it sunlight rippled across it it was near the surface of the canal vase you can see the pattern this symbol its that tenlegged toothy thing that tried to chew up pilgrim four not quite the same a bigger relative hanny im tired miya curled up in the curve of the floor svetz called the center hillary wengfa answered she went to wake ra chen no seeds svetz said how sure are you we get pottery we get eggs bones look like each other so the pilgrims show us a lot of those once we got a mob of reds in battle gear they all looked alike they were even walking in some kind of regular array pilgrim six went right up to examine them weve lost pilgrim six better tell willy no telling how much time had passed in the present here only an instant passed while the phone went dead then live he heard miya sleeping willy chairman ra chen tells me you cant find anything like a seed weve typed fifteen styles of pottery we find broken furniture not much garbage maybe theres a famine we did find a heap of spiky seeds fistsized but we searched through the rotten fruit around it which wasnt pleasant willy and it had more of the same seeds in it there are skeletons of at least three biped species most of them look human some were wearing armor the big fourarmed ones grow their own its not as if they have wars more like they fight in the streets every night weve found big eggs theyre not seeds theyre eggs and in fact theyre humanoids eggs red and pale and black all a little different marss answer to population control willy were both exhausted get some sleep call me when you wake up were sending you to mars willy we can refit a moon minim spacecraft and get it into the large xcage if it doesnt fit well fit something well brief zeera i dont see any way to get seeds off that tree except to go up it wait wait wait im not a cosmonaut pause a chance to see mars when it was alive at united nations expense willy we spent fifteen hours searching for your seeds and six pilgrims spent a year gathering the data if there were seeds theyd have fallen if theyd fallen wed have found them this tree is sterile and aside from all that i hanville svetz am not a cosmonaut there was a brief pause and miya was watching him willy gorky said twenty years ago id have killed you to steal your seat on that ship ra chens voice never mind svetz drop it willy well send miya and zeera you come home in the small xcage miyas eyes closed svetz curled up next to her and let it all drift away chapter he woke to miyas voice he was looking at a bulletshaped spacecraft backlit against dark earth and marked with riding lights he knew what to look for a faint halo around the ship fading into nothing at one rim was the shell of the large xcage youre awake good miya was already wearing a skintight in brilliant yellow patterns svetz this is a pressure suit the helmet unlocks and flops back if youre where you can breathe flops forward to close lock it or its explosive decompression unzip everything before you get in no wait strip first she watched clinically detached as svetz zipped himself into the pressure suit stickstrips held it open against the wall and it was still difficult limb by limb then torso lock each zip from shoulder to waist the back of the suit was a shell ten centimeters thick enough to enclose circuitry and an air and water recycler the bubble helmet locked against it when open the rest of the suit was very flexible very thin it fitted him like skin on a dieter just a little loose he smoothed out some wrinkles he pulled the big bubble down over his head wiggled it into lock and set the air going miya guided his fingers to sensors under his chin this is your voicelink her voice boomed receded this zooms your helmet miyas face expanded enormously the other way the room pulled in around her fisheye looking down at himself he saw the patterns of a brilliant green lizard miyas skintight was yellow and orange flames like a bird hed once glimpsed and lost waldemar ten would have loved it but hed asked for a spotted owl above earths black night side a halfseen circle opened like a flower and puffed a haze of ice crystals spacecraft and circle separated in a haze of frost a tiny pressure suit moved toward them stickstrips held an elastic belt twenty centimeters wide with space bureau insignia on an even wider buckle and a hooded silver cloak svetz left the cloak but donned the belt miya nodded and reached for a handle svetz was used to changing gravity he had a grip on the chair before the hatch opened air roared out svetz stayed put the suit shrank in vacuum now it fitted him like skin on a sausage vacuum outside pressure in his helmet the suit put pressure on his skin but air still pulled itself into his lungs he had to pull the belt tight around his belly before he could exhale miya had placed herself near the hatch to catch him but only now did she look back his heart leapt the skintight had shrunk around her she seemed to be wearing nothing but yellow and orange paint zeera southworth pulled herself inside and moored her flight slick zwra in a zebrastriped skintight was a marvelous sight her gaze brushed his crotch which may have showed signs of his interest and he saw a swallowed laugh svetz want to see a rocket ship yes take the cloak miya advised him a flight stick was lift field generator and power source built into a meter and a half of pole with a control ring at one end and a brush discharge at the other spinoff from space bureau of course the women bracketed him as they crossed to the large extension cage they neednt have worried svetz knew flight sticks though this one felt underpowered a lift field wasnt a rocket the earth it pushed against was too far below he wrapped the cloak around himself the earth had rotated into somebody elses midnight as it turned beneath the hovering xcages mars and the stars of taurus hadnt moved they flew alongside a spacecraft like a bullet standing upright and took their turns in the airlock lifted by antigravity beamers on the large xcage svetz entered free fall chapter the minim was big three reclined chairs faced up into a transparent nose cone behind those was considerable cargo space svetz noted a rolledup net and a door in the hull big enough to admit a van roomy he said zeera said we dont really know what kind of seeds a tree this size makes theyve got to stand up to reentry miya said at worlds maybe bigger than earth a seed could be as big as that door zeera said if its bigger well have to strap it to the hull tools were mounted around the cylinder wall svetz noted slickslrips for three pressure skintights and three flight sticks he waved at devices mounted in sleeves xeera pointed sonic stunners longrange blasters translator three of everything wide stickstrips along the wall to tether llure crew for sleep we can refit a moon minim spacecraft ra hrn had said svetz had refused to go to mars and then theyd built for three miya had heard his refusal he could lose her willy gorky whh manipulating him but it wasnt as if he had a choice xeera can this ship talk to the center xeera tapped a device like the talker in the small xcage get inr either chairman she ordered wait one a tech said gorkys voice ready xeera southworth here no showstoppers hanny svetz wants to talk svetz said willy this ship will clearly support three i want to ko to mars if its all right with chairman ra chen silence crawled then ra chen asked svetz are you in free fall now yes how do you feel no problems no motion sickness gorkys voice i dont know what the small xcage will do can we pull it back without a pilot ra chen yes gorky glad to have you hanny miya broke in willy that changes the ships mass by her eyes questioned him sixtyone kilos svetz told her miya you oppose this miya locked eyes with him and said no willy im for it but rewrite the instructions for boost gorky have to pull the cage back anyway our twenty minutes are up the large xcage blinked gone and back again miya snapped seat webs now and didnt watch svetzs initial clumsiness a ruddy dot above the earths limb waited he felt no thrust the large xcage shrank out of sight a few minutes later the earth was flowing past and the daylit crescent vas narrowing zeera watched her instruments willys pulled back the large xcage again she said boost one accomplished were in orbit it eight kps svetz said orbit i thought we were on our way well closeapproach the earth then the xcage pops back and the antigravity beamers hit us again this ships too heavy to jet into mars intercept in one boost miya nodded as if she understood so svetz did too he moved about the cabin testing his agility he looked over the gear that lung on stickstrips along the cylinder wall zeera a translator or martian miya answered hanny these have been used in united nations sessions for near a thousand years they can translate thieves cant and old recordings of dolphin and whale song we have a live whale yes hadnt occurred to me anyway these things certainly dont have martian on file you and the martians will have to talk until the translator can correlate some of your words svetz unrolled a screen to cover the cylinder wall now it was just another floor the earth turned full it came to him that being trapped in a tiny spacecraft with miya thorsven for two years wouldnt be half bad two more years returning if mars didnt kill them he looked around the cabin wondering how they could get privacy zeera had never shown interest in any man or woman which reminded him zeera hows wrona i brought her to the center she can go home with hillary if the mission lasts overnight overnight oh zeera do you like space better than time i never told you did i when i was a little girl i wanted to live with martians we shouldve merged the two bureaus then instead of waiting another fantasy fulfilled miya snapped oh get off that hanny heres another he said marooned with two beautiful women millions of klicks from planet earth for four years zeera she laughed four years without wrona doesnt that bother you its not four years for her wont bother us either have a look at this she showed him what ra chen had built into what would have been storage space for provisions its an advance on the temporal interrupt that weve been using to stop the xcages we call it fast forward or ffd chapter eight klicks per second is fast svetz never saw the large xcage return telltales in front of zeera told him when it came how hard it pushed and when it was gone he only saw the earth shrinking behind and mars like a glowing heart in taurus zeera said miya youll appreciate this next move she engaged the fast forward svetz trusted the machines of the institute for temporal research without understanding them he simply enjoyed the show the slowly dwindling earth shrank abruptly to a bright point the sun itself was shrinking the pink pinpoint that was mars grew brighter grew conspicuous i wondered where all the provisions were miya said lightly but she had a death grip on her armrests this is time travel too isnt it minimally we have to put ourselves in the right path before we engage and then the vehicle just follows the path the geodesic we cant change course or dodge or fight either i suppose but were hard to hurt the heads say that if we hit an asteroid its good odds well go right through it svrtx asked which head both grinning like fools said zeera she was working at the keyboard pictures scrolled across one of the displays svetz have fou seen these in the display screen mars came up fast an edge of horizon aecanie a shield volcano of awesome size its the view from the tanker yeah watch the viewpoint dropped toward a vast crater its bottom a glittering asterisk of mirrors dropped past the rim slowed above a rocky ledge but lines and tiny numbers overlay everything he saw zeera said the tanker the pilgrims all the pictures that came back ra chen and gorky have been turning it all into maps we cant get lost she wasnt looking at him svetz realized he was missing the new the bright orange point had become a disk not a disk now a whirling sphere expanding much too fast thats close enough zeera said and mars jarred to a stop as large as a full earth seen from the moon thus far the trip had cost them forty minutes ship time we still have to match orbit with mars anything threatens is we just go past weve got fuel to abort and return miya take he copilot slot zeera sounded edgy and well she might they were rubbing up against an alien civilization they had examined little more than its garbage but all the corpses wore wounds the minim slowed at a tenth of a gee spiraling in toward mars tie planet waned to a shrinking crescent then a great black hole n the stars they were moving inward of deimos orbit and mars was a spreading crescent when svetz found the tree it was foreshortened pointing almost at the ship the orbital tower looked like a giants club they were passing just above the massive rounded upper end interestingly phallic miya said or is that just me hanny us a diseased potato thirty klicks long came straight at them zeera screamed the hurtling moon missed them by watching it recede made it seem that deimos had missed by two klicks or more still much too close for comfort miya came out from behind her arms she looked at svetz for a heartbeat her face too pale then she turned her attention to the planet mars was still distant by hundreds of klicks but the minims zoom display was good mars crescent grew gibbous then full canal patterns laced the deserts knotted into cities at the intersections there was a wide white northern ice cap miya swore monotonously that region has to be syrtis major but theres nothing left of the shape valles marineris is all graygreen there where all those minor canals converge zeera every feature know has changed im feeling very lost wait thats mons olympus with greenery crawling up the sides thats aeolis coming over the horizon and the tree growing out of it craters thickened east of aeolis canals crossed a few of those the ones that held water mars covered half the sky features raced beneath the minim expanding aeria miya said i think better be zeera said svetz asked zeera are you going to land us no aerobrake whats it mean youll love it are you webbed in the hull began to sing a landscape of mottled ochre desert and ragged canyons and narrow graygreen lines hurled itself directly at his face close enough to touch svetz clutched the arms of his chair and felt heat radiating from the window he never thought to look at his companions he heard miya murmur xanthe and saw a monstrous crater pass beneath them then the singing tapered off but zeera whooped and whacked his bony back hell of a ride svetz began the process of relaxing his hands this next parts tricky she said thrust built up against their backs mars was a shrinking crescent a hint of a vertical line was growing ahead zeeras mind was on her flying she talked in staggered half sentences chairman gorkys been seven months rebuilding the minim we missed the coronation of course we had time to un your travelogues to death but we just werent seeing enough enough of the tree its beanstalk seeds were after ftlly gorky thinks the secgen is losing patience but its really willy were not on a rescue mission no hanny if we can save some martians thats in order but first where are the seeds not if hanny we assume there are seeds seeds are wanted where would you want to drop seeds if you were a skyhook tree svetz shrugged deep water for a plant that tall the canal in ocean if there was one but you looked they arent there miya said hide seeds in the black fringe grow a cannon spit them over the horizon at other canals zeera said the fringe runs along the midtrunk for more than twenty thousand klicks you want to search all that make us a better offer the fringe is like leaves on a tree hanny it makes sugar spectrum off a laser flash showed us the chemical that does phosynthesis its not chlorophyll a separate line of evolution its probably from another solar system alien the fringe could make seeds too i guess you want to look i the fringes thats the plan then ive got us in synchronous orbit we can study the midtrunk before i go down zeera cut the irust and they floated the trunk had grown huge svetz guessed it at five hundred meters thick and a couple of klicks distant he asked zeera do we have to go down at all miya exclaimed hanny thats mars down there i like to know my options zeera sighed weve already used up too much fuel to get home well need to land at mons olympus and refuel now make a choice do you want to go down the tree or up the tree youve got flight sticks i could let you off at the midpoint then go on to refuel while you work your way down or you can ride down with me maybe talk to some martians then fly to the tree and climb they spent a few minutes talking it over svetz wished they could call the center and give the decision to someone else no ko the talker would reach through time but not through an interplanetary gravity gradient they were out of contact until they could return to earth ultimately miya said lets get the job done first zeera let us off here well work our way down and join you at mons olympus miya left her seat in onetenth gee she fished out three transparent bags and handed two to svetz and zeera do you both know how to use these grinning svetz said this may never come up you cant breathe preindustrial air zeera laughed it nearly killed svetz on his first trip nearly killed us all once svetz said my fault zeera said i gave steam cars the edge at the beginning of the industrial age the change shock hit us and everyone stopped breathing and fainted i got us into filter helmets if it wasnt for temporal inertia we couldnt have fixed anything there wouldnt have been an institute or a time machine see miya youve got to have certain substances in your blood svetz said or your body forgets to breathe carbon dioxide nitrogen oxides sulfur compounds you need other industrial byproducts too miya asked why didnt you change too svetz and zeera looked at each other zeera said you mean humans of course i mean humans when the air changed why didnt every human being on earth change over to breathing preindustrial air the change shock moves at different rates zeera said we night all have suffocated waiting or strangled if we changed beore the air did all right miya said we need filter helmets to breathe martian air at ground level these arent stock issue theyre altered or mars note the insignia a thumbtipsized orange dot on the forehead on mars they have to concentrate oxygen and hold arbon dioxide and monoxide out dont try to climb with just these in vacuum you need a full pressure suit but keep them handy svetz and miya donned their pressure gear and tested the voicelink miya showed svetz how to back into a rocket pack set t and lock it to his back plate nozzles faced back up down nozzles poked past his short ribs facing forward he was wearing high explosives on his back and hed known this was coming they were in balance between mars gravity and centrifugal force a flight stick would push up no help miya affixed a flight stick to svetzs back for use when they got lower then a blaster want this too she was holding the needle gun svetz said yes you sure habit we dont use blasters on any normal mission we dont ivant to kill anything in the past she turned and let him stickstrip a flight stick and blaster to ler back careful to keep it all clear of rocket nozzles miya went out first the skyhook tree was fat in the middle wider than any redwood the black foliage only began much lower down lets do it miya said facing the tree she fired her rocket pack svetz fired his a moment later it kicked him toward the tree when her flame died he cut his off too chapter but most women when they feel free to experiment with life will go straight to the witches sabbath i myself respect them for it and do not think that i could ever really love a woman who had not at some time or other been up on a broomstick isak dinesen the old chevalier from seven gothic tales the midtrunk was glossy void of detail but for a glittering silver thread svetz used his helmet to zoom on it the thread split into two parallel lines miya i see it the martians have built a lift thats what you do with a beanstalk svetz asked theyd have used it to explore the solar system wouldnt they time is your thing not mine there are lots of little moons in the outer system some almost as big as mars if martians had been there wed have found something mars must have been just starting to reach out when something interrupted some disaster svetz reset his helmet view unzoomed the trunk was still coming close far around the curve was a creasing of the bark it stretched for several klicks as if a silvergray wing were folded along the trunk ready for retrothrust i havent taken my fingers off those switches since you showed them to me the bark was very close good hold off though hanny you see anything scary lift cables weve got martians above and below those folds you see them i want a better look at those retrothrust miya said he didnt see her fire but he toggled switches with four fingertips nozzles poking past his ribs fired his bark plate pulled him backward the trunk came softly up to meet him there was nothing to cling to zeeras voice are you on the tree miya phoenix has landed hanny svetz snake is on the tree zeera hows your view zeera i have views through both your helmet cameras i will call you from mons olympus blue flame puffed the minim spacecraft receded and was gone chapter beanstalk universe tree of fairy tales ladder or road to the heavens the rope trick of india is related to the belief in a stairway to heaven dictionary of mythology folklore and symbols by gertrude jobes svetz followed miya around the trunk the sun shown directly on them svetz deployed his silver cloak like a parasol but he was still sweating the porous pressure suit let his own sweat cool him otherwise hed have steamed himself to death he asked should we be wearing sunblock the suits block uv miya said he drifted alongside the silvergray crease blanket big enough to cover a city square klicks of it he reported for miya and a later audience he touched it flimsy stuff he crawled under a fold of tissuethin leaf and turned his headlamp on he was instantly dazzled yow its a hall of mirrors in here a skyhook tree could use lightsails to maneuver grow them like leaves they crawled around under the silvergray leaf without finding anything but bark and mirror they followed the metal rails down to a switching arrangement willy would have used a maglev track not a box on rails miya said this must be deadly slow building it must have been deadly slow maybe they live longer now what down miya said she fired rockets and was off down the mink svetz followed she was nearly out of sight but her voice remained clear cut your thrust now hanny use the flight stick when its time to decelerate weve got gravity now if you see anything on the trunk tell me nothing but the cable he was falling free fall hadnt bothered him at the midpoint this was different he fell alongside the tree as if hed jumped from an arcologys roof falling too fast and dead already i see another silver wrinkle another lightsail leaf dont get too close to the trunk hanny svetz didnt intend to big box on one of the cables its just an open cage barred lots of boxes inside some troops too hanny duck duck what he asked he still hadnt seen the barred box she spoke of but he fired a puff of rocket exhaust to push him sideways im just being cautious miya said there a barred box on the rail he zoomed his view and saw a metalwork cage sculpted into a festival tent sparks lit the cage puffs of flame from a dozen tubes a flicker tugged at his peripheral vision bits of metal passing silently through the space hed vacated miya had gone past the lift before they could react they must be shooting at svetz carefully rather than quickly svetz pulled the flight stick from its tape and set it between his legs it surged and lifted him away from another volley of what must be kinetic weapons faceplate magnification gave him shapes within the grillwork just for an instant as in hurtled past hed seen at least five species of manlike and alien creatures among the fifteen or so some looked like humans in gaudily decorated armor or in plain armor but with oversized misshapen heads some were bigger with too many limbs four clung to the bars all limbs like octopus who shared whales cage one was standing apart weaponless but he felt its regard a creamcolored creature three meters tall a skeletally gaunt giant fitted with great goblin ears stuffed into a fishbowl helmet missed me twice svetz told miya any damage no im losing you though not ffalling as fast his teeth were starting to chatter with reaction hed better stop talking gravity had grown strong the trunk slid past him ever faster minute by minute the band of dark foliage was still below him but rising something on the trunk miya that row of loose struts i see it artificial no i think that would be stems for lightsail leaves the leaf materials gone martians might have harvested it like a farm for mirrors miya said im going into the forest east side foliage strip aye decelerating hed never had a partner on a mission hed never had to coordinate every futzy move with someone else the flight stick thrust up against mars pull but it gave him maneuvering range too he needed it hed drifted too close to the trunk he heard hanny i misjudged ill be landing five or six klicks below the top want me to go in higher up do that the flight stick was steady under him the trunk slid past slowing he dropped alongside black foliage sparse at first then thick and dense miya im on im inside yeee miya something jumped at me i had to shoot it these blasters ion leave much svetz are you in at not in svetz hovered looking into a wall of black forest the fluffy surface looked no more substantial than a dandelion ready to blow he had no real wish to go inside and no way to avoid it something in there had tried to kill miya he fished out the blaster and fired into the black wall angled down foliage flared white there was no recoil the blast speared straight through until the tunnel showed red mars at its far end things swarmed out gravity and momentum pulled them away before he could see much of them he tracked a lensshaped creature as big as a bungalow the last in a whole fleet maybe zeera could get more detail from the recording coils of cable fell thrashing then stretched out klicks and klicks of it reaching svetz used the zoom feature to track it one end brushed the tree dragged along it caught more loop after loop thick cable marked with a blackonmilk diamond pattern that was a wedgeshaped head yes indeed there was more than one kind of snake ive fired a hole right through the forest things came out now im going straight in he reported futz of a way to explore miya said were not exploring were looking for seeds seeds on a thing this size ought to be immense unmistakable we can hope he coasted in coming out of the sun had him nearly blind despite his headlamp when his eyes adjusted a bit he jetted down the channel whatever might consider him edible must have died or fled twenty minutes later he let himself fall into sunlight miya im out have you moved still inside im not finding anything hi drop past your position by oh fifty klicks and go in again svetz was already falling his flight stick providing just a ouch of lift miya sounded tired hanny its too hig a job i know were missing something we need to know where to look but i just dont see the right pattern yet zeera are you with us no miya if you were a tree youd want to drop your seeds in water wouldnt you the tree did that sank roots where two canals crossed so this band of foliage ends what a hundred klicks up if seeds dropped from the bottom theyd fall at a slant coriolis effect would pull them two or three klicks east well look a twinkling overhead the martians lift cage was in view much lower than it had been it must be nearly falling and it was flashing light miya theyre coming down can you find cover i can put foliage between me and them im falling faster than they are we could talk to them if your translators worked in vacuum two hundred klicks lower the fringe of black foliage had swollen to become a match for any forest still on earth svetz charred out another tunnel again a swarm of creatures fled his blaster beam a nightmare shape took an interest in svetz his blaster dissolved it but hed attracted attention four rippling silver sheets with eyes in the middle drifted near studying him living lightsails not the lightsail leaves that grew on the tree but maybe part of the same evolutionary line svetz knew that if he fired on ambulatory mirrors his own beam would come back at him he jetted into the tunnel they didnt follow he slowed midway to look around limbs became branches became little branches became twigs growth here was fractal like a fern or a tree he saw nothing like flowers or fruit or seeds or pinecones miya was taking more time to explore but she was making bigger jumps he stopped another hundred klicks down and dipped in again tree parasites had grown sparse nothing else had changed the upper tree was a line of winking lights when he emerged pretty svetz zoomed his view lights twinkled all along the trunk to the far tip signals miya theyre talking about us the edge in her voice matched his own i see it mirrors they can chop huge mirrors out of those lightsails what the futz is that something ghastly bright was coming at them out of the night the breath froze in svetzs throat something like an eroded gray mountain came straight toward the tree turning massively us it came the flicker of mirrorspeech stopped as it moved on them growing growing gone past with several klicks clearance fear made miyas voice ragged missed hanny talk to me im okay but that was disturbing phobos it must scare the martians into fits every time it comes by it and the tree must be in a resonance pattern ha we can hope what else have you found look up he said her suit was badly chosen too like the colors of mars but hed spotted her i found you he dropped past her and slowed keeping his distance she eased alongside him two flight sticks fell together along the narrowing trunk dawn was crawling down the tree toward mars a broad crescent of dawn crawled across black land toward the base of the tree not black land he saw lines of light brighter where they crossed cities formed where canals met there were more cities arcs of light like little crescent moons on the darkness directly below was a cruciform glow but none of those lights were blinking up here theyre talking with reflected sunlight miya said talking about strangers on the tree theyll get answers as soon as its daylight below us and then the whole planet will know all about us maybe its time to talk to some martians svetz agreed offer them refuge tell them whats going to happen we dont exactly know what happened hanny makes us less persuasive and from everything i can tell svetz said martians would rather open fire than conversation there were lights flickering below not on mars but duck he said another open cage was rising toward them flashing with reflections and tiny puffs of fire futz there were crabs crawling all over the outside crabs as big as wrona with human faces it looked like human shapes inside the cage were doing the shooting he glided sideways to put forest between him and what hed seen futz what something hit my helmet miya said futz pull into the foliage let me look at you im fine my ears are ringing a little still falling braking with their flight sticks they eased around the narrowing curve of the tree svetz heard miya cursing softly before he spotted it above them on a second pair of silver tracks a wooden raft hung vertically a cargo lift rising things were tied to it a boxcarsized bulb with a door in one end and several smaller boxes manshapes were clinging to the web of lines something struck his backshell not from the cargo lift svetz yelped and lifted on the flight stick but that would take him too close to the guns on the cargo lift around the trunk then with bullets trying to follow him and then turn off the flight stick and fall where are you miya asked tailing west side the trunk below us is swarming hanny lets go with your guess go in at the bottom end of the black forest hide in there hope we see seeds zeera are you reading us the shadow of dawn had crept down the trunk to its base half of mars was alight and all of the skyhook tree svetz squinted down into a coruscation of blinking lights sunlight and mirrors mars was talking back to the tree but stare into the blaze and you saw more aircraft too high to be aircraft ho zoomed his faceplate and saw thousands of flying vehicles around the base of the tree higher up mere hundreds all trying to dock against the trunk but that high they must be in vacuum the pilgrim probes had videotaped what seemed to be hardshelled dirigibles could mars have a lighterthanvacuum gas what was he up against here some of the sparkling was weaponry puffs of fire and a glitter of projectiles falling short but some of the weaponry wasnt aimed at them the natives were fighting each other miya said zeeras over the horizon and the orbiter doesnt seem to be in position to relay still with us hanny still intact and on course for the bottom of the forest miya i may have used flight sticks as often as you have just not in mars gravity while trying to move inside a sausage skin very good anything goes wrong yell for me dont think it over first chapter jacobs ladder typifies a souls approach to perfection a universal axis or world tree equates with amano hashidate the beanstalk lughs chain stem ofjesse yggdrasil dictionary of mythology folklore and symbols by gertrude jobes a flyer ruptured and began to sink in a scattered cloud of men mars still pulled like a planet the flight stick was lifting at maximum but svetzs belly still thought he was sliding down a smooth glass hill but the treescape slowed slowed until the black forest was a worldsized bulge above him and he was starting o float back up miya drifted alongside below them the trunk was infested svetz had barely heard of termites he had to picture something like von neumann nanotech machines turning living wood nto more of themselves until there was nothing left but the machines it looked like that just a haze of motion until he turned up the zoom he had not anticipated that the wealth and power of mars five hundred and fifty years before earths first atomic bomb could match the wealth of the united nations of ae but armor and manpower of that order was crawling up the tree at them the twinkling wasnt all mirrors close below them slender manshapes were fighting greenclad sixlimbed giants faceplates winked like silver mirrors here and there were twinkling blades stickfigure shapes improbably tall moved about the trunk undisurbed observing the fighting like hundreds of wandering referees svetz said speculating its a technology race like the first cold war somebody saw us using tools that no martian has they cant let anyone else get to us first we came to rob them theyre ill swarming up the tree to be first to rob us one of the factions was getting too close svetz saw puffs of gunfire swords or not they still had kinetic projectiles lets get into cover miya said the forest flared briefly and left it charred tunnel miya jetted into it svetz fired rockets and followed it was soft cushiony wriggle through wriggle down thats iw behind you so dont shoot good i dont see any parasites miya said or seeds even seeds of earth could take any shape pinecones spiky peach pits smooth almonds great melons with tiny seeds avocados acorns sesame whatever their form skyhook seeds would look all alike they might be armored against reentry heat otherwise svetz had no idea what to look for and miya of space bureau had even less he was seeing nothing but foliage have a look here miya said he saw her below by pink marslight he wriggled down beside her theyd left most of the tree above them now and mars was close below they peered down through a hole in the sky the lower sixty klicks of tree was swarming with troop carriers and cargo vehicles miya said im wondering the tree shuddered they had that instants warning and then the trunk lashed like a whip it was worse than any earthquake svetz was totally disoriented his arms and legs strangled a black branch that was trying to fling him into the sky his grip was being shaken loose eerily calm was miyas voice hanny ive lost my flight stick can you come and get me what was that the tree was shuddering still miya was nowhere in sight dont know dont care yet come and get me she was falling stop a moment think was it lifting my flight stick no maybe it stayed in the tree svetz saw it wedged in branches he reached and the tree shook it and him out like overripe fruit he was spinning down dizzy and disoriented with his own flight stick in one hand and the other falling with him a flare of rockets sent him close enough to grab ive got them both wait one he wrapped himself around his flight stick gripped the other in an armpit and barely stopped himself from twisting the lift throttle hed lose her if he lifted miya youve got your rocket pack find me and come get your flight stick do it before we both burn up understood can you see me no youre the same color as mars who picks your wardrobe look for me im green and im turning on my blinks blinks aye aye well make great targets ohfutz he screamed in terror as the tree ripped loose whatever was happening below was half hidden in a cloud of chaff some of that chaff was vehicles and men the trees lateral surge must have shaken most of its parasites loose the torn base of the rising tree trailed wood chaff and artifacts twisted silver rails pressure suits of human and nonhuman shape falling sky ships a falling lift cage men and green giants and big crabs were swarming out and over it and what they hoped to accomplish was beyond svetz svetzs emergency suit lights were scintillating in preprogrammed panic he was a clear and vivid target maybe miya i see you hanny maybe miya would get to him before anyone else and there she was a flickering orange flare rising past him svetz twisted the flight stick throttle hard over do not make your burn im chasing you he called she was there again coming down and he twisted again to kill the lift rockets too close let me do the docking just give me the flight stick she screamed he hadnt guessed how frightened she was she snatched at the brush discharge with both hands and had it the trees torn base rose past them big as a wooden moon he glimpsed miya again high above him on the flight stick and lost her they were falling fast already he could hear a whisper of wind theyd burn as meteors if they couldnt kill their velocity it was not a time to worry about staying together her voice was clear almost calm too much weight on the tree they overloaded it are you all right decelerating i lost it for a moment there hanny look out overhead theres a lot of futz falling at us he looked up at men falling silent in vacuum a sky ship dropped past him slowed and rose again his hand scrabbled at his back he must have dropped the luster but he was instinctively reaching for the needle gun and if found that the vessel was alongside him it might have been a dirigible balloon with wooden decking along the top men swarmed out of iii interior well anchored themselves and hurled something it unfurled as it came a net svetz twisted the throttle off and dropped under the net they pulled it back and prepared to throw again something ripped the vessel wide open for an instant svetz could see into a tank running bow to stern filled with gas glowing by the light of a vermilion laser then the glowing gas puffed out and the vessel dropped away wind sang a reedy melody pulled at his helmet set up a tremor in his flight stick martian vehicles dropped past him nobody seemed to be firing at svetz some fired at each other none tried to match the lifting power of svetzs flight stick and then one did a sky yacht was floating down toward him he shifted laterally so did the yacht matching his lift it was brick shaped covered with masts and nets with no regard for streamlining miya a flying yacht tried to net me and now ive got another he said he looked for a target he could glimpse men but they were under hatches firing through slits miya said im clear i can get to you but not fast im already in the atmosphere they must have recognized his needle gun as a weapon the ship rose above him a net flew he dodged they pulled it back and threw again he dodged air sang past him ho could feel heat on his shoes the backs of his legs his forearms the sky yachts crew tired of trying to net him he saw puffs of flame from covered slits and tiny metal missiles whacked the back of his flight stick the brush discharge sputtered blue lightning and he fell nothing had hit him he was falling with a dead stick between his legs but he wasnt dead yet he twisted every control the stick only sputtered puffs of lightning he kicked it away from him the sky yacht was falling alongside him the net came down again and this time rocket pack or not svetz didnt dodge the net swept him in and the flight stick too and pulled him toward a wooden deck svetz fished out the flight stick and threw it overside the deck knocked the wind out of him he felt it surge under him the yacht pulling upward theyve got me he said chapter in one respect at least the martians are a happy people they have no lawyers a princess of mars by edgar rice burroughs describe the vessel miya instructed seventeen meters by seven fitted out like a boat no keel no aerodynamic surfaces two long tanks with a narrow cabin between im not guessing about that i saw a tank ripped open on another craft there are firing points forward kinetic energy weapons a motor aft and a deck across the whole top im lying on the deck and he looked up at a row of silver masks they wound the net around svetz to immobilize him svetz said they look like men what i can see except one dont leave me hanging its just watching squatting with its knees way higher than its head bubble helmet isnt quite big enough for its ears its wearing just the helmet its covered with white feathers bird ancestry hanny it wouldnt be related to anything from earth the crew fished his needle gun out and gathered round to study that one crewman fired at something as it fell past when he saw no result he fired a crystal into a wooden post it left a tiny streak of white powder he was not impressed he kept the needle gun several crew picked svetz up and turned him for inspection they reached through the net and opened buckles until they had freed the rocket pack and could slide it off his back they must have recognized the bellshapes as rocket nozzles they were careful with it bracing it against the deck before they tried to fire it they couldnt make it work theyd find the safety override soon enough svetz spoke while they were playing with the rocket pack miya theyre built like basketball players their pressure suits are not quite skintights theyre quilted and painted in camouflage all reds and they wear bracelets and toques over the suits theyre wearing silver masks the masks are pictures of human faces like death masks little windows for eyes gems in some of the masks wont be able to use my translator until weve got air talk to me miya im here hanny the decks are wood the fittings are wood theres some metal maybe iron and gold but im surrounded by literally tonnes of wood enjoy ive found seeds tell me she had flown over the city graceful towers that go up and up those slender arched bridges streets wind high up between the towers with no support but a few arches thin as an afterthought everything looks fragile they build like theyve forgotten gravity hanny the trees been dropping all kinds of heavy stuff itll knock down half the city before the days over nobody was going to notice me in all that i came down east of the city i found thousands of craters all in a line all sizesstuff that fell off the tree over the yearsexcept that a lot of little craters were just the same size two meters across i dug seeds out of the centers of those they look like big yellow apples mission accomplished yes but hanny i still cant get zeera i cant even get readings from the orbiter hed been hoping for better news the time machine couldnt reach mars the orbiter was to carry them back to earth orbit without the orbiter dont kill anyone from now on all right miya without the orbiter what we are is immigrants hanny the blaster is the only weapon ive got how do i rescue you without killing anyone she sounded brittle they havent hurt me yet when we get air ill try to talk my way out miya said im looking over the you called them roots but i dont think so hanny theyre anchors some of them have fallen over they all fell eastward the ones still standing are already sprouting black fuzz at their torn ends i think i know whats going on here yes yes futz miya thats awesome should we be looking for two kinds of seeds i think so hanny are you glad you came lets wait on that these flying yachts keep nosing around i can dodge them but there are too many now and theyre shooting at each other and i just think ill get out of town any idea where youre likely to land ill ask the captain when we get some air maybe youd better check in with zeera that would take days ill hide and wait keep in touch there were big holes in the city big enough to see from a hundred klicks high fallen towers and fallen anchor trees and fires spreading unchecked open water glittered where a fallen tree had blocked a canal these trees had seemed mere roots when the main trunk was in place now they seemed immense bigger than any building the ship had fallen far svetz could feel an honest wind blowing now and hear the nimble of a motor the vessel didnt hover long over the city it chugged toward where a vertical thread hung from the sky miya were following the skyhook tree thats west isnt it freed of the mass of its anchor trees the tree rises the orbit expands moving westtoeast with the planets rotation the tree lags and falls behind theres nothing west of us but desert ill follow keep me posted his captors took off their helmets and sucked air like theyd never tasted it before martian suit recyclers didnt seem to be as good as space bureaus their features were narrow and their heads were long with pointed chins but they seemed quite human one crewman reached down and fumbled around svetzs head until he found how to open his bubble svetz couldnt move his entangled hands im going to faint now he said the man didnt understand of course he spoke a few words svetz said my translator must hear you speak before it can help us the man spoke at length svetz talked with the martian and breathed whenever he remembered the martian taught svetz one word at a time eyes fingers grasp breathe fall matth from noblegas the martian who was teaching him sailor middle rank svetz himself skyrunner this dirigible yacht beneath them the orbiting space elevator still drifting ahead of skyrunner with its far end sprouting silver mowers was the hangtree aft was hangtree city the air was preindustrial and thin breathe but there wasnt enough carbon dioxide in his blood breathe he revived because theyd closed his helmet and miya was shouting in his ear hanny answer ive been unconscious his arms were still bound his translator had a pickup outside the helmet it must have heard whatever was said storing the sounds without understanding im having one of i host days svetz said miya said ride it out matth was answering too the translator hiccuped and said why do svetz throw the svetz guessed and bellowed his answer to get it through the bubble why did i throw the flight stick yes buy your life with it you hurt my flight stick i thought it would hurt us i bought all our lives another martian shouted matth i tried to net it he displayed a net with a black hole burned through it the flare would have killed many of us matth nodded svetz did you make that happen no miya im turning down the volume matth said you are slave to the ship now your life you must give for the safety of skyrunner there was no question in his voice and no doubt did martians become slaves that easily it would explain why he had been rescued not killed why did you sleep matth asked you opened my helmet and left me with not enough breath matth made an intuitive leap you come from where the air is different another world earth tes from earth svetz was growing hoarse matth free my hands i can make my voice loud with your hands matth considered swear not to attack us or skyrunner i swear swear for your friends he couldnt really vouch for miya and zeera had a bloodthirsty streak he said it anyway i swear matth freed him svetz stood up he twiddled the volume control and asked can you hear me yes said matth and miya good the deck surged with little gusts of wind just enough to throw his balance off lower gravity seemed to make it worse there were handholds all about him and a rope along the decks rim svetz wobbled forward handhold to handhold seeking a better view he said i see other sky ships matth said those are enemies svetz lowered his helmet over his head and zoomed the closest is bigger than skyrunner the next two are about our size and one of them has big crabs all over the deck they are part of the something wasnt translated the ships further back are too slow they wont catch us some of them look like the lens of an eye i cant tell how big they are i count fifteen total you have good eyes you said the crabs are part of something several kinds of men gathered to make hangtree city the the translator hesitatedallied peoples there is a prophecy svetz the world will dry and die we hoped to use the hangtree to lift ourselves to space when did the hangtree come when lord pfee was a child lord pfee a martian answered from a higher platform matth i have a vessel to fight matth went to join him the two spoke presently lord pfee bellowed a string of orders then came with matth to join svetz lord pfee asked can you see great distances yes what do you want to know tell me what you see ahead nothing but desert svetz zoomed his view some rightangle patterns just at the horizon right by a few degrees might be foundations for a city behind us two ships our size and one twice as long and more flat all at about our altitude theyre pacing each other now and theyre all closer than they were the markings where would i look for them never mind i see what you mean its a hand finders spread painted across the bow all three ships miya misread his hesitation brightly painted cloth on a mast or pole svetz knew that i see them theyre flapping i cant read them at all blue on the big one the same pattern on a little one and the other one is yellow and red svetz looked up the banner flapping above him was yellow and black none like yours one of the lens shapes is catching up lord pfee asked weapons i dont know what to look for the ships all have little holes in front the big ship has two and there are tubes on deck that look like they can turn lord pfee nodded he barked rapid orders to matth matth left svetz asked tell me how the hangtree came lord pfee peered at him suspiciously if i take this glass thing off you you die yes it might take an hour but hed be unconscious unable to save himself what you threw away wasnt it to keep a secret from us i thought it might explode and kill me werent you told yes what of this the rocket pack for flight on the tree yes svetz wobbled across deck to where theyd mounted it he showed lord pfee how to work the rockets and this needle gun these needle crystals dissolve in blood it puts animals to sleep enemies too but only from close not a useful thing tell me how the hangtree came i do have a ship to fight svetz still come lord pfee led him up a ladder to a railed balcony i can command from here you can use your farvision to keep me informed what is your interest in the hangtree we hope to lift vessels into the sky to the other planets yes the allied peoples thought so too chapter lord feshk ruled a city of many thousands where two canals nossed i was his fourth son out of fourteen lord pfee said few of us are left a city of a hundred thousand or more svetz decided as he lintened and hundreds of klicks of canals bordered by farming land lord pfee wasnt counting slaves children women elderly or maimed only men who could fight when lord pfee was three peculiar blackheaded plants were found growing around the edge of a canal ten years later they were a mighty grove that partly blocked i he canal they threatened a bridge of great age and beauty lord feshk ordered them cut down beneath woody silverbrown bark they were stronger than any metal made on mars uprooting them would have involved digging out a canal lord feshk didnt order that he thought he had something valuable he built a fortress twenty manheights above the ground with the alien grove as his pillars when lord pfee was seven a black string floated down from the sky children watched it wavering through the grove blown by winds but always returning we chased it for days i was still young enough to enjoy climbing ultimately it got tangled in the black trees and there it clung no man could see how high it led over years the trees bowed inward crumpling lord feshks fortress until the tops of every tree in the clump had grown into a single knot around the dangling string that grew to a thick silvergray vine children were told not to pull on it they did that anyway and it held their weight a century passed lord pfee do you mean a hundred martian years yes i was married and a landholder and had four girls by then and what had been a black string hanging from the sky grew thick and thicker until it and the anchor grove merged into one vast trunk the black tufts became a ragged black collar that rose to the edge of space with the growing of the anchor grove more black foliage ran up the hangtrees silverbrown hank savants came from all over mars to study the hangtree lord feshk didnt like them he taxed those who came and restricted their movements until the races of mars allied and attacked his city we were killed or scattered lord feshks children my sisters married theyre safe and they know my secret i and my few remaining brothers and our children rule homes buried in a desert but we found you on the tree did you join this allied peoples lord pfee spoke with the reluctance of a criminal confessing we scavenged a city abandoned when its water source dried up we found wealth to build a few airships and modify them for vacuum we unburied their gate marked in ancient runes whose meaning was madness green cross on a featureless desert we scavenged the name too and joined the allied peoples as green cross but i wear lord feshks face lord pfee tapped his silver mask now tilted back on his head we all wear our ancestors faces we have not forgotten who killed our father when word came that creatures had crossed from another world we sensed opportunity a man shouted lord pfee left him abruptly there was a mast svetz zoomed on its peak to find an observer tending a mounted tube lord fesk was bellowing thinly gesturing widely at men tending a similar tube on a rigid mounting they were playing with objects feeding small pointed cylinders into a feed belt for the tube lord pfee returned and spoke as if they had never been interrupted allied peoples comprises five toolbuilding species including the insect giants the tunnel crabs and their mindless symbiote carriers the smiths and the softfingers and ourselves most of mars accepts the prophecy that the world will dry and die the high folk counsel us to accept our fate but the allied peoples would change that future some factions babble of settling earth svetz would you give them help or war svetz said it wouldnt matter you couldnt stand or walk or light under the pull of the earth ive heard that too and some babble of siphoning water from a large iceshelled moon ofthe translator hiccupedsaturn when i was a child we had no notion that that world had moons or rings miya broke in europa is lighter than mars its water under an ice shell hanny you could position a tether with its center of mass in the second lagrange point with europa between it and jupiter europas tidelocked so youd still have an orbital tower svetz relayed most of that and people of your world could move around there too their plan is not mad no im worried about your sky ships though how do you lift we use a gas that pulls up when irradiated with the sixth kind of light inert the gas is still lighter than air that is weird svetz said bizarre but if it works by lifting away from the mass of a planet then you cant get to europa between the worlds youd be adrift the softfingers use something else something secret rockets do you mean like the recoil of a gun is that what you use can you teach us svetz said i can do that lord pfee is that one of the high folk indicating the skeletal giant on the mast yes ignore him he is with skyrunner but not of it with the allied peoples but not of it man when we fought to reach you on the hangtree we hoped for more from you than a weapon that puts animals to sleep if theyre close enough what would your people pay for your life ransom he heard the gap the translator didnt have that martian word pfee spoke and ransom the translator agreed weapons or wealth or ideas power to take back hangtree city we must com nand the hangtree itself i suppose to hold the city we might nile in tandem my people and your men of earth but have you anything to offer rockets eventually but maybe i can buy my way free now t might be worth his life lord pfee give me some object you dont need anymore lord pfee spoke to a warrior the enemy shipstheyre rising svetz said lord pfee laughed why so they are and he went below deck what happened then looked like group madness twelve men boiled out from below deck all wearing pressure suits like golden armor they replaced men at various stations those disappeared below the ship surged upward smoke and fire puffed from the nose of one of the enemy ships railing along the leftward side of skyrunner splintered then the other ships fired too the big tubes made a guttural drumbeat boom some of the crew fired devices that were more like needle guns svetz heard their higherpitched snap and a flurry of snaps from oncoming ships it all sounded distant harmless near vacuum was eating the sound but impact weapons chewed the rails and the masts the crewman who was carrying svetzs needle gun sprayed red mist and screamed a diminuendo behind the calm of his silver mask the skeletal alien clung to a mast and watched lord pfee emerged with his mask closed he shouted through it theyre trying to get above skyrunner fools we can rise higher than they were stripped to leave the air entirely he handed svetz a double handful of vertebrae as big as a mans a terwheeel was our dinner two days back will these do svetz ignored lord pfees evident amusement yes you should not see what i do next it nibbles my mind that i should not leave you alone svetz svetz shrugged youll have to fight your ship set me a guard you can trust with wealth i do not have even one man to spare lord pfee decided he closed his silver mask and began moving about the sky ship giving his commands in sign language he stopped briefly beside the high folk observer svetz felt his suit contracting in near vacuum as for the following ships two had fallen away the largest was spraying vermilion but a ship marked with yellow and red lifted to keep pace while its crew threw mass overboard and one of the lensshapes had come much nearer svetz opened his trade kit and suddenly realized that the observer was squatting beside him all bones inside a heatinsulating huff of tiny white feathers its knees higher than its head it made no signs and didnt try to speak as instructed svetz ignored him he fished out the superconducting net and wrapped it around the bones from dinner and sealed the edge he started the conversion sequence skyrunner tilted far forward svetz squealed and rescued the trade kit without releasing his scissorslock on a mast miya what was that svetz said were in a battle id better tie myself down he still had the net ive been following your ship hanny but youve gone way above me keep me posted miya they havent briefed me on their plans skyrunners nose gun fired the sound was almost lost to vacuum but svetz felt the deck jump the ships below were firing but their missiles were fighting gravity skyrunner fired again and again the big ship sprayed vermilion and sank a missile struck skyrunners side the trade kit had finished its work svetz took the altered vertebrae out and stowed the kit two ships below skyrunner were both falling altitude was a major advantage here but the redandyellowmarked ship was pacing skyrunner the lens had come in range too it looked like two silver woks set edge to edge with a small glass dome on the upper surface skyrunner rocked to another hit sailorsecond matth crossed the deck at a runandclimb making full use of every handhold matth stopped by svetz from his bellow the translator picked out weapon buy your life and freedom svetz handed him an altered vertebra it hadnt gained mass it was porous gold now it would melt down into a much smaller ingot gold matth turned it in his hands twisted it and broke it what shall we do with this push it down their throats he flipped the pieces overboard mars has all the gold we need he was off at a half run half climb sprinting from handhold to handhold svetz caught a flicker and turned in time to see what happened next the silver lens jetted a tight column of flame very like miyas blasters flame grazed the right side of skyrunner and ripped it from bow to stern skyrunner shuddered and was the center of a luminous vermilion cloud the lurch and roll caught sailorsecond matth off balance and then matth was in flight flapping wildly miya ill be down shortly svetz murmured he felt the right side of the ship his side sink no hurry miya caught something in his voice hanny once upon a time it had begun to bother him that all of the people he met in the past were dead when he told zeera his problem her take was quite different theyre not dead hanny nobodys dead if you dont believe me go back and talk to them hanny whats happening he told her he was hanging from a horizontal mast that projected from the vertical deck of a ship the ship was falling toward noonday mars with red desert below one tank was still lifting it wasnt enough in a few minutes he was going to be dead the crackle of gunfire paused then became a continuous rattle the remaining sailors were those who had found handholds now they saw no reason to reserve ammunition skyrunner lurched to two quick impacts from the big guns of the redandyellow sky ship skyrunner was falling and then it was really falling svetz released the net that bound him and cast it as a line for climbing those hours on the tree were all the experience hed had in free fall and hed better use them now too soon skyrunner would be in the winds martian sailors watched him two then three began crawling up the vertical deck svetz reached his rocket pack the three didnt like that they moved toward him a little less timidly a little faster as he wiggled into the harness the rocket pack was built to maneuver in free fall not to fly it would thrust at half an earth gravity it must be almost empty svetz burnt another teaspoon of fuel jetting down to pluck his needle gun from a dead martian tethered to the underside railing for an instant he might have gone further where was matth svetz zoomed his view of a hundred falling dots scattered across red mars some were debris some were men and several of those were flailing skyrunner had not lost lift quite soon enough for matth he would reach mars ahead of skyrunner svetz could never have reached him the sky ship was slowly tumbling crew were crawling up the vertical deck to tether themselves along the railing svetz clung where he was but he didnt tie himself miya mind if i talk this out brief me always talk it out im high enough to be in vacuum in a ship that has a tank of some light gas along either side the gas lifts if its irradiated with what sounds like a laser its antigravity not our version now the right tanks ruptured left side isnt lifting either if that tanks been shot open too then were just another crater what do the martians think of all this svetz watched a crewman tying himself in place they were all lined up along the left railing many of the silver masks were turned toward svetz some had guns but all wore swords theyve all tied themselves in place against the crash ive been rescuing my belongings they havent decided what to think of that lord pfee was still belowdecks where the controls must be miya asked where art you planning to hit planning well heres something below us a crater showing under the sand with markings around the rim like the blueprints for a city maybe its a buried city you might not see it from ground level ill watch o futz ftuz futz hanny he shouted in joy were lifting i knew it ships were shooting at us lord pfee dropped us away from them now hes turned on the lift again its just one side well still crash thats why theyre all clustered along whats going to be the top i dont think thatll save them the dead men watched him fascinated an alien talking to himself in vacuum and moments from death he watched the desert come up at him and when it was very close svetz fired the rocket pack and jumped he balanced facedown as flame roared past his ribs a martian snatched at his ankle as he went by and missed the man drew his firearm and sent a quick shot after svetz then he was rising above skyrunner but mars was rising faster chapter he couldnt see he could hear though a voice yammered in his ear hanny i saw you come down but i cant find you hanny he was bruised everywhere his back hurt something hot was burning his elbow he tried to push away from it that pulled his face out of the sand and then he saw sunset light in the triumph of the moment he bellowed i still live where the sun was high right on the tooclose horizon were the sunset colors hed seen below a navy blue sky closer yet sky runner looked like a glass bottle dropped on pavement a big bird flight stick and orange rider were circling the wreck miya im not in the sky yacht oh good it was getting some lift but near the end i used the rocket pack i think i ran dry i hit like a bomb but not as hard as they did svetz stood up testing taking his time that hurt in reasonable gravity hed never have made it but broken bones would be a deeper hurt and what had burned his elbow was a rocket nozzle there you are can you walk worth a try he took a few tentative steps i can walk thats good because we only have one flight stick she hovered above him i thought you were dead hanny theyre all dead im not surprised are you all right i didnt learn anything in hangtree town you got lucky this allied peoples sounds like something we want to join why theyve been exploring the tree for a century they must know where to find seeds and its not as if were protecting earth hanny a martian couldnt stand up in earth gravity and these people were cosmonauts like miya stillthey take ransom slaves too dont trust them until we have to she looked at him doubtfully are you always this distrustful maybe she changed the subject i think you were right about a buried city its ten klicks west of here so its on the way lets give it a look he limped across a crescent dune then another watched by miya hovering left and above then a wide arc of roughedged rock miya meteor crater right mars has a lot of these he favored his left ankle there might be cracked ribs among all the other aches and bruises fatigue softened the sensations and martian gravity softened the load he staggerdanced lightheaded and lightbodied feeling a bit drunk above a horizon that was knifesharp and too close the tip of the skyhook tree still showed as a spray of silver blossoms a small crescent rode above it a line of gourds faced the sun each as tall as a small man something odd about them or about the lighting or just their presence on a lifeless desert it was out of their path but svetz turned toward them miya was amused youve got energy to spare curiosity curiosity to spare svetz said no wonder they looked funny they were black where they faced the sun in the shade they were pale chameleons evolved to conserve heat he was moving too slowly for miya so she zipped over to see the grove for herself the grove lurched into motion scattering at turtle speed startled miya almost plowed into a dune she returned and settled ahead of him just animals hanny whats our interest here you ride for a while she handed him her flight stick there was a bag tied to the shaft svetz hefted it heavy seeds he zipped the bag open shed collected five yellow globes big as a fist and heavier than earthly fruit their rinds felt like ceramic they had an apples dimple and the melted stump of a stem she said now all we have to do is get home he climbed onto the flight stick why hadnt she put him on the flight stick first assessing her partners fitness or attitude miya walked briskly with a disconcerting bounce in her step that she brought under control by leaning forward svetz floated above her she leaned farther her feet pushing back and farther until she was running almost parallel to the sand he had to speed up he could hear her huffing breath but the skintight suit slowed her not at all the dustpuffs of her footfalls were two meters apart she ran up the slope of a dune that blocked her path crossed the lip and was airborne for more than a second her laughter rang in his helmet and he joined in youre wonderful to watch he said practice two years jet some rest then ill teach you another crescent moon rose behind the slender trunk in a few minutes it emerged from behind the trunk and hurtled up the sky miya ive been watching well those moons are both bigger than the pair of wasted little captured asteroids weve been living with i know hanny she slowed to talk they dont look like that on presentday mars maybe its an atmospheric effect some kind of optical illusion moonlight filtered through stratospheric ice crystals has anyone ever figured out why earths moon looks bigger when its close to the horizon no we were right about the solar sails though the hangtree is trying to steer itself i wonder where it wants to go it left a set of roots at hangtree city svetz said and seeds for more but thats where it got hurt maybe itll drop seeds in some safer place or just move out and away back where it came from its built to settle planets i think were looking at a piece of genetic engineering by a race with techniques way ahead of ours hut mars is ideal for an orbital tower low gravity high spin means the tree doesnt have to be as long or as strong it wont find anything else that good in the solar system it must have come from some other star hanny whats its secondbest choice earth miya began to run again the horizon was a symphony of reds a vertical black line crossed a hot white point the sun near setting they did not at first realize that they were running through a city nothing showed in the billows of sand and harder dirt beneath but the path of least resistance was a lowlands that ran straight as an arrow then miyas foot plunged through the surface past her knee and her chest hit the ground hard svetz settled he would have leapt off the flight stick to help her but he could barely move miya thinking of trapdoor spiders he worked the needle gun off his back she wiggled her leg loose stretched it and bent it then she looked into the hole its eaten out under the surface she said only water does that hanny there was water here her hand felt around in the hole then came out with black refuse feels like old dry leaves or moss she stamped again turf collapsed under her heel and fine sand flowed in like oil hiding all evidence he asked want to fly for a while no im fine she began to run again svetz limped along on foot leaning on the floating flight stick for support not trying to keep up his cramping began to ease up he wasnt trying to prove anything just getting the feel of what was around him it had worked for him in earths past here stuck in a sausage skin miya hows your recycler doing no problems all in one motion svetz threw back his bubble helmet took a limp transparent bag from an inner pocket and pulled it over his head he sealed it around his neck tasting of just the least whiff of alien air the filter helmet inflated the air tasted fine with proper traces of carbon oxides nitrogen oxides and petrochemicals something martian was still seeping through the semipermeable membrane meteor dust dust of alien plants and aeons of time a bit too heavy on the carbon compounds now he could hear a thin wind brushing over low dunes and crater rims a lonely sound you all right miya asked fine then whats the point nothing lasts forever i dont know where the flaws are in these pressure suit recyclers i trust a filter helmet makes sense miya imitated him now they walked with their bubble helmets thrown back svetzs footfalls jarred echoes from below him hed heard that sound a few minutes ago and not quite noticed nowi think were walking on a roof he said is that what you were expecting dont know miya shrugged she drew her blaster svetz backed up a dune slope to give her room at a touch of the trigger sand exploded outward then flowed into a conical hole the dune flowed downhill into it they backed away as the cone deepened then the flow eased and yellow light was shining out of the sand svetz wondered troglodytes clavius base is like this they could be human hold up miya said they waited for angry martians to come boiling out when that didnt happen svetz said i want a look here take the blaster wait the backblast no needles get your helmet up itll stop a bullet svetz poked his helmet and needle gun into the hole nobody home the floors five meters down i guess they didnt like bumping their heads some of the walls were transparent he was near one of those there was a silver pool below him like quicksilver or molten silver as big as a babys bassinet i dont want to go straight down he said you dont either are you carrying line yes here he went in feet first with a line in his hand he swung back and forth then dropped onto bare floor between a pair of small couches chapter they had a house of crystal pillars on the planet mars by the edge of an empty sea the martian chronicles by ray bradbury their counters were clicking but there werent enough rads to hurt them miya traced the radiation to lights that glowed in the walls and ceiling she looked them over and said hanny theres no way to replace these bulbs he speculated theyre supposed to last as long as the house miya kicked a wall of pink stone it was meters thick that could be forever look where the corners are rounded on the stairs and the walls there where people would brush against them futz they werent ever expecting a new brand of light bulb light gleamed off pink sand beyond a glass wall they climbed into a red stone tower via a spiral stair its peak was just above the sand tall narrow windows around the top faced in seven directions time had etched the glass arrow slits i dont think they worried about lasers they looked in vain for an escape tunnel or an airlock to keep sand out the desert had come unexpectedly then again there were no bones miya took the temperature of the pool of silver lava c hanny its a stove thats a perfect cooking temperature and still hot check for rads it is radioactive stay clear still think its a stove cosmic rays and thinner air martians might not be afraid of radiation wrap the food in foil or just dip it and let the hot metal drip off i dont see any spatulas or forks would they just pick cooked food out of that with their fingers clearly there was no householder to attack them they never found anything like a toilet maybe the sand had buried an outhouse opaque walls surrounded the back of the house here were two closetsized rooms doorless separated by a mirror wall in its center a frieze of two spindly human shapes wrestling having sex miya said in masks and touched the frieze with her fingertips the wall turned transparent another touch opaqued it privacy they could take it or leave it where are the beds svetz wondered miya shrugged they took the beds with them or they disintegrated or there werent any because mars gravity is so light svetz found a touch plate gray fog seeped from the floor they backed out fast fog filled the room to half a meter deep at the doorless doorway it hovered like a breaking wave svetz watched for a time then reached into it it sagged under his hand congealed into foam like a toosoft mattress he threw himself into it it held his weight he cried miya is this or is this not a bed hanny we have a mission weve learned as much as we can here there was a snap in her voice he looked at her face to see if she meant it she did chagrined he rolled out theres certainly something we havent learned before they left he got the other room to generate another bed of semisolid fog twin bedrooms no doors no closets he would have liked to ask they climbed out the way they came teach me to run svetz said are you up to that i can always stop start by walking now youre bouncing too high feel it you want to stay closer to the ground reach out with your feet lean forward a little now start pushing back with your toes he tried to keep his run level following curves to avoid upanddown leaning way over to take a curve miya flew alongside his knee and back and ribs were easing up they still hurt hed gel medical attention when they reached mons olympus they kept to the heights theyd seen that the old canal was treacherous footing thin air had him gasping but he ran for half an hour before he had to stop then miya walked alongside him not using tinflight stick presently she asked what are you singing dont know a tune was running through his head the music was there and the thoughts but the words didnt quite fit float past all our days he sang and reached farther and found only we dare not face the oceans loss a change already come the worlds long death must never harm this stove these lights our home we build to hide ourselves from time a stone and crystal wall and time will float past all our days along the grand canal doggerel its not quite right yet ocean never mind that why are you singing im happy it was true a grin was pulling his face out of shape he let it have its way why the gravity made every few footsteps a dance i fell twenty thousand klicks and im alive im healing im on mars you dont care about mars hanny i talked to zeera youre itrs best operative but youre afraid all the time youre no explorer you tried to back out why am i singing then hey how would i know but i do miya was that or was that not the last native martian bed you will ever see in your life and it wasnt any kind of a record you wanted it was me that was then you could have said something you didnt have to wait until we were moving through time that was then the song still played through his head lyrics writhing around a theme yes things change but she had loved him how big a town was this do you think svetz pointed down toward the dry canal the canals that cross at hangtree city werent any bigger than this look smooth then rectilinear lumps on the far side buried buildings that shallow bulge city hall hanny do you regard yourself as mission oriented is that a cosmonauts term he thought about it history isnt like astronomy miya my briefings tend to be totally futzed ive had to rethink my goal on every mission even this one weve got the seeds that grow the anchor trees right are we still looking for the seeds that grow the hangtree not on the martian surface i wouldnt think and you dont think that big bulge could be a granary or a library she didnt answer we dont know how to find hangtree seeds what they look like or even if the allied peoples have a billion of them in storehouses ready to launch at europa her voice was turning brittle again we cant read martian hanny its not a library anyway likely its something we dont have a word for but you have to look miya you dont find anything if you dont look we searched the hangtree first you dream then you look in a hundred wrong places maybe one of those buried buildings is your library and somewhere there are picture books or comic books and in one of those you find pictures of the hangtree and some seed clusters and a closeup of a seed or maybe you find something you never expected at all a seed storehouse no not that why store them at all let the tree deal with them we were probably looking at the wrong end what think like a tree now youre anchored deep in the watery soil of mars you grew an anchor grove and then linked to it and now its a part of you your roots close on the bedrock way down you grow more anchor trees in case you lose your anchor and have to reattach you make hangtree seeds too orbiter seeds because willy gorky needs them but are you putting them in orbit why you already have mars why do you want competition you want your children on other worlds yes if s what you were made for so you drop your orbiter seeds from the upper end the far tip is swinging round at better than escape velocity it flings them at the stars a long moment passed they were both panting then how long have you been thinking like this hanny only just it always feels like i should have known right away but it can take forever i have to go down all these blind alleys first i eventually get it all right im starting to see what zeera meant svetz was starting to wish hed heard that conversation all wed need to do is go get them miya said take up position beyond the high end of the hangtree and catch what falls hanny whats wrong with this picture you tell me it feels wrong throw seeds all over the sky its a strategy that works on earth works on a planet but hanny the sky is bigger than that futz miya you cant steer a seed ahh miya drew it out a long sigh willy and his seeds were hung up on seeds all right we still need to get to mons olympus four thousand klicks across amazonis but we can do it i dont know our fuel situation maybe zeeras already taken care of that and she would say no more theyd been following the crests of three interlocked craters the broad dusty road that had been a canal cut through two of them and time had worn them near to nothing but the largest and latest impact had fallen on the canal itself svetz thought to find water hacked up behind the blockage but it was dry on both sides hanny why didnt we go look under that bulge because we dont split up and this is a space mission and youve been on mars and i havent they walked for a time then she said hanny i didnt realize you were taking my orders this is an itr mission too if you think about it youve seen more aliens than i have preindustrial humanity isnt like us theyre closer to nature theyre surrounded by ten thousand times as many species as weve managed you want me in charge miya no answer i think zeeras the official head of mission thing is you clearly werent taking my orders so hanny she pointed beyond the next dune was another something slid over its crest like a caterpillar crossing the edge of a leaf it had far too many legs it was gone before he could see more something alive he said big what really i meant the house house where she pointed where the crater rim abruptly ended chopped through to make a canal stood a clump of crystals two were of smoky transparency two were the color of brick and the nearest was black not much like a house those structures hut now he could see the shadows of rooms and i did see something stalking us miya it looks like a caterpillar dreaming its a tiger the blaster was in her hands svetz cradled his needle gun they eased casually toward a peakthe high groundand waited doesnt have to be a predator miya said what would it eat out here what would it eat if it isnt mmm something living below the sand there he said as it came over the crest of the nearest dune for an instant he saw why such a creature might want ten legs in mars gravity the beast didnt charge off the crest and maroon itself in the air and wait to be pulled down it alowed over and down in a minimal shower of sand bending like a caterpillar its legs hugging the contours of the dune and was already much too close over the dunecrest and down to the flat and up the side of the crater it came fast it had a huge head in a collar of red fur several rows of teeth and four little tongues splayed like flower petals near the back svetz fired anesthetic needles into the things huge and gaping mouth in the last instant he twisted and leapt away the creature whipped around to follow and stumbled it tripped over its multitude of feet and one side went down and it rolled it rolled over svetz svetz half crushed caught its weight on both feet and kicked the beast snapped at what it felt under it svetz yelled as he felt teeth close on his ribs they slid off the slippery skintight and snapped shut on his silver cloak that ripped like tissue he was alive he lay as hed fallen taking stock no blood no torn flesh hed look at bruises later the needle gun didnt look broken the tenlegged predator lay twisted on itself and glassyeyed miya miya hovered on her flight stick looking down hanny he tried sitting up fine she had pulled her helmet over her head i saw another one why didnt you use the blaster hanny it was too close i lofted the flight stick and climbed on after i was up because i ddidnt want to come down after all and by then it was on you use it now svetz set his own helmet in place and looked around he would have to find a target before he could zoom on it see anything no my bruises have bruises on them he started walking he could still do that anything we do with a blaster could mark us for any aircraft miya said right will you look at this they stood like quartz crystals thirtyodd meters tall almost vertical but leaning a bit at odd angles two crystals might have been made of cut pink brick two were of smoky glass it still looked like a geological outcropping but within the glass svetz could see rooms and spiral stairs the near side of this nearest structure was a black wall painted with blurred pink silhouettes one high up had the shape of a bird or big insect three could have been human athletes a child and two adults if one adult was wearing a helmet or had a head the size of a watermelon the bigheaded one was holding a weapon or baseball mitt or jaialai basket and the fifth silhouette was a black circle a ball or discus in flight the bird was diving on it energy weapon miya said might be just paint svetz touched the childs silhouette and felt the raised edge nope the flying woks have energy weapons that could have done this they fought for the last of the water bet on it hanny lets be careful people who fight like this might set traps too we should be on the roof no we just dont use the door miya fired at a transparent wall and stepped through the hole svetz backed after her no tenlegged tigers followed them here was another pool of silver lava miya took its temperature c same as the other one i was right its for cooking up the stairs those little staggered platforms are where they ate lets stay here the beasts wont come into a house hanny is that your expert opinion would he stand behind that he would anything that thinks like a tenlegged tiger wont trap itself in this maze of rooms furthermore its my expert opinion that i need rest i dont know where youre getting your strength miya ive run out he didnt wait for an answer the sleeping rooms must be in one of the opaque towers he borrowed the blaster and shot a hole in a wall up the spiral stair were two matched cubicles bigger than closets and a glass wall with a faded obscene frieze on the glass the touch point in one room got him nothing the other deployed gray smoke that halfcongealed to a springy bed he heard miya behind him and he said mine one of us should stay on guard she said me my minds foggy do it wake me up when you cant stand it anymore he started to strip off his pressure suit just opening zips was enough to tell him that the air was martiancold he kept it on the gray foam accepted him and he slept he woke miya was on the stair with her back to him he rolled out of the foam he touched her shoulder and she jumped four hours she said its still dark out nothing threatening the moonswell look for yourself hows the bed youre going to love it he said she nodded she crawled into the foam feeling the need to stretch he went downstairs he felt elated maybe that was only the bouncy feel of mars gravity there were no windows upstairs or down the only light came from the forever bulbs he armed himself before he stepped out behind the sharp close horizon was a silver flower the hangtree with solar sails deployed that would be west then the hangtree in its higher slower orbit must be near setting above the hangtree one of the hurtling moons was a glowing disk smaller than luna but still too large he watched it for an hour or so while he stretched against yesterdays kinks and injuries the moon rose up the western sky it was pale and featureless but it was changing phase from full to a fat crescent maybe miya had guessed right that was moonlight on stratospheric ice crystals the corner of his eye caught motion he jumped straight backward through the doorway the dark shape resolved all teeth and too many legs and slammed into the jamb while svetz completed a backward somersault and jumped again straight up three meters of stairwell the beast roared like a highpitched jackhammer and pushed through into the house it was as big as the door still in flight svetz screamed back miya in case the beasts roar hadnt wakened her the curve of the stairwell caught him now that his feet had some purchase svetz reached for the needle gun on his back too slow the beast flowed up the stairs and svetz had to jump again its roar froze him and he landed badly miya must have heard the roar miya was in the bedroom door with the blaster in her hands he stumbled past her snatched at the doorway turned with needle gun in hand too late miya fired downward her backhand slapped his chest sending him into the other bedroom as the blast roared back up at them he waited until he couldnt hear anything before he crawled out the beast was gone below the upper landing both lower landings and half the stair were gone shrapnel had spattered the living space below miya said what a rush my hero he said he craned his neck to see if the flight stick had survived it looked untouched miya said there there my pretty one no danger shall harm you svetz said were doing this all wrong its dead were alive sorry about the stair no hear me out we cant walk a quarter of the way around the planet weve got one flight stick i stay here you take the flight stick to mons olympus debrief zeera and vice versa then come back here with zeeras flight stick and well fly back miya thought it over presently she nodded she said youre the boss i dont know how to give orders i was alone on every mision there has to be a boss she looked over the landings fractured edge long way down nah mars gravity he jumped she caught him by his backpack frame and lifted him youd just have to come back up she said thats right youve only had an hours sleep never mind that take off your skintight why oh miya im getting whiplash here what do you moan i thought youd made yourself pretty clear so i gave you up im not sure how often i can do that she sat down on the edge of the landing and swung her legs not looking at him you work for the itr i work for space bureau most of the time we wouldnt be in the same time or place i hadnt thought that far he sat down beside her had you thought of transferring we could ask xcages dont generally carry two crew me im not a cosmonaut but we could ask she sighed he asked you want your heros reward anyway sure she moved to kiss him through two filter helmets and caught herself she began opening zips instead svetz watched her nakedness emerge while he dealt with his own he didnt know where the zips were on a skintight pressure suit it slowed him miya opened a score of zippers in a few seconds time then started helping svetz with his suddenly she yelped its coldl svetz grinned i wondered well how the futz she saw the only answer she zipped zipped and pulled and svetz leapt naked into the sleeping room with miya on his tail she was the only warmth in the world the congealed gray fog wrapped itself partly around them and held some of their heat its still futzy cold she said well try to remember why you slept in your pressure suit oh was that it i thought i was too tired to take it off or maybe i just hadnt decided hanny but a thought finally plods across my sluggish mind zeera never saw you on a mission no of course not they had to keep the filter helmets they still couldnt kiss the gray foam impeded their lovemaking it tangled them svetz finally got enough of his arm free to reach a touch point the fog softened to mist and seeped into the floor miya pulled them together in frantic reaction to the cold and they connected and presently broke free and sprinted for the skintights how the cut did martians do this miya asked and went back into the room to look at the frieze hanny did it without the bed didnt they right kneeling the beds only for sleeping bet on it if martians had seen us theyd have laughed themselves sick well they grinned at each other then skintights werent good for coitus but they were fine for cuddling i was furious with you she said thats what i thought but i couldnt see why for letting me think you were dead miya i couldnt tell the difference myself how are you feeling now beaten there are places where i dont hurt miya whats your fantasy hanville svetz like is he taller brawnier braver than zeera thinks you are agile nonlinear thinker heals fast does he negotiate or give orders depends you talk it out when theres time hanny im describing what i see if you see that when we get home if wrona will have me chapter across the gulf of space intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes the war of the worlds h g wells after she was gone svetz tried to guess how long the flight would take moving at high altitude through mars already thin air miya could make a hundred and fifty klicks per hour mons olympus was four thousand and a bit far around the curve of the planet but with no chance of getting lost mons olympus would loom like a piece of the sky twentyfive hours give them an hour to debrief twentyfive coming back he stayed in the martian house that first day his injuries had stiffened up by noon of the second day he was beginning to starve the suit would conserve wateras the filter helmet would notbut it wouldnt feed him he had to distract himself somehow he went exploring he stayed on the bare rock crest and kept his needle gun in his hands they might have been a pack of wild dogs all hunger and teeth in the moment he glimpsed them they flowed up the rock slope in a surge that was like so many maglev trains he fired carefully into their mouths the nearest fell at his feet they were miniatures of the tenlegged killers no taller than wrona but three times as long they were dead the anesthetic had shut down their breathing he dragged two back to the house svetz dissected one talking his way through it for the record he learned little they had the wet red interiors of mammals he could identify a single longitudinal lung a stomach segued smoothly into an intestine that coiled neatly down the abdomen he cut up the second adolescent and dropped the legs into hot silver metal he had read of this that men and women had killed animals for food he didnt believe it until he lifted his filter helmet to free his mouth then the smell hit him he did not decide to eat he found himself tearing meat from the bone with his teeth it was good he nearly broke a tooth he had to learn to chew around the bone and the meat was tough but he was ravenous he made himself stop appalled at himself and waited to see if hed get sick a hour later he gorged he deepfried the rest of the legs and several strips of what he thought was muscle zipped it all into sample bags and set it outside where the martian cold would keep it night the hangtree was below the horizon not even a silver highlight now noon of the third day now he could begin to worry miya didnt answer the beam he waited through the fourth day in the afternoon there came a dust plume on the horizon svetz zoomed on a spidery crucifix moving across the desert it resolved into a lowbuilt vehicle the helmet said hello hanny is that you west of me on the ground yes i couldnt get to zeera weve only got the one flight stick but i found this miya was sailing along the dry canal there was a wheel under the open cabin and four more wheels on long springy booms and sails splayed on a mast and the booms he ran down to meet her get aboard she said i dont want to stop in one spot we might sink svetz tossed his burden in and climbed after it whats that you hungry dont ask here what is it dont ask take the wheel she examined the leg briefly then ate as hed showed her helmet back filter helmet on lift the edge of the filter helmet bite close it just keep us pointed west stick to the canal she said its light enough it wont break through the crust hanny this is good are you going to tell me he told her she asked for more zeera was pinned down with monsters all around her miya couldnt get near her theyd talked by beam is she hurt no miya said but shes given up i had trouble getting her to talk at all the crater in mons olympus was an observatory zeera had looked down into a vastness of telescope mirrors square klicks of mirrors and framework still didnt fill much of that tremendous crater the tanker was half hidden in a tangle of structures two klicks northeast of the crater rim a laboratory and army bivouac had grown up around the tanker when zeera hove into view they fired on her she flew out of their range and uphill before she brought the minim down did they damage the minim not then and not after but zeera says they could any time miya said now the minims surrounded too zeeras safe in the cabin but they shot at me as soon as i got close projectiles no theyve got blasters big heat beam projectors did you know the outer hull of the minim is a heat superconductor makes reentry easier but it also means a blast of heat wont melt holes in it did you try your blaster on them hanny i thought id better get you first instead of leaving him four thousand klicks away without air food water or transport good im still catching up here theyve got a whole laboratory around the tanker right and if s been there for years were lucky if they havent taken the tanker apart did it look all right after long silence miya asked hanny how the futz would know if they drained the tank svetz said get some sleep driving a sailcar was fun hed had days to grow used to the screaming wind it lost force now because they were racing ahead of it the car was rolling too fast to sink through the dried dust the canal was so wide that he couldnt see both rims at the same time it would be hard to hit anything a line of big birds needlenosed and wingless chased them for three or four klicks and never quite caught up svetz wondered if they were his dinner then if they were chasing their own dinner they looked to be just having fun but the nearest one seemed to be wearing miya give me a sanity check she wriggled around to look where he was pointing zoomed her faceplate that thing is wearing a belt or maybe its a collar with tools hanging on it matth said there are five sapient species in their funny alliance plus the observers this would make seven intelligent species right how could this many all evolve together cant miya said they could evolve separately svetz mused its another quantum mechanical thing im tired hanny what are you talking about time lines merging yes just before everything ends for this whole world like virtual particles no investigator is supposed to see this but were seeing it maybe were not supposed to be here either but miya was asleep in the morning she remembered nothing of big needlenosed birds wearing tool belts come night miya wanted to keep moving they mounted her flashlight on the roof pointing straight up she hovered above him on the flight stick in the beam while svetz sailed at midnight they switched miya made him take the blaster he showed her how to use the needle gun at dawn miya slept again she didnt wake until near sunset svetz got an hours sleep before night fell and then they both had to be awake to drive after two days of driving she was caught up on sleep dawn he flew above dark green canyons cutting through red desert far ahead was a row of something repetitive he took his time descending pyramids the row began above the canal and the first was no bigger than a fist each that followed was larger and each had been broken open the row descended to the canal floor as if tinarchitects had mindlessly followed the disappearing water the line continued built on the floor of what had been a canal these last could hardly be ancient tombs more like row houses the last was as big as a mansion and the peak was missing they gave it a wide and wary berth they were already past when svetz saw a skinny arm emerge from the pyramid with a rounded brick in its hand midnight miya brought the flight stick down to the aft boom tied it walked forward they traded places at the wheel svetz crawled back along the boom he didnt have miyas balance and it was very dark svetz flew high the tiny flashlight on the sailcar was a bright pinprick on black land a moon ghosted overhead west to east phobos a featureless pale lamp much larger than any tiny captured asteroid stratospheric ice crystals its light illuminated nothing until hed flown for hours until his night vision began to adjust below wide to the left and far aft motion reflected the moonlight svetz moved out of the sailcars flashlight beam he could still see the light as a wobbly line of lesser darkness in his peripheral vision an intruder in the sky was catching up with them their paths slowly converging miya how you doing hanny we have company turn the flashlight off already the intruder was an enemy strangers met during his trips to earths past had usually been suspicious jumpy ready to kill a man who didnt dress like they did he used his faceplate to zoom on the intruder he got a jittery image of a smoothsurfaced silver lens one ship big i think flying doublewok rounded with no decks not the same style as skyrunner was some other race what had matth called them skyrunner had been destroyed by a ship like this armed with a heat cannon the intruder was nearly alongside svetz but far to the left svetz dropped the zoom at once he saw the second ship flyeven higher than svetz and just above the larger ship tending it he watched it for some time before he saw it swing right abandoning its post for something more interesting the second intruder had seen miya svetz saw the lensship tilt nearly to vertical saw an aperture open in the rim and that was enough its after you he said hed been keeping the blaster in a zipped pocket he drew it carefully knowing how much he didnt want to drop it shoot it miya demanded he fired way ahead of you the smaller ship rocked in the jet of flame it fired a wild actinic jet of its own not a laser it spread too much but it didnt spread like a rocket exhaust maybe a plasma jet held together by its own magnetic fields for an instant it held and then the flying wok flared svetz saw i he ship shred itself inside a dying fireball he lifted he could do that by touch there was nothing solid above him eyes aboard the large intruder might have seen him when he fired as the point on a line of white plasma but now he would be only a dark dot on the sky hanny report i saw i got the little ship the big one had to have seen me im lifting theyll try to chase me theres no chance theyll find you until dawn if youll just turn off that futzy flashlight i did why not just shoot them down i blinded myself she didnt say anything theres nothing that can hurt me this high he said ill just wait for my sight to come back good plan miya sounded jittery look if you dont find me then just keep west to mons olympus get to the minim right he couldnt see it was chilly without his cloak but no worse than chilly the flight stick flew on altitude unknown miya called not much later i saw where the wreck hit im going to look it over bad idea svetz said in and out quick trust me it felt like hours passed before she spoke again what did your rebels call them softfingers ive found parts of at least four bodies they look like dryskinned octopuses theyve got ten arms with no bones in them theyre bigger than men oversized heads with an external skull and big bulging eyes the undersurfaces of the tentacles are thick with callus right up to the shoulder the underside of the pressure suit is a curved plate a skid i pried one up its covering the air supply the mouth is on the bottom pause hanny do you remember gorkys maps from footage taken by the descending tanker gorky had made maps of every size theyd all studied them so that they could find the tanker remember a white rock formation on mons olympus it looked chopped sculpted but no special shape well that was a softfingers skull charming hanny i found rolls of mirror cloth its solar sail material harvested from the skyhook trees leaves an innocent cargo ship they had one futz of an energy weapon aye aye but i sure hope we know what were doing miya get out of there before they come to bury their dead you dont know they right something blurred and bright floated in his sight joy flooded through him his sight was returning he watched it for a time trying to guess its size and distance miya is it still night where you are sure how high are you i can see the curve of the planet an arc of light without detail and i can see mons olympus the craters rim was aflame with dawn no mistaking it now though his sight was still blurry go for it chapter he said zeera and waited these were the foothills of mons olympus the mountain looked like a tilted continent from this close zeera should be in line of sight hanville svetz calling zeera southworth for the institute for temporal research zeera answer svetz hi zeera whats happening they shoot at me when i try to take off if i try to work the airlock they shoot sometimes when i look out how many where are they can you see them they shoot at me when i look theyve got things like blasters but big how much damage have you taken i cant tell maybe none the blaster only shoots heat beams i think and it recharges in ten minutes there are two at least the minims hull superconducts heat it can take that much energy and radiate it away before they can fire again but my engines overheat and shut down and i fall about a meter i did it twice more i thought youd need the data id need you miya somebodyl he heard the edge of hysteria in her voice she wanted rescue he said well im here just stay away youll go like an ice cube in coffee i cant leave things the way they are well starve youve got all the food zeera did the tanker look ruptured not ruptured but they took off one of the landing motors and tested it zeera said and they built a kind of token wall around the nuclear pile radiation must have made someone sick they didnt cut the cable no theyre letting it run who am i fighting i started a war coming down the people around the tanker were human these things with all the arms and no bones theyre astronomers im not guessing svetz they use radio i tuned in and used the translator there was some kind of longterm truce the men had the tanker and the astronomers softfingers softfingers had the telescopes but they both saw the minim come down and that set things off i heard them fighting over me sanity check svetz said you hovered above the crater because you wanted to see the telescope setup the softfingers saw you then then you went into a landing pattern over the tanker they fired on you yes the men they had impact weapons i put some mountain between me and them fast but i could see the astronomer ships coming down at me theyve got aircraft like two saucers set lip to lip they were blasting the camp around the lander when i got out of sight one came after me he got me with a heat cannon my engines started to shut down i hit the override and got down as fast as i could and ive been here since okay stay put im on it the astronomers killed most of the people and kept the rest as the translator says slaves hanny what are you going to do maybe i shouldnt tell you if you heard them they could listen to us svetz didnt believe they could translate but he didnt have a plan either he was well up mons olympus now just a few klicks high though that still put him above where a man could breathe he might still be too small to notice but as soon as he fired a blaster theyd be after him the tanker had taken pictures all the way down gorky had maps of every size and svetz had studied them for months he didnt expect to have trouble finding the tanker but where was it he could not keep circling forever in hope that something would look familiar wait now he knew that white rock formation from gorkys maps miya had dissected a softfinger and she said this was the shape of its skull so the tanker should be there svetz looked for a compact silver bullet shape the tanker was moonbuilt motors turbines compressors and the nuclear pile to power them but most of its volume would be tanks it was there it was nearly hidden in a maze made up of ladders and pipes and flattened spheres a long silver line of cable that led to the nuclear power source on its tractor treads a dismounted rocket motor braced against a hillside and a score of little buildings too pretty to be prefabs too hastily built to be houses martian work in the style of hangtree town and two bigger structures that looked more like beehives still he could not imagine how hed missed the tanker it sat on the highest flat spot the tankers computer could find space bureau wouldnt hide the fuel it would take to get their samples home zeera i have the tanker in view tell me again how you get them to shoot at you any time i try to take off any time the airlock door wiggles sometimes if they see me in the flight dome they blast a granite outcropping im right under it so the rocks around you would be covered with scorch marks would they yeah look for kind of a big rounded granite skull they shoot it any time i poke my head into the flight dome they shot the eyeholes first now theyre shooting just over my head and making gaps for teeth human skull hed found another little beehive high above the tanker beside what might be a heat cannon though hed never seen a weapon like that one a line ran down to a patch of black cloth or paint heat radiator he flew wide around zeera couldnt have flown very far and she hadnt the human brain is configured to turn random patterns into faces the moment he glimpsed a skull carved into the granite cliff he dropped then eased the flight stick uphill he was rising up an arc of ridge maybe part of an old meteoroid impact mountains werent immune the ridge might hide him he eased up the slope then veered away fast at the crest was another beehiveshaped building he followed the ridge around and came up at the other end the minim was in a shallow dish the impact point of that old meteor strike it was about the same size as the tanker most of the minim must be tanks too he knew how cramped the skimpy cabin was the cone at the top was the flight dome hed expected to see zeera inside but he didnt the beehive hut had the minim in full view and a good view of the blasted cliff through a doorone meter tall two meters widehe could see a small telescope pointed at the minim the heat cannon was a big tube on a massive swivel what must be a control chair was mounted in the swivel behind the tube a black stripnot a cable more like a line of paintled to a broad black patch on the slope below fine zeera hanny wiggle the airlock door for me why she chopped it off svetz didnt watch the minim he wasnt looking straight at the gun either hed been blinded once already he watched for the line of flame that speared down from the granite skull and bathed the minim svetz said wait it out then stand up in the dome eyes closed the flame died he looked up the granite mountainside past the crudely blasted skull pattern and found the wok ship perched above the eye sockets a point on its rim was glowing orange brighter than sunlight now stand up wave he said if zeera was right the wok ship couldnt fire again there was no second blast good thank you zeera svetz said measuring angles with his eye two guns shed said theyd held the second in reserve and that had to mean that there wasnt a third right he took careful aim on the wok ship and fired immediately he lifted and dropped below the ridge swept around the curve and rose on the blind side of the beehive hut fired and held his aim the hut flared into a rising fireball and behind the fireball was the heat cannon glowing orange and red and flame colors streaming from the control chair where there had been a softfinger gunner the wreckage of the wok ship was still rolling downhill svetz rose into full view held the pose for a long moment lifted at two earth gee looped and dove behind the ridge again circled far around and rose making himself a target nothing open the airlock he said already diving and get me a ration bar at the last moment he veered hard loopedstill no heat blastsettled into the airlock and punched the cycle point he was aiming through the outer door until it had actually closed hed done it the inner door opened zeera gaped at him from one of the command chairs he was gasping for air that wasnt getting through the filter helmet fast enough he pulled it off and took the ration bar out of her hand he went through them as fast as possible the things hed planned if he got this far eat stuff more ration bars in his pockets for himself and miya he ate steadily and talked through a full mouth zeera find the maps the tanker made coming down zeera nodded where hed been expecting joy and gratitude she only looked exhausted but she set to work presently she had the display he remembered complete with willy gorkys overlaid contour lines and notes yes now zeera what did you see coming in sketch it for me she looked up theres more put the needle gun back on the wall fat lot of use it would be on mons olympus where every friend and enemy wore an armored pressure suit plug the blaster into the wall for a recharge take down the other freshly charged blaster he was fizzing with energy it would be dreadful if he forgot something crucial and they couldnt have very much time take a sonic too there was still enough air to transmit sound blasters made noise but the sonic stunners were too shrill for human ears what kind of ears did softfingers have why was she still looking at him zeera theres more than what svetz theyve shot down the orbiter what i was linked up and recording multiscreen orthogonal views and a window for data i thought i could learn something more before i landed the orbiter was crossing over the tree and then something came up from the mars direction and hit me between the eyes and everything just went its gone hanny we cant go back to earth he absorbed that no wonder youre a little twitchy a week ago trapped here with nobody to talk to and nobody to help have you been eating eating yes sleeping no there are things we have to deal with now maybe none of the softfingers saw me burn this place out and nobody got a message off but that cant hold forever we should be out of here can you expand this map theyll kill us they will if they find us still here theyve got more than heat cannon zeera they took projectile weapons off the huinanoids we need to move i want you to rescue miya im low on fuel how low i saved some actually the minim wasnt as massive coming down because you and miya werent in it her hands moved displays changed shed set the minims pile to warming then the map shrank and all of mons olympus was in view where is she weve been following this dry canal i dont know what shell do when she gets close and i dont want to lose her you take off you follow the canal until you see a car with pale blue sails unexpectedly zeera giggled right so i can tell it from all the other sailboats running around mars svetz it sounds like fun weve been starving h it was fun svetz what it they follow me youre on a ballistic parabola these martian ships are dirigibles they cant follow you but theyll try anything that lifts off i shoot it shoot it i burned down a wok ship last night im armed and maneuverable and too small to see you start a war and theyll wreck the tanker the tanker has the same superconducting shell that saved you they stripped off some of it didnt i say futz svetz said zeera they still cant kill us the minims safe they can only trap us again so in a few minutes ill take my flight stick out and bring the war to them she nodded bring the war to them she repeated war i dont expect theyll worry much about one man on a flying stick and if you kill everyone on the mountain we still cant get home zeera its not as bad as that we can use your ffd to move us say again hed hated the use of initials all his life and now they had him doing it the institutes fast forward device that got us here in the first place turn it on and ride it to present time base one is buried so we cant find it without miya but she knows the codes thatll get us into the base of course willy will want our heads fast forward i never thought of that zeera said good one more thing svetz took the bag from miyas flight stick and spilled five golden globes weve got seeds we both think we only got the seeds that grow into roots to anchor the big one but willy cant scream too loud if we cut the expedition short oh hanny thats great she picked one up futz its heavy storage there while svetz put the seeds away zeera was at work hanny ive got the minim on a ballistic trajectory down to here where the flats meet the foothills its where the canal peters out ill phone her once im out of these rocks it looks like ive got fuel to get back up but i cant hover at all up and down and unless i spot her in time shell have to come to me and the minim cant fight youll have to do that chapter svetz went out the airlock over the ridge and down and around and up the mountain following the route hed marked using zeeras map by now it felt like hed been born riding a flight stick he was moving fast as he rose into view of the tanker and the laboratory facilities around it the minim lifted into view the flame of its exhaust wasnt much brighter than the daylit mountain there were octopoids everywhere several were sunning them selves on the hill what looked like an open cafeteria served several more a few wore what must be pressure suits starshaped with a glass dome in the center he wasnt trying to count and hed miss some anyway twenty in view big eyes bulged beneath the skullcap shells a few had noticed the tiny minim svetz was rising fast and now he couldnt tell if any had seen him nobody was shooting at him he hadnt seen any wok ships on his first pass he didnt see anything in the air now he did find two beehiveshaped huts and the heat cannon mounted beside them looking down from the edge of a mesa the minims rocket flame went out and he lost it svetz and miya must have been shot at by every kind of martian who ever stalked the nightmares of primitive man even so the danger svetz feared most was zeera southworth zeera was on a short fuse and that put svetz on a time limit if she was really as desperate as shed seemed then all she had to do was abandon her crew turn on the fast forward device and ride to the present find base onewhich was buried but surely theyd mark it with paint no need for miyas codes if zeera could talk her way in svetz and miya would be left as involuntary colonists on a doomed world hed done what he could if everything went right miya would be with zeera safe until svetz could join them both the trick was to move fast he rose level with the mesa it was painted with a gigantic tenpointed asterisk there was a bigger beehive building at the edge he pegged it as a broad landing field with warehousing and no aircraft currently in residence where was the big wok ship if hed seen a ship hed have had to go after it seeing no ship he had a problem hed seen a big wok ship last night coming here by now it should have reached mons olympus crater he was rising fast the wind blew straight down battering at his bubble helmet then glarewhite plasma blew past him from below and he knew hed been seen it missed him by a fair distance hed left the asterisk far below the lip of mons olympus crater was near and he turned off his lift and coasted upward radio messages must be alerting the observatory even now hed hoped to reach the observatory without giving warning too bad they might be expecting him but they couldnt expect what he was about to do the crater in mons olympus would have held all of the hawaiian islands dots of sunlight glare ran in rays along the bottom tremendous sheets of mirror in a far larger array two or three square klicks of landing field had been marked off with another asterisk as svetz dropped closer he could pick out a hexagon of beehives and then the big double wok ship a score of octopoid astronomers were unloading cargo from a big hatch under the rim if everything else works out svetz thought the minim will still have to be refueled there must be nobody to attack the tanker while we do that best to take out everything that can fly now he tried not to think how many softfmgers he would have to kill he was not used to killing people svetz dropped toward the ship took aim beneath the hatch and fired in daylight the light didnt blind him he played the flame against the ground bouncing the backwash into the ship bearers who werent caught in the flame dropped their burdens and fled into the shadow of a mirror with all their rubbery limbs functioning as legs they looked like so many pinwheels but hed killed ten in less than ten seconds then the big double wok lurched into the air and turned with its hatch closing and svetz was falling too fast if he didnt lift quick hed be nothing but a smear lift and thrust the flight stick pulled out of its swoop and svetz ran beneath several acres of mirror slowing slowing he didnt want to ram the framework no hurry softfinger astronomers would flinch from firing on their own mirrors they flinched maybe but they fired he saw flame wash around the mirrors edge and he turned away there were big arcs and pillars under the mirror fabric to shape the paraboloid he could see well enough to dodge he emerged into sunlight and immediately veered under another mirror just ahead of a blast from above and emerged again almost under the big ships belly the ship flew tilted but the aperture in the rim wasnt looking at him yet he lifted hard firing at the ships belly and rose past the rim and fired down the disc was spinning on its vertical axis heat cannon coming around and his blast hadnt hurt the belly at all why would it that must be its reentry shield but he kept rising and veered and rose again playing his fire against the upper surface the blaster was searing his hand through the glovewaste heatbut hed melted a hole he held his fire on it something puffed fire from inside the ship it lurched its heat cannon was coming around and svetz veered hard plasma washed past him once and again this ship had two cannons with a flight stick the only way to dive was to turn off the lift and let feeble mars gravity have its way he had lateral thrust but h he wanted to change his path quick the only way to go was up svetz went up more fire was coming down at him from four heat cannons on the craters vast rim the astronomers had gotten organized but only the big wok ship was in flight he had cut them a new rocket nozzle and that was blowing flame he was rising fast now spiraling to avoid the mounted heat cannon he was above them now he saw no point in attacking fixed installations or astronomers in general the big ship ripped through a line of mirrors svetz kept rising zeera miya he should have them in line of sight now hed risen into near vacuum his suit was tight around him and hed tightened the belly band so he could breathe the planets wimpy gravity was pulling him down toward what seemed a fuzzy white dot from this height hed placed it in relation to the octopoids skullcap svete calling they both cut in at once hanny svetz are you all right are you together miya laughed yes and no zeera im down i saw the sailcar too late to do anything about it i set down in shadow over against the south edge of the canal tell miya where you are miya its all right hanny i have the minim in sight the winds died on me but sailing is still faster than running ten minutes how are you doing svetz said i went up to the observatory and shot down everything that flies now ill take out whatevers around the tanker he was giving it way more confidence than he felt zeera said you won so far theres still the tanker now if youll work up a ballistic course to the lander already done svetz im just waiting for miya miya cried hanny hanny i can see two flying woks coming from the east oh futz east everything that flies eh zeera futz i should have it wouldnt have made a difference miya how close are they just two dots if i dont zoom i only just sighted them theyre not very close and i dont know how fast they are svetz mulled it through hed shot down the little escort ship the big cargo craft must have told the observatory our escort was shot down by an unseen enemy somewhere along the old canal theyd sent two ships to search for the bandit and here they were coming back a blurred dot had become an asterisk the landing pad above the lander miya id say they flew right past your old sailing craft without finding it interesting which meant zeera if the wok ships get too close take off take off without miya miya theyll have to follow zeera they dont know what shell do they dont know what she can do and some hysterical softfinger astronomer is telling them about me right now zeera ill clean out the area around the lander before you get here miya said hanny the big cargo ship i shot it down there was a wok ship overlooking the minim and i blew that up too i couldnt find any others just gun emplacements he was decelerating hard the asterisk came up big flat area why hadnt the lander come down here six years ago he saw the answer in fused rock astronomers found the lander then used those heat cannon to melt a bigger landing field above it a cannon swiveled to look at him he blasted it then the other then played his flame over the big beehive storage shed the explosion was actinic white less like dynamite than lightning he hugged the flight stick the shock sent him spinning he got straightened out before he hit anything and watched a fireball rise where the storage shed had been so much for stealth then again svetz lifted and coasted around and down with not much to hide him there might be no more defenses he dropped below the level of the lander around and up he was looking into manbuilt prefab houses twenty more like thirty octopoids were in view most of them in motion a few were struggling into pressure armor that had arms like a draincleaning device and a centered transparent dome like svetzs own bubble helmet nobody saw him every softfinger was looking up at the landing field and its dissipating cloud svetz felled two dozen octopoids with his sonic dropped and swung round the slope and came up again nearby more houses had anyone heard anything how would he tell they werent agile these octopoids they didnt run about screaming incoherently they did have eyes beneath the skullcap shell he circled pouring silent sleep on the softfingers then floated into a slml between two rows of houses several octopoids saw him and pointed before they slumped one must have reached a phone he dipped between two houses and plasma flame lashed out behind him he hadnt seen where it came from he was reluctant to make himself a target but he didnt see a choice he popped up just above the roofs there were only two beehive buildings down here and svetz fired on the one in view dropped back and scooted the return blast almost fried him but he saw a general direction not from the octopoidbuilt beehives from one of the houses svetz ran down the line of houses firing another blast placed the right house he flew toward it lifting firing the house melted out from around the gun the gunner must have melted too or fled he could see octopoids fleeing downhill like so many wheels with no rims skidding and catching themselves their low center of gravity compensating for their clumsiness he let them go but he took the time to blast every dwelling no hidden thing would emerge later he floated high there were no octopoids in sight was there anything hed missed oops zeera coming down svetz two minutes i dont think they left you a landing spot blast me one he opened up with the blaster again the halfcremated beehive hed taken for a lab blazed again and slumped further ash remained and something solid and massive one of the landers rocket nozzles he poured fired onto it at close range it slumped and was gone and something hot and bright was coming down at him he zipped away from under the falling minim it settled gently in the ash pit not far from the lander chapter wheres miya zeera descended from the minim in a long jump i left her a flight stick miya spoke in his helmet im on my way altitude twenty klicks i have you in sight ive lost one of the wok ships the others following me but its slow hasnt caught up yet shall i try to lead it to the observatory zeera ordered stay and protect the tanker softfinger astronomers had dismounted two of the motors one to disassemble one to test fire theyd disjointed a landing leg the tanker sat tilted too low and wide to fall over theyd ripped off a sheet of the superconducting reentry shroud theyd opened every hatch cover theyd pulled hoses out in long coils and spilled methane and liquid oxygen and let the compressors replace it then theyd tied off the hoses and cut off the nozzles and taken them somewhere could be worse well have to make nozzles zeera said svetz held a severed tube in each hand he felt somewhat emasculated whats it take not much anything watertight well use the spare pressure suit that and some stickstrips here comes the wok ship miya reported zeera said were busy can you hold miya said ill get above them and hit them before they get here ill send svetz up when i can he helped zeera lift the methane hose into place and wrap the join it sprayed fluid but most of it was going in svetz took to the air eastward was a flying silver button he saw something fluttering around it he said miya dont bother shooting at the underside thats a reentry shield thanks miya said a tiny shape darted and flickered around the wok ship and he dared not watch where was the other ship if miya was patrolling high hed go low the minim and lender made good targets theyd shed softfinger heat rays without harm but spilled fuel would burn zeeras voice svetz give me some help i need to change hoses miya cant fight two ships zeera im disconnecting the fuel why isnt the other ship in your face right now dont know they split up he thought one ship to track and kill miya shes riding a flight stick they must think shes me the other ship went to the observatory to protect whats left he could help miya now theyd kill that first one quick then doubleteam the second but if he was wrong he hovered low above the tanker and minim fire speared down its origin too high to see above and about the minim a thin mix of fuel and martian air puffed and tried to catch svetz lifted hed been lucky miya couldnt hold off two but the second ship had spotted him instead while the others heat cannon recharged he could act here it was lower than hed guessed svetz fired up at its belly just to make the softfingers wary and drew nearer the aperture came around he swerved fired swerved out of the fringe of their return blast and fired again the wok ship couldnt turn fast enough he played his blaster on its upper surface and saw a runnel form and then the wok ship was rising trying to disappear in the sky svetz followed up up above the wok ship and holding the trigger down hard but his blaster was dead im unarmed he reported i can buzz around them until you get here miya zeera shouted get down here and help me pump oxygen miya said my targets falling zeera take cover itll hit near you hanny i cant see your target yet ill get them to shoot the second ship would fire on him no matter what he did he dropped wide of the ixinder on a wiggly path make them choose their target the thing he must not do was hover flame seared past him he cursed reflexively i see it hanny go help zeera he set down next to the minim there was no problem matching the severed oxygen hose to its intake then wrapping it with the spare suit and then with stickstripping it only took four hands they started the pump and watched oxygen boil out around the join svetz asked was the leak this bad dont worry we were supposed to have extra for exploring they watched the sky a bright star appeared and drifted down they both began shouting at once and miya had to bellow into her suit mike got them futz they nearly fried me you hurt them hanny i only finished it im coming down how are you doing near done zeera said the voice from the sky said feed me an instant later miya dropped beside them they had to get out of the pressure suits then zeera laughed and waved a hand in front of her nose and the minims air system howled it was futile to think about baths miyas mouth was full and zeera was trying to tell her about svetzs suggestion its so easy we just turn on the fast forward and wait miya swallowed deliberately youre for this hanny im not for it i just havent thought of anything better wed be aborting the mission we only have seeds for the anchor grove zeera exclaimed its something to show ra chen and willy we dont have what it takes to grow an orbital tower that is what we came for svetz asked zeera think that tank is full she glanced at her board and nodded they went outside pulled the oxygen hose loose and sealed up the minim all in silence ready to launch zeera said if we can figure out where to go svetz said we have options go back to hangtree town stay and be natives there are things we can teach them if we find someone who wants to be taught we might learn something too how to grow a hangtree miyas voice in their helmets you favor this no im just thrashing around well ive got a plan miya said leader speak to us trust me come in and button up the minim ill show you chapter dead of night the stars were ablaze seen through no trace of cloud and only the barest trace of atmosphere the hangtree had fallen below the horizon days ago ffd said miya on sunlight blasted their eyes day and night strobed zeera cursed and clenched her eyelids tight miya looked out grim and squinting svetz pulled his helmet into place now the sun was a dark spot hurtling east to west over and over but the lightdarklight landscape was still uncomfortable pressure tents and vehicles appeared in a pattern not quite centered on the spot where the minim moved through time all built in the fashion of the red humanoids the tanker disappeared in sections a few minutes later all the activity on the plateau went away the temp housing began to decay and collapse miya switched off on a day in late afternoon the hangtree was high in the sky east by south bouquets of tremendous silver flowers bloomed at both ends the splintered bottom end had healed it was pointed like a stem emerging from u silver corsage ten thousand klicks above mars miya asked how far did we come theres no gauge for the ffd zeera said just an onoff switch futz give me a guess then three years or so the martains must think we just disappeared now the trees higher but it took forever to get there so the hangtree is leaving mars but its taking its sweet time miya whats your plan zeera demanded launch we cant reach earth rendezvous with the hangtree its not in geosynchronous orbit anymore its higher than that but we can still reach the midpoint the midpoint will still be in free fall we can do all that zeera said carefully but why do we want to launch us ill tell you on the way are we in a hurry miya what you need is sleep i want to get moving hanny get into your suit you too zeera if im wrong i want to know it midpoint of the tree aye aye zeera said check my work they were pilots he wasnt svetz watched them and presently said the telescopes in the crater may be up again when they see us in flight the partys over miya murmured launches are finicky hanny zeera said ive got the minim in low orbit we circle half around the planet and do a second bum svetz reclined his chair and watched for doublewok ships in a navy blue sky he snapped out of a sound sleep when the floor roared at him and gravity doubled the ship rolled the biggest mountain in the solar system dwindled behind them the motors went quiet zeera said well make another burn to close with the tree twentyfive minutes miya are you planning to moor us to the trunk right i think ive worked out the hangtree life cycle miya closed her eyes and said we dont have fuel to reach earth right but we can get on the hangtree and ride it anchor to the tree well get there with a reserve of fuel then fast forward until we see where its going if im wrong we abort reentry and fast forward land at mars base one and call willy start over mars was a vast black curve beneath black sky fuzzy light was just peeping over the horizon not the sun but the hangtrees upper cluster of mirrors zeera started her second burn svetz was able to make out a vertical line almost invisible against the black sky motionless and infinitely distant it didnt look threatening whats that he asked and it was suddenly far too close zeera yelled and fired attitude jets the minim twisted viciously and surged the intruder whipped past they craned around to see it recede a silverbrown cable hanging unsupported in space there for an instant more then gone miya said quietly the hangtrees dropped a sapling a juvenile hangtree thats good isnt it might mean im not crazy zeera said im correcting course now that cost us some fuel the parent hangtree rose become large vast a world in its own right coming up too fast as zeera turned the minim for a final burn thrust pulled them into their seats then eased a vertical bar on the displays stretched lit up in red kept stretching turned yellow svetz asked whats that hull temperature zeera said she turned the minim and they looked into a hot pink glare heat rays futz em zeera muttered did either of you see any kind of projections on the midtrunk sail struts svetz said down the trunk by no more than twenty klicks sail material harvested struts still in place the glare of softfinger heat rays washed out all detail but hed seen we can moor to those zeera what about the heat cannon cant hurt us but projectiles can i need to moor us now another puff of thrust sent them downward still closing with the trunk the heat rays touched wood red fog boiled out of the bark and closed around the minim before the softfingers turned their weapons off svetz looked for doublewok shapes in the red murk what he saw was a manbuilt dirigible airship moored below them much too close a final tiny push and they were up against bark in a ring of lightsail stumps miya was already in the airlock svetz followed her through his flesh shrinking from unseen highvelocity bits of metal slowly carefully miya showed him how to make knots that would come apart at a pull they wound cables around the huge stumps moored the minim tight then climbed back inside the airlock held them both intimately as something like a rainstorm began bullets ticking against the hull the sky lurched into motion i the inner door opened miya moved briskly to her chair svetz blocked the suns flickering arc with his forearm he watched stars whirling around him the brighter twinkling of clustered lightsails whirling mars sinking away a wooden structure built itself on one side of the minim and continued to flicker with motion studying us svetz guessed they saw us disappear here zeera could they detect us how would i know mars was a ruddy dot not even a halfmoon anymore the sun was fixed a glare among the mirrors at one end of the tree svetz asked miya you had a plan are we still on track me plan miya laughed then sobered all right im trying to think like an orbital tower here like a tree hanny where does a hangtree want to go it must have crossed interstellar space to get here why didnt it go straight to earth iow gravity high spin mars not earth shed told him that but mars is mostly desert earth is mostly ocean why wouldnt a hangtree want to zero in on the richest waterandoxygen spectrum in the sky our problem is we got hung up on seeds miya said a plant can bundle tiny bits of information into a million seeds a hangtree cant do anything that simple interstellar space is just too big to find anything by accident even a seed that got lucky wouldnt be anything more than a bit of meteor it must have crossed space as a tether already a hundred thousand klicks long and festooned with solar sails all ready to move into place and take over a planet she looked at them right svetz was reserving judgment ten thousand years on route getting energy from starlight but using up its reserves of mass getting more like a driedout dead tree all the time it leaves fat and arrives lean anything that migrates does that miya said it finds a world and takes up orbit maneuvering with the sails drops seeds an anchor grove grows the hangtree drops a root the grove sends up water and soil nutrients the hangtree sends down sugar sap they feed each other they grow it picked mars because mars is easy earth makes a better garden but two and a half times the gravity means a tree has to be longer and stronger now its strong enough it was almost ready to tear loose from mars then we got here and war came swarming up the tree all that dead weight tore it loose or maybe it was just ready its going to earth chapter when it became clear that nothing was going to happen fast zeera and miya went to sleep leaving svetz on watch the tree had made accommodation with the prevailing tide its down branch was pointed into the sun constellations streamed past conveying a sense of progress marking a year for every circuit there was motion on the tree the dulled silver elevator track was being stressed stretched pulled apart anchor points popped torn ends slithered away from each other up and down the trunk then a wave of repair ran down the rail and left it intact and shining silver and flickering with traffic mirrors at the trees end points flickered endlessly bubble domes sprang up along the trees up branch then were replaced by more angular more solid structures svetz could see their mutating silhouettes against the glare of mirrors at the up end beehives formed along the down branch plumbing began to grow along the bark suddenly the pipes were shattered and most of the beehives became charred craters in the bark it all began to grow again like mushrooms svetz tried to guess how many martians how many martian races were still on the hangtree it seemed theyd built vertical cities fought then reached an accommodation the tree was maneuvering going somewhere the flicker of lightsails told him that the minims instruments might have told him more if hed learned to read them new lightsails were beginning to unfold on the old stumps around the minim the elevator track wriggled restlessly now crooked now straightening torn again repaired again hours passed in the minim svetz had lost count of the years passing outside sixty seventy light glinted from miyas eyes she was awake he spoke his fear lightly we are going to earth arent we im sure its what the tree wants sleep made her voice gravelly maybe its ready to cross to another star miya wasnt looking at him her fingertips glided over her instrument display svetz said weve been between planets for something near a century whatever martians are still with us must have made their peace with the tree theyre here if they want to be any martian would have had time to get back down to mars what if they learn to steer the tree theres a nice thought miya laughed they could take the tree to europa let it pick up gigatons of water bring it back to mars cut into the trunk and let sap bleed out fill up those canals wed end up at europa with no fuel and nothing to eat pass me a dole brick hanny he did that miya said now the ffd completely futzes up our inertial guidance and the computer cant find our location because nobody thought to tell it about changes in the constellations but ive graphed our insolationthats the light thats been falling on us since we left mars here tap svetzs display changed sure enough that was a graph curve looks choppy doesnt it sunlight should be more steady maybe all the mirrors screw it up but see for yourself hanny were getting twice the sunlight now were going in toward the sun not out anyway the earthmoon system went past while you were talking and here it comes again see it svetz never could find anything that someone else had to point at he said ill take your word are you awake i want some sleep if you can take over go ahead still asleep or trying he let both arms drift up to block a bluewhite strobe it almost worked a fitful glare lit up his eyelids anyway when he opened his eyes the minim was in a bouquet of rippling mirrors the mirrors shifted languidly edges parted and closed again he caught partial views of glarewhite clouds forming and swirling and dissolving frenetically on a whirling blue background a black shadow swept across zeera saw that he was awake we havent moved for a while we thought you should be up when we turn off the ffd should think so martians all around us svete loosed himself from the web he was groggy free fall made him clumsy good call miya earth did the tree touch down yet not yet its dropped seeds showers of seeds a dozen times in a dozen places i think it must be waiting to see which anchor trees come up weve been here two years and a fraction were not in geosynchronous orbit were drifting can we finally check in with the institute the talker doesnt work in fast forward well have to drop out zeeras forefinger reached hold it miya spoke soothingly hanny were fine we programmed the minim for reentry those lightsail stumps werent dead after all so were pretty well hidden from any martians we drop out we use the talker to call present time cut the minim loose first miya we cant see them take translators and blasters too are we all going out zeera laughed translators in vacuum if you find yourself wound in a net in some softfinger pressure dome zeera you will be glad you have a translator all right hanny you and miya do that ill phone home chapter the spinning earth jarred to a stop svetz went out first into a forest of mirrors yes it was fun to squeeze in next to miya but theyd be too confined to fight he worked fast reality rippled bewilderingly showing him an army of brilliant green bulbheaded lizards now came a forest of companions in a yellow pattern and miya was beside him helping now came larger distorted shapes in silverbrown svetz whirled and lashed out he couldnt remember snatching out the heavy blaster blaster handle and fist whacked hard into protruding glass goggles in a bronze mask as big as his whole chest glass shattered and sprayed a meter of sharp silver lashed out svetz ducked under the backhand stroke as a longbarreled weapon spat fire past him then both weapons were wheeling through space while the intruder covered its face with both arms trying to hold in the air while svetz gaped a third appendage reached far out and closed like a vise around his leg if hed seen the intruder first hed have frozen in terror it was four meters long it had six limbs like an insect but no thorax or tail and miya was on its back her fingers working to pull its upper arms loose fog puffed out the intruder went limp svetz wriggled out of the loosening grip on his knee he barked zeera did you cover all that do you see more of them just the one but futz i want to bring it in dont vent the air pump it a live prisoner would be nice vacuum doesnt kill instantly but a corpse would do and theyd want that air miya disengaged herself from the monster and pulled it around to look at it she couldnt have seen much inside the hardshelled suit she wrestled the helmet off come see these eyes she said svetz shuddered had he disappointed her she said i used to envy you the weird wild creatures youve seen and touched come on hanny look at the way the eyes are placed so it can see to both sides at once it could almost be an herbivore he let her pull him close the skin was yellowgreen the eyes were closed under lids that might have been cut from tennis balls they were too far apart vulnerablelooking at the edges of a squarish head the martian would see forward too hands opened and closed reflexively at miyas touch the middle pair were thick and clumsy with a callused heel the minims great cargo door opened to the sky in a trace of icy fog svetz and miya pulled the creature inside some erg counter has me on hold zeera said shall i close up and pressurize right said miya they pulled a cargo net over the alien the minim had just become a lot smaller zeera said i wish we could bag that when it starts to rot miya said we can look it over first svetz didnt want to be involved in that ill finish up out there i want us loose he told miya no wait he fished his blaster out and put it back on the wall if wed fired these deathtraps in that house of mirrors wed be nothing but ash oh futz but hanny what if there are more its a risk svetz took his time methodically pulling tethers loose and coiling them and stowing them under hatches on the hull any creature this big had to be something of a loner just to find enough to eat if a squad of green giants had found the minim they would hardly let svetz smash their mans visor and kidnap him would they they couldnt be that different if these lines got tangled the minim couldnt reenter but methodically pulling cables loose and stowing them he kept spinning around to look for intruders miyas radio voice said its not breathing how are you doing near finished ive got its suit off theres flexible tubing down the insides of the suit its got a backpack too the minim was free there arent any fingernails or toenails its ancestors may have had an exoskeleton but there are only a few plates left like it was born wearing armor the tusks are bone and there are bones and joints in the limbs no ribs still a welldeveloped endoskeleton that middle pair is legs and arms both i can almost see how the shoulders rotate mph what oh now i see hanny youre going to love this im coming in miyas arms wore around the green giant compressing its torso releasing it still isnt breathing too much to hope for wasnt it that an alien captive would be built like earths lifeforms stillinsects dont have lungs check for openings along its sides thats what i meant but spiracles still have to be pumped zeera shouted futz it will you both strap in i might have to launch the cheery voice of willy gorky barked zeera hows it going zeeras arms waved frantically summoning miya and svetz to their seats thats a long story willy but weve got everything you wanted the voice from the other end of time said great they took turns talking we saw at least five kinds of tool user im pretty sure they werent all intelligent miyas collected some seeds big heavy golden spheroids with a texture like foamed ceramic for a reentry shell but those only make the anchor trees willy we think descriptions of the last leg of the flight had to come from the women while svetzs eyes peered between the mirror blossoms up and down the trunk the tree still has some drift to it miya said its been dropping seeds it prefers targets on the equator strips of seeds fifty klicks long generally crossing a shoreline youll remember that the grove on mars was partly on a canal boss we dont exactly know what to do now the tree wont bud a sapling until its ready to move on if it locks to earth and we leave it in place will it still be here in present time that was a serious question ra chen and gorky held rapid discussion with techs and time travelers irritatingly half audible willy gorky said we certainly want to watch the tree link up that could take years svetz said not for us willy there was whispering at the other end of time then willy gorky said youve got the ffd zeera use it and the secretarygeneral wants to see some martians have they made any attempt to contact you yes and no we had a prisoner sir but we th it moved svetz said miya loosed herself and went to look without the pressure suit it still looked armored dark green back pale yellow face and belly jeweled ornaments were riveted to exoskeletal plates and holsters for tools including tube weapons and knives nasty little spines of polished metal jutted from its midlimb wrists there were rows of holes along its flanks thick eyelids suddenly rolled open bulging eyes wobbled independently as they scanned the minim making svetzs own eyes hurt then both centered on miya the hull rattled svetz turned to see shapes like spindly frog bounding among the mirrors tubes in their hands spat fire he saw three sixlimbed giants wrestling a much bigger tube into place it poked out through the silver petals looking straight at him and he yelled launch launch now turned to scream miya tether yourself died on his lips miya had been distracted six limbs wrapped themselves around her and pulled her close her fists and heels pounded against the creatures shell launching now zeera said the intruder sighed and sagged limp under nearly earths gravity of thrust miya rolled clear dead aft the big tube was looking right at the minim we have a live prisoner zeera spoke crisply above the rockets muted scream great said willy gorky but you launched to earth of course to earth sorry im still catching up but zeera we want those martians the secgen they were firing on us the burn ended the big lube spat orange flame attitude jets puffed as the minim slewed sideways automatics avoiding a meteor something massive tacked the hull anyway the midtrunk dwindled it was still huge a world in itself was it more slender than it had been at mars earths hangtree must be longer because geosynchronous orbit was higher of course it must have grown longer year after year and more slender too and that was why the rails had ripped miya still wasnt in her command chair svetz looked back miya was moored to the wall by sleeping tethers just beyond the monsters reach she was talking the monster was talking and the translator was talking too svetz always hated learning a new language he said willy the only martians talked to did all their talking after i was a helpless prisoner maybe weve done exactly the right thing from the other end of time gorky said ah maybe where are you coming down zeera said south america northern edge of what became brazil right on the equator and just at the shoreline its where the anchor trees seem to be having the most success good luck wait sir how do you expect to get us back willy gorky said well send the small xcage for you call us when you get down and give us decent coordinates how zeera cried the inertial calendars on the xcages werent that accurate the minim didnt have one and willy gorky didnt see the problem at all ra chen broke in you gave us your location in space brazil equator shoreline get there on foot if you have to but get us a date ask a local gorky would a primitive have a dating system ra chen mayans and incas did but hmm we couldnt read them zeera what you really want is a spanish invader look for metal armor get christian dates well try that chapter on the night side of earth was no trace of city light the planet was black nearly uninhabited population a few millions and now they must search among savage locals for a savage spaniard halfway round the world from spain for a spanish conquistador as likely as any martian to kill a stranger on sight but that problem might never arise zeera these motors wouldnt even lift us they werent built to land on earth yes svetz they were minims launch from earth and refuel in orbit this one was rebuilt for mars heavier with an expanded cabin but its pretty much the same most of the volume is tanks we fall motorsdown whats under us is a fuel tank thats supposed to collapse if we hit too hard it takes the shock we dont youve been thinking about this too oh yes and about that impact weapon that might have torn up our reentry shielding from aft miya called ive been telling thaxir about mars about whats going to happen she wants to talk to us thaxir she us i was born on the tree the green giant said i know only what my mother told me of those days when the tree broke loose we were royalty and i am a princess in memnonia my age is near thirteen i think we have clocks to keep the time our ancestors kept by sun and dark really thaxirs speech was as interesting as what the translator was saying her mouth wasnt insectile but the mouth and lips of a mammal though tusks as long as svetzs forearm would make her speech mushy even if it were shaped by lungs but thaxir breathed through spiracles svetz saw what miya was trying to tell him tubes ran down the inside of her pressure suit to feed two rows of holes along her sides she spoke in a prolonged belch and swallowed air to keep it going the translator said our nature is conquest but the tree is too fragile for war the allied peoples have not made war in thirty years we live with the hangtree and the hangtree is our life i have tried to learn why we should want to leave miya cannot tell me i told her about mars miya said to svetz the world was to dry and die my parents knew the prophecy said thaxir when the hangtree broke loose they could have gone home to their children and grandchildren they chose the tree to their miya told svetz they live a long time her parents already had grandchildren forty years ago mars time seventyfive earth years and youre under thirteen twentyfour and a half in earth years among beings who might reach a thousand futz miya weve kidnapped a little girl you have made me slave and i remain slave thaxir said with composure until my warriors can rescue me but my heart is with the tree the trees intent may not be the same as yours miya told the martian the hangtree crosses between stars it only stops at worlds to take nourishment to make itself strong for the crossing the green giants lips pulled back from her tusks a terrifying sight another star yes we hoped you wont have a sun for thousands of years understand the bark of the tree you know how thick it is its insulation the core of the tree wont freeze only the outside only you and your people thaxir snorted we survive vacuum sucks air and water from our bodies but we build pressure tents and then walls other kinds attack us for our position on the tree we fight them until they must make peace the tree stretches and tears our rails locks each group of us away from what we need elsewhere but we build again if the sun is distant we will use solar mirrors to gather the light have we survived vacuum and starvation and war to be stopped by cold miya considered she asked you dont live together all of your species do you no mother says we are distributed by what we can defend there was more of lighting for turf before the hangtree settled in above this cloudy world my father died in the war nowthaxir stopped talking miya asked secrets i cannot tell you how we defend ourselves you may not demand there are laws for treatment of slaves were going down to earth our vessel wont lift again we have no way at all to attack any part of the hangtree thaxir thought that over no way to return me even for high ransom if we find a way well return you you can carry our message some of you must want to leave the tree before it freezes you a stubborn silence though thaxirs face was hard to read where her nose would have been was a flat plate with a stylized pictograph carved into it miya asked what do you eat the tree bears bountiful life there is fungus we make a paste from the starchy roots of a parasitic plant there are animal forms big enough to feed an army for a week she wriggled if i may reach my pack miya reached through the net to release the little pack on the green giants back and moved it around to her arms thaxir pulled out a flask then a big shapeless lump of something wrapped in mirror leaf then a beautiful golden arch set with gems the frame for a score of taut parallel strings svetz asked musical instrument yes a windstormminor listen thaxir played a tune of strange intervals all sharps and flats it seemed to svetz that she was trying to duplicate some pattern already known like a computer yet there was charm in the moments uniqueness miya spoke unaware that she interrupted a crossing between stars would take thousands of years there wont be sunlight no source of energy for anything that lives on the bark it will all die and so will all of you and even if you could survive you thaxir would never live to see another star the pack had disgorged a slate and stick and thaxir was drawing she said after all what choice have we some of you who want to accept our offer could gather at the tree midpoint where there is no gravity well send you the large extension cage wed like some from each of the allied peoples if possible the large cage would holdhanny svetz thought it over going forward in time gravity would plate them across the interior of the shell you could lay them out around the whole inner surface twenty of these green giants or a hundred softfingers or eighty red humanoids i never saw the crab things close up miya asked there are more of you than that arent there of the species from the south the fishers and high folk stayed to share the planets fate only the smiths chose to ride the tree five kinds a million warriors it didnt matter if thaxir was inflating the numbers miya said so we cant take you all think now if some of you stay and some go with us its much more likely you wont all die you argue as a gambler thaxir was amused probabilities it may be some mathematicians will go with you do your people live at the hangtrees midpoint softfingers hold that region theyre all arms you know freely falling they are more dexterous than we wethe translator hiccuped thengreen giants we hold the tree from its far end to forty thousand klicks inward there we have nearly the same weight as on mars its the best part of the tree the translator helped them get their measurements straightened out reds held a stretch along the inner branch from to klicks altitude that was roughly martian gravity they could fight species that were less strong but more dexterous thaxir was not reluctant to describe the locations of rival species but she avoided any mention of their defenses what was she doing in softfinger turf we repay a debt eleven of us lend our muscle to help the softfingers extend their city other species are involved too i thought to use the sunflower stalks as anchor points for some preliminary construction and there you were and youlooking at svetzyou smashed my face before could so much as scream i was frightened svetz said is there such a thing as a mirror in this place miya said no thaxir your face is fine the carvings they arent touched what is that whistling earths air slowing us dont be frightened miya plucked the netting around the green giant it was taut she pushed the windstormminor under it youll be fine hanny we should strap down she and svetz made their way forward the sun was a sudden flame ahead of them bisected by a flat black horizon the sound of a harp joined the thin wailing air screamed around heat shielding intended for mars not earth and thaxir was playing a weird and lovely counterpoint through the flame colors svetz couldnt tell what was below them he wouldnt have known the geography anyway the hulls scream had a warble in it now and zeera who knew this ship better than svetz wasnt looking happy at all wisps of cirrus went past svetz could make himself believe they were slowing his weight was easing the minim was falling almost vertically and what was below was hard to make out but zeera let the computer handle it svetz look those trees off there must be the anchor grove ten fifteen klicks away we came pretty close thats water isnt it miya said cosmonauts always fire too early it costs fuel we learned to just let the program handle it the motors fired the minim tilted hard over ocean below shoreline where the nose pointed and slender trees tipped with black there wasnt enough thrust theyd known that and now the motors were firing horizontally not slowing their fall the minim tilted to vertical then a bit farther svetz heard the hull rattle and hoped it was landing legs deploying the ground came up much too fast i chapter baba yaga or baba jaga a female supernatural of russian folklore a cannibalistic ogress her abode is a little hut constantly spinning around on fowls legs in a clearing in the distant forest this is surrounded by a picket fence topped with skulls the baba yaga rides through the air in an iron kettle stirring up tempests or in a mortar which she moves by a pestle as she sweeps her traces from the air with a broom funk wagnalls standard dictionary of folklore mythology and legend svetz cautiously tested his necknot brokenand his back before he looked around is everyone alive fine miya said dubiously zeera said svetz it wasnt that bad a landing considering we came down on two legs svetz asked didnt that used to be there the intertemporal speaking device torn from its mounting lay next to the martians head they scrambled down to look the green giant lay as if dead but air was going in and out of her spiracles the talker had missed her head it looked partly crushed there was nothing to try it only had one switch futz the talkers dead look at it were cut off svetz pulled a filter helmet over his head and went out he came back in much faster pulling it off gasping zeera have we got filter helmets for earth atmosphere tes svetz ra chen wont let us go into the past without them he made sure the drawers are labeled see so if you can read the itr logo thank you zeera we all get one miya you cant breathe whats out there you told me hanny she was cautiously prodding thaxir nothing broken i think unless its under one of these plates gravitys going to bother her and i cant guess what she eats the outer door was now a horizontal platform the sand was twelve meters down there should have been a ladder there was only a pulley system not yet deployed svetz and miya rose on flight sticks and circled the minim it was hot and humid they were wearing loose ships clothing cinched at wrists and ankles in seconds they were soaked through two of the minims legs were still retracted the remaining pair had plunged through a meter of water deep into sand if the minim hadnt come down hard it would have toppled over the tide had withdrawn now the minim stood upright on two slender legs the burned gouge along its flank ran almost through into the oxygen tank company zeera said softly i dont see in the trees onshore use infrared trees as slender as wands stood just offshore growing out of the sea tufted with black the anchor grove a forest of tangled greenery and shadows grew densely inland the opposing life of earth svetz turned a pair of mag specs on those mag specs were almost as good as a pressure suits fishbowl by infrared svetz picked out hot spots five feet tall now he could zoom them in normal light a dozen or more short dark people standing perfectly still within the shade of the earthly forest men and women both though they looked so oddpoor dietthat svetz identified the women only by their breasts zeera said id say they dont want to talk fine by me svetz said lets talk about our orders miya said the talkers dead that makes it moot whether we need a spaniard to tell us what time it is do we still want to watch the hangtree link up east of them the hangtree hung above the ocean almost fading into the blue sky hard to judge how far away it was but at least several hundred klicks several degrees of the earths circumference the bottom faded into horizon haze svetz said maybe it is linked up miya gave him a look of disgust the fast forward zeeras radio voice reported is futzed that too how bad ten centimeters of superconducting wire would fix what i can see i just cant seem to find it im looking where it should have been packed svetz knew better than to try to help zeera find something and shed packed the minim he said miya lets look around whats the point then miya said yes hanny were in no real hurry are we zeera zeera sounded distracted not until i findwell and food sooner or later well need a way to feed ourselves hold up weve got dole bricks for a long time two months anyway no no hurry they went back in and came out wearing only shorts shoes would have had to come off the pressure suits big bulky things they both rejected they flew among anchor trees no thicker than miyas waist but scores of meters tall the tip of the tallest was a black puffball five or six meters through miya hovered close up against it notice anything interesting hanny no its fluffy like black cotton cotton she was drifting down the slender length of the anchor tree and svetz followed he said its a plant people used to wear it so were looking around where we dont even know what the questions are you need curiosity to solve puzzles you told me that and there are always puzzles to solve because all of your missions go wrong right hanny the water was wonderfully clear the slender trunks went straight down through the water and into the sand any roots must have begun spreading out far beneath the sand reaching into bedrock forming a network to anchor what would presently attach itself a mass greater than any mountain pulling up svetz said a bit defensively we accomplished the mission this time didnt we but landing a mars minim on earth wasnt part of any plan helped make miya let him see her turn off the radio link to the minim that black cotton looked very soft and cushiony would you like to make love in a tree from the stars well futz i didnt plan that either they drifted back up theyd be hidden from the minim but a fall from this height would kill them svetz suggested lets moor some lines miya swam into the foliage svetz stayed aloft hed catch her if theres branches all through this i can anchor us come on in the puffball material had some of the hampering effect of a martian bed but not as bad it cradled them held them together cuddling afterward they lifted their filter helmets to kiss and miya tasted earths air she was instantly in love with it svetz had to pull her filter helmet into place when she started to pass out then still tethered miya crawled down through the tuft to look through the underside svetz wasnt going to bother but he heard miyas radio whisper come see this svetz swam through the foliage and stuck his head out of the bottom a man was on the beach looking up at them he was paleskinned and dirty shelled like a green martian but in rusted metal miya said weve found ra chens conquistador chapter they didnt want to be seen flying they locked their flight sticks then dropped them to the ground and slid down the smooth trunk they planted the flight sticks in a conspicuous green bush the brush discharges sticking up like strange golden blossoms hold it hanny what when the suns right behind you theres a ring of light around your head its the filter helmet we dont want the sun behind us when we approach a local the shelled man was no taller than svetz or miya he looked pale and ill he wore weapons but he didnt try to reach them tilted against a supporting tree he watched them descend as if they might be hallucinations then he drew himself up before them in yoga tree position and said yo soy john de castores del camoes and continued at some length i am jack said the translator in earth gravity jack wore armor around his torso and carried heavy baggage too no wonder he seemed bowed beneath the weight he looked amazingly dirty his beard and hair were scraggly and matted and overgrown he carried his helmet and svetz wondered if his overgrown hair would still fit into it the united nations translator recognized the language not spanish but portuguese it had that in storage it learned the archaic forms much faster than it had learned martian speech jack wanted food he was here to fish he explained beneath these very strange trees svetz said orbital tether and heard the silence the translator didnt have that term yet hangtree roots beanstalk the translator spoke jack thought that over then said politely beneath these beanstalk roots the fish and shellfish thrive but dinis and i we are sick of fish miya offered him a dole yeast bar jack bit into it and looked dubious then he offered them a dark strip of something svetz took it because he couldnt guess how miya would react he lifted his filter helmet and caught a wave of smells some of that must be coming from jack he put the dark strip in his mouth it was hard enough to break teeth saliva softened it and then it tasted like strange like ancient messages crawling up from his primitive brain corruption and meat and fire jerked meat the translator called it with these you locals call chills for flavor meat from a beast from some local creature i do not know which dinis shot but the animals become wary and our bullets run low sir my companion dinis is hurt do you know local herbs to help him before they could admit to knowing nothing of the locality which svetz had already decided not to dojack had spilled his pack on the sand blanket knives a bottle and a small bag both made of something like naugahyde gear for mending a boot an ornate religious thing crossshaped jack showed them leaves and roots wrapped in cloth half a dozen varieties this root they had cooked and eaten and liked this helped constipation these leaves they had spread on dinis wound it hadnt done much good and your do yeesbar god ordains that true medicine must have an evil taste and truly i feel better where does it grow in another country svetz handed jack another bar for hed finished the first we must hoard them he said miya picked up a small heavy bag whats this jack took it quickly silver coins all i have would that they were gold we hoped to find gold in this place but he shrugged will you come and look at my sick friend dinis jack told his tale as he led them through the jungle the shipwreck had left twelve attacks by primitives out of jungle shadows snakes bigger than a madmans nightmares fever starvation rumors of gold greed and madness among their officers had winnowed them down to two the jungle had nearly strangled a small stepped pyramid built of huge stone blocks jack led them nearly to the top and through a great doorway the room wasnt large amid a junkyard of primitive tools and elegant stoneware dinis lay on a dais beside rusted armor dinis looked much like jack they even dressed alike all the same dinis had been dead for hours jack asked hopefully is it possible did he really expect dole yeast to restore a man to life svetz didnt laugh he said we cannot help this man were we fools to lodge in this alien temple ah dinis but we had not strength to build shelter svetz said jack our mission leader tells us that nobody is ever truly dead go back and talk to them zeera would have added jack seemed to relax you are christian he marveled and svetz is your name russian svetz let that stand jack what is the year we left portugal in the year of our lord fifteen sixty since then i too have lost count two years i think in this place one cannot even guess when christmas might come jack announced that he must bury his friend dinis alvares de albuquerque y another name of considerable length miya explained that they must report to their mission leader svetz saw jacks disappointment before jack turned away to dig in the earth with his blunted sword miya was right they could not help with dinis funeral jack would see that they didnt know the rites stilltranslator off suit radio on zeera people made coins out of gold didnt they for a while then they went to paper and plastic if i found you a little silver could you make wire superconductor would be better oh all right svetz silvers ductile i can pound it miya whispered hanny go on ahead miya im right behind you svetz went back to where jack was digging in the earth with his blunted sword translator on jack give me your silver for a few minutes and ill give you gold coins back jack stared then laughed truly i hear the sounds of my home why would you do this because i need silver because ive evaded helping you with a friends death rites curiosity warred with distrust and jack handed svetz his pouch svetz went into the trees out of sight he took the largest coin out of the pouch then dropped the pouch into the superconducting net of his trade kit the conversion took a few minutes svetz realized his mistake when he picked up the pouch it too had become gold and that would tell jack more than svetz wanted told he fished out a zipped sample bag and poured the coins into that he brought that to jack jack poured the coins from hand to hand then bit one where did you get these master svetz and this the clear plastic pouch futz svetz said thats a secret jack he took a coin and bit it but it didnt have any taste at all the woman had taken the net off thaxir as svetz watched the green giant rolled over onto her side then her belly then lifted herself on all sixes very good miya said youll stay healthier if you can exercise hello hanny careful of her balance thaxir slid a middle arm toward her pack she saw svetz go tense hungry she said she fished in the pack and came out with a lump wrapped in a patch of hangtree mirror what was inside might have been white cheese she ate half of it in two bites then will you taste miya broke off a crumb and put it in her mouth theres almost no taste she said like tofu thaxir i think you could eat dole yeast try this still on all sixes thaxir let miya put a chunk of dole yeast in her mouth her eyes squeezed shut they heard her voice muffled your food tastes like canal scum my weight holds me paralyzed and the tree hangs above us taunting so much for worlds miya will you help me to lie down again i dont want to fall svetz helped miya ease the martian down he could feel thaxirs strength her problem was fear he asked do you eat meat some meat most plants to choose too carefully is to starve ill find you something zeera he showed her jacks silver coin counterfeit zeera said after testing it only part silver not very conductive at all is gold conductive why oh wait now svetz silvers ductile ill hammer this into shape and then well change it about the green giant svetz said why not put her in water let her float zeera took the charge out of a blaster and began to pound on the silver coin with the butt shes an alien svetz what would salt water do to her she might dissolve or anything how did you get this svetz told her this jack knows you can make gold i handed him a bag of gold he doesnt know where i got it hes the last of his crew who would he tell and what if he does there were tales of people who could make gold they were called alchemists thats why we made the trade kit zeera zeera bellylaughed you might have started that story right here why not svetz reclined his chair and went to sleep his dreams were shaped by the tapping of a blaster butt on a silver coin and zeeras monotonous swearing the pounding stopped what zeera had was a narrow little bar not quite a wire to replace a mere whisker of superconductor all right svetz turn it into gold miya we want to videotape straight up and all of thai was the work of a few minutes miya went to help thaxir roll over again thaxir do you understand all this were going into the future where my companions and my consortbycontract are all grown old or dead but the tree is linked to earth good zeera glared at them last chance did any of you leave scraps of high tech underwear for some archeologist miya made a show of patting herself nope anything conspicuous in some unlikely place jack svetz said they were leaving an ally miya shrugged zeera flipped the fdd switch the sun dropped like a giant meteoroid and plunged them into the dark chapter they shared a meal and took turns in the bath bag and drifted through half a year while the hangtree drifted up the sky when zeera judged it straight overhead she turned off the ffd night again the tree loomed huge and weightless silver blossoms blazed down but not so many as there had been a tiny moon was tangled among the blossoms miya said its still not connected well its in position zeera said hit it again we do not want to miss this wait miya took her time lolling in her reclined chair with her mag specs pointed straight up she said i can see the taproot and its still fifty klicks too high zeera hit it day and night strobed svetz had found nothing but he kept his mag specs pointed there it was thrashing like a string in a hurricane in real time what was happening a root descended through ferocious stratospheric winds weighted at the end lightsails unfurled to move the trees position against the wind below to drag the line along a strip of anchor grove until miya hit the cutoff the strobe ended just past dawn theyd jumped by twenty days harder to see now that it wasnt moving a silver thread descended from heaven its end was tangled in the black tops of the anchor grove the winds might still be vibrating it but it was under tension now the tree was in place its lightsail leaves were furled its mass was pulling up i want a better look at that svetz said he and miya drifted among the black treetops a silver line no thicker than coarse wire rose from one of the tufts it was tangled through the black cotton of this and two other anchor trees miya collected vegetation for thaxir to try black anchortree foliage green leaves and stems and a dugup root lichen and mushrooms seaweed thaxir liked lichen and certain leaves they jumped the minim four days zeera was getting cabin fever she and svetz went out while miya stayed with thaxir three anchor trees had merged the root line reached straight out of the common tuft all the other trees that had once stood straight now leaned toward the trees that had caught the dangling line zeera was clumsy on a flight stick she hovered above while svetz drifted among the black treetops earths ecology was adapting to the alien grove seaweed grew among the trunks and seabirds hunted fish a bird had made a nest in the black foliage and laid eight small blue eggs svetz collected the eggs for ra chen theyll rot zeera objected well be months getting home with the ffd doesnt the minim have a cold box have you seen one wait now maybe the vivarium only needs to study the interior structure if we dont expect eggs to hatch so svetz put them in the trade kit and turned them to gold another sixday jump made it clear that many of the anchor trees were going to merge the root line had grown thicker as thick as svetzs little finger they jumped another ten days and studied the anchor grove through the minim dome the grove was merging into a single mass anchor trees farther away had fallen on their sides their trunks grew along the ground some merged head to tail only those closest to the hangtree root still stood and those leaned growing into one conical stalk the collar of black foliage was growing ragged svetz and miya geared up and went through the inner door miyas hand stopped him on the launch platform below the launch platform a ring of men in metal shells was converging on the minim a sailing ship built like an ornately carved bathtub lay at anchor nearby miya dropped her flight stick we cant go down to meet them no ladder better not fly either right svetz thumbed his translator on jack a soldier stepped forward they all looked alike and svetz had to guess he was looking at jack jack was clean he had shaved svetz shouted down whats his own voice carried but the translation didnt svetz turned up the volume on the device pointed it down and asked in a normal voice whats happened while weve been away jack let the translator do his shouting jack shouted back a great wonder thisyou called these beanstalk roots this monstrous beanstalk sprang from them overnight it happened while i was in delirium from fever he moved like a healthy man now dole yeast might have cured a vitamin deficiency but another great wonder the saint mercurius has arrived please make the acquaintance of captain magalhaes major iv reira father de castro look at her wouldnt you like to so beautiful shamefree barbarian devils other voices were intruding miya flushed and stepped back out of sight the translator wasnt picking up just the shouts it caught several near whispers and translated them all the one in the window i wonder if she bares her breasts too to have two such wives but they are dark he gave jack gold he must have much more to treat it so lightly why does he not invite us in what might this wizard be hiding inside svetz tried to answer only the shouts from jack and captain magalhaes a pleasure to meet you so far from home little chance to explore the weather seems most pleasant in the morning yes some of us have learned to eat fish what is the date i must ask the navigator captain magalhaes lowered his voice not to a whisper but to a softer authoritative bark three mongrels of a dark strange race a man with two wives who claims to be christian and russian father de castro is this a christian is this a russian i have met russians their skin is whiter than mine whiter than my fathers i should say given what this fierce sun has done to my complexion their ceremonies are queer and their beliefs are strange jack i do not see what you trusted in this svetz did you see his dwelling from a distance sir and then it was gone and now returned it stands on two chicken legs this from father de castro i think this man may be a kind of russian sorcerer from jack sir i believe he saved my life i know his generosity well jack perhaps you are too trusting captain magalhaes raised his voice master svetz the year is fifteen sixtyfour in the month of april and we are ten days from celebrating easter we hope you will join us miya touched his arm keep it cool here i have an urge to cover up sure svetz said and he stepped forward smiling as miya stepped inside thank you captain jack look what i found he tossed down a handful of gold eggs jack caught two of the eight the others fell and lay like golden eyes looking up from the mud the shelled men stared for less than a heartbeat then jack reached to pick up another eggand so did every other man except captain magalhaes the priest got one jack had three he stepped out of the scuffle and handed one of the eggs to captain magalhaes for inspection miya stepped out wearing a ships blouse she saw the knot of excitement and asked hanny what did you do who me hanny theyve been waiting for me to invite them in miya they must think we have an invisible door down there where theres nothing but hydrogen tank not showing them my home makes me an illmannered barbarian right so i distracted them you gave them golden eggs and watched them fight right said svetz and he waved and grinned widely and went back inside zeera lets jump a few days i cant think of anything more we want to learn from these savages well miss their holy day theyll be sure were sorcerers arent we they counted ten strobes and dropped out at midnight miya and svetz went out with mag specs the portuguese ship was still at anchor a glare on shore near the ship was the remains of a cookfire oblong wooden structures reflected infrared light nothing interesting had happened to the hangtree so zeera jumped them again miya stayed to tend thaxir svetz and zeera went out the line from the sky was no thicker but for a swelling several meters above the tuft xeera found another lump six meters higher and another and another pumps she said you cant get fluid very high with just capillary action look zeera those little bulges are crawling moving up the line not pumps more like little cargo vessels svetz were going to have to stay and watch this they dipped into the green forest to collect a variety of leaves for the martian svetz asked zeera what about thaxir she could float if you put her in a pressure suit well yes if her faceplate wasnt smashed svetz lifted again for another look at the swellings on the cable thirty to forty meters apart a tablespoon of water each hey zeera whats wrong with this picture maybe they pull apart as they climb you know accelerating theyd better otherwise add it up and its enough mass to pull the tree down is that what happened at mars a million tonnes of war fleet if the center of mass of an orbital tether drops below geosynchronous orbit somethings got to fall zeera said maybe we can fix that faceplate that part turned out to be easy zeera cut two lenses out of a fishbowl helmet and embedded them in a meteor patch size large that fit across thaxirs pressure suit mask they waited for night and high tide thaxir watched on the airlock platform while her captors worked at putting the pulley system together then suddenly losing patience she began climbing down the pulley ropes svetz found it a startling sight thaxir had been sloughing her exercise but now she was a tremendous insect climbing head down all six appendages gripping the ropes despite earths gravity six limbs were enough there were hot spots in the jungle svetz wondered what the soldiers thought they saw thaxir descended into the surf zzz she said and the translator said pleasure svetz and miya swam around thaxir she seemed to be comfortable for the lirst time since her capture she asked for her pouch with her food and her harp and they dropped that down to her times had become too interesting for the locals they were gone leaving time travelers and portuguese in possession miya and zeera went to pick leaves for thaxir in the forest they took the trade kit after all they might meet portuguese the minims cameras were mounted to watch the black knot where all the anchor trees now merged where the root trailing from the hangtree was now thick as miyas calf the cameras found several portuguese sailors on a climbing expedition the nearhorizontal trunks were easy going but climbers were stalled near the peak still why had he assumed that sailors couldnt climb they must spend half their lives in the rigging of sails so svetz might have gone with the women but he stayed to watch he had thought the portuguese might approach him they had seen golden coins then golden eggs and now they must have glimpsed a sea creature moving about the minim but nobody had come perhaps their religious father figure had warned them away from wizards the women returned at sunset they took turns cleaning up in the minim before they would talk to svetz we met some conquistadors in the woods miya told him learn anything dont talk to strange men zeera snapped miya said we did some teaching too the women wouldnt meet his eyes nor each others svetz let it go eventually hed get the story chapter thaxir had slept floating this morning she played in the water getting her exercise without fighting gravity svetz sat on the launch platform watching he felt restless they were wasting time and there was no need how did a hangtree grow could it survive to the present would it move on to some other star what would kill it and what was its life span the only things left to learn would all be learned using the fast forward device with the ffd they would watch it all happen wait for present time and ultimately report it all to the institute thaxir a breaking wave had caught her and was washing her toward shore a martian might well find an ocean terrifying and indeed she seemed paralyzed borne headfirst toward the beach on her belly plates svetz considered rescue the tide was in he could reach shore with a flight stick and risk being seen or let the waves wash him in but then hed be stuck onshore for hours though it might be the only way to help thaxir waves rolled her up the sand wouldnt it be better to hail her using the translator and ask her to wait futz no if the tide went out hed have to roll her back to the water but now she was on all sixes crawling headfirst back into the waves and shelled men at the edge of the woods were shouting gesticulating then dropping to one knee and aiming their kinetic weapons tubes they fired into green water and foam thaxir was gone miya and zeera were both sleeping svetz caressed miyas foot she snapped alert in an instant portuguese onshore im going to have to talk to them is there anything ill have to apologize for behind his shoulder a chilled voice said do not apologize for anything thats an order svetz miya said believe it hanny anything to make them apologize for no great and what do i tell them about thaxir she was onshore they saw her miya said let me sleep in the sshh hisss of waves there was a music born of madness svetz tried to ignore it but his mind ran away from him chasing the beat the water was withdrawing from the land svetz glanced down to be sure but yes thaxir was in the shadow of the minim safely hidden in floating weed she was playing her windstormminor harp in time with the waves svetz called a cheery good morning to six portuguese the conversation that followed was all shouting over diminishing distance and hissing waves but svetz didnt have to do his own shouting the captain was missing a man had svetz or his wives seen alfonso nunes svetz answered well but men in armor all look alike from a distance was there anything distinctive alfonso nunes is short captain very hairy and lost his helmet long ago so his face is dark the translator was picking up normal voices again captain magalhaes shouted six went out to the woods yesterday afternoon five returned there was no blood on the survivors they will not speak to any but the priest and father ie castro will not speak i must not violate a covenant but i must know has any soldier tried to rob you master svetz nobody has troubled us here not even the great sea creature i saw it myself master svetz we fired on it to protect you i think it harmless i armed myself and swam with it yesterday captain and it did not trouble me svetz was beginning to enjoy himself remembering whales undying hatred for its captors he said many large sea creatures enjoy the company of men it is known that you and your women have gold no we gave you what we had why would we need such stuff here he lies captain let me try my surgical skills on his tongue why peter would you wade into the sea to shout your threats up at him on his platform peace peter patience master svetz where did you find these golden eggs the portuguese were growing hoarse the shouting was wearing them down and thaxirs music that might have been the sound of the sea hereabouts they were losing subtlety their greed showed through an antic whim took svetz futz theyd never trust him anyway and now he was sure that theyd offended his women he pointed straight up along the hangtree from up there i got the coins there too but im not wanted back by their questions he let them add their own details together they concocted a wild tale in which svetz climbed to orbit robbed a giant of coins returned and captured a bird that laid golden eggswho had escaped and must be still at large in the jungle maybe jack saw it shall we talk to jack jack has gone exploring said captain magalhaes we should join him i think i thank you for the suggestion captain magalhaes turned away but some of his soldiers were looking toward the green jungle and others toward the hangtree beanstalk rising to infinity and the voices went on alvarez you thieving son of a dog tell me what that sorcerers women will have told him will he kill us all with his magic captain they are not hurt we only wanted to have our way with them but they are hiding gold you understand captain no we would not have hurt them even if alfonso threatened the dark woman truly he might have hurt her not just had his way with her yes peter peter alvarez da orta if you lie to me now god will never find your soul they were not hurt sir sir they were not hurt we blocked their way alfonso nunes set the edge of his sword against the black womans throat and spoke his threats and then we all fell over and could not move evil was the day we came to this unholy place but you could see and hear yes captain two women six men pitiful what happened to alfonso nunes did they drag him away a pause then yes no we didnt see captain captain no stay your hand we will show you peter we must and they were among the trees and their voices fuzzed out thaxir was elated she tried to describe the sensation of riding a rolling wall of water down onto powdered rock in two and a half mars gravities with all her limbs pulled against her body to make her into a great unstoppable missile the translator was losing phrases an epiphany svetz gathered how did she feel her soul was complete but physically water was her natural element she could float waking or sleeping and rest or she could swim against waters resistance and exercise her whole body we need to be about our mission svetz said will you come with us into the future thaxir was startled she took some time to think then would you leave me behind if i asked why not but i dont think its a good idea earths gravity will kill you young even if you could find a food supply in the present we can levitate you well take care of you in the vivarium until willy gorky knows how to make mars habitable again thaxir asked for details vivarium levitate then she rolled on her back to look up at the minim how will you get me back up there do you think you can climb well let me try svetz watched her climb the ropes of the halfcompleted pulley she didnt have trouble until she was nearly free of the water there she stalled miya came out on the platform to watch thaxir dropped back and tried again and failed again well set up the pulleys miya said thaxir disappeared underwater svetz and miya went to work they werent surprised when the green giant didnt surface at once it might be her last chance to swim the oceans of the thirtysecond century were polluted to a greenandblack goo during a rest break he turned his mag specs on the hangtree there had been attrition but he saw at least two climbers in the black tuft the root that ran into the sky had become as thick as a mans leg a third man was climbing it eighty meters up another was pulling on the root he could hardly be needed to hold it steady he too must intend to climb it the view through the minim dome was the same as the cameras almost straight up the anchor trunks past the underside of the black tuft and up into infinity anyone might be in the tuft zeera came out whats this about getting out of here i thought theyd been having trouble arranging the pulley system it was new to them both now im not sure zeera did you kill someone in the woods silence miya ignored them both svetz said alfonso nunes short very hairy almost as dark as you didnt wear a helmet six of em thought they were going to rape us and torture us zeera said miya stunned them down we talked a little about what to do with them but we couldnt move them without letting them wake up just putting them to sleep didnt seem like much of a lesson miya wanted to steal their pants and dye their uh pubic region not enough they think weve got gold they wouldve tortured us to get it rape thats just entertainment svetz they take it as their due a woman doesnt walk alone or speak to a man if she has a protector to speak for her a woman alone is is anyones they have to be taught svetz and youd steal their pants theyre showing something to captain magalhaes right now svetz asked what is he going to see zeera turned away miya answered theyre going to take him to that temple jack showed us hes going to find a gold statue lifesized reclining obscene why didnt thaxir toss us her pack dont know right the martian had left her pack underwater when she tried to climb where is she dont know am i being distracted miya always talk it out remember lets talk about a gold statue i take it you turning to zeera used the trade kit on alfonso nunes svetz looked into the forest but the portuguese were all gone why him miya answered he had his pants off he had zeera down on that stone dais before i got to my stunner knife at her throat i had to stun them both and then wait for zeera to wake up he stank like nothing ive ever smelled like the ostrich cage after the roc broke loose zeera said and he was hard he had an impressive erection nunes could have had a great media career if hed waited a few centuries right zeera right you could have stopped me zeera i had a different impression miya said coolly svetz said theyre showing that statue to captain magalhaes right now whyd they wait this long miya wondered zeera laughed gold she said mocking they dont know how to move it or hide it or sell it but they want it miya said hanny we turned some of those stoneware things to gold too and that row of knives they might think it was all native work hide him in plain sight what is it hanny lakmy nivbn svetz touched his mag specs what ho thought hed seen thaxir thaxir was out of the surf and almost to the trees her pack was on her back sixlimbed thaxir managed a fast crawl whats she doing miya wondered escaping i told her wed leave her here if she wanted svetz said she was into the forest shouldering trees aside a portuguese came running out he ran down the beach southeastward never slowing they made a meal while they talked it over the default option is that we can leave her zeera said any objection willy gorky wanted us to negotiate with her but shes not negotiating and shes not in contact with the tree anyway shell starve miya said hanny dont you have an opinion svetz had been letting them run on while he watched the anchor grove they were wasting time but svetz himself shied from abandoning a story half finished jack was on the hangtree a hundred and twenty meters above the anchor grove hed left his metal shell below this would not be much like climbing rigging ropes would have some slack to them would run horizontal in spots still he climbed on two men portuguese but without their shells waited below him in the black foliage thaxir was not to be seen svetz said she knows what she can eat you know ive taken a lot of prisoners in my time im used to considering them property but they dont talk to me im inclined to consider that thaxir owns herself im surprised at what she can do in earth gravity maybe shell maim herself maybe shell crawl back to the sea for rest and sleep and forage on land or just eat seaweed maybe the conquistadors will kill her but she knows the risks as well as we do or better so the question is how long will it be before she needs rescue do we stay or go or fast forward by a year and look again hyahl what its her a great yellowgreen insectile shape poked itself above the black fluff jacks companions hung themselves away out of the tuft and how they fell was not to be known the martian began to climb six limbs around a silver thread miya was scrambling for mag specs zeera had hers there she can climb she was faking us out sure as futz how high can she expect to get whatever we cant do anything about it the minim wont fly and the flight sticks wont carry anything like that much weight thaxir wasnt moving fast jack was hardly moving at all shes catching up shell have to get past him miya said jack looked down and saw the monstrous shape coming up at him zeera said svetz try your ir on the beach zeera i want to see but he knew the sound of terror svetz obeyed found the beach looked for hot spots and zoomed where a portuguese had burst from the forest forty minutes ago nine were now wrestling with some massive tube zeera get us ready for fast forward ill cut these lines svetz dropped to the cargo level and went out the airlock within the shadows of the forest shelled men were backing their big metal tube against a tree trunk svetz had a familiar view straight down the axis he slashed away the nevertested pulley system most of it fell into the sea he pulled what remained through the airlock then stabbed virtual buttons the airlock doors closed get us into ffd he told zeera but she was already doing it the tube blinked fire clouds raced the sun set and rose again i wonder how that came out miya said svetz said id say jack is a doomed man and isnt it a wonderful thing to be able to leave all your mistakes behind im just wondering though what will happen if those men go home with an obscene statue made of solid gold theyll have all of europe thinking that theres gold all over these continents and the locals dont deserve to keep it there was silence and the flicker of time passing until miya asked hanny did you do anything with the talker talker no zeera last i saw it it was lying lying right next to thaxirs head do you suppose that was in her pack too it was broken beyond repair wasnt it zeera oh yes but thats still the answer svetz decided she took the talker but why chapter during the opposition of a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk first at the lick observatory then by parrotin of nice and then by other observers english readers heard of it first in the issue of nature dated august am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun in the vast pit sunk into their planet from which their shots were fired at us the war of the worlds by h g wells the portuguese ship lasted a minute or two then zipped away they watched the anchor grove shed its black top a knot remained where it had been where anchor trees joined the root of the hangtree but it had grown a klick or two higher and the marks of a join were fading it was all one organism now far above where earths atmosphere no longer filtered the sunlight of naked space photosynthesis stored energy as some form of sugar water and soil nutrients from below sugar from above and so the tree survived and grew they watched and argued and took turns reading notes into the record they ate dole bricks and drank recycled water they took turns sleeping svetz and miya made love on the cargo net while zeera slept above them beneath a strobe made by the whirling sun years passed outside the minims ruined hull more ships came wooden buildings sprang up the green forest shrank back to reveal patchwork farmlands farm gave way to factories then to city and the shore receded so gradually that svetz hardly noticed but now the minim stood among six and eightstory buildings was the land rising land did rise and fall but the hangtree only grew greater svetz could picture roots spread through the bedrock beneath this land lifting passing time began to wear on the minims crew well over a thousand years of development had shaped the minims waterrecycling system but how well had it survived martian shellfire and a crash landing fast forward itself was experimental after several weeks aboard the minim in an environment that changed like dreams it was easy to imagine that water had begun to taste of trace elements accumulating that dole bricks had gone bad that air was developing a stench zeera developed an annoying cough passing centuries swept them into a future that diverged from their own the tree was grown vast it cut the suns arc like a storm cloud moored in place briefly tall structures with glass faces rose in a crescent about the base of the hangtree using the trunk as a main support structure but the tree was alive and its shape changed year by year glass slabs stretched and crumbled and remained in place as slums the ruined glass faces and the cracks were mended with stucco or concrete over and over external sensors registered air becoming postindustrial zeeras cough cleared up when she saw that theyll be burning coal in europe running steam engines svetz miya that stuff is almost breathable read it again miya suggested though factories had appeared even on this equatorial shoreline readouts still showed too little carbon dioxide too much oxygen we cant go out anyway miya said futz were all going crazy in here but we cant first thing you know were under arrest for illegal parking i dont get this zeera said were assuming the hangtree makes sugar right even if chlorophyll isnt what its using martians live on the sap but its being made outside the atmosphere so wheres all this oxygen coming from miya was willing to speculate co and water come up with the sap sugar and oxygen go down the same way or maybe oxygen just diffuses through the bark and drifts down what the futz miyas reactions were faster she hit the ffd switch the sun stopped at high noon tangled in mirror blossoms a metal structure as big as a tenstory building came out of the sea on a tripod of threehundredmeter legs it was walking toward the city but now it turned ponderously as if it had just seen the minim svetz could almost make out what was inside the tiny dome and then light brighter than a thousand suns flared at them even a softfinger plasma blast wouldnt have hurt the minims superconducting hull but the gouge over the oxygen tank flared and gave way in the instant before miya stabbed the ffd switch then everything strobed but the minim rang like a bell svetzs seat flung him forward and then back cracking his neck like a whip he saw flame backfiring through the break in the oxygen tank an instant more and the minim would have exploded like a car in a movie seasons passed outside while the minim creaked and toppled to a thirtydegree angle and stuck there the threelegged thing was gone the city had been leveled they watched it being rebuilt i think those were softfingers miya said svetz said i didnt see even if it was martians were they from mars or the hangtree were deep into industrial times after all mars must be dying zeera how long twelve hundred years to go svetz was in the shower bag the display flashed a radiation warning and svet was about to yell when zeera switched off the ffi he said i thought i saw here zeera had the meteor sensor going in passive mode a map of the earth showed a swarm of red arrowheads we just passed the year zero hanny first atomic bomb propeller planes anything that cracks the speed of sound now isnt local arrowheads swarmed over the center of the north american continent but others were on the equator just about here svetz looked up an overlay on the dome was blinking red arrowheads around little fastmoving dots those are softfmger lens ships miya said theyre invading earth again what do you think are they looking for nuclear test grounds ten lens ships all wheeled to converge on the minim svetz said i think we should punch out miya hit the ffd plasma cannon blinked and were gone cityscape around the minim showed craters and broken walls they began to grow back futz id have liked to know more about that miya said zeera said mars must be on its last breath by now in twenty years well put our first probes around mars and not a drop of water or a whiff of oxygen left they must be desperate anyway were halfway home they waited it out they detected a much bigger blast of radiation another lens ship attack or else theyd seen the one race war if time hadnt been bent too badly an earthquake shook the city blink and half the buildings were down that must have been the shock from the hammer of august falling offshore from chili in shoreline cities had washed away bureau of space resources had not been able to stop the minor asteroid they didnt even have spacecraft to mount a pretense the united nations hierarchy took the blame for the destruction and were executed waldemar the first took power building styles changed they were smaller more graceful with more land around them population was dwindling partly due to un planning but not everyone could adjust to postindustrial air were right on track zeera said and coughed we dont know that time lines converge when they can changes we make are smoothed out youve seen that svetz miya usually sat out these discussions she didnt know enough history to have an opinion they mostly argued to convince miya so svetz said the time machine is too big to move itself the extension cage goes out on an arm that can swing in four dimensions coming home theres no telling where it might swing to ive met someone from a culture that blasted the human race to extinction wrona came from one where wolves evolved instead of men but ive always come back to the institute time line because the extension arm is attached at both ends but the institute time line can change too zeera youve seen that and we put it back miya was looking up through the dome the hangtree filled the sky the moon and stars hung in its branches the moon was only one light among a hundred mirror blossoms mag specs could find strange architectures forming tiny cityscapes along the trunk she whispered what legends are being made about that we dont have to wonder do we yggdrasil the axis runs through the earth a variety of heavens are in the branches hanny how could we have had the legends before the tree was in place there were legends of werewolves before i ever found wronas time line svetz said dreams and stories wander across the time lines well miya gestured upward you think its so easy then put that back the way it was i thought you wanted it the black was very restful sleep had not favored svetz for a long time but now the darkness went on and on he slept as if drugged in the sudden light he snapped awake and the sun sat on the ocean and wouldnt move barricades and familiar un police uniforms surrounded the minim thousands of people surrounded the barricades a few wandered inside the perimeter acting like they knew what was going on miya and zeera were asleep in their command chairs svetz ate a dole brick while he watched and waited presently miya stirred svetz asked her did you turn off the fast forward and then he noticed a dribble of silver where jacks coin had run molten miya saw what surrounded them and jerked upright its present time hanny we need to find a vidphone chapter the stem spreads its branches over the entire sky their leaves are the clouds their fruits the stars the ash tree itself is the nordic tree of life symbol of strength and vigor the ash tree from mattiolis commentaires lyons as a police roton lifted them toward the sky they saw a metropolis of eight to ten million spread beneath the vastness of the hangtree root town the police pilot called it and world tree an hour later the roton set them down at the institute for temporal research in angels city west coast of north america province where the garden had been they took deep gulps of air flavored by cactus blooms the roses and onceedibles were gone scores of varieties of cactus bloomed in dry earth and perfect crescent dunes was this some whim of the new secretarygeneral and where was the ornamental pond the pond was where they dumped the heat from a returning xcage they were still enjoying the taste of postindustrial air zeeras cough had come back during that last thousand years and svetz had caught it too theyd been sure the minims air was foul the instruments were sure it wasnt a crowd wove its way through the cactus to meet them willy gorky shouldered between them he had lost weight miya why didnt you call how did you get here fast forward what else was there she snapped willy why didnt you send us an xcage weve only just finished resetting the small xcage that was no trivial problem miya you never gave us a date miya said but why would got it said svetz ra chens disgusted look suggested that hed seen it too how long has it been since our last call four hours ra chen shrugged his eyebrows yes miya we used fast forward and thats why we didnt get rescued because were already here zeera was nodding the other end of the talker link before the talker was smashed that was present time thats when the ffd burned out these things wont go into the future four hours ago if wed been awake wed have called you right back but why cant we still send gorky stopped seeing the way they all looked at him what would happen if we sent a rescue vehicle now would you pop like so many soap bubbles would i be looking at two of everyone nobody answered nobody knew the time machine was running on standby the large and small xcages looked ready to go though none of the stations were manned a dozen techs were seated around the drinks dispenser off duty now that the time travelers had been returned svetz recognized dark hillary wengfa pale zat forsinan and ruddy wilt miller from his own past the rest were strangers though they knew him while the two heads and three time travelers walked in and took seats zat and a stunning eurafrican woman tall and narrow as a soda straw put coins in the dispenser without asking what anyone wanted and brought themwater clean water svetz savored the taste people were acting peculiar he would wait to learn why and why the drinks dispenser had only two settings and what was it about the way they all looked the time travelers must look like three rats turned loose from a dirty cage ra chen was amused and not hiding it he looked good he too had lost weight he said we jiggered the inertial calendars on the xcages the intertemporal talker is a kind of a little xcage after all whatever travels in time needs more energy to coexist with it its like hitting a bump we can sense that willy gorky exclaimed thats what you were doing ra chen laughed we never got a date but there are tricks we can pull were all set to send the xcages back toward minus ae which is just precolumbian and pop out where the talker was ruinedwhen you landed right zeerapick you up leave an instrument package and come home still we dont know everything about time zeera did you learn anything about the squirrel after a long moment zeera said squirrel ra chen frowned batatosk zeera was still looking blank as well she might secretarygeneral victor four wants the giant squirrel that used to run up and down the world tree it was bigger than whale so hes got to have it if it was a squirrel at all ole romer the ancient danish astronomer he saw it and thought it was a squirrel but what it was ra chen felt their confusion what sir it seems weve changed the past a little svetz said what was our mission we know when it died svetz the impact caused the tidal wave thai washed away rio de janeiro it might have been sick or old for longer than that but futz the xcage was already set for precolumbian batatosk must have been in its prime then locate it send for the large xcage get the squirrel and bring it home nothing about martians martians tree dwellers legends fire giants frost giants if they were real theyve been extinct since oh before serious telescopes those were martians willy gorky looked at ra chen before he spoke id like to rescue some martians did you have any contact with them mostly hostile svetz saw body language he half understood he asked tell me about merging history bureau and bureau of the sky domains willy said briskly and without rancor right its all history now victor four likes strange animals just like his brother hes financed a heavy lift extension cage we fulfilled our mission svetz said a bit belligerently we went to mars for the seeds to grow that and he gestured southeast far around the curve of the world the hangtree still owned the sky we didnt just grow seeds we brought back the tree itself with that we can own the sky willy gorky said not under victor four i think mars whats it like svetz swept up their plastic cups and went to the dispenser for refills he came back cradling five cups and set them down without spilling hed bought himself a few seconds to think the dispenser had only two settings water and carbonated water that seemed important he said willy we had a martian too but shes gone back up the tree bong miya demanded what the futz was that but svetz and zeera were running toward the guide pit and the heads were just behind them talker svetz called back hut we can see all three extension cages ra chen shoved into the guide pit he tapped the virtual display head talk to me an inhuman voice spoke with the sound of a sustained belch translator willy gorky demanded zeera beat them to the draw let me set it sir this is portuguese thats martian ra chen made way for gorky talk to me gorky said syllables burbled the un translator said such is our intent is miya within sound of my voice or svetz or zeera miya pushed past miya here and now ae thaxir yes a tech was trying to finetune the talker but gorky was tending to that himself softly he asked zeera could this be your talker the settings changed how badly it was ruinedl miya had been talking rapidly with the voice at the other end of time she said over her shoulder thaxir saystell them yourself thaxir i took the ruin of your talker we studied that until we could build one ourselves what you said of probabilities made sense to us miya the love of adventure may take some of us to future earth instead of the stars what must we do ra chen asked how many want to come thaxir we have travelers from all of the five races the martian voice gave numbers four green giants fourteen red humanoids twenty softfingers three of the great crabs and six of their humanoid symbiotes of the pious ones only the smiths had settled on the tree eleven would try earth if you can give us low gravity i will come too i am too old to reach the stars even if the tree would go and i laid my last egg long since sir i have the new setting hillary wengfa said gorky demanded we can call back and get thence with the small xcage yes theyre calling from pluseleven ae miya tell her well call back ra chen said thaxir were switching off now but well switch on again before you can draw breath i know how strange that sounds but its true miya switched off they want rescue svetz svetz had been adding it up one load in the large xcage but theyll be crowded setting up a cage in the viv bestiary is no problem whales got all the room he needs that many martians will too we can set shelves at different levels and give them material to make houses the mission ra chen said gently was to retrieve a squirrel willy gorky asked just what kind of promise did you make miya rescue as many as want to go that was our mission willy you wanted a beanstalk but waldemar the eleventh miya willy said gently walls have ears victor the fourth was the secretarygeneral the only secretarygeneral wanted martians miya said anyway willy said ra chen we never really get used to the way time changes things around martians willy gorky said ra chen does it strike you that martians on the world tree would know a lot about the squirrel theyve lived with it if we can get the martians first well have their help in retrieving the squirrel two trips for the large extension cage twice the cost right absolutely what settings are you using for his cage batatosk what does he eat nuts the size of this dome no that cant be it because if one of those ever fell anytime in human history wed have records so we dont know what to feed him dont know how much room he actually needs it might be thousands of klicks he might want a vertical treadmill with variable gravity but im guessing there if we take time to study him to see what he needs in the way of a cage environment hell probably die willy gorky glared into ka chens eyes at close range if only we had somebody to ask point taken willy theres lots of martians we can house them well get readings for archaic mars right out of the minim but we only get one shot at batatosk if he dies yes not liking it svetz asked wouldnt we be giving the squirrels cage to the martians ra chen brushed it off we built six of the big cages when waldemar ten was secgen and we had the funding whale in one roc in another roc survived used to be ostrich anyway batatosk would have gone in one if we ever get the heavy lift xcage running well go after the midgard serpent and if we can ever reach back far enough we can house a brontosaur and a tyrannosaurus rex separately no housings not a problem and yes drown it well get the martians get em back for me miya chapter un officials were beaming the minims records from root town to the institute for temporal research in angels city it was a slow process if youre near the tree you can relay from the mirror sails but were not close enough for that there are only a few orbital windows such that a relay satellite wont crash into the tree willy gorky said youd think geosynchronous orbit would be safe but the mass of the tree only allows you two stable points lagrange four and five just like the moon you can do twelvehour poletopole orbits not near the tree of course that must take lots of deltav svetz said and sipped his water hed barely heard the word but he knew it was a measure of fuel consumption ixw earth equatorial orbits were the easiest to reach youre drowning right you need so much deltav for either set of orbits that you might as well go to the moon for anything but weather satellites and signal relays all these stations are too high you lose signal definition willys fist clenched on his glass svetz you could put anything you wanted in low earth orbit without smashing into the world tree right we could right drown me even men right when first man went into orbit in plus sixteen ae drown me we had to go straight to the moon is that bad in the reign of chaka third between plus one eighty and two hundred ae we put a dozen men on the moon brought em back and never went again for thirty years the world had already used up too many resources svetz without the tree we could have had a moon colony by fifty ae our space program is a pitiable thing you said that willy looked up to you wait svetz thought that was then that was the other you when the first man stepped on the moon in ae that willy wanted a beanstalk aghast willy asked why pitiable svetz thought our idea he said was to run elevators up the tree or a linear accelerator get to orbit and beyond for whatever the electricity costs drop asteroid mining ships from the upper end he drank the last few drops of water water was expensive he hadnt noticed yesterday nobody thought wed have to fight seven kinds of martians to do it vie four wouldnt support it anyway willy im starting to think that nobody really tries to get the stars for his grandchildren anyone who wants the stars must want thorn now for eleven and a half centuries sir a tech was trying to get willy gorkys attention willy turned as if glad to escape sir we have numbers for archaic mars air comp temp gravity and so forth we need to rework the large xcage and furnish a cage in the bestiary six hours svetz entertain yourself the dole yeast dispenser was empty svetz brought miya a cup of water miya had been talking to martians for hours the first invasion from mars was a softfinger fleet she told him in minus fifty ae we saw one of their walkers almost nobody came back the martians on the tree thought it was some disease of earth that killed them all we think it was gravity thaxir says the rebuilt talker has been ready for centuries nobody wanted to use it all these centuries the peoples of the tree must have thought they could invade earth any time the tree failed them when the first few atomic bombs went off in year zero the softfingers tried some reconnaissance missions they were sure wed use the bomb on the tree if they didnt hit us first they wanted to know where the bombs were most of their wok ships never even set down but when they got home the pilots were dying earths gravity breaks their internal membranes ive been trying to tell thaxir how antigravity in the zoo works make room svetz slid into place and said svetz at ae calling thaxir are you thence i am hence svetz the antigravity the sky domains uses is expensive we dont use that in the zoowhich they seem to call the bestiary now miya thaxir we use a magnetic field that acts on the magnetic moment of hydrogen we can float organic material i saw them float a halfmillionton bubble of seawater into whales cage then move whale in without hurting him believe me putting martian gravity in a mars environment cage is the easy part i will convey svetz miya tells me that there are none of us on the tree in your future our past your future they tell me the same they tell me some tremendous animal yes miya spoke of that a squirrel is a beast that run up and down trees and your first telescopes saw something large running up and down the tree svetz i have consulted with our storytellers long ago red martians invaded crab territory during a border dispute we think your ole romer saw their heavy war lift while they were ferrying troops and armaments the secretarygeneral wasnt going to like that svetz thought he said get yourselves into place when youre ready to be picked up and not before smash the talker that brings us we cant hold the large xcage in the past for very long at all yes miya told me svetz i need rest i dont have your human stamina and the ready light went out miya looked exhausted gaunt and drooping svetz told her you need sleep and something to eat and a bath we both all need baths and nobodys offered us one lets check it out find zeera too good miya its present time do i still look good to you she smiled took his hands and squeezed hard you look like me i bet tired half starved lets get something to eat and then bathe each other the large xcage loomed over the middle of the dome an extension arm behind it ran into the same metal housing from which a smaller arm led to the small xcage to the right of the guide pit strangers were at work in the pit writing in the specs that had come from the minim more strangers were gluing a bin the size of a bungalow to the tipper curve of the xoage wilt miller was supervising he hailed them svetz was relieved most techs were total strangers who had known him for years that was disconcerting wilt was an exception and easy to spot skin that was always sunburn red and flamered hair wilt gestured at a pile of hardware two men high look it over what part of this is garbage what are you going to need for this mission they discussed it pressure suits of course theyd fill the xcage with a marsstyle atmosphere and wear pressure suits themselves no telling if refugees would bring enough oxygen theyd want gorkys special filter helmets for breathing mars atmosphere lines hanny youll be maneuvering near sixty refugees in vacuum and free fall miya said youll need stickstrips and fixpoints and lines ill get those from space bureau wilt give me a man and a floater cart bottled water medical equipment what kind of accidents were likely to hurt or kill martians during a rescue svetz listened nodded advised then he asked wilt about baths and showers bath well that was awkward gorky wanted the large xcage off in five hours everyone was busy so the bath was available yes the problem was in finding enough people to take a bath zeera wont like the conditions svetz told miya shell be pissed if we dont invite her wont she sure the lock on the bathroom was a guard program they typed in an appointment then went looking for a quorum they found zeera and ra chen on cots in the sleep area ra chen was snoring like a machine with a bad bearing zeera was awake too hungry to sleep anymore she said whats up svetz tried to explain what was going on the guard program isnt corruptible or else i dont know the codes theres a big double door it wont let in less than eight or more than twelve one tub lots of towels and a sonic for cleaning those theyre short of water zeera said we noticed are you in im in zeera sounded tired id bathe with elephant id bathe with gila monster futz why not he could dry me with his breath so i guess ill bathe with you two hillary wengfa and zat forsman were loose or else they took pity on three bewildered time travelers and they brought three strangers eight was enough the bathroom was roomy the tub was luxurious finely carved and economically shaped equipped with water jets and bubbles but it wasnt big eight bathers sudsed each other before they took turns entering the tub they rinsed each other dried each other and drifted into communal sex so easily that svetz never had a chance to be startled water was to be celebrated he was deeply involved with hillary and trying to think of a polite way to break loose until he saw miya with zat that was a relief of sorts sometime during all this he looked at zeera up near the ceiling where the sauna heating was laughing down at them naked as he had never seen her dark and gaunt as a wraith zeera called down how important is horse horse why svetz even your weird fantasy theories dont claim that our unique horned horse needs a virgin attendant in ae shed been reading the old stories youre right so she said mart mart torgeson a total stranger until today was lolling in the tub he looked up brightly change your mind azeera ive been chasing you so long azeera and now you think its going to be easy zeera slid into the tiny tub and whispered in his ear and he jumped and accepted the challenge svetz watched in awe and unease zeera must think that the end of the world is coming most of them needed the tub again after all that activity the water was black theyd certainly burned up an hour and a half when a tech poked his head in and called if youre a time traveler youre wanted theyd finished loading and programming the large xcage willy gorky and wilt miller waited willy said weve tagged wilt to go back for the refugees on the tree but we also want to send someone whos talked to a martian zeera you got some sleep didnt you if youre up to it zeera breezed past svetz and miya im in boss look it over all of you we may have missed something we launch in ten minutes wilt miller with his ruddy skin might pass for a red martian if hed dyed his hair black and had cosmetic surgery to soften his jaw maybe that was why the heads had chosen him ra chen came to join them zeera and wilt climbed into pressure suits and entered they were lost inside the volume of the large xcage it would run on remote control from the small cage but there was also a chair and horseshoe of controls zeera took the chair wilt set some fixpoints and anchored himself to them svetz closed the hatch on them and stepped back the sphere faded in an instant the extension arm behind it faded away in a direction no human eye could follow now only instruments could record its progress toward the past svetz was inclined to monitor he was thwarted ra chen said drown me willy where are you going to put them sir i have men working on a cage in the bestiary ah good willy ill take care of the mission here time is my turf mars is yours take svetz and miya along and look over that cage someone might have missed something they walked toward the entrance with willy gorky hang on a second svetz said and looked for the water dispenser there were the tables left of the armory but where willy im lost wheres the water dispenser the what come on svet youre not any thirstier than anyone else chapter once there must have been a thousand kinds of cactus svetz hadnt known that but he couldnt doubt it while surrounded by scores of surviving varieties it bothered them that many of them seemed to be dying miya whispered hanny the chairs and tables were there but theres nothing between the armory door and the pit what happened to the drinks dispenser i thought it was over i thought we could adapt the world our species svetz said all we had to do was wait the drinks dispenser willy had left them behind he waited impatiently at the bridge that led through the world globe he didnt look that strong that energetic until svetz looked at miya and then down at himself the flesh hung on their bones their stomachs bulged with starvation he asked willy what happened to victors brother waldemar i liked him svetz i tried to teach him about the stars he died in childhood willy said and coughed lung troubles and willy led them into the world globe miya stopped in the middle svetz stopped too there was no need to speak again it was as if the skin of a world had been inverted and they stood at the center but this world was not their own the oceans were small blue patches on a world gone mostly red the continental shelves were dry land a blue worm wriggled the length of the valley that had been the mediterranean sea willy turned back misunderstanding he pointed out a ridge that stood up from what had been the seabed of the atlantic ocean are you familiar with atlantis some saltland farmers found the ruins in waldemar fours time on your time line we didnt have technology to look that deep miya told him well come on willy forged ahead miya lingered hanny did you see theyve got canals blue threads wriggled over the earth the largest followed the old rivers and the beds of the baltic black caspian and red seas and the sites of the great lakes but rectilinear networks branched out from tiny cubistic pumping stations on the old natural curves cities crowded around the remaining seas hundreds of klicks below what had been coastlines antarctica was a diminished ice cap on a greatly expanded continent highways wide enough to see from orbit led across dry seabeds to australia africa south america svetz pictured trucks as big as tanker ships laden with freshwater ice they caught up to willy gorky near whales cage which was more properly an aquarium he shared it with crabs and a seaweed forest whale held svetzs eye you made us extinct now its your turn this is why we have to guard the bestiary gorky told them every so often someone tries to break in all that water they must think its fresh of course but theres enough fresh water in the bestiary to to svetz turned around when willy trailed off willy was on the ground he looked dead svetz said these locks are beyond me miya miya looked dead too an angry and desperate ghost they must all be seconds from death willy sir do you know a code to get us into the cages willy stirred cages why we need water ra chen told me some of the codes which cage svetz looked about him the door to whales cage was up a stairway he didnt want salt water anyway snakes head lifted from his coils horse came to his feet horn poised for murder rabbit seemed to be hiding but owl housed in the same cage watched from an artificial tree branch dog dog woof state your name first willys head flopped back they picked up willy one under each shoulder willy didnt weigh much dogs crowded around the door waiting eagerly to greet them panting laughing they were of various sizes colors and breed mixtures miya shied back a bit but svetz felt no fear he said hanville svetz woof the double door unlocked and they went in three dogs swarmed him and one was wrona another was sniffing miya unsure they walked willy inside and set him down the air smelled wet you could taste it on your skin wet a big dish of water stood half full and open to the air they scooped water with their hands until their thirst was quieted then they dribbled water into willys mouth into his hair into the collar of his shirt he smiled and opened his eyes sitting with a dog under each arm svetz asked willy have you any idea what wrona is doing in here dogs need water willys voice was a bit slurred she has to be protected what did you think wed send her home with you svetz scratched wronas ears well fix it he said she looked up at him in perfect confidence willy were dying right were holding on willy said the antarctic ice isnt gone yet but we changed the past willy the change shock is still coming down the line i thought fifteen hundred years of intense natural selection would have shaped us for the dryness but it isnt going to be like that when the time line adjusts the human race will have been extinct for hundreds of years svetz what did you do we brought the world tree to earth he said it must have sucked up most of the water on mars already we busted it loose from mars it left a sapling behind in orbit the sapling must have finished draining mars meanwhile the hangtree came to earth and drained us wouldnt it have come anyway svetz was jolted miya is he right i dont know miya was starting to cry of course thaf s what a hangtree would want but it wasnt finished didnt have all the water on our time line the hangtree must have waited too long at mars something happened what oh phobos i wondered if the hangtrees trunk could oscillate in a harmonic rhythm with the inner moons orbit every time the moon conies past the trunk would be off to one side hanny it would be easy to disturb such a system close approach from an asteroid or a solar flare pushing on the mirror sails or just chaos in action leaving mars it would have to be dodging both moons but im guessing hanny another possibility miya svetz willy gorky said the question is what to do now chop down the tree svetz said that willy gestured southeast though the world tree couldnt be seen from dogs cage it was there in their minds to think of destroying such a thing was ludicrous in norse myth yggdrasil wasnt a part of the earth the world of mortals was a part of yggdrasil earlier stubbornly svetz went on when it first linked up the trailing root wasnt any thicker than my finger if only we had a time machinel miya said hanny if you chop through the link the trees still in geosynch orbit it dropped lots of anchor groves itll just link up again svetzs mind began to run in little panicky circles when tkt tree reached earth it was already too late we have to chop it btfort then at mars wait now we did that it came here we cant get to mars anyway an xcage wont reach that far the minim cant lift from earth wronas fur under his fingers the perfect trurt in her eyes were anchors to reality but whatever reality might be he was losing it willy said chop off the top miya said ah right then chop it with what svetz said wait would that work his mental mapping caught up and he said of course it would work you just have to chop off enough yes lets have a look in the armory miya suggested that got a quizzical look from gorky but svetz felt he had his balance back he said of course all of this has to be done at a dead run whats out there is not much different from current mars too dry for humans wrona held off the other dogs somehow while they drank deeply and splashed their collars and shirts and hair the dogs didnt much like intruders at their water dish willy asked what about the martians on the tree they looked at each other gravely when nobody else spoke svetz said i cant see a way to save them miya nodded willy gorky stood up a little wobbly and said the small xcage is set and ready to go are we all right go somebody had brought in a big lifter platform good idea martians wouldnt be able to walkbut it was unattended ra chen and three techs were all in the guide pit one of the techs was on her back with her knees and head propped up willy told the armory door willy gorky come to the arms of victor four a massive door opened svetz looked at what was inside the armory it was evidently a kinder gentler age willy said i dont know what you thought youd find miya were ready for riots and of course were ready for big animals but not a major deconstruction project it was also an age in which rioters might invade the secretarygenerals garden and bestiary in search of water the weapons locker held mostly sonic stunners thirty or more handguns and six twohanded sonic crowd sprayers of a design svetz had never seen they looked to be heavily shielded against backstun the net sprayer was a bulky twohanded thing it would tangle an ostrich or an elephant or hundreds of rioters there was space bureau pressure suit armor for half a dozen it too might double as riot gear there was nothing like the blasters theyd had aboard the minim svetz was used to a needle rifle he took one miya and gorky looked at him oddly so he put it back and now he was right out of ideas incoming ra chen called routine announcement but he wanted help svetz saw why another tech had passed out leaving only hillary wengfa and ra chen himself svetz slid into the pit nothing in the displays looked urgent the large xcage was being reeled in passing minus two hundred ae minus eighty plus ten out on the floor the extension arm faded a meter from the wall at first glance you might mistake the end for a hologram washed out by sunlight keep looking and your eyes would try to try to follow through long practice svetz wrenched his eyes away plus two ten three hundred willy and miya were at the pit miya was holding a hand stunner she said hanny we dont have anything to cut a hangtree with i know now what six hundred seven sixty man the lifter miya we dont have anyone else one thing at a time thats a little fast hillary eight thirty eight ninety too fast hillary tes but what do i do svetz showed her the numbers slowed telltales showed that the excess heat was being dealt with going where not the pond that was gone a radiator fin somewhere ten ninety eleven hundred incoming eleven five the extension arm was blocked by a ghost then a solid transparent shell a variety of martians had been plated around the shell they wore pressure suits as various as their shapes in the instant the xcage came home they all fell toward the earths center now they were thrashing and trying to pick themselves up where gravity had dropped them svetz looked for wilt and zeera a froglike entity with a pointed face occupied the control chair svetz found zeera and wilt in a cluster of red martians their handsfutz they were prisoners and what was that pointing down the axis of the xcage its size and placement made it hard to seetoo big and too foreshortenedbut only for that first instant under the big equipment bin in the ceiling a tube of crystal and copper and silver ran nearly the length of the large xcage the back end was welded in place it was a heat ray cannon longer than whale and the lens looked straight into the guide pit svetz jumped over the wall and ran theyd left the armory open svetz snatched up a twohanded sonic and ran at the xcage he was out of the line of fire but next to the great glass door as the doors began to open like flower petals all the four and sixlimbed martian shapes were thrashing around trying to get to their feet or trying to wave blades or longbarreled guns at the door bulgeeyed octopoids attended what must be the firing mechanism which was a sort of cockpit svetz had no idea whether a heat ray would fire through the xcages door or wall or reflect he guessed that they didnt either they waited miya was on the other side of the opening door her sonic handgun ready a green giant lurched into the bugeyed cannoneers and sent them sprawling in a tangle of rubber limbs miya forced her hand inside the doors and began spraying sound svetz had to wait one full second and then he could poke in both arms and the crowd sprayer he sprayed everything in the way aiming for the back of the cannon where the controls seemed to be and where another green giant was wrestling with the first the first must be thaxir but it didnt matter the crowd sprayer was not selective he sprayed them both and the two softfinger octopoids who wriggled free of the wrestlers and were trying to reach the trigger cockpit he was inside now and he waded toward that holding his aim on the cockpit men hands and blades kept popping up in his face but nothing around the cannon controls was moving anymore and now he was there zeera and wilt had wriggled away from their captors he fired bursts around them and around miya and nothing else seemed to be moving in the cageful of martians his arms were numb these martians were still conscious svetz remembered they just couldnt move or answer so he was talking to himself as he inspected the great weapon all right now we have a heat ray how the futz does it work cockpit and big attitude jets built for free fall more plasma weapon than laser maybe itll cut the tree maybe futz i think we can save the martians willy ra chen and willy gorky were in the xcage willy was pulling a red martian woman out hed set the edge of the floater against the doorway svetz cried willy stop what put her back we can save them just leave the martians where they are but weve got them and we want to keep them we didnt send the large xcage back far enough in time look willy were going to chop down the tree before they were rescued the only way to keep them retcued is to take them back with us because this time line is going to disappear willy looked a bit sick but he said got it leave them in the large xcage we have to take that back anyway because theres no easy way to dismount the cannon ra chen said if s set for the wrong time sixteen ae well have to reset it thatll take hours svetz i really dont think we have that long i dont either and they dont waving into the xcage earth gravity killed softfingers quick ra chen said advise me then drown you think the silence was a rustling of martians sonic weapons set muscles twitching at random the small cage is set for the right time miya said isnt it yes and you can set the large xcage to meet the small one cant you hanny its how you got whale then stet got it thanks ra chen was on it hillary you and i can run the xcages zeera you take the small extension cage back its set to drop out where the minims ffd disappeared around minus three fifty ae thats where your team went into fast forward and came here then hillary wengfa said wait now boss youre going to kill everyone in the universe youre dying now svetz told her when weve done our job youll be restored to health but it wont be me in a few hours it wont be anyone hillary ill take my chances you think youll save yourself hillary boss most people will be in better shape after weve done this millions of people wont be dead anymore were all near dead even if youve got too much courage to admit it nice phrasing but hillary wengfa wasnt showing courage it wont be mel i i cant help you do this no of course not go home hillary zeera you and me well be running two xcages we can send the large xcage back to meet the small xcage on manual soon as its in place are you up to it certainly hillary cried zeera youll disappear along with the rest of this willy youll take the small xcage back ra chen continued its set for the right timespace there are only two things you need to do he stepped into the small xcage and pulled willy after him the chair swivels this whole display on the left is remote controls for the large extension cage on arrival you punch this it summons the large xcage if we didnt need someone to do that wed send it empty then pull this in the middle thats the gohome i cant see any way you can get in trouble and its a futz of a ride im in willy said now willy willy climbed into the small xcage zeera and ra chen took their places in the pit svetz joined them but he only watched they were both better at this than he was willy watched them all with a look of wary anticipation the small xcage disappeared the extension arm led off in a direction the eye could not follow ra chen said hillary are you still here go home svetz miya you take the large xcage what have i forgotten svetz said thaxir get her apart from the rest before they ball up martians had fallen all around the control chair miya found a green giant and swore that she was thaxir it took three of them to pull her up the slope of the wall away from the others what else miya said pressure suits ra chen i think thats a plasma weapon well examine it on the way but well have to open the cage to use it and question some martians zeera said translators the net gun and something to cut nets more sonics net the trigger on the cannon and net the martians and keep them apart and spray a net over thaxir you want to keep them stunned and you dont want them wriggling loose and you dont want them to open the door or fire the cannon ra chen rubbed his temples sounds like a lot anything else miya lifted her sonic handgun and fired hillary reaching into the armory door dropped like loose bones thaf s all i can think of miya said get that stuff and get aboard chapter svetz took the control chair miya tethered herself with the lines and fixpoints zeera had abandoned they watched ra chen and zeera in the guide pit until all the colors went to chaos and gravity shifted to the center of the shell a rustling of stunned martians followed them into the past svetz and miya hung head down svetz had done this before and it didnt seem to bother miya the martians had all settled into a ball miya sprayed a net over them and tethered it to the curve that had been the ceiling thaxir hung in a net near her miya had already sprayed a fine net over the cannons firing cockpit every martian was wearing some kind of pressure envelope softfinger green giant and red martian pressure suits were no surprise svetz had seen them before the big crabs with their ogrehuman faces and their mock human mounts wore separate pressure envelopes with sockets to join them inflated bubbles with attached bottles held red martian children spindly sixlimbed dark green children as tall as a man grinning pointyfaced frogs festooned with tools tiny ogre crabs and infant crabmounts other such bubbles held animals and plants in what looked like terrariums thaxir hadnt mentioned that the childbubbles remained closed but all the adults had opened their helmets or zippers earths postindustrial air couldnt be good for them despite the high carbon dioxide content svetz asked shall we switch to martian air i dont want to close my helmet did you bring svetz held up a pair of clear bags filter helmets labeled for mars they act like theyre running out of air he said they took enough to board the xcage and enough more for the children they must think we still have preindustrial air or what or theyre running out what if the tree stopped giving them oxygen miya asked why would it do that parasite control we can ask they donned filter helmets svetz adjusted the air monitors miya spoke to the elderly green giant is that why you called us thaxir thaxir couldnt answer assuming this was thaxir the green of her shell was yellowed the plates of her face bore a wonderful array of fine delicate carvings and an old crack that svetzs blaster handle might have put there ages ago she hung twitching a bit svetz said i wish i really knew how sonics affect a martian im tired miya said you wiped from the moment we hit the target date we have to keep going for twenty minutes miya said thats right isnt it then we can quit we won or we didnt right go easy with the sonics dont knock them out again theyll all want to close their helmets when we open that big door she turned back to the green giant the hangtree is killing the earth it killed mars too we need to chop it down when if young i beg you to tell us how this weapon operates thaxir twitched not just a tremor she was trying to speak and she was amused while they waited svetz opened the talker ra chen boss problems smooth as silk then get off now call when youre in place click he hadnt realized the talker was using up ra chens life span and zeeras too they might have only minutes if a martian got too restless miya stunned it on low the species svetz could recognize were men and women in equal numbers a good many elders a handful of older children they had come as a colony even if their intent was conquest thaxir was stirring while svetz monitored the telltales miya talked to her believing she could hear thaxir mumbled slurred martian gibberish the un translator adjusted in seconds it said wake cannon masters who cannon masters know they waited presently thaxir said softfingers made the cannon dont put softfingers to sleep martians were stirring miya asked which ones softfingers all look alike chufchufchufa sound that came from thaxirs sides her spiracles laughter then let them all wake the large xcage moved steadily into the past toward where the small xcage had popped out svetz wasnt needed at the controls he let himself down on a tether to examine the weapon it had to be a weapon didnt it svetz remembered that heat beams from a wok ship diverged more than a laser and reflected less plasma gun if they fired it inside the closed xcage theyd cremate everything in a moment thaxir had said that twenty softfingers would come there might have been that many but they were a tangled mass of tentacles indistinguishable even by gender twenty awake would would what try another mutiny he brushed a few wakeful martians with the stunner on low more and more were waking softfingers were stirring too svetz cut a hole in the net pulled a softfinger outabout his own weight less than fifty kilograms nowlifted it to the shell and netted it in place then another and another miya was saying if the tree dies earth lives if earth lives we can make mars live again it might take a long time but we can thaxir do you have a problem with that trust me miya i havent decided what did you hope to gain at the institute softfingers outnumbered us fools we all were not to bring more of us they took our weapons if they have a plan they did not tell me but many joined them the promise was of a time machine with a chance to change old mistakes the green martian was ten times miyas weight and she was stirring again trust her miya had a stunner so did svetz why did you run from us the martian said long time ago you and the others told me this much that your end of time and mine should talk told me more but i believed that much then the landing smashed your talker i knew that my people on the tree could build it again i could not guess what else we would learn in learning how to do that i did not know if you would share knowledge i carried out your wish as you told it but i did it my way when we are made slave obligations bind us but to be slave does not kill our minds obligation runs two ways svetz said we dont hold intelligent beings as property at all is that why you let me run yes i wondered i serve you miya and svetz and zeera too you seek to destroy what destroyed my peoples world the scope of your ambition is a madness that excites my awe the tree was our home but you say it will destroy us and i believe you thaxir why the sap that runs through the veins of the tree holds dissolved oxygen we sink pipes always we have our air that way and water and sugar too galls grow around the ends of the pipes and close them so that more must be drilled but now the tree learns to close the pipes much faster faster every year can you tell us how to work the cannon no chufchufchuf can you tell us which softfingers are the cannoneers no i can tell you some that are not chufchufchuf svetz one you have chosen is gravid it makes them clumsy the cannoneers were not gravid svetz had netted nine softfingers in an arc around his control desk it was heavy exercise the inertial calendar read ae with no real accuracy but the xcage was halfway thence and nothing had burned out he lowered the gravid softfinger back to the net moved her in chose another too old no not the injured one either chose another sprayed the net closed his captive wrestled with him sluggishly as he moved it into place this mode of time travel was much faster than fast forward but fast forward would have given them a view now ten softfingers and thaxir wriggled restlessly against a chaotic rainbow when would thaxir ask to be freed miya asked her can you talk to softfingers yes miya i remember how long it took for your device to learn my speech best if you let me translate they have their own speech yes but softfingers will never agree to destroy the tree this sounded suspiciously like the end of all their hopes svetz climbed back up to where miya and thaxir hung he asked what if we make them slaves none are made slave except by agreement any may die if he will not be slave any may be silent if he will not speak to a captor any may refuse to act some are slaved by degrees do this refrain from that reveal knowledge give up a weapon justify details of living style to a lords servant bit by bit until free has become slave it may take centuries or generations i have seen it again and again old thaxir said are you sure none of you are slave svetz didnt answer nor did miya i chose to be your slave these will not they will not tell you how to harm the tree well have to guess svetz said svetz will you trust me miya if you have something in mind see if you can describe it chuf chuf chuf i intend a dance of words too chancy too variable too strange to reach through a speaking device into alien minds if i can make this work i will make legends but you must trust me well trust you miya said what do you need from us thaxir said leave your pressure suit helms thrown back move more softfingers do not notice me leathery bugeyed octopuses redskinned humans insectoid giants froggy elves nearheadless humanoids and ogre crabs were all stirring in the net thaxir began talking to the nearest softfingers miya and svetz moved down the tethers to the wriggling mass of martians most were conscious and they wanted to talk the un translator knew red martian and green giant and was learning other speech too and it tried to translate it all in a babble of white noise svetz turned his volume down leave it this way he said to miya we could get away from this we can hear everything that goes on i dont know if thaxir ever noticed that but i dont think we want the octopoids to if they know we can listen thaxir may have trouble you trust her why miya shrugged we dont have to really lets see what happens maybe thaxir can get some instructions we still have to guess if theyre right or else guess how to work these funny controls either way do you feel lucky she pointed that one they extracted a softfingers they moved that one and another and netted them there was food and water in the storage bin not much they ate ravenously and talked of the past before theyd met and watched the martians their translators were speaking again svetz could barely hear he chose not to raise the volume the incomplete translation stuttered from earth destroyed the sky watch station on highest mountain horror we are captive to these think guilt plan revenge they have not thought to close their pressure envelopes allies and infants would be left open to the empty must they die guile these were shaped by earths thick air shaped by mars we can live longer in the empty but wait a word makes them safe thaxir lowered her voice further and spoke a single emphatic syllable the translator gave it as close your outer skin or burst like a sandgrape witless child miya said she told us to leave our suits open does she expect to open the door to vacuum not without warning i guess but you cant lock the control board right hanny what for when i only moved animals svetz had sometimes wondered owl had claws to pull and turn knobs and a beak to punch keys the light changed gravity changed martians wailed and peeped and gibbered as their net sagged toward the floor just as matters were becoming interesting they were back among the conquistadors twenty minutes to ragnarok chapter three hundred meters northeast of the anchor grove a portuguese army was converging on nothing becoming braver as it became clear that there was no enemy the shallow sea showed not a trace of the minim spacecraft that must have disappeared fifteen minutes ago soldiers had finished reloading a cannon and under the direction of a frantic officer began inching its aim toward what must have been a puzzling target a tight cloud of hundreds of human and alien shapes floating high above them rising out of sight before anyone could quite be sure it was there svetz said futz what svetzs thumb was on the direction vector pushing hard enough to break it up up up we should have had willy go up the tree in the small xcage we could have met it there hes got twenty hours to play with we only have twenty minutes futz the large xcage ghosted through a layer of cottonball clouds and kept rising svetz zoomed his mag specs and found a silver stalk rising straight up from the black head of the clustered anchor trees hed follow it up the manshape on the stalk was jack a great yellowgreen insectile shape was climbing up below him svetz was looking almost straight down along the root to the black tuft he kept raising the magnification on his mag specs he was tempted to delay to see the end of it but he dared not the xcage was rising fast but it wasnt a rocket it wasnt accelerating the climb up the hangtree was likely to eat most of their allotted time tiny jack fled from a yellowgreen ogre with tusks and too many limbs he climbed with hysterical strength in the only possible direction up and he had lost the monster reached from below and plucked him up in two forward limbs jacks knife slashed twice across the green giants chest plates thaxir ignored it with exquisite care she turned him around then transferred jack to her middle limbs never losing her grip on the root nor on jack in that position he couldnt reach the monster he slashed at her pack something fell and then young thaxir set him against the stalk below her jack wrapped himself lovingly around the hangtree root some glittering thing from thaxirs pack was falling and jacks knife fell too at maximum zoom svetz still couldnt see anymore he called to thaxir what was that old thaxir said my windstormminor curse that thief an heirloom i will never see again thaxir you must have been killing yourself climbing in earth gravity what did you think youd find i expected that my folk would send the lift down as far as it could go there svetz the hangtree was swollen to tree trunk size suddenly there was a silver rail and a barred box at the bottom sixty klicks above the earth quite a climb a record never to be matched i was years recovering my strength what if it hadnt been there it was altitude klicks the large xcage was already above geosynchronous orbit svetz was staying alongside the tree so the xcage moving at orbital speed was back in free fall svetz saw activity of some kind on the trunk as it sped past but nothing flashed at them nothing impacted they were rising fast and jack was going home with a golden harp an alien shape of gold set with jewels that made an alien song what would they make of that in ancient portugal golden harp and golden eggs and a bag of golden coins doubtless the king of portugal would take it all kings did that svetz thought unless jack sailed into some foreign port england maybe and sold the loot there would he tell his tale how could he not his companions would know it by heart before they reached port they might have trouble describing johns absolute terror of a yellowgreen fourarmed monster with tusks who stands ten feet tall and swings a sword no man can pick up as the legend spreads it might describe only a simple giant or ogre better phone home svetz activated the talker boss we are thence he heard a soft murmur that might have had words in it creepy the voice of a quantized uncertain future he switched off thaxir spoke softfinger sounds the translator said see they bust me then she called in green giant speech apparently addressing another green giant miya go and look at the cannon that individuals eyes swiveled then came back puzzled svetz said you go miya id better stay at the controls miya held svetzs eyes but asked thaxir what shall i look for look like you do not expect help from any martian the hangtree had grown broad as a freeway even in the stretched and slender form that had crossed interplanetary space to earth svetz tried to keep the xcage near it without crashing into it altitude klicks a trace of gravity had returned with a vast earth overhead the control chair was inverted miya wedged her head and shoulders into the cannons cockpit it was too small for anything human svetz was tempted to laugh she looked very awkward she pulled and pushed and touched and if she set something off theyd all be dead softfingers and other martians were paying her considerable attention two or three smiths were either shouting instructions or cursing the phone rang that wasnt the intertemporal talker it was the remote in the small extension cage svetz punched in and said willy futz of a ride yes hello svetz are we still on track no showstoppers yet where are you and why arent you on your way home svetz ive getting great pictures i suppose im pacing you but youre too small i havent even glimpsed you if you can bring this off i want a record i want to watchl if you cant well there wont be anything to go back to they talked further svetz was glad of the company at klicks the tree had narrowed as much as it was going to its diameter no more than a city block thirty thousand klicks farther out he could see how the tree swelled into a knob it looked like if he could cut into that would he find an encysted asteroid swallowed for ballast no telling ever he brought the rising xcage to a stop now he had only about four minutes to play with thaxir he asked do you know how to work the cannon thaxir said yes do you know better than to fire it against a closed door svetz didnt move tes what now wait are you armed with your sleepthing he didnt reach or look yes both of us miya are you tracking this ready hanny thaxir shouted a single syllable it galvanized the martians they began screwing down helmets and zipping zippers and stickstrips on themselves their elders and children the translator was saying close your outer skin or burst svetz pulled his own helmet closed and saw miya do the same he tapped the icon that would suck away the air in the shell a beam of white heat missed his forearm and plunged deep into the controls svetz threw himself backward a fireball blasted back out of the hole and somehow missed fusing his helmet as it puffed across the diameter of the xcage svetz fired in the direction the beam had come from miya was firing too their sonics swept the softfinger gunman and several others elsewhere another softfinger loosed itself at thaxir with a leap that spun it like a buzz saw its spin caressed the netbound thaxir and svetz held his aim and waiteddared not put thaxir to sleepwaited and fired the pinwheel octopoid spun away slack and senseless a knife spun free thaxir lifted herself free of the slashed net if you can still open the door she said do it she closed her helmet the gunmans aim had been precise the heat beam had put a hole in the left branch of the horseshoe control board that array controlled air composition and pressure lights recorded warnings and of course the door thaxir joined miya at the trigger housing the translator picked up her speech i persuaded some among the softfingers that if they cut me loose i could fire the cannon while the door was closed we would die the earth would die the tree would survive to carry the rest of our races to the stars if we could change the future and survive the tree itself in any case they would have their vengeance in the quantumrandomized future ra chen was dead or never born but his urgency lived on in svetzs mind they revealed to me what weapons they still have thaxir said a knife to free me a heat gun to ruin your door lock both swallowed in sealed bags swallowed to be disgorged at need miya i alerted you and trusted your reactions the rest was up to you there was vacuum inside and out martians of every description were shouting at each other in silence the large xcage had sucked the air back into its tanks good enough svetz touched the remote willy nothing he remembered to plug the jack into his suit mike willy hows it going willy you need to use the remote controls to open the door in the large extension cage do it now right now hanny nobody showed me how dont panic ive used these myself now right in front of you you should see he talked willy through it we are the masters of time the door opened like a flower more softfmgers had cut themselves free svetz shot them with sonics as they moved a thread of light burst from the cannons mouth it was searingbright until it impacted the tree four or five klicks away then the intensity became intolerable miya and thaxir seemed to have the cannon under control a halo of gas and particles surrounded the tree now illuminating the plasma beam the tree tore apart the severed end was rising sap sprayed into space boiling and freezing into a vast white plume nothing much seemed to be happening to the main body of the tree turn it off svetz said into his suit mike hanny we dont have instructions for that thaxir says that wasnt supposed to be needed well if you dont turn it off we cant close the door and then we cant go home and the energy buildup will blow the institute off the map and us too but we did it we won there will be a future the beam went off got it miya said willy are you still on close the door for us willy stop filming and close the door on the large xcage willy the door closed willy gorky said patience is an underrated but svetz pushed the gohome and the voice went away chapter phaethon n class myth a son of helios who borrowed the chariot of the sun for one day and drove it so dangerously close to earth that zeus struck him down with a thunderbolt to save the world from catching fire random house dictionary of the english language the main dome was crowded to the teeth every face showed triumph until they looked into the large xcage ra chen barely flinched but svetz caught it a few techs looked bewildered a few were frightened some gaped then laughed of sixty or seventy present half were wearing united nations security uniforms and they showed no emotion at all body language told svetz what man was the secretarygeneral he and his guards were off to one side and ra chen with him the secretarygeneral was no bigger than svetz the crown of his head was bald otherwise he bore thick brown hair eyebrows and beard at sight of a crowd of martians he started forward wild with delight security blocked him any attack on the secgen would take ra chen too an attack from the large xcage would fall upon guards and techs first the large extension cage had last come here as an act of war but un security didnt know that they were only being prudent and of course everyone was waiting for svetz to open the door the noise the martians were making died a little they were fainting in earths gravity svetz and miya set about cutting the nets the small extension cage faded into view svetz saw rage flash in ra chens expression but he covered by moving briskly to help willy gorky out willy delayed for a moment at the controls the door unfolded like a great flower thank you willy a door big enough to pass whale allowed a dozen techs to swarm in they came out carrying martians ra chen must have assembled every lifter platform in the un research complex as quickly as they could they got the martians into low gravity stripping them of weapons where they could no doubt the softfingers kept a few swallowed svetz and miya helped trying to keep species separate setting infants in bubbles among their own folk the techs didnt seem to think that was important but it might be worth thaxirs life the secretarygeneral was bubbling with questions the guards wouldnt let him near the martians yet so he made do with the heads willy gorky was just a bit diffident with the secgen and ra chen ra chen was cordial and brisk and gave way to both my time line and its really waldemar the eleventh svetz decided but the world trees willy gorky a dominance dance between the two heads should be fun to watch given that they each thought theyd lost to the other now willy was pulling heavy golden spheres from a pouch and handing them ceremoniously to the secretarygeneral un guards intercepted the seeds the last of the martians a sixgeneration family of reds was being floated away ra chen eased free of the others excellent work svetz those seeds will look really good in the palace maybe we can grow a few trees ra chens grip closed like iron on svetzs forearm we need to talk set guards for thaxir boss svetz murmured smiling he was being pulled outside through the front guard the martians theyll kill our source if we just turn them loose in a vivarium cage thaxirs one of the older green first things first svetz how did you and willy gorky change places and why what the wonderful elaborate drinks dispenser was back ra chen pulled him past it and outside we sent you back in the small xcage we needed to know if any of the martians were setting us up for something willy gorky just had to go back and rescue sixty martians himself his first trip through time and nobody had the least idea what these creatures really have in mind if anything happens to the head of sky domains were finished ra chen said and now youre back but the head of sky domains is in the small xcage and youre in the big one svetz is this another one of those the reflecting pool was back too svetz said changes in the past other time lines those yes boss but lets just deal with the martian refugees first then ive got a great story and willys got visual aids to back us up the severed treetop rose like a comet spraying a tremendous frosty comettail lit by raw sunlight long after the treetop itself was out of view the trail of frost continued to expand gorky had most of the tree in view in a wraparound shot that filled the display wall svetz could see it all at first the tree seemed unchanged but its center of mass was below geosynchronous orbit left to itself it would have moved in a closer faster orbit but it couldnt it was anchored the mass pulled ahead of the rotating earth and the earth pulled back slowing it lowering its orbit farther the bottom of the tree the root was still anchored to the earth more than an hour after miya and thaxir had severed the top hie tree tilted forward arcing toward horizontal then deep in the bedrock of brazil roots ripped free the tree pulled away carrying away a disintegrating black clot of anchor grove now tidal forces began to swing it back to vertical the lower end dropped until the hangtrees torn bottom was ripping through the atmosphere blazing like the sun the bottom of the tree was a meteor trailing flame and smoke all around the earth prairies and forests blazed in its wake a noose of fire circling the planet above the atmosphere yggdrasils mass pulled it along the tree was burning at the bottom as it sank toward the earth the legend of phaeton miya breathed no that happened way earlier said svetz why hanny dont you believe in time travel futz no wonder the medieval world was afraid of comets if such a mass had fallen all at once at or near orbital speed well legends would have told that tale too gorky ra chen and the secretarygeneral engaged in intense discussion within a horseshoe of guards they summoned miya talk continued a un guard went for refreshments not to the itr dispenwr but to the limousines they summoned zeera svetz bought and ate a carton of dole yeast then another they summoned svetz he told the tale as if they hadnt heard it twice already prompted he spoke of martians left behind the furred high ones the big birds who wore tool belts the secretarygeneral didnt leave until midnight then svetz dared to eat what had been sitting untouched he and miya snatched food they didnt bother to identify in a scrambling of hands they fed each other bits of anything interesting laughing at each others greed and belatedly thought to bring zeera into the circle but zeera shied away ra chen was talking genially to gorky you had your beanstalk you had the solar system wasnt as useful as you thought was it head ra chen i still have it hillarydrown me theyve all gone home i dont blame them willy raised his voice who knows how to work the holo projector i want just that first bit back i can do that miya said light blazed fiercely from the world tree fog haloed the heat ray and then the top of the world tree ripped free thirty thousand klicks of severed end rose at escape velocity sap sprayed at the stars and again miya had looped the record this is what i meant willy gorky said excitedly and pointed with his laser a red dot traced the flow of fluid and steam i need to show this to the martians all the martians tomorrow willy ra chen said gently willy sagged this was the world trees willy gorky half starved in a starving world the willy gorky whose bureau of the sky domains had been eaten by the institute for temporal research in this spacetime he was master but he was tired go home he said find beds tomorrow if only i had a time machine they set the holo projector up in the vivarium outside the cage that held five martian civilizations in miniature martians watched them and discussed what they were seeing there were sound pickups in the mars cage as in all the cagesthe sounds an animal made might be of interestbut no speakers techs linked speakers to un translators programmed with what svetzs translator had learned of mars wilt miller mounted them inside the mars cage five varieties of martian watched them do it as soon as they were out the froglike martiansthe smiths swarmed over the devices and took them apart before gorky could begin speaking willy gorky waited with amazing patience they waited with willy until seera lost patience and went four cages down to tend horse the rest stayed horse seemed glad of the attention in present time one need not credit a childrens story but svetz knew that they had lost the zeera of the baths the zeera who turned a conquistador into gold that zeera who had stayed with that ra chen in another time line so that they could destroy it that zeera would not be petting horse when the smiths had reassembled the translators willy gorky told them i can restore your planet no martian spoke svetzs eye found thaxir among the green giants he was relieved she sat dignified and straight among her kin willy said what i need from you is transportation i know you didnt bring any kind of spacecraft but you know things i want to know how your wok ships work i need to know how to make a gas lighter than nothing anything that helps me reach the planets is worth having think about it tonight i will show you how daylight would have washed out willy gorkys hologram recordings they had to wait for night zeera still had seeds heavy golden spheres hardened against reentry it took jewelers equipment to open them inside they were built like pomes the laboratorys first attempt at a dna scan failed it must be some other genetic molecule that reproduced a beanstalk anchor tree theyd find it willy worked with the bureau of the sky domains astronomers they knew what to look for now the worlds telescopes were turned on europa data began flowing back the vivarium nightfall the severed ends of the world tree came apart trailing oceans of water in a wide frosty comet tail the blood of the tree sprayed across the sky willy gorky spoke for the translators in the martians housing it goes on and on gigatons of sap mostly water infused with oxygen and some interesting nutrientsi zapped it with a laser to get a spectroanalysis an elderly smith had come forward our worlds water he said other species stayed to share the fate of our dying world the tree was our destiny willy didnt miss a beat our fate too but we sidestepped your worlds water yes now ill show you how to get it back and he showed them a sapling left at mars fifteen hundred years ago had sucked away that worlds remaining life what it sensed of its parents fate was unknowable how do trees communicate but on this time line the hangtree had been chopped down and killed at earth when its sapling child had as much water as mars had to give it had moved still feeble outward the sapling was at europa given that the ancient mariner probe had found no hangtree at mars it must have been at europa for at least a thousand years in the holo view it was a mere silver thread as thin as imagination but it was long its center of mass stood well out from europa in the stable l point made by europa and jupiter did you learn anything about guiding the hangtree willy looked hopefully up at the rows of alien faces europa is a water ocean under a shell of ice that thing is sucking it up all we need to do is guide it back to mars then chop away the root and bleed its veins dry let the sap drain into the old canals and ocean beds oceans of water sugar and nutrients for fertilizer youll have a world again willys voice rang but we cant get there from here earths gravity is greater our space program is a pitiable thing our rockets can barely lift themselves but with those and your antigravity dirigibles or your wok ships to lift them free of earths gravity we can get there we can get anywhere well make mars live again will you help me he had them without being able to read alien faces svetz still knew he had them its not what i really wanted willy corky admitted later its a thousand years too late i wanted to take the planets while the earth was still rich ka chen had formed his attitude long ago thou shall not change the past not by accident not deliberately disaster and chaos will result he said willy youd have roughly ten productive years if you marooned yourself in the twentieth century no conspicuous technology means no modern medicine and no un translators we could train you in their language but youll still have an accent nobody can define like werner von braun willy said whatever and now you think you can talk an insular and defensive agency of an ancient government into doing your will and still compete with any other branch that might want their funding willy gorky didnt answer willy its just a fantasy i know that ra chen well still have the stars the past is dead ill build from here from now the reference director speaks the humanoids and green giants and their cultures guns and swords and negativegravity dirigibles all derive from edgar rice burroughs except for the houses and stoves which belong to ray bradbury and those slender towers that probably belong to robert heinlein more than anyone the crabs and the headless nearhumanoid servants that carry them are also from burroughs schiapareli and lowell and a host of other astronomers of the early twentieth century saw and described the canals the flightless bird is from stanley weinbaums a martian odyssey so is the pyramid builder of the c s lewis martians fishers and high folk and smiths only the smiths left mars for the tree they liked the challenge yellowfaced hairless pointed shabbylooking built like a frog lewis eldils are missing and so are heinleins martians and many others because they were more powerful than the author the sailcar came from flash gordon sunday comics the hangtree or beanstalk in its earliest form was the creation of a schoolteacher who served the czar a host of fine minds have elaborated the original concept of an orbital tether the tentacled astronomers derive from h g wells the war of the worlds one appeared as an astronomer in old faithful by gallun their lensshaped craft were a familiar sight over the midwest in the s the tanker modulewhich carries a nuclear reactor and six tonnes of liquid hydrogen to make ninetysix tonnes of methane and liquid oxygen from the martian atmosphere was evolved from plans outlined in mars direct by robert zubrin ole romer danish astronomer was brought to france by christiaen huygens he invented the transit

approximately hanville svetz stepped out of the extension caw and looked about him to svetz the atomic bomb was eleven hundred years old and the horse was a thousand years dead it was his first trip into tin past his training didnt count it had not included actual time travel which cost several million commercials a shot svetz was groggy from the peculiar gravitational side effects of time travel he was high on preindustrial age air and drunk on his own sense of destiny while at the same time he was not really convinced that he had gone anywhere or anywhen trade joke he was not carrying the anaesthetic rifle he had come to get a horse he had not expected to meet one at the door how big was a horse where were horses found consider what the institute had had to go on a few pictures in a salvaged childrens book and an old legend not to be trusted that the horse had once been used as a kind of animated vehicle in an empty land beneath an overcast sky svetz braced himself with one hand on the curved flank of the extension cage his head was spinning it took him several seconds to realize that he was looking at a horse it stood fifteen yards away regarding svetz with large intelligent brown eyes it was much larger than he had expected further the horse in the picture book had had a glossy brown pelt with a short mane while the beast now facing svetz was pure white with a mane that flowed like a womans long hair there were other differences but no matter the beast matched the book too well to be anything but a horse to svetz it seemed that the horse watched him waited for him to realize what was happening then while svetz wasted more time wondering why he wasnt holding a rifle the horse laughed turned and departed it disappeared with astonishing speed svetz began to shiver nobody had warned him that the horse might have been sentient yet the beasts mocking laugh had sounded far too human now he knew he was deep deep in the past not even the horse was as convincing as the emptiness the horse had left behind no reaching apartment towers clawed the horizon no contrails scratched the sky the world was trees and flowers and rolling grassland innocent of men the silenceit was as if svetz had gone deaf he had heard no sound since the laughter of the horse in the year postatomic such silence could have been found nowhere on earth listening svetz knew at last that he had reached the british isles before the coming of civilization he had traveled in time the extension cage was the part of the time machine that did the traveling it had its own air supply and needed it while being pushed through time but not here not before civilizations dawn not when the air had never been polluted by fission wastes and the combustion of coal hydrocarbons tobaccos wood et al now retreating in panic from that world of the past to the world of the extension cage svetz nonetheless left the door open behind him he felt better inside the cage outside was an unexplored planet made dangerous by ignorance inside the cage it was no different from a training mission svetz had spent hundreds of hours in a detailed mockup of this cage with a computer running the dials there had even been artificial gravity to simulate the peculiar side effects of motion in time by now the horse would have escaped but he now knew its size and he knew there were horses in the area to business then svetz took the anaesthetic rifle from where it was clamped to the wall he loaded it with what he guessed was the right size of soluble crystalline anaesthetic needle the box held several different sizes the smallest of which would knock a shrew harmlessly unconscious the largest of which would do the same for an elephant he slung the rifle and stood up the world turned gray svetz caught a wall clamp to stop himself from falling the cage had stopped moving twenty minutes ago he shouldnt still be dizzybut it had been a long trip never before had the institute for temporal research pushed a cage beyond zero pa a long trip and a strange one with gravity pulling svetzi mass uniformly toward svetzs navel when his head cleared he turned to where other equipment was clamped to a wall the flight stick was a lift field generator and power source built into five feet of pole with a control ring at one end a brush discharge at the other and a bucket seat and seat belt in the middle compact even for svetzs age the flight stick was a spinoff from the spaceflight industries but it still weighed thirty pounds with the motor off getting it out of the clamps took all his strength svetz felt queasy very queasy he bent to pick up the flight stick and abruptly realized that he was about to faint he hit the door button and fainted we dont know where on earth youll wind up ra chen had told him ra chen was the director of the institute for temporal research a large round man with gross exaggerated features and a permanent air of disapproval thats because we cant focus on a particular time of dayor on a particular year for that matter you wont appear underground or inside anything because of energy considerations if you come out a thousand feet in the air the cage wont fall itll settle slowly using up energy with a profligate disregard for our budget and svetz had dreamed that night vividly over and over his extension cage appeared inside solid rock exploded with a roar and a blinding flash officially the horse is for the bureau of history ra chen had said in practice its for the secretarygeneral for his twentyeight birthday mentally hes about six years old you know the royal familys getting a bit inbred these days we managed to send him a picture book we picked up in pa and now the lad wants a horse svetz had seen himself being shot for treason for the crime of listening to such talk otherwise wed never have gotten the appropriation for this trip its in a good cause well do some cloning from the horse before we send the original to the un thenwell genes are a code and codes can be broken get us a male and well make all the horses anyone could want but why would anyone want even one horse svetz had studied a computer duplicate of the childs picture book that an agent had pulled from a ruined house a thousand years ago the horse did not impress him ra chen however terrified him weve never sent anyone this far back ra chen had told him the night before the mission when it was too late to back out with honor keep that in mind if something goes wrong dont count on the rule book dont count on your instruments use your head your head svetz gods know its little enough to depend on svetz had not slept in the hours before departure youre scared stiff ka chen had commented just before svetz entered the extension cage and you can hide it svetz i think im the only one whos noticed thats why i picked you because you can be terrified and go ahead anyway dont come back without a horse the directors voice grew louder not without a horse svetz your head svetz your head svetz sat up convulsively the air slow death if he didnt close the door but the door was closed and svetz was sitting on the floor holding his head which hurt the air system had been transplanted intact complete with dials from a martian sandboat the dials read normally of course since the cage was sealed svetz nerved himself to open the door as the sweet rich air of twelfthcentury britain rushed in svetz held his breath and watched the dials change presently he closed the door and waited sweating while the air system replaced the heady poison with its own safe breathable mixture when next he left the extension cage carrying the flight stick svetz was wearing another spinoff from the interstellar exploration industries it was a balloon and he wore it over his head it was also a selectively permeable membrane intended to pass certain gasses in and others out to make a breathingair mixture inside it was nearly invisible except at the rim there where light was refracted most severely the balloon showed as a narrow golden circle enclosing svetzs head the effect was not unlike a halo as shown in medieval paintings but svetz didnt know about medieval paintings he wore also a simple white robe undecorated constricted at the waist otherwise falling in loose folds the institute thought that such a garment was least likely to violate taboos of sex or custom the trade kit dangled loose from his sash a heatandpressure gadget a pouch of corundum small phials of additives for color lastly he wore a hurt and baffled look how was it that he could not breathe the clean air of his own past the air of the cage was the air of svetzs time and was nearly four percent carbon dioxide the air of anteatomic held barely a tenth of that man was a rare animal here and now he had breathed little air he had destroyed few green forests he had burnt scant fuel since the dawn of time but industrial civilization meant combustion combustion meant carbon dioxide thickening in the atmosphere many times faster than the green plants could turn it back to oxygen svetz was at the far end of two thousand years of adaptation to air rich in c it takes a concentration of carbon dioxide to trigger the autonomic nerves in the lymph glands in a mans left armpit svetz had fainted because he wasnt breathing so now he wore a balloon and felt rejected he straddled the flight stick and twisted the control knob on the fore end the stick lifted under him and he wriggled into place on the bucket seat he twisted the knob further he drifted upward like a toy balloon he floated over a lovely land green and untenanted beneath a pearlgray sky empty of contrails presently he found a crumbling wall he turned to follow it he would follow the wall until he found a settlement if the old legend was trueand svetz reflected the horse had certainly been big enough to drag a vehiclethen he would find horses wherever he found men presently it became obvious that a road ran along the wall there the dirt was flat and bare and consistently wide enough for a walking man whereas elsewhere the land rose and dipped and tilted hard dirt did not a freeway make but svetz got the point he followed the road floating at a height of ten meters there was a man in worn brown garments hooded and barefoot he walked the road with patient exhaustion propping himself with a staff his back was to svetz svetz thought to dip toward him to ask concerning horses he refrained with no way to know where the cage would alight he had learned no ancient languages at all he thought of the trade kit he carried intended not for communication but instead of communication it had never been fieldtested in any case it was not for casual encounters the pouch of corundum was too small svetz heard a yell from below he looked down in time to see the man in brown running like the wind his staff forgotten his fatigue likewise something scared him svetz decided but he could see nothing fearful something small but deadly then the institute estimated that man had exterminated more than a thousand species of mammal and bird and insectsome casually some with malicebetween now and the distant present in this time and place there was no telling what might be a threat svetz shuddered the brown man with the hairy face might well have run from a stinging thing destined to kill hanville svetz impatiently svetz upped the speed of his flight stick the mission was taking far too long who would have guessed that centers of population would have been so far apart half an hour later shielded from the wind by a paraboloid force field svetz was streaking down the road at sixty miles per hour his luck had been incredibly bad wherever he had chanced across a human being that person had been just leaving the vicinity and he had found no centers of population once he had noticed an unnatural stone outcropping high on a hill no law of geology known to svetz could have produced such an angular flatsided monstrosity curious he had circled above itand had abruptly realized that the thing was hollow riddled with rectangular holes a dwelling for men he didnt want to believe it living within the hollows of such a thing would be like living underground but men tend to build at right angles and this thing was all right angles below the hollowed stone structure were rounded hairylooking hummocks of dried grass each with a mansized door obviously they must be nests for very large insects svetz had left that place quickly the road rounded a swelling green hill ahead of him svete followed slowing a hilltop spring sent a stream bubbling downhill to break the road something large was drinking at the stream svetz jerked to a stop in midair open water deadly poison he would have been hard put to say which had startled him more the horse or the fact that it had just committed suicide the horse looked up and saw him it was the same horse white as milk with a flowing abundance of snowy mane and tail it almost had to be the horse that had laughed at svetz and run svetz recognized the malignance in its eyes in the moment before it turned its back but how could it have arrived so fast svetz was reaching for the gun when the situation turned upside down the girl was young surely no more than sixteen her hair was long and dark and plaited in complex fashion her dress of strangely stiff blue fabric reached from her neck to her ankles she was seated in the shadow of a tree on dark cloth spread over the dark earth svetz had not noticed her might never have noticed her but the horse walked up to her folded its legs in alternate pairs and laid its ferocious head in her lap the girl had not yet seen svetz the horse obviously belonged to the girl he could not simply shoot it and take it it would have to be purchased somehow he needed time to think and there was no time for the girl might look up at any moment baleful brown eyes watched him as he dithered he dared waste no more time searching the countryside for a wild horse there was an uncertainty a finagle factor in the math of time travel it manifested itself as an uncertainty in the energy of a returning extension cage and it increased with time let svetz linger too long and he could be roasted alive in the returning cage moreover the horse had drunk open water it would die and soon unless svetz could return it to postatomic thus the beasts removal from this time could not change the history of svetzs own world it was a good choice if he could conquer his fear of the beast the horse was tame young and slight as she was the girl had no trouble controlling it what was there to fear but there was its natural weaponry of which ra chens treacherous picture book had shown no sign svetz surmised that later generations routinely removed it before the animals were old enough to be dangerous he should have come a few centuries later and there was the look in its eye the horse hated svetz and it knew svetz was afraid could he shoot it from ambush no the girl would worry if her pet collapsed without reason she would be unable to concentrate on what svetz was trying to tell her he would have to work with the animal watching him if the girl couldnt control itor if he lost her trustsvetz had little doubt that the horse would kill him the horse looked up as svetz approached but made no other move the girl watched too her eyes round with wonder she called something that must have been a question svetz smiled back and continued his approach he was a foot above the ground and gliding at dead slow riding the worlds only flying machine he looked impressive as all hell and knew it the girl did not smile back she watched warily svetz was within yards of her when she scrambled to her feet he stopped the flight stick at once and let it settle smiling placatorially he removed the heatandpressure device from his sash he moved with care the girl was on the verge of running the trade kit was a pouch of corundum a several phials of additives and the heatandpressure gadget svetz poured corundum into the chamber added a dash of chromic oxide and used the plunger the cylinder grew warm presently svetz dropped a pigeonsblood star ruby into his finders held it to the sun it was red as dark blood with a blazing white sixpointed star it was almost too hot to hold stupid svetz held his smile rigid ra chen should have warned him what would she think when she felt the gems unnatural heat what trickery would she suspect but he had to chance it the trade kit was all he had he bent and rolled the gem to her across the damp ground she stooped to pick it up one hand remained on the horses neck calming it svetz noticed the rings of yellow metal around her wrist and he also noticed the dirt she held the gem high looked into its deep red fire ooooh she breathed she smiled at svetz in wonder and delight svetz smiled back moved two steps nearer and rolled her a yellow sapphire how had he twice chanced on the same horse svetz never knew but he soon knew how it had arrived before him he had given the girl three gems he held three more in his hand while he beckoned her onto the flight stick she shook her head she would not go instead she mounted the animal she and the horse they watched svetz for his next move svetz capitulated he had expected the horse to follow the girl while the girl rode behind him on the flight stick but if they both followed svetz it would be the same the horse stayed to one side and a little behind svetzs flight stick it did not seem inconvenienced by the girls weight why should it be it must have been bred for the task svetz notched his speed higher to find how fast he could conveniently move faster he flew and faster the horse must have a limit he was up to eighty before he quit the girl lay flat along the animals back hugging its neck to protect her face from the wind but the horse ran on daring svetz with its eyes how to describe such motion svetz had never seen ballet he knew how machinery moved and this wasnt it all he could think of was a man and a woman making love slipperysmooth rhythmic motion absolute singleminded purpose motion for the pleasure of motion it was terrible in its beauty the flight of the horse the word for such running must have died with the horse itself the horse would never have tired but the girl did she tugged on the animals mane and it stopped svetz gave her the jewels he held made four more and gave her one she was crying from the wind crying and smiling as she took the jewels was she smiling for the jewels or for the joy of the ride exhausted panting she lay with her back against the warm pulsing flank of the resting animal only her hand moved as she ran her fingers repeatedly through its silver mane the horse watched svetz with malevolent brown eyes the girl was homely it wasnt just the jarring lack of makeup there was evidence of vitamin starvation she was short less than five feet in height and thin there were marks of childhood disease but happiness glowed behind her homely face and it made her almost passable as she clutched the corundum stones when she seemed rested svetz remounted they went on he was almost out of corundum when they reached the extension cage there it was that he ran into trouble the girl had been awed by svetzs jewels and by svetz himself possibly because of his height or his ability to fly but the extension cage scared her svetz couldnt blame her the side with the door in it was no trouble just a seamless spherical mirror but the other side blurred away in a direction men could not visualize it had scared svetz spitless the first time he saw the time machine in action he could buy the horse from her shoot it here and pull it inside using the flight stick to float it but it would be so much easier if it was worth a try svetz used the rest of his corundum then he walked into the extension cage leaving a trail of colored corundum beads behind him he had worried because the heatandpressure device would not produce facets the stones all came out shaped like miniature henseggs but he was able to vary the color using chromic oxide for red and ferric oxide for yellow and titanium for blue and he could vary the pressure planes to produce catseyes or star gems at will he left a trail of small stones red and yellow and blue and the girl followed frightened but unable to resist the bait by now she had nearly filled a handkerchief with the stones the horse followed her into the extension cage inside she looked at the four stones in svetzs hand one of each color red and yellow and light blue and black the largest he could make he pointed to the horse then to the stones the girl agonized svetz perspired she didnt want to give up the horse and svetz was out of corundum she nodded one swift jerk of her chin quickly before she could change her mind svetz poured the stones into her hand she clutched the hoard to her bosom and ran out of the cage sobbing the horse stood up to follow svetz swung the rifle and shot it a bead of blood appeared on the animals neck it shied back then sighted on svetz along its natural bayonet poor kid svetz thought as he turned to the door but shed have lost the horse anyway it had sucked polluted water from an open stream now he need only load the flight stick aboard motion caught the corner of his eye a false assumption can be deadly svetz had not waited for the horse to fall it was with something of a shock that he realized the truth the beast wasnt about to fall it was about to spear him like a cocktail shrimp he hit the door button and dodged exquisitely graceful exquisitely sharp the spiral horn slammed into the closing door the animal turned like white lightning in the confines of the cage and again svetz leapt for his life the point missed him by half an inch it plunged past him and into the control board through the plastic panel and into the wiring beneath something sparkled and something sputtered the horse was taking careful aim sighting along the spear in its forehead svetz did the only thing he could think of he pulled the homeagain lever the horse screamed as it went into free fall the horn intended for svetzs navel ripped past his ear and tore his breathingballoon wide open then gravity returned but it was the peculiar gravity of an extension cage moving forward through time svetz and the horse were pulled against the padded walls svetz sighed in relief he sniffed again in disbelief the smell was strong and strange like nothing svetz had ever smelled before the animals terrible horn must have damaged the air plant very likely he was breathing poison if the cage didnt return in time but would it return at all it might be going anywhere anywhen the way that ivory horn had smashed through anonymous wiring they might come out at the end of time when even the black infrasuns gave not enough heat to sustain life there might not even be a future to return to he had left the flight stick how would it be used what would they make of it with its control handle at one end and the brushstyle static discharge at the other and the saddle in the middle perhaps the girl would try to use it he could visualize her against the night sky in the light of a full moon and how would that change history the horse seemed on the verge of apoplexy its sides heaved its eyes rolled wildly probably it was the cabin air thick with carbon dioxide again it might be the poison the horse had sucked from an open stream gravity died svetz and the horse tumbled in free fall and the horse queasily tried to gore him gravity returned and svetz who was ready for it landed on top someone was already opening the door svetz took the distance in one bound the horse followed screaming with rage intent on murder two men went flying as it charged out into the institute control center it doesnt take anaesthetics svetz shouted over his shoulder the animals agility was hampered here among the desks and lighted screens and it was probably drunk on hyperventilation it kept stumbling into desks and men svetz easily stayed ahead of the slashing horn a full panic was developing we couldnt have done it without zeera ra chen told him much later your idiot tanj horse had the whole center terrorized all of a sudden it went completely tame walked up to zeera and let her lead it away did you get it to the hospital in time ra chen nodded gloomily gloom was his favorite expression and was no indication of his true feelings we found over fifty unknown varieties of bacteria in the beasts bloodstream yet it hardly looked sick it looked healthy as a healthy as a it must have tremendous stamina we managed to save not only the horse but most of the bacteria too for the zoo svetz was sitting up in a hospital bed with his arm up to the elbow in a diagnostician there was always the chance that he too had located some longextinct bacterium he shifted uncomfortably being careful not to move the wrong arm and asked did you ever find an anaesthetic that worked nope sorry about that svetz we still dont know why your needles didnt work the tanj horse is simply immune to tranks of any kind incidentally there was nothing wrong with your air plant you were smelling the horse i wish id known that i thought i was dying its driving the interns crazy that smell and we cant seem to get it out of the center ra chen sat down on the edge of the bed what bothers me is the horn on his forehead the horse in the picture book had no horns no sir then it must be a different species its not really a horse svetz well have to send you back itll break our budget svetz i disagree sir dont be so tanj polite then dont be so tanj stupid sir svetz was not going back for another horse people who kept tame horses must have de veloped the habit of cutting off the horn when the animal was a pup why not we all saw how dangerous that horn is much too dangerous for a domestic animal then why does our horse have a horn thats why i thought it was wild the first time i saw it i suppose they didnt start cutting off horns until later in history ra chen nodded in gloomy satisfaction i thought so too our problem is that the secretarygeneral is barely bright enough to notice that his horse has a horn and the picturebook horse doesnt hes bound to blame me mmm svetz wasnt sure what was expected of him ill have to have the horn amputated somebodys bound to notice the scar said svetz tanj it youre right ive got enemies at court theyd be only too happy to claim id mutilated the secretarygenerals pet ra chen glared at svetz all right lets hear your idea svetz was busy regretting why had he spoken his vicious beautiful horse tamely docked of its killer horn he found the thought repulsive his impulse had betrayed him what could they do but remove the horn he had it change the picture book not the horse a computer could duplicate the book in detail but with a horn on every horse use the institute computer then wipe the tape afterward morosely thoughtful ra chen said that might work i know someone who could switch the books he looked up from under bushy black brows of course youd have to keep your mouth shut yes sir dont forget ra chen got up when you get out of the diagnostician you start a fourweek vacation im sending you back for one of these ra chen told him four weeks later he opened the bestiary we picked up the book in a public park around ten post atomic left the kid who was holding it playing with a corundum egg svetz examined the picture thats ugly thats really ugly youre trying to balance the horse right the horse was so beautiful youve got to have one of these or the universe goes off balance ra chen closed his eyes in pain just go get us the gila monster svetz the secretarygeneral wants a gila monster how big is it they both looked at the illustration there was no way to tell from the looks of it wed better use the big extension cage svetz barely made it back that time he was suffering from total exhaustion and extensive seconddegree burns the thing he brought back was thirty feet long had vestigial batlike wings breathed fire and didnt look very much like the illustration but it was as close as anything hed found the secretarygeneral loved it leviathan two men stood on one side of a thick glass wall youll be airborne svetzs beefy redfaced boss was saying we made some improvements in the small extension cage while you were in the hospital you can hover it or fly it at up to fifty miles per hour or let it fly itself theres a constantaltitude setting your field of vision is total weve made the shell of the extension cage completely transparent on the other side of the thick glass something was trying to kill them it was forty feet long from nose to tail and was equipped with vestigial batlike wings otherwise it was built something like a slender lizard it screamed and scratched at the glass with murderous claws the sign on the glass read giia monster retrieved from the year ante atomic approximately from the region of china earth extinct youll be well out of his reach said ra chen yes sir svetz stood with his arms folded about him as if he had a chill he was being sent after the biggest animal that had ever lived and svetz was afraid of animals for sciences sake what are you worried about svetz its only a big fish yes sir you said that about the gila monster its just an extinct lizard you said we only had a drawing in a childrens book to go by how could we know it would be so big the gila monster drew back from the glass it inhaled hugely took aimyellow and orange flame spewed from its nostrils and played across the glass svetz squeaked and jumped for cover he cant get through said ra chen svetz picked himself up he was a slender smallboned man with pale skin light blue eyes and very fine ashblond hair how could we know it would breathe fire he mimicked that lizard almost cremated me i spent four months in the hospital as it was and what really burns me is he looks less like the drawing every time i see him sometimes i wonder if i didnt get the wrong animal whats the difference svetz the secretarygeneral loved him thats what counts yes sir speaking of the secretarygeneral what does he want with a sperm whale hes got a horse hes got a gila monster thats a little complicated ra chen grimaced palace politics its always complicated right now svetz somewhere in the united nations palace a hundred plots are in various stages of development and every last one of them involves getting the attention of the secretarygeneral and holding it keeping his attention isnt easy svetz nodded everybody knew about the secretarygeneral the family that had ruled the united nations for seven hundred years was somewhat inbred the secretarygeneral was twentyeight years old he was a happy person he loved animals and flowers and pictures and people pictures of planets and multiple star systems made him clap his hands and coo with delight and so the institute for space research was mighty in the united nations government but he liked extinct animals too someone managed to convince the secretarygeneral that he wants the largest animal on earth the idea may have been to take us down a peg or two said ra chen someone may think were getting too big a share of the budget by the time i got onto it the secretarygeneral wanted a brontosaur wed never have gotten him that no extension cage will reach that far was it your idea to get him a sperm whale sir yah it wasnt easy to persuade him sperm whales have been extinct for so long that we dont even have pictures all i had to show him was a crystal sculpture from archeologydug out of the steuben glass buildingand a bible and a dictionary i managed to convince him that leviathan and the sperm whale were one and the same thats not strictly true svetz had read a computerproduced condensation of the bible the condensation had ruined the plot in svetzs opinion leviathan could be anything big and destructive even a horde of locusts thank science you werent there to help svetz the issue was confused enough anyway i promised the secretarygeneral the largest animal that ever lived on earth all the literature says that that animal was a sperm whale there were sperm whale herds all over the oceans as recently as the first century ante atomic you shouldnt have any trouble finding one in twenty minutes ra chen looked startled what if i try to keep the big extension cage in the past for more than twenty minutes ill never be able to bring it home the i know that uncertainty factor in the energy constants svetz blow the institute right off the map we thought of that svetz youll go back in the small extension cage when you find a whale youll signal the big extension cage signal it how weve found a way to send a simple onoff pulse through time lets go back to the institute and ill show you malevolent golden eyes watched them through the glass as they walked away the extension cage was the part of the time machine that did the moving within its transparent shell svetz seemed to ride a flying armchair equipped with an airplane passengers lunch tray except that the lunch tray was covered with lights and buttons and knobs and crawling green lines he was somewhere off the east coast of north america in or around the year ante atomic or anno domini the inertia calendar was not particularly accurate svetz skimmed low over water the color of lead beneath a sky the color of slate but for the rise and fall of the sea he might almost have been suspended in an enormous sphere painted half light half dark he let the extension cage fly itself twenty meters above the water while he watched the needle on the nai the nervous activities indicator hunting leviathan his stomach was uneasy svetz had thought he was adjusting to the peculiar gravitational side effects of time travel but apparently not at least he would not be here long on this trip he was not looking for a mere fortyfoot gila monster now he hunted the largest animal that had ever lived a most conspicuous beast and now he had a lifeseeking instrument the nai the needle jerked hard over and trembled was it a whale but the needle was trembling in apparent indecision a cluster of sources then svetz looked in the direction indicated a clipper ship winged with white sail long and slender and graceful as hell crowded too svetz guessed many humans closely packed would affect the nai in just that manner a sperm whalea single center of complex nervous activitywould attract the needle as violently without making it jerk about like that the ship would interfere with reception svetz turned east and away but not without regret the ship was beautiful the uneasiness in svetzs belly was getting worse not better endless graygreen water rising and falling beneath svetzs flying armchair enlightenment came like something clicking in his head seasick on automatic the extension cage matched its motion to the surface over which it flew and that surface was heaving in great dark swells no wonder his stomach was uneasy svetz grinned and reached for the manual controls the nai needle suddenly jerked hard over a bite thought svetz and he looked off to the right no sign of a ship and submarines hadnt been invented yet had they no of course they hadnt the needle was rocksteady svetz flipped the call button the source of the tremendous nai signal was off to his right and moving svetz turned to follow it it would be minutes before the call signal reached the institute for temporal research and brought the big extension cage with its weaponry for hooking leviathan many years ago ra chen had dreamed of rescuing the library at alexandria from caesars fire for this purpose he had built the big extension cage its door was a gaping iris big enough to be loaded while the library was actually burning its hold at a guess was at least twice large enough to hold all the scrolls in that ancient library the big cage had cost a fortune in government money it had failed to go back beyond aa or ad the books burned at alexandria were still lost to history or at least to historians such a boondoggle would have broken other men somehow ra chen had survived the blow to his reputation he had pointed out the changes to svetz after they returned from the zoo weve fitted the cage out with heavy duty stunners and antigravity beams youll operate them by remote control be careful not to let the stun beam touch you it would kill even a sperm whale if you held it on him for more than a few seconds and itd kill a man instantly other than that you should have no problems it was at that moment that svetzs stomach began to hurt our major change is the call button it will actually send us a signal through time so that we can send the big extension cage back to you we can land it right beside you no more than a few minutes off that took considerable research svetz the treasury raised our budget for this year so that we could get that whale svetz nodded just be sure youve got a whale before you call for the big extension cage now twelve hundred years earlier svetz followed an underwater source of nervous impulse the signal was intensely powerful it could not be anything smaller than an adult bull sperm whale a shadow formed in the air to his right svetz watched it take shape a great grayblue sphere floating beside him around the rim of the door were antigravity beamers and heavyduty stun guns the opposite side of the sphere wasnt there it simply faded away to svetz that was the most frightening thing about any time machine the way it seemed to turn a corner that wasnt there svetz was almost over the signal now he used the remote controls to swing the antigravity beamers around and down he had them locked on the source he switched them on and dials surged leviathan was heavy more massive than svetz had expected svetz upped the power and watched the nai needle swing as ievial hail rose invisibly through the water where the surface of the water bulged upward under the attack of the antigravity beams a shadow formed leviathan rising was there something wrong with the shape then a trembling spherical bubble of water rose shivering from the ocean and leviathan was within it partly within it he was too big to fit though he should not have been he was four times as massive as a sperm whale should have been and a dozen times as long he looked nothing like the crystal steuben sculpture leviathan was a kind of serpent armored with redbronze scales as big as a vikings shield armed with teeth like ivory spears his triangular jaws gaped wide as he floated toward svetz he writhed seeking with his bulging yellow eyes for whatever strange enemy had subjected him to this indignity svetz was paralyzed with fear and indecision neither then nor later did he doubt that what he saw was the biblical leviathan this had to be the largest beast that had ever roamed the sea a beast large enough and fierce enough to be synonymous with anything big and destructive yetif the crystal sculpture was anything like representational this was not a sperm whale at all in any case he was far too big for the extension cage indecision stayed his handand then svetz stopped thinking entirely as the great slitted irises found him the beast was floating past him around its waist was a sphere of weightless water that shrank steadily as gobbets dripped away and rained back to the sea the beasts nostrils flaredit was obviously an airbreather though not a cetacean it stretched reaching for svetz with gaping jaws teeth like scores of elephants tusks all in a row polished and needle sharp svetz saw them close about him from above and below while he sat frozen in fear at the last moment he shut his eyes tight when death did not come svetz opened his eyes the jaws had not entirely closed on svetz and his armchair svetz heard them grinding faintly againstagainst the invisible surface of the extension cage whose existence svetz had forgotten entirely svetz resumed breathing he would return home with an empty entension cage to face the wrath of ra chen a fate better than death svetz moved his fingers to cut the antigravity beams from the big extension cage metal whined against metal svetz whiffed hot oil while red lights bloomed all over his lunchtray control board he hastily turned the beams on again the red lights blinked out one by reluctant one through the transparent shell svetz could hear the grinding of teeth leviathan was trying to chew his way into the extension cage his released weight had nearly torn the cage loose from the rest of the time machine svetz would have been stranded in the past a hundred miles out to sea in a broken extension cage that probably wouldnt float with an angry sea monster waiting to snap him up no he couldnt turn off the antigravity beamers but the beamers were on the big extension cage and he couldnt keep the big extension cage more than about fifteen minutes longer when the big extension cage was gone what would prevent leviathan from pulling him to his doom ill stun him off said svetz there was dark red palate above him and red gums and forking tongue beneath and the long curved fangs all around but between the two rows of teeth svetz could see the big extension cage and the battery of stunners around the door by eye he rotated the stunners until they pointed straight toward leviathan i must be out of my mind said svetz and he spun the stunners away from him he couldnt fire the stunners at leviathan without hitting himself and leviathan wouldnt let go trapped no he thought with a burst of relief he could escape with his life the gohome lever would send his small extension cage out from between the jaws of leviathan back into the time stream back to the institute his mission had failed but that was hardly his fault why had ra chen been unable to uncover mention of a sea serpent bigger than a sperm whale its all his fault said svetz and he reached for the gohome lever but he stayed his hand i cant just tell him so he said for ra chen terrified him the grinding of teeth came itchingly through the extension cage hate to just quit said svetz think ill try something he could see the antigravity beamers by looking between the teeth he could feel their influence so nearly were they focussed on the extension cage itself if he focussed them just on himself he felt the change he felt both strong and lightheaded like a drunken ballet master and if he now narrowed the focus the monsters teeth seemed to grind harder svetz looked between them as best he could leviathan was no longer floating he was hanging straight down from the extension cage hanging by his teeth the antigravity beamers still balanced the pull of his mass but now they did so by pulling straight up on the extension cage the monster was in obvious distress naturally a water beast he was supporting his own mass for the first time in his life and by his teeth his yellow eyes rolled frantically his tail twitched slightly at the very tip and still he clung let go said svetz let go you monster the monsters teeth slid screeching down the transparent surface and he fell svetz cut the antigravity a fraction of a second late he smelled burnt oil and there were tiny red lights blinking off one by one on his control board leviathan hit the water with a sound of thunder his long sinuous body rolled over and floated to the surface and lay as if dead but his tail flicked once and svetz knew that he was alive i could kill you said svetz hold the stunners on you until youre dead theres time enough but he still had ten minutes to search for a sperm whale it wasnt time enough it didnt begin to be time enough but if he used it all the sea serpent flicked its tail and began to swim away once he rolled to look at svetz and his jaws opened wide in fury he finished his roll and was fleeing again just a minute svetz said thickly just a scienceperverting minute there and he swung the stunners to focus gravity behaved strangely inside an extension cage while the cage was moving forward in time down was all directions outward from the center of the cage svetz was plastered against the curved wall he waited for the trip to end seasickness was nothing compared to the motion sickness of time travel free fall then normal gravity svetz moved unsteadily to the door ra chen was waiting to help him out did you get it leviathan no sir svetz looked past his boss wheres the big extension cage were bringing it back slowly to minimize the gravitational side effects but if you dont have the whale i said i dont have leviathan well just what do you have ra chen demanded somewhat later he said it wasnt later yet he said you killed him why svetz pure spite no sir it was the most intelligent thing i did during the entire trip but why never mind svetz heres the big extension cage a grayblue shadow congealed in the hollow cradle of the time machine and there does seem to be something in it hi you idiots throw an antigravity beam inside the cage do you want the beast crushed the cage had arrived ra chen waved an arm in signal the door opened something tremendous hovered within the big extension cage it looked like a malevolent white mountain in there peering back at its captors with a single tiny angry eye it was trying to get at ka chen but it couldnt swim in air its other eye was only a torn socket one of its flippers was ripped along the trailing edge rips and ridges and puckers of scar tissue and a forest of broken wood and broken steel marked its tremendous expanse of albino skin lines trailed from many of the broken harpoons high up on one flank bound to the beast by broken and tangled lines was the corpse of a bearded man with one leg hardly in mint condition is he ra chen observed be careful sir hes a killer i saw him ram a sailing ship and sink it clean before i could focus the stunners on him what amazes me is that you found him at all in the time you had left svetz i do not understand your luck or am i missing something it wasnt luck sir svetz hurried to explain the sea serpent was just leaving the vicinity i wanted to kill him but i knew i didnt have the time i was about to leave myself when he turned back and bared his teeth he was an obvious carnivore those teeth were built strictly for killing sir i should have noticed earlier and i could think of only one animal big enough to feed a carnivore that size ahhh brilliant svetz there was corroborative evidence our research never found any mention of giant sea serpents the great geological surveys of the first century post atomic should have turned up something why didnt they because the sea serpent quietly died out two centuries earlier after whalers killed off his food supply svetz colored exactly so i turned the stunners on leviathan before he could swim away and i kept the stunners on him until the nai said he was dead i reasoned that if leviathan was here there must be whales in the vicinity and leviathans nervous output was masking the signal sure enough it was the moment he was dead the nai registered another signal i followed it to svetz jerked his head they were floating the whale out of the extension cage to him days later two men stood on one side of a thick glass wall we took some clones from him then passed him on to the secretarygenerals vivarium said ra chen pity you had to settle for an albino he waved aside svetzs protest i know i know you were pressed for time beyond the glass the oneeyed whale glared at svetz through murky seawater surgeons had removed most of the harpoons but scars remained along his flanks and svetz awed wondered how long the beast had been at war with man centuries how long did sperm whales live ra chen lowered his voice wed all be in trouble if the secretarygeneral found out that there was once a bigger animal than his you understand that dont you svetz yes sir good ra chens gaze swept across another glass wall and a firebreathing gila monster further down a horse looked back at him along the dangerous spiral horn in its forehead always we find the unexpected said ra chen sometimes i wonder if youd do your research better svetz thought did you know that time travel wasnt even a concept until the first century ante atomic a writer invented it from then until the fourth century post atomic time travel was pure fantasy it violates everything the scientists of the time thought were natural laws logic conservation of matter and energy momentum reaction any law of motion that makes time a part of the statement relativity it strikes me said ra chen that every time we push an extension cage past that particular fourcentury period we shove it into a kind of fantasy world thats why you keep finding giant sea serpents and firebreathing thats nonsense said svetz he was afraid of his boss yes but there were limits youre right ra chen said instantly almost with relief take a months vacation svetz then back to work the secretarygeneral wants a bird a bird svetz smiled a bird sounded harmless enough i suppose he found it in another childrens book thats right ever hear of a bird called a roc bird in the hand its not a roc said ra chen the bird looked stupidly back at them from behind a thick glass wall its wings were small and underdeveloped its legs and feet were tremendous ludicrous it weighed three hundred pounds and stood nearly eight feet tall other than that it looked a lot like a baby chick it kicked me svetz complained a slender smallboned man he stood stiffly this day with a slight list to port it kicked me in the side and broke four ribs i barely made it back to the extension cage it still isnt a roc sorry about that svetz we did some research in the history section of the beverly hills library while you were in the hospital the roc was only a legend but look at it svetzs beefy redfaced boss nodded thats probably what started the legend karly explorers in australia saw these ostriches wandering about they said to themselves if the chicks are this size what are the adults like then they went home and told stories about the adults i got my ribs caved in for a flightless bird cheer up svetz its not a total loss the ostrich was extinct it makes a fine addition to the secretarygenerals vivarium but the secretarygeneral wanted a roc what are you going to tell him ra chen scowled its worse than that do you know what the secretarygeneral wants now people meeting ra chen for the first time thought he was constantly scowling until they saw his scowl svetz had suspected ra chen was worried now he knew it the secretarygeneral was everybodys problem a recessive gene inherited from his powerful inbred family had left him with the intelligence of a sixyearold child another kind of inheritance had made him overlord of the earth and its colonies his whim was law throughout the explored universe whatever the secretarygeneral wanted now it was vital that he get it some idiot took him diving in los angeles ra chen said he wants to see the city before it sank that doesnt sound too bad it wouldnt be if it had stopped there some of his circle of advisors noticed his interest they got him historical tapes on los angeles he loves them he wants to join the first watts riot svetz gulped that should raise some security problems youd think so wouldnt you the secretarygeneral is almost pure caucasian the ostrich cocked its head to one side studying them it still looked like the tremendous chick of an even bigger bird svetz could imagine that it had just cracked its way out of an egg the size of a bungalow im going to have a headache he said why do you tell me these things you know i dont like politics can you imagine what would happen if the secretarygeneral got himself killed with the help of the institute for temporal research there are enough factions already that would like to see us disbanded space for instance theyd love to swallow us up but what can we do we cant turn down a direct request from the secretarygeneral we can distract him they had lowered their voices to conspiratorial whispers now they turned away from the ostrich and strolled casually down the line of glass cages how i dont know yet if i could only get to his nurse ra chen said between his teeth ive tried hard enough maybe the institute for space research has bought her then again maybe shes loyal shes been with him twentyfour years how do i know what would catch his attention ive only met the secretarygeneral four times all on formal occasions but his attention span is low hed forget about los angeles if we could distract him the cage they were passing was labeled elephant retrieved from the year ante atomic approximately from the region of india earth extinct the wrinkled gray beast watched them go with sleepy indifference his air of inhuman age and wisdom was such that he must have recognized svetz as his captor but he didnt care svetz had captured almost half of the animals in the vivarium and svetz was afraid of animals especially big animals why did ra chen keep sending him after animals the thirty feet of lizard in the next cage definitely recognized svetz it jetted orangewhite flame at him and flapped its tiny batlike wings in fury when the flame washed harmlessly across the glass if it ever got loose but that was why the cages were airtight the animals of earths past must be protected from the air of earths present svetz remembered the cobaltblue sky of earths past and was reassured todays afternoon sky was brilliant turquoise at the zenith shading through pastel green and yellow to rich yellowbrown near the horizon if the chinese firebreather ever got out it would be too busy gasping for purer air to attack svetz what can we get him i think hes tired of these animals svetz what about a giraffe a what or a dog or a satyr its got to be unusual ra chen muttered a teddy bear out of his fear of animals svetz ventured i wonder if you might not be on the wrong track sir mph why the secretarygeneral has enough animals to satisfy a thousand men worse than that youre competing with space when you bring back funny animals they can do that too ra chen scratched behind his ear i never thought of that youre right but weve got to do something there must be lots of things to do with a time machine they could have taken a displacement plate back to the center ra chen preferred to walk it would give him a chance to think he said svetz walked with bowed head and blind eyes alongside his boss inspiration had come to him at similar times but they had reached the red sandstone cube that was the center and the mental lightning had not struck a big hand closed on his upper arm just a minute ra chen said softly the secretarygenerals paying us a visit svetzs heart lurched how do you know you should recognize that machine in the walkway we brought it back last month from los angeles from the day of the great california earthquake its an internal combustion automobile it belongs to the secretarygeneral whatll we do go in and show him around pray he doesnt insist on being taken back to watts august eleventh twenty post atomic suppose he does if they boiled ra chen for treason they would surely boil svetz too ill have to send him back if he asks it oh not with you svetz with zeera shes black and she speaks american it might help not enough said svetz but he was already calmer let zeera take the risks they passed close by the secretarygenerals automobile svetz was intrigued by its odd angular look its complex control panels the shiny chrome trim someone had removed the hood so that the polished complexity of the motor was open to view wait svetz said suddenly does he like it will you come on does the secretarygeneral like his automobile sure svetz he loves it get him another car california must have been full of automobiles on the day before the great quake ra chen stopped suddenly that could be it it would hold him for a while give us time time for what ra chen didnt hear a racing car no hed kill himself the circle of advisors would want to install a robot chauffeuroverride maybe a dune buggy why not ask him its worth a try said ra chen they went up the steps in the center there were three time machines including the one with the big extension cage plus a host of panels with flashing colored lights the secretarygeneral liked those he smiled and chuckled as ra chen led him about his guards hovered at his shoulders their faces stiff their fingernails clicking against their gunbutts ra chen introduced svetz as my best agent svetz was so overwhelmed by the honor that he could only stutter but the secretarygeneral didnt seem to notice whether he had forgotten about seeing the watts riot was moot but he did forget to ask on that occasion when ra chen asked about cars the secretarygeneral smiled all across his face and nodded so vigorously that svetz worried about spinal injury faced by a vast array of choices five or six decades with dozens of new models for every year the secretarygeneral put his finger in his mouth and considered well then he made his choice why not ask him why not ask him ra chen mimicked savagely now we know the first car he wants the first car ever made i thought hed ask for a make of car svetz rubbed his eyes hard how can we possibly find one car a couple of decades to search through and all of the north american and european continents its not that bad well use the books from the beverly hills library but its bad enough svetz the raid on the beverly hills library had been launched in full daylight using the big extension cage and a dozen guards armed with stunners on june third twentysix post atomic giant time machines crazy men wearing flying beltson any other day it would have made every newspaper and television program in the country but june the third was a kind of happy hunting ground for the institute for temporal research no californian would report the raid except to other californians if the story did get out it would be swamped by more important news the series of quakes would begin at sunset and the ocean would rise like a great green wall svetz and ra chen and zeera southworth spent half the night going through the history section of the beverly hills library ra chen knew enough white american to recognize titles but in the end zeera had to do all the reading zeera southworth was tall and slender and very dark crowned with hair like a black powder explosion she sat gracefully crosslegged on the floor looking very angular reading pertinent sections aloud while the others paced they followed a twisting trail of references by two in the morning they were damp and furious nobody invented the automobile ka chen exploded it just happened we certainly have a wide range of choices zeera agreed i take it we wont want any of the steam automobiles that would eliminate gugnot and trevethick and the later british steam coaches well concentrate on internal combustion svetz said our best bets seem to be lenoir of france and marcus of vienna except that daimler and benz have good claims and seldens patent held good in court dammit pick one just a minute sir zeera alone retained some semblance of calm this ford might be the best weve got ford why he invented nothing but a system of mass production zeera held up the book svetz recognized it a biography she had been reading earlier this book implies that ford was responsible for everything that he created the automobile industry single handed but we know that isnt true svetz protested ra chen made a pushing motion with one hand lets not be hasty we take fords car and we produce that book to authenticate it wholl know the difference but if someone does the same research we justoh sure hell get the same answers no answers fords just as good a choice as anyone else better if nobody looks further zeera said with satisfaction too bad we cant take the model t it looks much more like an automobile this thing he started with looks like a kiddy cart it says he built it out of old pipes tough said ra chen late the next morning ra chen delivered lastminute instructions you cant just take the car he told zeera if youre interrupted come back without it yes sir it would be less crucial if we took our duplicate from a later time from the smithsonian institution for instance the automobile has to be new he reasonable zeera we cant give the secretarygeneral a secondhand automobile no sir well land you about three in the morning use infrared and pills to change your vision dont show any visible light artificial light would probably scare them silly right were you shown i know how to use the duplicator zeera sounded faintly supercilious as always i also know that it reverses the image never mind that bring back the reversed duplicate and well just reverse it again of course she seemed chagrined that she had not seen that for herself what about dialect you speak black and white american but its for a later period dont use slang stick to black unless you want to impress someone white then speak white but speak slowly and carefully and use simple words theyll think youre from another country i hope zeera nodded crisply she stooped and entered the extension cage turned and pulled the duplicator after her its bulk was small but it weighed a ton or so without the lift field generator to float it one end glowed white with glowpaint they watched the extension cage blur and vanish it was still attached to the rest of the time machine but attached along a direction that did not transmit light now then ra chen rubbed his hands together i dont expect shell have any trouble getting henry fords flightless flight stick our trouble may come when the secretarygeneral sees what hes got svetz nodded remembering the grayandflat pictures in the history books fords machine was ungainly slipshod ugly and undependable a few small surreptitious additions would make it dependable enough to suit the secretarygeneral nothing would make it beautiful we need another distraction said ra chen weve only bought ourselves more time to get it zeeras small time machine gave off a sound of ripping cloth subdued monotonous reassuring a dozen workmen were readying the big extension cage zeera would need it to transport the duplicate automobile theres something id like to try svetz ventured concerning what the roc ra chen grinned the ostrich svetz dont you ever give up svetz looked stubborn do you know anything about neoteny never heard of it look svetz were going to be over budget because of the roc trip not your fault of course but another trip would cost us over a million commercials i wont need the time machine oh but i could use the help of the palace veterinarian have you got enough pull to arrange that the palace veterinarian was a stocky blocky busty woman with muscular legs and a thrusting jaw a floating platform packed with equipment followed her between the rows of cages i know most of these beasts she told svetz once upon a time i was going to give then all names an animal ought to have a name theyve got names thats what i decided gila monster elephant ostrich she read you give horace a name so you wont mix him up with gilbert but nobody would get horse mixed up with elephant theres only one of each poor beasties she stopped before the cage marked ostrich is this your prize ive been meaning to come see him the bird shifted its feet in indecision it cocked its head to consider the couple on the other side of the glass it seemed surprised at svetzs return he looks just like a newly hatched chick she said except for the legs and feet of course they seem to have developed to support the extra mass svetz was edgy with the need to be in two places at once his own suggestion had sparked zeeras project le ought to be at the center yetthe ostrich had been his first failure he asked does it look neotenous neotenous of course neoteny is a common method of evolution we have neotenous traits ourselves you know bare skin where all the other primates are covered with hair when our ancestors started chasing their meat across the plains they needed a better cooling system than most primates need so they kept one aspect of immaturity the bare skin probably the big head is another one the axolotl is the classic example of neoteny excuse me you know what a salamander was dont you it had gills and fins while immature as an adult it grew lungs and shed the gills and lived on land the axolotl was a viable offshoot that never lost the gills and fins a gene shift typical of neoteny i never heard of either of them axolotls or salamanders they needed open streams and ponds to live svetz svetz nodded if they needed open water then both species must be over a thousand years extinct the problem is that we dont know when your bird lost its ability to fly some random neotenous development may have occurred far in the past so that the birds wings never developed then it may have evolved its present size to compensate oh then the ancestor may have been no bigger than a turkey shall we go in and find out the glass irised open to admit them svetz stepped into the cage felt the tug of the pressure curtain flowing over and around him the ostrich backed warily away the vet opened a pouch on her floating platform withdrew a stunner and used it the ostrich squawked in outrage and collapsed no muss no fuss the vet strode toward her patientand stopped suddenly in the middle of the cage she sniffed sniffed again in horror have i lost my sense of smell svetz produced two items like cellophane bags handed her one put this on why you might suffocate if you dont he donned the other himself by pulling it over his head then pressing the rim against the skin of his neck it stuck when he finished he had a hermetic seal this air is deadly he explained its the air of the earths past reconstituted think of it as coming from fifteen hundred years ago theres no civilization nothings been burned yet thats why you cant smell anything but ostrich out therewell you dont really need sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide and nitric oxides to stay alive you do need carbon dioxide theres a nerve complex in the lymph glands under your left armpit and it triggers the breathing reflex its activated by a certain concentration of c in the blood she had finished donning her filter helmet i take it the concentration is too low in here right youd forget to breathe youre used to air thats four percent carbon dioxide in here its barely a tenth of that the bird can breathe this bland stuff in fact its die without it what weve put into the air in the past fifteen hundred years weve had fifteen hundred years to adapt to the ostrich hasnt ill keep that in mind she said shortly so that svetz wondered if hed been lecturing someone who knew more than he did she knelt beside the sleeping ostrich and the platform floated lower for her convenience svetz watched her as she ministered to the ostrich taking tissue samples testing blood pressure and heartbeat in reaction to small doses of hormones and drugs in a general way he knew what she was doing there were techniques for reversing the most recent mutations in an animals genetic makeup one did not always get what one expected still there was a homo habilis several cages down who had been in the circle of advisors until he called the secretarygeneral a tyrannical fugghead while she was identifying the neotenous developments she would also be trying to guess what she would have when they were eliminated then there were matters of metabolism if svetz was right the birds mass would increase rapidly it must be fed intravenously and even more rapidly in generalbut the details of what she was doing were mysterious and dull svetz found himself studying her filter helmet full inflation had rendered it almost invisible a golden rim of it showed by diffraction against the yellowbrown sky did space really want to take over the institute for temporal research then that golden halo was support for their claim it was a semipermeable membrane it would selectively pass gasses in both directions in such a way as to make an almost breathable atmosphere breathable it had been taken unchanged from a space warehouse other itr equipment had come from the space industries flight sticks anaesthetic needle guns the lowmass antigravity unit in the new extension cage but their basic argument was more subtle once the ocean teemed with life svetz thought now the continental shelf is as dead as the moon nothing but bubble cities once this whole continent was all forest and living desert and fresh water we cut down the trees and shot the animals and poisoned the rivers and irrigated the deserts so that even the desert life died and now theres nothing left but the food yeast and us weve forgotten so much about the past that we cant separate legend from fact weve wiped out most of the forms of life on earth in the last fifteen hundred years and changed the composition of the air to the extent that wed be afraid to change it back i fear the unknown beasts of the past i cannot breathe the air i do not know the edible plants i could not kill the animals for food i do not know which would kill me the earths past is as alien to me as another planet let space have it the palace veterinarian was busy jabbing the pointed ends of colorcoded tubing into various portions of the birds anatomy the tubes led back to machinery on the floating platform svetzs pocket phone rang he flipped it open theres trouble said ra chens image zeeras cage was on its way home she must have pulled the gohome ever right after she called for the big extension cage she left before the big cage could get there ra chen nodded grimly whatever happened must have happened fast if she called for the big cage then she had the automobile a moment later she aborted the mission svetz im worried id hate to leave now sir svetz turned to look at the ostrich in that moment all of the birds feathers fell out leaving it plump and naked that decided him i cant leave now sir well have a fullgrown roc here in another ten minutes what good but how the ostrich was a neotenous offshoot of the roc weve produced a throwback good stick with it svetz well handle it here ra chen switched off the palace veterinarian said you shouldnt make promises you cant keep svetzs heart leapt trouble no its going beautifully so far all the feathers fell out is that good dont worry about it see for yourself already theres a coat of down your ostrich is reverting to chickhood she said cheerfully its ancestors chickhood if the ancestor really was no bigger than a turkey before it lost the ability to fly itll be even smaller aa a chick whatll happen then itll drown in its own fat we should have taken a clone too late look at it now look at the legs they arent nearly as overdeveloped the bird was a big ball of pale yellow down its frame had shrunk but its legs had shrunk much more standing it would have been no more than four feet tall the extra mass had turned to fat so that the ostrich was nearly spherical it bulged like a poolside toy lying on its inflated side in a pool of feathers now it really looks like a chick said svetz it does svetz in fact it is that was a big chick the adult is going to be tremendous the palace veterinarian jumped to her feet svetz weve got to hurry is there a basic dole yeast source in this cage sure why hell starve at the rate hes growing unless just show me svetz the animals of the zoo ate dole yeast like everyone else but with special additives for each animal a brain tap could induce the animal to imagine it was eating whatever it was used to eating when the time probe had picked it up svetz showed her the yeast tap she hooked the pipeline to one of the machines on her floating platform she made adaptations added another machine the bird grew visibly its fat layer shrank deflated its legs and wings stretched outward the beak began to take a distinctive hooked form sharp and wicked svetz began to feel panic beneath its downy feathers the bird was little more than taut skin stretched over long bones the yeast was now feeding directly into two tanks on the floating platform and from there into the colored tubes somehow the palace veterinarian was converting the yeast directly into sugarplasma its working now she said i wasnt sure it would hell be all right now if the growth cycle slows down in time she smiled up at him you were right all along the ostrich was a neotenous roc at that moment the light changed svetz wasnt sure what had disturbed him but he looked upand the sky was baby blue from the horizon to the zenith what is it the woman beside him was bemused rather than frightened i never saw a color like that in my life i have what is it dont worry about it hut keep your filter helmet on especially if you have to leave the cage can you remember that of course her eyes narrowed you know something about this svetz its something to do with time isnt it i think so svetz used the key beam then to avoid further questions the glass peeled back to let him out he turned for a last look through the glass the palace veterinarian looked frightened she must have guessed too much for her own comfort but she turned away to care for her patient the ostrich lay on its side its eyes open now it was tremendous and still scrawny despite the volume of the intravenous feed its feathers were changing color the bird would be black and green it was half as big as the elephant next door whose air of gray wisdom was giving way to uneasiness as he watched the proceedings it looked nothing like an ostrich the sky was baby blue the blue of the deep past crossed with fluffy clouds of clean and shining white blue from the horizon to the zenith without a trace of the additives that ought to be there unconscious men and women lay everywhere svetz dared not stop to help what he had to do was more important he slowed to a walk as he neared the center there was pain like a knife blade inserted between his partly healed ribs itr crewmen had fallen in the walkway around the center presumably after staggering outside and there was the secretarygenerals automobile sitting quietly in front behind it flat on his back was ra chen what did he think he was doing there svetz heard the purr of the motor as he approached so that was it ra chen must have hoped that the exhaust would revive him damn clever and it should have worked why hadnt it o labrv nivkn svete looked into the polished metal guts of the motor as he passed the motor had changed somehow what ran it now steam electricity a flywheel in any event the exhaust pipe ra chen had been searching for was no longer there ra chen was alive his pulse rapid and frantic but he wasnt breathing or yes he was he was breathing perhaps twice a minute as carbon dioxide built up enough to activate the reflex svetz went on into the center more than a dozen men and women had collapsed across lighted control panels three more figures sprawled in an aisle the secretarygeneral lay in angular disorder smiling foolishly up at the ceiling his guards wore troubled sleeping expressions and held drawn guns the small extension cage had not returned svetz looked into the empty gap in the time machine and felt terror what could he accomplish without zeera to tell him what had gone wrong from ante atomic to the present was a thirty minute trip ra chens call to the zoo must have come less than thirty minutes ago weird how an emergency could telescope time unless that was a side effect of the paradox unless the paradox had chopped away zeeras extension cage and left her stranded in the past or cast off into an alternate world line or there had never been a temporal paradox math was no help the mathematics of time travel was riddled with singularities last year somebody had tried to do a topological analysis of the path of an extension cage he had proved not only that time travel was impossible but that you couldnt travel faster than light either ra chen had leaked the news to space on the off chance that their hyperdrive ships would stop working what to do start putting filter helmets on everyone great but the helmets werent kept at the center hed have to go across town did he dare leave the center svetz forced himself to sit down minutes later he snapped alert at the pop of displaced air the small extension cage had returned zeera was crawling out of the circular doorway get back in there svetz ordered quick i dont take orders from you svetz she brushed past him and looked about her the automobiles gone wheres ra chen zeeras face was blank with shock and exhaustion her voice was a monotone ragged at the edges svetz took her arm zeera weve she jerked away weve got to do something the automobiles gone didnt you hear me did you hear me get back in the extension cage but weve got to decide what to do why cant i smell anything she sniffed at air that was scentless empty dead she looked about her in bewilderment realizing for the first time just how strange everything was then the eyes rolled up in her head and svetz stepped forward to catch her he studied her sleeping face across the diameter of the extension cage it was very different from her waking face softer more vulnerable and prettier zeera had quite a pretty face you should relax more often he said his ribs throbbed where the ostrich had kicked him the pain seemed to beat like a heart zeera opened her eyes she asked why are we in here the extension cage has its own air system said svetz you cant breathe the outside air why not you tell me her eyes went wide the automobile its gone why i dont know svetz i swear i did everything right but when i turned on the duplicator the automobile disappeared that doesnt sound at all good svetz strove to keep his voice level what did you i lid it just he way they taught me i hooked the glowpainted end to the frame set the dials for an estimated mass plus a margin of error read the dials off you must have hooked up the wrong end somehow wait a minute were you using the infrared flash of course it was dead of night and youd taken the pills so youd be able to see infrared do you always think that slowly svetz then her eyes changed i was seeing infrared of course i hooked up the hot end the duplicator end that would duplicate empty space where there was an automobile youd get emptiness at both ends stupid zeera said bitterly stupid she hooked her arms under her knees and relaxed against the curved side of the extension cage presently she said henry ford sold that automobile for two hundred dollars according to the book later he had trouble getting financed how much is two hundred dollars i think it depends on the year enough to ruin a man apparently if you take it away at the right time then someone else used assembly lines to make automobiles and he must have liked steam or electricity steam id guess steam cars came first why would that affect the air we can breathe what comes out of an automobile exhaust pipe but we dont need it to live except co a steam automobile would bum fuel wouldnt it i wondered about that too said svetz it took me a while but i got it some of what comes out of an exhaust pipe never goes away it just stays in the air like a curtain between us and the sun its been there for a thousand years cutting off half our sunlight and we made it didnt happen photosynthesis thats where all the carbon dioxide went right but if the air changed why didnt we change with it we evolved to be able to breathe a certain kind of air shouldnt the evolution have been cancelled too for that matter why do we remember i dont know theres a lot we dont know about time travel im not nagging svetz i dont know either more silence its clear enough zeera said presently ill have to go back and warn myself to get the duplicator on straight that wont work it didnt work if youd gotten the ends of the duplicator on straight we wouldnt be in this mess therefore you didnt logic and time travel dont go remember maybe we can go around you svetz hesitated then plunged in try this send me back to an hour before the earlier zeera arrives the automobile wont have disappeared yet ill duplicate it duplicate the duplicate take the reversed duplicate and the original past you in the big extension cage that leaves you to destroy the duplicate i reappear after youre gone leave the original automobile for ford and come back here with the reverse duplicate hows that it sounded great would you mind going through it again lets see i go back to she was laughing at him never mind but it has to be me svetz you couldnt find your way you couldnt ask directions or read the street signs youll have to stay here and man the machinery svetz was crawling out of the extension cage when there came a scream like the end of the world momentarily he froze then he dashed around the swelling flank of the cage zeera followed wearing the filter helmet she had worn during her attempt to duplicate fords automobile one wall of the center was glass it framed a crest of hill across from the palace and a double row of cages that made up the zoo one of the cages was breaking apart as they watched smashing itself to pieces like like an egg hatching and like a chick emerging the roc stood up in the ruin of its cage the scream came again what is it zeera whispered it was an ostrich id hate to give it a name now the bird seemed to move in slow motion there was so much of it green and black beautiful and evil big as eternity and a crest of golden feathers had sprouted on its forehead its hooked beak descended toward a cage that cage ripped like tissue paper zeera was shaking his arm come on if it came from the zoo we dont need to worry about it itll suffocate when we get the car back where it belongs oh right said svetz they went to work moving the big extension cage a few hours further back in time when svetz looked again the bird was just taking to the air its wings flapped like sails and their black shadows swept like clouds over the houses as the roc rose fully into view svetz saw that something writhed and struggled in its tremendous talons svetz recognized it and realized just how big the roc really was its got elephant he said an inexplicable sorrow gripped his heart inexplicable for svetz hated animals what come on svetz um oh yes he helped zeera into the small extension cage and sent it on its way despite its sleeping crew the machinery of the center was working perfectly if anything got off svetz would have six mens work to do therefore he prowled among the control boards alert for any discrepancy making minor adjustments and occasionally he looked out the picture window the roc had reached an enormous height any other bird would have been invisible long since but the roc was all too apparent hovering in the blue alien sky while it killed and ate elephant bloody bones fell in the walkway time passed twenty minutes for zeera to get back more time to make two duplicates of the automobile load them into the big extension cage then to signal svetz the signal came she had the cars svetz played it safe moved her forward six hours almost to dawn on the crucial night she might be caught by an early riser but at least ford would have his automobile back the roc had finished its bloody meal elephant was gone andsvetz watched until he was surethe bird was dropping riding down the sky on outstretched wings svetz watched it grow bigger and bigger yet until it seemed to enfold the universe it settled over the center like a tornado cloud in darkness and wind like twin tornado funnels two sets of curved talons touched down in the walkway the bird bent low an inhuman face looked in at svetz through the picture window it nearly filled the window it knows me svetz thought even a birds brain must be intelligent in a head that size the vast head rose out of sight above the roof i had the ostrich i should have been satisfied thought svetz a coin in the hand is worth two in the street the ancient proverb could as easily be applied to birds the roof exploded downward around a tremendous hooked beak particles of concrete spattered against walls and floor a yellow eye rolled and found svetz but the beak couldnt reach him not through that hole the head withdrew through the roof three red lights svetz leapt for the board and began rwistinjj dials he made two lights turn green then the third it had not occurred to him to run the bird would find him out wherever he hid there zeera had pulled the gohome lever from here it was all automatic crash svetz was backed up against the big time machine pinned by a yellow eye as big as himself half the roof was gone now still the curved beak couldnt reach him but a great claw came seeking him through the shattered glass the light changed svetz sagged behind the green and black feathers he could see that the sky had turned pale yellowgreen marked with yellowbrown streamers of cloud the bird sniffed incredulously once twice somehow the panic showed in its tremendous eye before the great head rose through the roof the roc stepped back from the center for clearance its dark wings swept down like night falling svetz was beyond fear or common sense he stepped out to watch it rise he had to hug an ornamental pillar the wind of the wings was a hurricane the bird looked down once and recognized him and looked away it was still well in view rising and circling when zeera stepped out to join him presently ra chen was there to follow their eyes then half the center maintenance team was gaping up in awe and astonishment the bird dwindled to a black shadow black against pastel green climbing climbing suffocating one sniff had been enough the birds brain was as enormously proportioned as the rest of it it had started climbing immediately without waiting to snatch up svetz for its dessert climbing climbing toward the edge of space reaching for clean air the secretarygeneral stood beside svetz smiling in wonder chuckling happily as he gazed upward was the roc still climbing no the black shadow was growing larger sliding down the sky and the slow motion of the wings had stopped how was a roc to know that there was no clean air anywhere theres a wolf in my time machine the old extension cage had no fine controls but that hardly mattered it wasnt as if svetz were chasing some particular extinct animal ra chen had told him to take whatever came to hand svetz guided the cage back to preindustrial america somewhere in midcontinent around ante atomic era few humans many animals perhaps hed find a bison and when he pulled himself to the window he looked out upon a vast white land svetz had not planned to arrive in midwinter briefly he considered moving into the time stream again and using the interrupter circuit try another date try his luck again but the interrupter circuit was new untried and svetz wasnt about to be the first man to test it besides which a trip into the past cost over a million commercials using the interrupter circuit would nearly double that ra chen would be displeased svetz began freezing to death the moment he opened the door from the doorway the view was all white with one white bounding shape far away svetz shot it with a crystal of soluble anaesthetic he used the flight stick to reach the spot now that it was no longer moving the beast was hard to find it was just the color of the snow but for its open red mouth and the black pads on its feet svetz tentatively identified it as an arctic wolf it would fit the vivarium well enough svetz would have settled for anything that would let him leave this frozen wilderness he felt uncommonly pleased with himself a quick easy mission inside the cage he rolled the sleeping beast into what might have been a clear plastic bag and sealed it he strapped the wolf against one curved wall of the extension cage he relaxed into the curve of the opposite wall as the cage surged in a direction vertical to all directions gravity shifted oddly a transparent sac covered svetzs own head its lip was fixed to the skin of his neck now svetz pulled it loose and dropped it the air system was on he would not need the filter sac the wolf would it could not breathe industrial age air without the filter sac to remove the poisons the wolf would choke to death wolves were extinct in svetzs time outside time passed at a furious rate inside time crawled nestled in the sphericalcurve of the extension cage svetz stared up at the wolf who now seemed fitted into the curve of the ceiling svetz had never met a wolf in the flesh he had seen pictures in childrens books and even the childrens books had been stolen from the deep past why should the wolf look so familiar it was a big beast possibly as big as hanville svetz who was a slender smallboned man its sides heaved with its panting its tongue was long and red and its teeth were white and sharp like the dogs svetz remembered the dogs in the vivarium in the glass case labeled dog alone of the beasts in the vivarium the dogs were not sealed in glass for their own protection the others could not breathe the air outside the dogs could in a very real sense they were the work of one man lawrence wash porter had lived near the end of the industrial period between and post atomic era when billions of human beings were dying of lung diseases while scant millions adapted porter had decided to save the dogs why the dogs his motives were obscure but his methods smacked of genius he had acquired members of each of the breeds of dog in the world and bred them together over many generations of dogs and most of his own lifetime there would never be another dog show not a purebred dog was left in the world but hybrid vigor had produced a new breed these the ultimate mongrels could breathe industrial age air rich in oxides of carbon and nitrogen scented with raw gasoline and sulfuric acid the dogs were behind glass because people were afraid of them too many species had died the people of post atomic were not used to animals wolves and dogs could one have sired the other svetz looked up at the sleeping wolf and wondered he was both like and unlike the dogs dogs grinned out through the glass and wagged their tails when children waved dogs liked people but the wolf even in sleep svetz shuddered of all the things he hated about his profession this was the worst the ride home staring up at a strange and dangerous extinct animal the first time hed done it a captured horse had seriously damaged the control panel on his last mission an ostrich had kicked him and broken three ribs the wolf was stirring restlessly and something about it had changed something was changing now the beasts snout was shorter wasnt it its forelegs lengthened peculiarly its paws seemed to grow and spread svetz caught his breath svetz caught his breath and instantly forgot the wolf sveta was choking dying he snatched up his filter sac and threw himself at the controls svetz stumbled out of the extension cage took three steps and collapsed behind him invisible contaminants poured into the open air the sun was setting in banks of orange cloud svetz lay where he had fallen retching fighting for air there was an outdoor carpet beneath him green and damp smelling of plants svetz did not recognize the smell did not at once realize that the carpet was alive he would not have cared at that point he knew only that the cages air system had tried to kill him the way he felt it had probably succeeded it had been a near thing he had been passing post atomic when the air went bad he remembered clutching the interrupter switch then waiting waiting the foul air stank in his nostrils and caught in his throat and tore at his larynx he had waited through twenty years feeling every second of them at post atomic he had pulled the interrupter switch and run choking from the cage pa at least he had reached industrial times he could breathe the air it was the horse he thought without surprise the horse had pushed its wickedly pointed horn through svetzs control panel three years ago maintenance was supposed to fix it they had fixed it something must have worn through the way he looked at me every time i passed his cage i always knew the horse would get me svetz thought he noticed the filter sac still in his hand not that hed be svetz sat up suddenly there was green all about him the damp green carpet beneath him was alive it grew from the black ground a rough twisted pillar thrust from the ground branched into an explosion of red and yellow papery things more of the crumpled colored paper lay about the pillars haw something that was not an aircraft moved erratically overhead a tiny thing that muttered and warbled living all of it a preindustrial wilderness svetz pulled the filter sac over his head and hurriedly smoothed the edges around his neck to form a seal blind luck that he hadnt fainted yet he waited for it to puff up around his head a selectively permeable membrane it would pass the right gasses in and out until the composition of the air waswas svetz was choking tearing at the sac he wadded it up and threw it sobbing first the air plant now the filter sac had someone wrecked them both the inertial calender too he was at least a hundred years previous to post atomic someone had tried to kill him svetz looked wildly about him uphill across a wide green carpet he saw an angular verticalsided formation painted in shades of faded green it had to be artificial there might be people there he could no he couldnt ask for help either who would believe him how could they help him anyway his only hope was the extension cage and his time must be very short the extension cage rested a few yards away the door a black circle on one curved side the other side seemed to fade away into nothing it was still attached to the rest of the time machine in pa along a direction eyes could not follow svetz hesitated near the door his only hope was to disable the air plant somehow hold his breath then the smell of contaminants was gone svetz sniffed at the air yes gone the air plant had exhausted itself drained its contaminants into the open air no need to wreck it now svetz was sick with relief he climbed in he remembered the wolf when he saw the filter sac torn and empty then he saw the intruder towering over him the coarse thick hair the yellow eyes glaring the taloned hands spread wide to kill the land was dark in the east a few stars showed though the west was still deep ml perfumes tinged the air a full moon was rising svetz staggered uphill bleeding the house on the hill was big and old big as a city block and two floors high it sprawled out in all directions as though a mad architect had built to a whim that changed moment by moment there were wrought iron railings on the upper windows and wrought iron handles on the screens on both floors all painted the same dusty shade of green the screens were wood painted a different shade of green they were closed across every window no light leaked through anywhere the door was built for someone twelve feet tall the knob was huge svetz used both hands and put all his weight into it and still would not turn he moaned he looked for the lens of a peeper camera and could not find it how would anyone know he was here he couldnt find a doorbell either perhaps there was nobody inside no telling what this building was it was far too big to be a family dwelling too spread out to be a hotel or apartment house might it be a warehouse or a factory making or storing what svetz looked back toward the extension cage dimly he caught the glow of the interior lights he also saw something moving on the living green that carpeted the hill pale forms more than one moving this way svetz pounded on the door with his fists nothing he noticed a golden metal thing very ornate high on the door he touched it pulled at it let it go it clanked he took it in both hands and slammed the knob against its base again and again rhythmic clanking sounds someone should hear it something zipped past his ear and hit the door hard svetz spun around eyes wild and dodged a rock the size of his fist the white shapes were nearer now bipeds walking hunched they looked too humanor not human enough the door opened she was young perhaps sixteen her skin was very pale and her hair and brows were pure white quite beautiful her garment covered her from neck to ankles but left her arms bare she seemed sleepy and angry as she pulled the door openmanually and it was heavy too then she saw svetz help me said svetz her eyes went wide her ears moved too she said something svetz had trouble interpreting for she spoke in ancient american what are you svetz couldnt blame her even in good condition his clothes would not fit the period but his blouse was ripped to the navel and so was his skin four vertical parallel lines of blood ran down his face and chest zeera had been coaching him in the american speech now he said carefully i am a traveler an animal a monster has taken my vehicle away from me evidently the sense came through you poor man what kind of animal like a man but hairy all over with a horrible faceand clawsclaws i see the mark they made i dont know how he got in i svetz shuddered no he couldnt tell her that it was insane utterly insane this conviction that svetzs wolf had become a bloodthirsty humanoid monster he only hit me once on the face i could get him out with a weapon i think have you a bazooka what a funny word i dont think so come inside did the trolls bother you she took his arm and pulled him in and shut the door trolls youre a strange person the girl said looking him over you look strange you smell strange you move strangely i did not know that there were people like you in the world you must come from very far away very said svetz he felt himself close to collapse he was safe at last safe inside but why were the hairs on the back of his neck trying to stand upright he said my name is svetz whats yours wrona she smiled up at him not afraid despite his strangeness and he must look strange to her for she surely looked strange to hanville svetz her skin was sheet white and her rich white hair would better have fit a centenarian her nose very broad and flat would have disfigured an ordinary girl somehow it fit wronas face well enough but her face was most odd and her ears were too large almost pointed and her eyes were too far apart and her grin stretched way back and svetz liked it her grin was curiosity and enjoyment and was not a bit too wide the firm pressure of her hand was friendly reassuring though her fingernails were uncomfortably long and sharp you should rest svetz she said my parents will not be up for another hour at least then they can decide how to help you come with me ill take you to a spare room he followed her through a room dominated by a great rectangular table and a double row of highbacked chairs there was a large microwave oven at one end and beside it a platter of red things roughly conical they were each about the size of a strong mans upper arm each with a dot of white in the big end svetz had no idea what they were but he didnt like their color they seemed to be bleeding oh wrona exclaimed i should have asked are you hungry svetz was suddenly have you dole yeast why i dont know the word are those dole yeast they are all we have wed better forget it svetzs stomach lurched at the thought of eating something that color even if it turned out to be a plant wrona was half supporting him by the time they reached the room it was rectangular and luxuriously large the bed was wide enough but only six inches off the floor and without coverings she helped him down to it theres a wash basin behind that door if you find the strength best you rest svetz in perhaps two hours i will call you svetz eased himself back the room seemed to rotate he heard her go out how strange she was how odd he must look to her a good thing she hadnt called anyone to tend him a doctor would notice the differences svetz had never dreamed that primitives would be so different from his own people during the thousand years between now and the present there must have been massive adaptation to changes in air and water to ddt and other compounds in foods to extinction of food plants and meat animals until only dole yeast was left to higher noise levels less room for exercise greater dependence on medicines well why shouldnt they be different it was a wonder humanity had survived at all wrona had not feared his strangeness nor cringed from the scratches on his face and chest she was only amused and interested she had helped him without asking too many questions he liked her for that he dozed pain from deep scratches stickiness in his clothes made his sleep restless there were nightmares something big and shadowy half man and half beast reached far out to slash his face over and over at some indeterminate time he woke completely already trying to identify a musky unfamiliar scent no use he looked about him at a strange room that seemed even stranger from floor level high ceiling one frosted globe no brighter than a full moon glowed so faintly that the room was all shadow wrought iron bars across the windows black night beyond a wonder hed wakened at all the preindustrial air should have killed him hours ago it had been a futz of a day he thought and he shied from the memory of the thing in the extension cage the snarling face pointed ears double row of pointed white teeth the clawed hand reaching out swiping down the nightmare conviction that a wolf had turned into that it could not be animals did not change shape like that something must have gotten in while svetz was fighting for air chased the wolf out or killed it but there were legends of such things werent there two and three thousand years old and more everywhere in the world were the tales of men who could become beasts svetz sat up pain gripped his chest then relaxed he stood up carefully and made his way to the bathroom the spiggots were not hard to solve svetz wet a cloth with warm water he watched himself in the mirror emerging from under the crusted blood a pale slender young man topped with thin blond hair and an odd distortion of chin and forehead that must be the mirror he decided primitive workmanship it might have been worse hadnt the first mirrors been twodimensional a shrill whistle sounded outside his door svetz went to look and found wrona good youre up she said father and uncle wrocky would like to see you svetz stepped into the hall and again noticed the elusive musky scent he followed wrona down the dark hallway like his room it was lit only by a single white frosted globe why would wronas people keep the house so dark they had electricity and why were they all sleeping at sunset with breakfast laid out and waiting wrona opened a door gestured him in svetz hesitated a step beyond the threshold the room was as dark as the hallway the musky scent was stronger here he jumped when a hand closed on his upper armit felt wrong there was hair on the palm the hard nails made a circlet of pressure pointsand a gravelly male voice boomed come in mister svetz my daughter tells me youre a traveler in need of help in the dim light svetz made out a man and a woman seated on backless chairs both had hair as white as wronas but the womans hair bore a broad black stripe a second man urged svetz toward another backless chair he too bore black markings a single black eyebrow a black crescent around one ear and wrona was just behind him svetz looked around at them all seeing how like they were how different from hanville svetz the fear rose up in him like a strong drug svetz was a xenophobe they were all alike rich white hair and eyebrows black markings narrow black fingernails the broad flat noses and the wide wide mouths the sharp while conical teeth the high pointed eait that moved yellow eyes hairy palms svetz dropped heavily onto the padded footstool one of the males noticed the larger one who was still standing it must be the heavier gravity he guessed its true isnt it svetz youre from another world obviously youre not quite a man you told wrona you were a traveler but you didnt say from how far away very far svetz said weakly from the future the smaller male was jolted the future youre a time traveler his voice became a snarl youre saying that we will evolve into something like you svetz cringed no really i hope not what then i think i must have gone sidewise in time youre descended from wolves arent you not apes wolves yes of course the seated male was looking him over now that he mentions it he does look much more like a troll than any man has a right to no offense intended svetz svetz surrounded by wolf men tried to relax and failed what is a troll wrona perched on the edge of his stool you must have seen them on the lawn we keep about thirty plains apes the smaller male supplied imported from africa sometime in the last century they make good watchbeasts and meat animals you have to be careful with them though they throw things introductions the other said suddenly excuse our manners svetz im flakee wrocky this is my brother flakee worrel and brenda his wife my niece you know pleased to meet you svetz said hollowly you say you slipped sideways in time i think so a futz of a long way too said svetz marooned gods protect me it must have been the horse wrocky broke in horse the horse three years ago a horse damaged my extension cage it was supposed to be fixed i suppose the repairs just wore through and the cage slipped sideways in time instead of forward into a world where wolves evolved instead of homo habilis gods know where im likely to wind up if i try to go back then he remembered at least you can help me there some kind of monster has taken over my extension cage extension cage the part of the time machine that does the moving youll help me evict the monster of course said worrel at the same time the other was saying i dont think so bear with me please worrel svetz it would be a disservice to you if we chased the monster out of your extension cage you would try to reach your own time would you not futz yes but you would only get more and more lost at least in our world you can eat the food and breathe the air yes we grow food plants for the trolls you can learn to eat them you dont understand i cant stay here im a xenophobe wrocky frowned his ears flicked forward enquiringly what im afraid of intelligent beings who arent human i cant help it its in my bones oh im sure youll get used to us svetz svetz looked from one male to the other it was obvious enough who was in charge wrockys voice was much louder and deeper than worrels he was bigger than the other man and his white fur fell about his neck in a mane like a lions worrel was making no attempt to assert himself as for the women neither had spoken a word since svetz entered the room wrocky was emphatically the boss and wrocky didnt want svetz to leave you dont understand svetz said desperately the air he stopped what about the air it should have killed me by now a dozen times over in fact why hasnt it odd enough that hed ever stopped wondering about that i must have adapted svetz said half to himself thats it the cage passed too close to this line of history my heredity changed my lungs adapted to preindustrial air puts it if hadnt pulled the interrupter switch id have adapted back then you can breathe our air said wrocky i still dont understand it dont you have any industries of course worrel said in surprise internal combustion cars and aircraft diesel trucks and ships chemical fertilizers insect repellents no none of that chemical fertilizers wash away ruin the water the only insect repellents i ever heard of smelled to high heaven they never got beyond the experimental stage most of our vehicles are battery powered there was a fad for internal combustion once said wrocky it didnt spread very far they stank the people inside didnt care of course because they were leaving the stink behind at its peak there were over two hundred cars tootling around the city of detroit poisoning the air then one night the citizenry rose in a pack and tore all the cars to pieces the owners too worrel said ive always thought that men have more sensitive noses than trolls wrona noticed my smell long before i noticed hers wrocky this is getting us nowhere ive got to go home i seem to have adapted to the air but there are other things foods ive never eaten anything but dole yeast everything else died out long ago bacteria wrocky shook his head anywhere you go svetz your broken time machine will only take you to more and more exotic environments there must be a thousand ways the world could end suppose you stepped out into one of them or just passed near one but here on the other paw you will be an honored guest think of all the things you can teach us you who were born into a culture that builds time traveling vehicles so that was it oh no you couldnt use what i know said svetz im no mechanic i couldnt show you how to do anything besides youd hate the side effects too much of past civilizations was built on petrochemicals and plastics burning plastics produces some of the strangest but even the most extensive oil reserves could not last forever you must have developed other power sources by your own time wrockys yellow eyes seemed to bore right through him controlled hydrogen fusion but i cant tell you how its done svetz cried desperately i know nothing of plasma physics plasma physics what are plasma physics using electromagnetic fields to manipulate ionized gasses you must have plasma physics no but im sure you can give us some valuable hints already we have fusion bombs and so do the europeans but we can discuss that later wrocky stood up his black nails made pressure points on svetzs arm think it over svetz oh and make yourself free of the house but dont go outside without an escort the trolls you know svetz left the room with his head whirling the wolves would not let him leave svetz im glad youre staying wrona chattered i like you im sure youll like it here let me show you the house down the length of the hallway one frosted globe burned dimly in the gloom like a full moon transported indoors nocturnal they were nocturnal wolves im a xenophobe he said i cant help it i was born that way oh youll learn to like us you like me a little already dont you svetz she reached up to scratch him behind the ear a thrill of pleasure ran through him unexpectedly sharp so that he half closed his eyes this way she said where are we going i thought id show you some trolls svetz are you really descended from trolls i cant believe it ill tell you when i see them said svetz he remembered the homo habilis in the vivarium it had been a man an advisor until the secretarygeneral ordered him regressed they went through the dining room and svetz saw unmistakable bones on the plates he shivered his forebears had eaten meat the trolls were brute animals here whatever they might be in svetzs worldbut svetz shuddered his thinking seemed turgid his head felt thick he had to get out of here if you think uncle wrockys tough you should meet the european ambassador said wrona perhaps you will does he come here sometimes wrona growled low in her throat i dont like him hes a different species svetz here it was the wolves that evolved into men at least thats what our teacher tells us in europe it was something else i dont think uncle wrocky will let me meet him or even tell him about me svetz rubbed at his eyes youre lucky herr dracula smiles a lot and says nasty things in a polite voice it takes you a minute tosvetz whats wrong svetz groaned like a man in agony my eyes he felt higher my forehead i dont have a forehead anymore i dont understand svetz felt his face with his fingertips his eyebrows were a caterpillar of hair on a thick solid ridge of bone from the brow ridge his forehead sloped back at fortyfive degrees and his chin his chin was gone too there was only a regular curve of jaw into neck im regressing im turning into a troll said svetz wrona if i turn into a troll will they eat me i dont know ill stop them svetz no take me down to the extension cage if youre not with me the trolls will kill me all right but svetz what about the monster he should be easier to handle by now itll be all right just take me there please all right svetz she took his hand and led him the mirror hadnt lied hed been changing even then adapting to this line of history first his lungs had lost their adaptation to normal air there had been no industrial age here but there had been no homo sapiens either wrona opened the door svetz sniffed at the night his sense f smell had become preternaturally acute he smelled the trolls jefore he saw them coming uphill toward him across the living green carpet svetzs fingers curled wishing for a weapon three of them they formed a ring around svetz and wrona one of them carried a length of white bone they all walked upright on two legs but they walked as if their feet hurt them they were as hairless as men apes heads mounted on mens bodies homo habilis the killer plains ape mans ancestor pay them no attention wrona said offhandedly they wont hurt us she started down the hill svetz followed closely he really shouldnt have that bone she called back we try to keep bones away from them they use them as weapons sometimes they hurt each other once one of them got hold of the iron handle for the lawn sprinkler and killed a gardener with it im not going to take it away from him that glaring light is that your extension cage yes im not sure about this svetz she stopped suddenly uncle vrockys right youll only get more lost here youll at least be taken care of no uncle wrocky was wrong see the dark side of the extension cage how it fades away to nothing its still attached to the rest of the time machine itll just reel me in oh no telling how long its been veering across the time lines maybe ever since that futzy horse poked his futzy horn through he controls nobody ever noticed before why should they nobody ever stopped a time machine halfway before svetz horses dont have horns mine does there was noise behind them wrona looked back into a darkless svetzs eyes could not pierce somebody must have noticed is come on svetz she pulled him toward the lighted cage they stopped just outside my head feels thick svetz mumbled my tongue too v what are we going to do about the monster cant hear anything no monster just a man with amnesia now he was only dangerous in the transition stage she looked in why youre right sir would you mindsvetz he doesnt seem to understand me sure not why should he he thinks hes a white arctic wolf svetz stepped inside the whitehaired wolf man was backed into a corner warily watching he looked a lot like wrona svetz became aware that he had picked up a tree branch his hand must have done it without telling his brain he circled holding the weapon ready an unreasoning rage built up and up in him invader the man had no business here in svetzs territory the wolf man backed away his slant eyes mad and frightened suddenly he was out the door and running the trolls close behind tour father can teach him maybe said svetz wrona was studying the controls how do you work it let me see im not sure i remember svetz rubbed at his drastically sloping forehead that one closes the door wrona pushed it the door closed shouldnt you be outside i want to come with you said wrona oh it was getting terribly difficult to think svetz looked over the control panel eeny meenythat one svetz pulled it free fall wrona yipped gravity came vectored radially outward from the center of the extension cage it pulled them against the walls when my lungs go back to normal ill probably go to sleep said svetz dont worry about it was there something else he ought to tell wrona he tried to remember oh yes you cant go home again said svetz wed never find this line of history again i want to stay with you said wrona all right within a deep recess in the bulk of the time machine a fog formed it congealed abruptlyand svebzs extension cage was back hours late the door popped open automatically but svetz didnt come out they had to pull him out by the shoulders out of air that smelled of beast and honeysuckle hell be all right in a minute get a filter tent over that other thing ra chen ordered he stood over svetz with his arms folded waiting svetz began breathing he opened his eyes all right said ra chen what happened svetz sat up let me think i went back to preindustrial america it was all snowed in i shot a wolf weve got it in a tent then what no the wolf left we chased him out svetzs eyes went wide wrona wrona lay on her side in the filter tent her fur was thick and rich white with black markings she was built something like a wolf but more compactly with a big head and a short muzzle and a tightly curled tail her eyes were closed she did not seem to be breathing svetz knelt help me get her out of there cant you tell the difference between a wolf and a dog no why would you bring back a dog svetz weve got dozens of dogs svetz wasnt listening he pulled away the filter tent and bent over wrona i think shes a dog more dog than wolf anyway people tend to domesticate each other shes adapted to our line of history and our brand of air svetz looked up at his boss sir well have to junk the old extension cage its been veering sideways in time have you been eating gunchy pills on the job ill tell you all about it wrona opened her eyes she looked about her in rising panic until she found svetz she looked up at him her golden eyes questioning ill take care of you dont worry svet told her he scratched her behind the ear his fingertips deep in soft fur to ka chen he said the vivarium doesnt need any more dogs she can stay with me are you crazy svetz you live with an animal you hate animals she saved my life i wont let anyone put her in a cage sure keep it live with it i dont suppose you plan to pay back the two million commercials she cost us i thought not ra chen made a disgusted sound all right lets have your report and keep that thing under control will you wrona raised her nose and sniffed at the air then she howled the sound echoed within the institute and heads turned in questioning and fear puzzled svetz imitated the gesture and understood the air was rich with petrochemicals and oxides of carbon and nitrogen and sulfur industrial air the air svetz had breathed all his life and svetz hated it death in a cage svetz was coming home his narrow arms were folded on his chest his back curved like a bow to fit him into the curvature of the extension cage he lay motionless in stoic endurance watching the inertial calendar gravity behaved oddly in an extension cage the pull was outward now as the cage moved into the future svetz could not have reached the controls without considerable effort they were overhead at the center of the spherical shell he did not need to reach them the bulk of the time machine was fixed in timespace at the institute for temporal research in post atomic it would simply reel him in the small armored thing hed captured was strapped to an opposite wall it had not moved since svetz shot it with an anaesthetic crystal the numbers on the inertial calendar rolled upward gravity jumped and shivered like a car on a bumpy road svetz lay on his back and tried to ignore what his belly and his inner ear were telling him in a couple of hours internal time hed be home something smoky began to obscure the control panel svetz sniffed the air was thick with oxides of nitrogen and sulfur carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride a mixture of industrial wastes that svetz had been breathing since the day he was born he sniffed and found nothing unusual but the haze was thickening it was not fanning out it hung before the control panel taking shape svetz rubbed his eyes it was still there a shape like a cloaked and hooded man distorting colors and outlines where they showed through a vague stickfigure hand moulded itself around a lever and pulled the interrupter circuit svetz sat up his head swam he tried to stand and overbalanced and fell rolling the apparition braced its smoky feet against the control panel heedless of the switches and dials its feet and ankles were terribly thin it pantomimed frantic effort but the lever marked emergency stop did not move the figure turned to svetz and screamed at him without sound svetz screamed back and threw his arms across his eyes that face when svetz dared look again the thing was gone svetz began to shake the inertial calendar read ghosts eh svetzs beefy redfaced boss scowled ferociously at least he was taking it seriously he might as easily have sent svetz off for a psychiatric examination thats all we need a haunted time machine well have you got any idea what really happened there must be something wrong with the time machine i think we ought to give up using it until we find out what you do yes sir come here a minute ra chen took svetzs arm and walked away with him he was twice svetzs mass his hand wrapped one and a half times around svetzs bicep he stopped them before the picture window that fronted the institute for temporal research spread below them the shops and houses and crooked streets of the city of capitol on the hill across the valley tremendous and daunting the complex of buildings that was the united nations palace ra chen pointed downhill there there was a gap in the cityscape a cluster of broken houses surrounded the broken corpse of a bird a bird the size of a fivestory building it had been there for two weeks now the stink reached them even here our worst failure to date i forebear to point out to you svetz that it was your idea to use regression treatments on an ostrich notice however that the futzy thing lies in full view of the palace well have to do something spectacular before the advisors forget that gaff and wed better do it soon yes sir were in bad odor at the palace svetz sir i think thats the roc ra chen glared were already missing one time machine he continued i had to yank it after we found out it was veering sidewise in time across probability lines the technical arm is still trying to find something wrong with it now you want me to yank the other one svetz could you have imagined thismanifestation ive asked myself that well no sir it was real even if i could see through it its just such a lousy time to lose both time machines appropriations come up in three months the vets were removing his armadillo from the extension cage svetz watched them erect a gauzy filter tent over it to protect it from the air of post atomic we ought to give up on funny animals said ra chen the secretarygeneral already has more extinct animals than he knows what to do with we ought to try something else yes sir but what ra chen didnt answer they watched as the medical team took clone samples from the armadillo then moved away with it it was awake but doing very little to prove it tomorrow it would be in the vivarium this ghost now ra chen said suddenly was it human or just humanoid itthere was something wrong with the face something dreadful but was it a man or an alien i couldnt tell after all it was thin as smoke it was wearing a robe i couldnt see anything but the face and handsand they were dreadfully thin it looked like a walking skeleton a skeleton huh maybe you were seeing through the flesh like a holo of a man in xray light that sounds right but why why would he be transparent funny i was just wondering the same thing dont be sarcastic svetz sorry sir weve both been assuming it was a sign of something wrong with the time machine what if it wasnt what if the thing was real svetz shook his head violently there are no such things as ghosts we thought that about rocs why not think how long the ghost legend has been around all over the world in burial customs folk tales all the great religions there are people who believe in ghosts even today not many i admit but sir its nonsense even if there were real ghosts whatever they are how would they get aboard an extension cage and what could we do about it capture it of course the secretarygeneral would love it he could even play with it it sounded harmless enough but just ugly as for how it got there how should i know i dont know anything about the theory of time travel it should be possible to duplicate the conditions you say its harmless i saw it i say it isnt we can look into that after weve got it svetz we need a coup were going after that ghost we me and i wont come said ra chen let us reason together gravity behaved oddly in an extension cage going backward in time the pull was inward toward svetzs navel its intensity fluctuated to no known laws i must be getting used to this svetz thought he found that ominous svetz hated time travel if he was getting used to the odd motion he had probably given up hope of changing careers at least he didnt get sick anymore how did he talk me into this the extension cage slowed gravity dwindled was gone came back pointing down the inertial calendar read ante atomic seven hundred years before the first nuclear explosion through the transparent hull of the extension cage svetz could see a thousand shades of dark green green in all directions a place of obscenely proliferating life it was the south american jungle where he had found the armadillo svetz donned a filter sac and waited for it to inflate around his head then he cut the air system and opened the vents to flood the extension cage with outside air the ghost had first appeared around pa if there was a ghost and if it came it would probably suffocate in industrial age air svetz took a sonic stun gun from its place on the wall subsonics were less material than anaesthetic crystals more likely to affect a ghost he told himself he pulled the gohome lever and that was that svetz had no controls only signals the controls were in the future with the bulk of the time machine in the institute building now the technicians began bringing him home they had readings from his last mission they could make his cage behave as it had then svetz had nothing to do but wait time travel still cost over a million commercials a shot if the cage simply brought him home now he was going to feel like an idiot but then so would ra chen he was passing post atomic when the haze began to form svetz stayed on his back but he raised the handgun it was clearer now more solid a dark voluminous cloak and hood showed behind the pale translucent outline of a human skeleton details were blurred mercifully perhaps because the thing was moving too fast screaming and pleading and gesticulating all without a sound it was frantic it begged svetz to stop the machine svetz fired the stun weapon he kept the stud down until his own head buzzed from the echoes the apparition screamed what must have been a string of curses and thereafter ignored him it wrapped the bones of its hands around the emergency stop braced the bones of its feet against the control panel and pulled the lever didnt move it was as if fog clung to the control panel svetz began to relax the thing was harmless he was willing to believe that it was manshaped though he could see no trace of the ghostly flesh that must surround the smoky bones perhaps he was watching some kind of probability phenomenon as if the ghostfigure marked where a man might be if there were another man aboard svetzs extension cage and its transparency was a measure of just how improbable that was svetzs head began to ache certainly he could not be expected to capture a probability phenomenon the ghost slowly faded then became clear it shifted its grip the white of bones gleamed faintly through dark cloak the ghost came solid in an instant it pulled the emergency stop down hard turned and leapt it was still a skeleton svetz screamed high and shrill turned and tried to burrow into the hull he felt the thing land on his back light and dry and hard he wailed again he was in fetal position now hugging his knees bony fingers tugged at his hand and he screamed and let go of the stun gun the fingers took it away for a long time nothing happened svetz waited for the end instead he heard slow footsteps clickings and a hollow grating voice that said all right thats enough of that roll over small bones prodded svetzs ribs he rolled over and opened his eyes it was as bad as hed thought worse the ghostfigure had turned solid but it was still no more than a mobile skeleton it stood now with its cloak flung back and a sonic stun gun in its finger bones its face was a skull far back in the black eye sockets eyes watched him steadily stop staring said the apparition it spoke speech it spoke svetzs language but the consonants came out mushy because the things skull was lipless it chuckled hollowly you can see me cant you it means youre going to die when people can see me its because theyre going to die no svetz whispered his legs were trying to push him back through the wall of the extension cage stop staring its not my fault im this way it was the radiation the apparition shifted uncomfortably whats your name ssvetz allow me to introduce myself i am doctor nathaniel reynolds the worlds first time traveler and ive decided to hijack your time machine svetz licked his lips i dont think so the first time traveler i beat him to it on another line of history of course a dead line my own fault have you ever heard of the cuban missile crisis the date was nineteen fiftyeight ad seventeen post atomic your dating no youre sure we called it the short war svetz shook his head doctor reynolds settled himself against the curved wall he held svetzs gun steadily on svetz he was not as much a skeleton as svetz had thought there was skin over the bones though the skin itself was the white of bleached bone in reynoldss neck there were trachea and gullet as well as the lumpy row of vertebrae the rib cage was something else again reynoldss ribs were naked bone behind the ribs was a narrow torso of flabby white flesh that pulsed like lungs torso and abdomen depended from the spine but daylight showed between the exoskeletal ribs the nose and ears were mere holes the pelvic bones were sharp as ax blades doctor reynolds was both hairless and sexless he said i dont talk well the only people who can see me and hear me are always about to die sometimes theyre too sick to concentrate sometimes too busy sometimes too scared am i dying reynolds chuckled well decide that between us what are you im a ghost my own fault but dont laugh it could happen to you svetz was not thinking of laughing let me tell you i was born about a century after the short war said doctor reynolds by then it was obvious the human race was dying too many countries had dropped too many bombs in the short war some were cobalt bombs there was still too much radiation around too many mutations mostly sick and mostly sterile not to mention disgusting i was one of the lucky ones svetz said nothing id have knocked your teeth out said the hollow voice i really was one of the lucky ones no brain damage no gonads but so what with all the radiation around i wouldnt have bred true anyway no organic damage that couldnt be fixed by available medicines i had to take the pills every day of course would you believe that i once had a pot belly svetz shook his head a very small pot belly i had to get rid of it it hurt my abdominal muscles couldnt carry the weight funny ive never picked up fat anywhere else just the belly and bones showing through the rest of me how did you get to be a ghost reynolds laughed a weak hollow sound deliberately and by dint of great effort there were thousands of us working on it there wasnt any question that we were doomed our best brains such as we were were working on time travel we called it project retake you know what a retake is doing a scene over for a sensory thats what we were after we werent sure the past could be changed even if we did have time travel but we had to try it we did it too the time machine was just big enough for me and the scrambler system they picked me because i only weigh about fifty pounds what did you do scrambled the guidance mechanisms of every guided missile in the union of soviet socialist republics a week before the cuban missile crisis they had to back down and move the missiles out of cuba by the time they got their missiles fixed the crisis was over and they still didnt know what had happened it must have made them cautious for a while afterward i monitored it all by radio i made sure nobody saw me of course my appearance is a bit right so afterward i tried to go home not to my own present but to the new one the one id created my time machine didnt work we saved a lot of weight by leaving the power source fixed in the future now it was gone i left the machine and went to give myself up and found out i was gone too well thats all over now said reynolds he hefted the stunner the bones of his hands were crossed by narrow strands of muscle his fingernails were long and ragged were going to put it back the way it was uh using your time machine mine wouldnt do it but yours will were going back to seventeen post atomic we cant ill kill you if we dont svetz believed him when nathaniel reynolds gave himself a name svetz had stopped seeing him as a supernatural horror but he was convinced that the bony physicist was mad he said you dont understand this isnt a time machine its only the extension cage the part that does the moving the technicians have to haul me back to the present before they can send me back again youre lying no reynolds there arent any controls herejust onoff pulses to tell the technicians which way to move me they can only move forward now i almost believe you reynolds mused but ill still kill you unless one of us thinks of something youre crazy youd have to be crazy to want your bombedout world back the skeleton clacked his teeth svetz saw the red of his mouth horribly incongruous in the white skull svetz you havent asked me how long ive been a ghost how long then theres no way to measure svetz im anchored to seventeen post atomic i wait i get eight months or so beyond the cuban missile crisis and then everything slows down and stops i think its been thousands of years more can you imagine anything more horrible its a frozen world people like statues pigeons nailed to the air im frozen too i dont get old i dont get hungry sunlight goes right through me see how white my skin is and i cant die im not real enough to die id have gone crazy long ago if it werent for the time machines reynoldsa eyes burned black within the pits of his skull the time machines i see them going and coming svetz some from your line of history some from others yours is the real future the future i made but i can ride the others too mostly i ride them into the past as far as theyll go that way time passes normally for me until seventeen post atomic rolls around again ive been through the middle ages a dozen times funny thing svetz im invisible to most people but anyone can see me if hes about to die maybe because hes about to leave time entirely it doesnt matter what line of history hes on or im on reynolds laughed i think some of them die because they see me heart failure svetz shuddered reynolds was probably right reynolds said not funny eh ive been in the future too dozens of futures svetz did you know that your time machines go sidewise in time we had one that did it was damaged they all do they wobble the selfpowered ones get lost the ones that are anchored to their own lines of history like yours they always get pulled back no matter how far they slip across alternate probabilities ive seen some strange futures svetz paradises alien invasions one where elephants were civilized ive been in your future reynolds said bitterly long enough to learn speech long enough to see what youve done to the world i made you what do you mean what do i mean everythings dirty everythings dead you killed off everything but yourselves and that gray sludge you eat dole yeast dole yeast i know a short word that would fit it better ive watched you ejecting that sludge from your mouths what i was going backward in time of course waiting to slide back to seventeen post atomic the fun goes out of that awfully fast i dont like hopping time machines into the future not unless i can get a ride back but i do it anyway theres always the chance a time machine will wobble across my own line of history then i could get off or even stop the machine and it paid off didnt it i dont understand you havent looked outside at all have you svetz for the first time svetz looked past reynolds the extension cage rested on a plain of cracked black glass nothing grew far in the distance was a line of svetz abruptly realized that it was a rim wall they were in something like a lunar crater this is your world thats right im home i cant say i like it much reynolds laughed his hollow grating laugh its cleaner than your world svetz if id known youd kill off everything on earth poison the land and the water and the air well never mind well fix that what do you mean all youve got to do is step outside youre home but it isnt real i need you to make it real this is the only time ive ever been able to affect a time machine youre my only chance svetz but i told you svetz this is a stun gun it cant hurt anyone but it can hold you still while i immobilize you after that well ive spent considerable time in medieval torture chambers wait wait what year did you leave from what was the date when you left to stop the short war ah twenty ninetytwo you wouldnt think to look at me that i was only twentytwo years old would you i havent aged since what date post atomic lets see one fortyseven the inertial calendar read all right you can hitch a ride on your own time machine it leaves thirteen years from now we cant move back in time but we can jump forward svetz reached for the gohome in the same instant his arm became dead meat dropping limply back to his side reynolds said but if we tried to go into the future wed likely slip sidewise wouldnt we and then the pattern of events would have been different and i wouldnt exist anymore would i so it was certainly worth a try thought svetz he said what are you going to do wait thirteen years if i have to reynolds clacked his teeth apparently it was his only expression it must make do for a smile a scowl a thoughtful look hah i can do better than that svetz can you get me to australia will this thing travel in space coordinates yes im going to change guns reynolds stood examined the equipment lining the curved wall selected a weapon a heavy needle gun it wouldnt kill an elephant maybe but theres anaesthetic enough in here to kill a man yah said svetz he felt very afraid and now well go australia the eastern coast was a cityscape of streets and oblong buildings its the only place on earth thats even marginally habitable said reynolds its mostly empty now and he directed svetz south along the coast he had not stopped talking during the entire flight he sprawled motionless as a laboratory exhibit the gun propped casually on one kneecap while he poured out a steady monologue of reminiscence of course i have a poor opinion of mankind he was saying in answer to one of his own questions why not if youd seen people under stress as often as i have in overcrowded hospitals in torture chambers on scaffolds and headsmans blocks on battlefieldsyoud know people take stress badly especially on battlefields now i may have a biased viewpoint i suppose i should spend more time at square dances and new years eve parties and palace balls places where people laugh a lot but svetz who would i talk to nobody can see me or hear me unless hes about to die and then they wont listen men bear suffering so badly and theyre so afraid to die ive tried to tell them how lucky they are to be able to buy eternal peace at the price of a few hours of agony ive talked to millions of men and women and children over tens of thousands of years the only ones who listen are the children sometimes svetz are you afraid of death yes idiot are you sure you know where were going oh well find it svetz dont worry were looking for the school a school what for youll see theres only one school svetz its far too big for the number of children you know sometimes the people i talk to seem to recognize me but then they always behave like idiots dont take me as if i had something to do with it ive had men offer me goldhow would i carry it and what the women offer me makes even less sense if theyd only use their own senses reynolds pointed there that wide parkland wide it was vast all green grass and the green heads of trees svetz was reminded of the jungle where hed found the armadillo but this greenery was neater and there were white buildings showing here and there thats the zoo that low building all the real animals are dead but we have mechanical mockups there the athletic field see the white lines on the grass veer right we want the lower grade schoolyard there were children in the schoolyard but not many and they werent playing much many were distorted their deformities ob vious even at this altitude one nineyearold was terribly thin he looked like a small ambulatory skeleton hold her steady said reynolds open the door no suddenly svetz understood open the door the bore of reynoldss gun looked straight into svetzs eyes svetz opened the door when reynolds turned to the door svetz jumped him his dead arm threw him off balance reynolds gun butt caught him under the jaw svetz fell back with lights exploding in his head when his head cleared reynolds was braced in the doorway svetz struggled to his knees reynolds fired into the playground svetz staggered toward him with his good hand outstretched reynolds fired again then he noticed svetz and brought the gun around svetz lurched forward to catch the muzzle reynolds fought madly to turn the gun he couldnt svetz weak as a kitten and ready to die was still too strong for him when reynolds suddenly kicked svetz under the jaw it was like being hit with foam plastic six feet tall and a fiftypound weakling svetz jerked the gun toward him out of reynoldss grip and threw it behind him reynolds staggered helplessly after it svetz reached out and took him by the neck if he closed his fist reynolds would be dead there was no muscle to protect his windpipe svetz looked down the skeleton boy was sprawled beside a green bench surrounded by boys and girls and small indeterminate beings he looked dead svetz wasted some time trying to think of something to do then he moved two levers with his foot gravity changed reynolds struggled furiously for a moment and then svetzs hand was empty something foggy seemed to be tugging at the emergency stop svetz watched it fade but then he got away with it said ra chen svetz shrugged i did my best to stop him you dont get it he killed himself he stopped himself from ever going back in time to stop the short war svetz nodded thenwe arent real the short war happened and reynoldss line of history happened and ours didnt so how can you be here at all the time machine pulled me home an extension cage cant get lost not if its anchored to its own present ra chens eyes were haunted but if reynolds aborted our past if we dont have a history anymore then metaphysics what if we arent real what if we never were real sir you feel real dont you so do i we can always tell ourselves that project retake went ahead without reynolds but or maybe the boy lived he had no hair and practically no scalp if reynolds shot him in the head the anaesthetic crystal would just ricochet off his skull right and knock him out urn i like that if the kid was dead at age nine reynolds would have disappeared right wrong futz it ra chen snarled if he made himself unreal he made you unreal too why shouldnt you go on seeing him come here a minute svetz pulled at ra chens arm without effect but after a moment ra chen followed him voluntarily beyond the glass wall that fronted the itr building half a dozen broken buildings surrounded the broken corpse of a bird the bird was several blocks long and several weeks dead now dont you have enough to worry about besides whether youre real or not futz yes weve got to do something about that roc said ra chen there it lies in full view of the united nations palace afterword svetz and the beanstalk this book derives from events of more than thirty years ago when i was still a novice i had an insight that delighted me time travel is fantasy but the only way to get fun out of it is to treat it as analogstyle science fiction keep it internally consistent lay out a set of rules and invite the reader to beat you to the consequences hanville svetz doesnt know that time travel is fantasy he was born deep into a future polluted to match the sorriest predictions of greenpeace most lifeforms are extinct by svetzs time to svetz the creatures of the past may be strange dangerous horrifying anything but surprising svetz has the scientists talent he can wrap a theory around what he finds rather than altering the evidence to fit a theory i dreamed up the flight of the horse one morning spent the afternoon outlining it and told it as a cocktail party story that night without losing any listeners you cant do that with every good story but when you can do that the story is ready i sold leviathan to playboy magazine its the only time ive ever managed that playboy was a joy to work with editorial work was minimalist all changes explicitly described and the money was good too i sent them bird in the hand too but they sent it back theres a wolf in my time machine was set in an altered version of the haunted house ride at disneyland the characters are alternatetimeline versions of the keeshond show dogs i grew up with time travel is fantasy and the universe of fantasy is large but after death in a cage i decided the joke was played out in the s carl sagan persuaded kip thorne a worldclass mathematician to design him a time machine for a science fiction novel tipler got interested in the challenge and other mathematicians joined in the time machines that emerged are solid science fiction if youll accept that the ringworld is that is they require exotic materials and construction techniques and the engineers need nearly godlike powers but give them these and all the laws of physics hold except what has never been proven the law of cause and effect these time machines look less like a delorian automobile than a freeway you cant ride on a freeway except where its been built that is we wont be seeing time travelers because the freeway hasnt been built in our time time travelers will already have godlike powers before they can travel in time unless we should chance to find somebodys abandoned freeway but in any era previous to the s time travel is fantasy worlds dont disappear on me a notion was kicking around in my head and on my computer disks once jerry pournelle talked me into switching from a typewriter for a quarter of a century i would occasionally stumble across beans my file of disorganized notes comparing jack and the beanstalk to the orbital tower invented by tsiolkovsky and later popularized in several stories including arthur clarkes the fountains of paradise i knew by then that i wouldnt ever lack for story ideas we are the masters of time as svetz says svetz and the beanstalk could wait in a leaflet from dangerous visions a bookstore in van nuys alerted me that terry pratchett and neal caiman would be in to autograph good omens that sounded like fun id barely discovered neil gaiman but already i would buy anything by terry pratchett i went to say hi his flight had been delayed by six hours we went back to my place i didnt know how that would work out but marilyn and i have one of the better art collections and i have some computer games or we could hike mulholland nah we started talking collaboration and spent our whole time that way i tossed in the notion of a beanstalk thats a plant we carved out a loose novel structure from there and ive got those notes around somewhere but ive never looked at them since we live eight time zones apart he admitted to a tendency to blitz to start writing and never quit these things might make a collaboration awkward unless i could get the jump on him hed wind up handing me completed text but we were both involved in other projects the beanstalk would wait my first published story set on mercury was obsolete before it hit print when the world was told the truth about venuss surface temperature i was just behind it with becalmed in hell the astrophysicists kept changing mars on me and i wrote a string of stories to keep up then i fell behind now its the nineties and every hard science fiction writer has written a mars story red green blue mars moving mars mars underground with competition like robinson greg bear william hartmann how was i going to find anything new to say if i wanted to write about mars i would need another approach then it all came together when a story is ready to be told i write i started svetz and the beanstalk on a portable computer aboard a cruise ship docked at ensenada mexico wed already seen the blowhole marilyn went off to shop i set up my laptop computer in the lounge that sells cappuccino and began writing i saw nothing impossible about writing two beanstalk stories the second with terry pratchett except that i never leave anything out it was my first insight as a writer never hold anything back from the reader it was basic to robert heinleins style too take one idea and explore every implication yggdrasil was one of terrys suggestions a lot of that sixhour conversation must have worked its way into the novel worried and embarrassed i emailed terry and told him what had happened his opinion matches mine ideas are cheap its the writing that makes them golden he tells me hes ready to write a beanstalk novel too but set on the diskworld its likely to follow wildly different physics then theres suzanne gibson i met her through her husband warren james who runs hour a local radio show on friday nights when i was deep into svetz and time travel and mars suzanne volunteered to do some of my research the chapter heads all came from her it seems as if every separate branch of humanity has its own tower to heaven i found some wonderful quotes from south america too but i lost them so this is my take on mars and yggdrasil and the space program what came before doesnt count we always build from now
