thief of always plays incarnations forms of heaven weave world clive barker introduction i remember a window in a farmhouse in north wales which had a sill of whitewashed stone so deep i could sit sideways in it at the age of six hugging my knees to my chin from that spying place i had a view of the orchard of apple trees behind the house the orchard seemed large to me at the time though in retrospect it probably contained less than twenty trees in the heat of the afternoon the farmyard cats having exerted themselves mousing went there to doze and i went to hunt through the unkempt grass for eggs laid by nomadic hens beyond the orchard was a low wall with an ancient mossy stile and beyond the wall an expanse of rolling meadow grazed by sheep with the sea a misty blue prospect i have little way of knowing how accurate these memories are almost forty years have passed since i was small enough to sit in that window niche the photographs my parents took of those distant summers are still pasted in the musty pages of their album but they are tiny black and white and often blurred there are its true a couple of pictures of the cats dozing but none of the orchard or the wall or the meadow and crone of the window where i sat perhaps it doesnt really matter how accurate my memories are all that matters is how powerfully they move me i still conjure that place in my dreams and when i wake i have the details clear in my head the smell of the nightlights my mother set on the dresser in my bedroom the dale beneath the trees the warmth and weight of an egg found in the grass and carried into the kitchen like unearthed treasure the dreams are all the evidence i need i was there once blissfully happy and though i cannot tell you how i believe i will be there again the farmhouse has long since disappeared the cats are dead the orchard uprooted but i will be there again if you are already familiar with the book in your hand you know the relevance of this sliver of autobiography weaveworld is a meditation on memory yes it also tells about magic and demagogery and angelic judgments but the central drama of the tale is the way the characters remember or fail to remember the glimpse theyve had of paradise this for instance of cal mooney our hero it was only when in the middle of a dreamy day something reminded him a scent a shout that he had been in another place and breathed its air and met its creatures it was only then that he realized how tentative his recall was the glories of the fugue were becoming mere words the reality of which he could no longer conjure when he thought of an orchard it was less and less that extraordinary place hed slept in and more a commonplace stand of apple trees surely dying was like this he thought losing things dear and unable to prevent their passing the novel is not primarily about the escape into eden its about how the knowledge of eden slips from us and the means we devise to hold on to that knowledge this is i think a universal experience which may go some way to explaining why the book continues to find readers i recently finished a sixweek publicity tour for a new novel and at booksignings across the country found readers bringing me battered but muchbeloved copies of weaveworld to be inscribed several times i heard people say the book had helped them through dark times in their personal lives there is nothing more gratifying to this author than to sign and personalize a book which has seen some action passed between friends dropped in the bath coffeestained and sunyellowed i have in my library copies of certain works melville poe blake that ive treasured over the years all much the worse for wear i know how close you can get to a book whose stains and creases are part of your shared history and what more perfect marriage of form and content than that a novel about memory like weaveworld should be valued because of the events that have marked it the book was published in the year in which the first hellraiser film was released but it represented a considerable departure from the transgressive horror fiction with which i had become identified there were plenty of critics ready to snipe at the change of direction opining that my imagination was too dark for the genre i was attempting to infiltrate and i was better off staying on the horror shelves but the response from readers including many who were devoted to the extremes of my earlier work was overwhelmingly positive the book sold solidly from the outset and has continued to do so in several languages ever since it has sparked off creative work in other media from readers who wanted to explore the story for themselves paintings poems musical compositions even an opera planned for production in paris i have come to believe that the darkness i imported into the work far from proving problematic is very much to the books purpose yes there are raptures in the novel and glorious deliriums but the fugue the magic haven of the book is threatened with total destruction and the powers that overshadow it are not tuppenny coloured terrors they are the obscenities of human cruelty and human despair tales of paradise lost are central to our culture of course we are all exiles from some place of bliss what is that place a memory of a preconscious state of perfect contentment where we believe ourselves whole because we have not yet comprehended the fact of our physical separation from our mothers or a religious conviction too deep in our selves to be subjected to the rigours of intellectual enquiry that knows our connection to the planet to animal life to the stars a faith is it or a glorious certainty it isnt necessary for a storyteller to have answers to the questions they pose of course only to be interested enough to ask them weaveworld is full of unrequited enquiries why does immacolatas hatred of the seerkind burn so intensely is the creature in the empty quarter an angel or not and if the garden of sand in which it has kept its psychotic vigil is not the eden of genesis then where did the seerkind arise from there are certainly answers to these mysteries to be wrought and written but they would i am certain only beg further questions which if answered would beg yet more for all its length and elaboration the novel does not attempt to fill in every gap in its invented history nothing ever begins its first line announces there are innumerable stories from which this fragment of narrative springs and there will be plenty to tell when its done though i get requests aplenty for a sequel i will never write one the tale isnt finished but ive told all i can that is not to say my attitude to the work does not continue to change in the past ten years ive gone through periods when i was thoroughly out of sorts with the book or even on occasion irritated that it found such favour with readers when other stories seemed more worthy and in the troughs of my discomfort i made what with hindsight seems to be dubious judgments about fantastic fiction as a whole i have been i think altogether disparaging about the escape elements of the genre emphasizing its powers to address social moral and even philosophical issues at the expense of celebrating its dreamier virtues i took this position out of a genuine desire to defend a fictional form i love from accusations of triviality and triteness but my zeal led me astray yes fantastic fiction can be intricately woven into the texture of our daily lives addressing important issues in fabulist form but it also serves to release us for a time from the definitions that confine our daily selves to unplug us from a world that wounds and disappoints us allowing us to venture into places of magic and transformation though of late my writing has concerned itself more and more with detailing that wounded disappointing reality as a reader i have rediscovered the pleasures of unrepentant escapism the short fiction of lord dunsany early yeats poems the paintings of samuel palmer and ernst fuchs the author who wrote weaveworld has however disappeared ive not lost faith with the enchantments of fantasy but there is a kind of easy sweetness in this book that would not at least presently come readily from my pen we go through seasons perhaps and weaveworld was written in a balmier time perhaps therell be another but its tender inventions seem very remote from the man writing these words maybe thats why when i sat down to work this morning i thought of that sill in north wales and the orchard and the wall and the meadow they too are remote yet like the copy of weaveworld that sits beside me on the desk they are here with me still part of my past and yet present that which is imagined need never be lost runs the epigram in the book of faerytales mimi laschenski leaves in her granddaughters keeping the book will become a repository before the story of weaveworld is told a place where vulnerable enchantments can take refuge so inner and outer books tales of faerie and of fugue collapse into a single idea the same precious idea that brings readers to bookstores with battered copies to be signed and me back to memories of a sill and an orchard to set before you its such a simple idea but it still seems to me miraculous that in words we may preserve ideas and images precious to us not only preserve them but pass them on to dream in isolation can be properly splendid to be sure but to dream in company seems to me infinitely preferable cb book one in the kingdom of the cuckoo part one wild blue yonder i for one know of no sweeter sight for a mans eyes than his own country homer the odyssey homing nothing ever begins there is no first moment no single word or place from which this or any other story springs the threads can always be traced back to some earlier tale and to the tales that preceded that though as the narrators voice recedes the connections will seem to grow more tenuous for each age will want the tale told as if it were of its own making thus the pagan will be sanctified the tragic become laughable great lovers will stoop to sentiment and demons dwindle to clockwork toys nothing is fixed in and out the shuttle goes fact and fiction mind and matter woven into patterns that may have only this in common that hidden amongst them is a filigree which will with time become a world it must be arbitrary then the place at which we chose to embark somewhere between a past half forgotten and a future as yet only glimpsed this place for instance this garden untended since the death of its protector three months ago and now running riot beneath a blindingly bright late august sky its fruits hanging unharvested its herbaceous borders coaxed to mutiny by a summer of torrential rain and sudden sweltering days this house identical to the hundreds of others in this street alone built with its back so close to the railway track that the passage of the slow train from liverpool to crewe rocks the china dogs on the diningroom sill and with this young man who now steps out of the back door and makes his way down the beleaguered path to a ramshackle hut from which there rises a welcoming chorus of coos and flutterings his name is calhoun mooney but hes universally known as cal he is twentysix and has worked for five years at an insurance firm in the city centre its a job he takes no pleasure in but escape from the city hes lived in all his life seems more unlikely than ever since the death of his mother all of which may account for the weary expression on his wellmade fare he approaches the door of the pigeon loft opens it and at that moment for want of a better this story takes wing cal had told his father several times that the wood at the bottom of the soft door was deteriorating it could only be a matter of time before the planks rotted completely giving the rats who lived and grew gross along the railway line access to the pigeons but brendan mooney had shown little or no interest in his racing birds since eileens death this despite or perhaps because the birds had been his abiding passion during her life how often had cal heard his mother complain that brendan spent more time with his precious pigeons that he did inside the house she would not have had that complaint to make now now cals father sat most of every day at the bade window staring out into the garden and watching the wilderness steadily take charge of his wifes handiwork as if he might find in the spectacle of dissolution some clue as to how his grief might be similarly erased there was little sign that he was learning much from his vigil however every day when cal came back to the house in chariot street a house hed thought to have left for good half a decade ago but which his fathers isolation had obliged him to return to it seemed he found brendan slightly smaller not hunched but somehow shrunken as though hed decided to present the smallest possible target to a world suddenly grown hostile murmuring a welcome to the forty or so birds in the loft cal stepped inside to be met with a scene of high agitation all but a few of the pigeons were flying back and forth in their cages near to hysteria had the rats been in cal wondered he cast around for any damage but there was no visible sign of what had fuelled this furore hed never seen them so excited for fully half a minute he stood in bewilderment watching their display the din of their wings making his head reel before deciding to step into the largest of the cages and claim the prize birds from the melee before they did themselves damage he unlatched the cage and had opened it no more than two or three inches when one of last years champions a normally sedate cock known as were they all by his number flew at the gap shocked by the speed of the birds approach cal let the door go and in the seconds between his fingers slipping from the latch and his retrieval of it was out damn you cal shouted cursing himself as much as the bird for hed left the door of the loft itself ajar and apparently careless of what harm he might do himself in his bid was making for the sky in the few moments it took cal to latch the cage again the bird was through the door and away cal went in stumbling pursuit but by the time he got back into the open air was already fluttering up above the garden at roof height he flew around in three ever larger circles as if orienting himself then he seemed to fix his objective and took off in a northeasterly direction a rapping drew cals attention and he looked down to see his father standing at the window mouthing something to him there was more animation on brendans harried fact than cal had seen in months the escape of the bird seemed to have temporarily roused him from his despondency moments later he was at the back door asking what had happened cal had no time for explanation its off he yelled then keeping his eye on the sky as he went he started down the path at the side of the house when he reached the front the bird was still in sight cal leapt the fence and crossed chariot street at a run determined to give chase it was he knew an all but hopeless pursuit with a tail wind a prime bird could reach a top speed of miles an hour and though had not raced for the best part of a year he could still easily outpace a human runner but he also knew he couldnt go back to his father without making some effort to track the escapee however futile at the bottom of the street he lost sight of his quarry behind the rooftops and so made a detour to the foot bridge that crossed the woolton road mounting the steps three and four at a time from the top he was rewarded with a good view of the city north towards woolton hill and off east and southeast over allerton towards hunts cross row upon row of council house roofs presented themselves shimmering in the fierce heat of the afternoon the herringbone rhythm of the dosepacked streets rapidly giving way to the industrial wastelands of speke cal could see the pigeon too though he was a rapidly diminishing dot it mattered little for from this elevation s destination was perfectly apparent less than two miles from the bridge the air was full of wheeling birds drawn to the spot no doubt by some concentration of food in the area every year brought at least one such day when the ant or gnat population suddenly boomed and the bird life of the city was united in its gluttony gulls up from the mud banks of the mersey flying tip to tip with thrush and jackdaw and starling all content to join the jamboree while the summer still warmed their backs this no doubt was the call had heard bored with his balanced diet of maize and maple peas tired of the pecking order of the loft and the predictability of each day the bird had wanted out wanted up and away a day of high life of food that had to be chased a little and tasted all the better for that of the companionship of wild things all this went through cals head in a vague sort of way while he watched the circling flocks it would be perfectly impossible he knew to locate an individual bird amongst these riotous thousands he would have to trust that would be content with his feast on the wing and when he was sated do as he was trained a do and come home nevertheless the sheer spectacle of so many birds exercised a peculiar fascination and crossing the bridge cal began to make his way towards the epicentre of this feathered cyclone ii the pursuers the woman at the window of the hanover hotel drew bade the grey curtain and looked own at the street below is it possible she murmured to the shadows that held court in the comer of the room there was no answer to her question forthcoming nor did there need to be unlikely as it seemed the trail had incontestably led here to this dogtired city lying bruised and neglected beside a river that had once borne stave ships and cotton ships and could now barely carry its own weight out to sea to liverpool such a place she said a minor dustdervish had whipped itself up in the street outside lifting antediluvian litter into the air why are you so surprised said the man who half lay and half sat on the bed pillows supporting his impressive frame hands linked behind his heavy head the face was wide the features upon it almost too expressive like those of an actor whod made a career of crowdpleasers and grown expert in cheap effects his mouth which knew a thousand variations of the simile found one that suited his leisurely mood and said theyve led us quite a dance but were almost there dont you feel it i do the woman glanced back at this man he had taken off the jacket that had been her last loving gift to him and thrown it over the back of the chair the shirt beneath was sweat sodden at the armpits and the flesh of his face looked waxen in the afternoon light despite all she felt for him and that was enough to make her tearful of computation he was only human and today after so much heat and travel he wore every one of his fiftytwo years plainly in the time they had been together pursuing the fugue she had lent him what strength she could as he in his turn had lent her his wit and his expertise in surviving this realm the kingdom of the cuckoo the families had always called it this wretched human world which she had endured for vengeances sake but very soon now the chase would be over shadwell the man on the bed would profit by what they were so very dose to finding and she seeing their quarry besmirched and sold into slavery would be revenged then she would leave the kingdom to its grimy ways and happily she turned her attentions back to the street shadwell was right they had been led a dance but the music would cease soon enough from where shadwell lay immacolatas silhouette was clear against the window not for the first time his thoughts turned to the problem of how he would sell this woman it was a purely academic exercise of course but one that pressed his skills to their limits he was by profession a salesman that had been his business since his early adolescence more than his business his genius he prided himself that there was nothing alive or dead he could not find a buyer for in his time he had been a raw sugar merchant a small arms salesman a seller of dolls dogs lifeinsurance salvation rags and lighting fixtures he had trafficked in lourdes water and hashish in chinese screens and patented cures for constipation amongst this parade of items there had of course been frauds and fakes aplenty but nothing nothing that he had not been able to foist upon the public sooner or later either by seduction or intimidation but she immacolata the not quite woman he had shared his every waking moment with these past many years she he knew would defy his talents as a salesman for one she was paradoxical and the buying public had little taste for that they wanted their merchandise shorn of ambiguity made simple and safe she was not safe oh certainly nor not with her terrible rage and her still more terrible alleluias nor was she simple beneath the incandescent beauty of her fare behind eyes that concealed centuries yet could be so immediate they drew blood beneath the deep olive skin the jewess skin there lay feelings that would blister the air if given vent she was too much herself to be sold he decided not for the first time and told himself to forget the exercise it was one he could never hope to master why should he torment himself with it immacolata turned away from the window arc you rested now she asked him it was you wanted to get out of the sun he reminded her im ready to start whenever you are though i havent a clue where we begin thats not so difficult immacolata said remember what my sister prophesied events are close to crisispoint as she spoke the shadows in the comer of the room stirred afresh and immacolatas two dead sisters showed their ethereal skirts shadwell had never been easy in their presence and they in their turn had always despised him but the old one the hag the beldam had skills as an oracle no doubt of that what she saw in the filth of her sister the magdalenes afterbirth was usually proved correct the fugue cant stay hidden much longer said immacolata as soon as its moved it creates vibrations it cant help itself so much life pressed into such a hideway and do you feel any of these vibrations said shadwell swinging his legs over the edge of the bed and standing up immacolata shook her head no not yet but we should be ready shadwell picked up his jacket and slipped it on the fining shimmered casting filaments of seduction across the room by their momentary brightness he caught sight of the magdalene and the hag the old woman covered her eyes against the spillage from the jacket fearful of its power the magdalena did not concern herself her lids had long ago been sewn closed over sockets blind from birth when the movements begin it may take an hour or two to pinpoint the location said immacolata an hour shadwell replied the pursuit that had finally led them here seemed today to have been a lifetime long i can wait an hour who moved the ground the birds did not stop their spiralling over the city as cal approached for every one that flew off another three or four joined the throng the phenomenon had not gone unnoticed people stood on the pavement and on doorsteps hands shading their eyes from the glare of the sky and stared heavenwards opinions were everywhere ventured as to the reason for this congregation cal didnt stop to offer his but threaded his way through the maze of streets on occasion having to double back and find a new route but by degrees getting closer to the hub and now as he approached it became apparent that his first theory had been incorrect the birds were not feeding there was no swooping nor squabbling over a sixlegged crumb nor any sign in the lower air of the insect life that might have attracted these numbers the birds were simply circling some of the smaller species sparrows and finches had tired of flying and now lined rooftops and fences leaving their larger brethren carrioncrows magpies gulls to occupy the heights there was no scarcity of pigeons here either the wild variety banking and wheeling in flocks of fifty or more their shadows rippling across the rooftops there were some domesticated birds too doubtless escapees like canaries and budgerigars birds called from their millet and their bells by whatever force had summoned the others for these birds being here was effectively suicide though their fellows were at present too excited by this ritual to take note of the pets in their midst they would not be so indifferent when the circling spell no longer bound them they would be cruel and quick theyd fall on the canaries and the budgerigars and peck out their eyes killing them for the crime of being tamed but for now the parliament was at peace it mounted the air higher ever higher busying the sky the pursuit of this spectacle had led cal to a part of the city hed seldom explored here the plain square houses of the council estates gave way to a forlorn and eerie nomansland where streets of oncefine threestorey terraced houses still stood inexplicably preserved from the bulldozer surrounded by areas levelled in expectation of a boomtime that had never come islands in a dust sea it was one of these streets rue street the sign read that seemed the point over which the flocks were focused there were more sizeable assemblies of exhausted birds here than in any of the adjacent streets they twittered and preened themselves on the eaves and chimney tops and television aerials cal scanned sky and roof alike making his way along rue street as he did so and there a thousand to one dance he caught sight of his bird a solitary pigeon dividing a cloud of sparrows years of watching the sky waiting for pigeons to return from races had given him an eagle eye he could recognize a particular bird by a dozen idiosyncrasies in its flight pattern he had found no doubt of it but event as he watched the bird disappeared behind the roofs of rue street he gave chase afresh finding a narrow alley whirl cut between the terraced houses half way along the road and let on to the larger alley that ran behind the row it had not been well kept piles of household refuse had been dumped along its length orphan dustbins overturned their contents scattered but twenty yards from where he stood there was work going on two removal men were manoeuvring an armchair out of the yard behind one of the houses while a third stared up at the birds several hundred were assembled on the yard walls and window sills and railings cal wandered along the alley scrutinizing this assembly for pigeons he found a dozen or more amongst the multitude but not the one he sought what dyou make of it he had come within ten yards of the removal men and one of them the idler was addressing the question to him i dont know he answered honestly maybe theyre goin to migrate said the younger of the two armchair carriers letting drop his half of the burden and staring up at the sky dont be an idiot shane said the other man a west indian his name gideon was emblazoned on the back of his overalls whyd they migrate in the middle of the fuckin summer too hot was the idlers reply thats what it is too fuckin hot its cookin their brains up there gideon had now put down his half of the armchair and was leaning against the back yard wall applying a flame to the halfspent cigarette hed fished from his top pocket wouldnt be bad would it he mused being a bird gettin yer end away all spring then fuckin off to the south of france as soon as yer get a chill on yer bollocks they dont live long said cal do they not said gideon drawing on his cigarette he shrugged short and sweet he said thatd suit me shane plucked at the halfdozen blond hairs of his wouldbe moustache yer know somethin about birds do yer he said to cal only pigeons race em do you once in a while me brotherinlaw keeps whippets said the third man the idler he looked at cal as though this coincidence verged on the miraculous and would now fuel hours of debate but all cal could think of to say was dogs thats right said the other man delighted that they were of one accord on the issue hes got five only one died pity said cal not really it was fuckin blind in one eye and couldnt see in the other the man guffawed at this observation which promptly brought the exchange to a dead halt cal turned his attention back to the birds and he grinned to see there on the upper windowledge of the house his bird i see him he said gideon followed his gaze whats that then my pigeon he escaped cal pointed there in the middle of the sill see him all three now looked worth something is he said the idler trust you bazo shane commented just asking bazo replied hes won prizes said cal with some pride he was keeping his eyes glued to but the pigeon showed no sign of wanting to fly just preened his wing feathers and once in a while turned a beady eye up to the sky stay there cal told the bird under his breath dont move then to gideon is it all right if i go in try and catch him help yourself the old girl who had the houses been carted off to hospital were taking the furniture to pay her bills cal ducked through into the yard negotiating the bricabrac the trio had dumped there and went into the house it was a shambles inside if the occupant had ever owned anything of substance it had long since been removed the few pictures still hanging were worthless the furniture was old but not old enough to have come back into fashion the rugs cushions and curtains so aged they were fit only for the incinerator the walls and ceilings were stained by many years accrual of smoke its source the candles that sat on every shelf and sill stalactites of yellowed wax depending from them he made his way through the warren of pokey dark rooms and into the hallway the scene was just as dispiriting here the brown linoleum tucked up and torn and everywhere the pervasive smell of must and dust and creeping rot she was well out of this squalid place cal thought wherever better off in hospital where at least the sheets were dry he began to climb the stairs it was a curious sensation ascending into the murk of the upper storey becoming blinder stair by stair with the sound of birds scurrying across the slates above his skull and beyond that the muted cries of gull and crow though it was no doubt selfdeception he seemed to hear their voices circling as though this very place were the centre of their attentions an image appeared in his head of a photograph from national geographical a study of stars taken with a slow release camera the pinpoint lights describing circles as they moved or appeared to move across the sky with the pole star the nail of heaven steady in their midst the wheeling sound and the picture it evoked began to dizzy him he suddenly felt weak even afraid this was no time for such frailties he chided himself he had to claim the bird before it flew off again he picked up his pace at the top of the stairs he manoeuvred past several items of bedroom furniture and opened one of the several doors that he was presented with the room he had chosen was adjacent to the one whose sill occupied sun streamed through the curtainless window the stale heat brought fresh sweat to his brow the room had been emptied of furniture the only souvenir of occupancy a calendar for the year on it a photograph of a lion beneath a tree its shaggy monolithic head laid on vast paws its gaze contemplative cal went out on to the landing again selected another door and was this time delivered into the right room there beyond the grimy glass was the pigeon now it was all a question of tactics he had to be careful not to startle the bird he approached the window cautiously n the sundrenched sill cocked its head and blinked its eyes but made no move cal held his breath and put his hand on the frame to haul the window up but there was no budging it a quick perusal showed why the frame had been sealed up years ago a dozen or more nails driven deep into the wood a primitive form of crime prevention but no doubt reassuring to an old woman living alone from the yard below he heard gideons voice peering down he could just sec the trio dragging a large rolledup carpet out of the house gideon giving orders in a ceaseless stream to my left bazo left dont you know which is your left im going left not your left yer idiot my left the bird on the sill was undisturbed by this commotion it seemed quite happy on its perch cal headed basic downstairs deciding as he went that the only option remaining was to climb up on to the yard wall and see if he couldnt coax the bird down from there he cursed himself for not having brought a pocketful of grain coos and sweet words would just have to do by the time he stepped out into the heat of the yard once more the removal men had successfully manhandled the carpet out of the house and were taking a rest after their exertions no luck said shane seeing cal emerge the window wont budge ill have to try from down here he caught a deprecating look from bazo youll never reach the bugger from here rite man said scratching the expanse of beergut that gleamed between tshirt and belt ill try from the wall said cal watch yerself gideon said thanks you could break yer back using pits in the crumbling mortar for foothold cal hauled himself up on to the eighttoot wall that divided this yard from its neighbour the sun was hot on his neck and the top of his head and thing of the giddiness hed experienced climbing the stairs returned he straddled the wall as though it were a horse until he got used to the height though the perch was the width of a brick and offered ample enough walking space heights and he had never been happy companions looks like its been a nice piece of handiwork said gideon in the yard below cal glanced own to see that the west indian was now on his haunches beside the carpet which hed rolled out far enough to expose an elaborately woven border bazo wandered over to where gideon crouched and scrutinized the property he was balding cal could see his hair scrupulously pasted down with oil to conceal the spot pity its not in better nick said shane hold yer horses said bazo lets have a better look cal returned his attention to the problem of standing upright at least the carpet would divert his audience for a few moments long enough he prayed for him to get to his feet there was no breath of wind here to alleviate the fury of the sun he could feel sweat trickle down his torso and glue his underwear to his buttocks gingerly he started to stand bringing one leg up into a kneeling position both hands dinging to the brick like grim death from below there were murmurs of approval as more of the carpet was exposed to light look at the work in that said gideon are you thinkin what im thinkin said bazo his voice lowered i dont know til you tell me came gideons reply what say we take it down to gilchrists we might get a price for this the chiefll know its gone shane protested keep it down said bazo quietly reminding his companions of cals presence in fad cal was far too concerned with his inept tightrope act to bother himself with their petty theft he had finally got the soles of both feet up on to the top of the wall and was about to try standing up in the yard the conversation went on take the far end shane lets have a look at the whole thing dyou think its persian havent a fuckin clue very slowly cal stood upright his arms extended at ninety degrees from his body feeling as stable as he was ever going to feel he chanced a quick look up at the window sill the bird was still there from below he heard the sound of the carpet being unrolled further the mens grunts punctuated with words of admiration ignoring their presence as best he could he took his first faltering step along the wall hey there he murmured to the escapee remember me took no notice cal advanced a second trembling step and a third his confidence growing he was getting the trick of this balancing business now come on down he coaxed a prosaic romeo the bird finally seemed to recognize his owners voice and cocked his head in cals direction here boy cal said tentatively raising his hand towards the window as he risked another step at that instant either his foot slipped or the brick gave way beneath his heel he heard himself loose a yell of alarm which panicked the birds lining the sill they were up and off their wingbeats ironic applause as he flailed on the wall his panicked gaze went first to his feet then to the yard below no not the yard that had disappeared it was the carpet he saw it had been entirely unrolled and it filled the yard from wall to wall what happened next occupied mere seconds but either his mind was lightning fast or the moments played truant for it seemed he had all the time he needed time to appreciate the startling intricacy of the design laid out beneath him an awesome proliferation of exquisitely executed detail age had bled brightness from the colours of the weave mellowing vermilion to rose and cobalt to a chalky blue and here and there the carpet had become threadbare but from where cal teetered the effect was still overwhelming every inch of the carpet was worked with motifs even the border brimmed with designs all subtly different from their neighbours the effect was not overbusy every detail was dear to cals feasting eyes in one place a dozen motifs congregated as if banded together in another they stood apart rival siblings some kept their station along the border others spilled into the main field as if eager to join the teeming throng there in the field itself ribbons of colour described arabesques across a background of sultry browns and greens forms that were pure abstraction bright jottings from some wild mans diary jostling with stylized flora and fauna but this complexity paled beside the centre piece of the carpet a huge medallion its colours as various as a summer garden into which a hundred subtle geometries had been cunningly woven so that the eye could read each pattern as flower or theorem order or turmoil and find each choice echoed somewhere in the grand design he saw all of this in one prodigious glance in his second the vision laid before him began to change from the comer of his eye he registered that the rest of the world the yard and the men whod occupied it the houses the wall hed been toppling from all were winking out of existence suddenly he was hanging in the air the carpet vaster by the moment beneath him its glorious configurations filling his head the design was shifting he saw the knots were restless trembling to slip themselves and the colours seemed to be merging into each other new forms springing from this marriage of dyes implausible as it seemed the carpet was coming to life a landscape or rather a confusion of landscapes thrown together in fabulous disarray was emerging from the warp and the weft was that not a mountain he could see below him pressing its head up through a cloud of colour and was that not a river and could he not hear its roar as it fell in white water torrents into a shadowed gorge there was a world below him and he was suddenly a bird a wingless bird hovering for a breathless instant on a balmy sweetscented wind sole witness to the miracle sleeping below there was more to claim his eye with every thump of his heart a lake with myriad islandsdotting its placid waters like breaching whales a dappled quilt of fields their grasses and grains swept by the same tides of air that kept him aloft velvet woodland seeping up the sleek flank of a hill on whose pinnacle a watchtower perched sun and cloudshadow drifting across its white walls there were other signs of habitation too though nothing of the people themselves a duster of dwellings hugging a river bend several houses beetling along the edge of a cliff tempting gravity and a town too laid out in a cityplanners nightmare half its streets hopelessly serpentine the other half culdesacs the same casual indifference to organization was evident everywhere he saw zones temperate and intemperate fruitful and barren were thrown together in defiance of all laws geological or climatic as if by a god whose taste was for contradiction how fine it would be to walk there he thought with so much variety pressed into so little space not knowing whether turning the next comer would bring ice or fire such complexity was beyond the wit of a cartographer to be there in that world would be to live a perpetual adventure and at the centre of this burgeoning province perhaps the most awesome sight of all a mass of slatecoloured cloud the innards of which were in perpetual spiralling motion the sight reminded him of the birds wheeling above the house in flue street an echo of this greater wheel at the thought of them and the place hed left behind he heard their voices and in that moment the wind that had swept up from the world below keeping him aloft faltered he felt the horror in his stomach first and then his bowels he was going to fail the tumult of the birds grew louder crowing their delight at his descent he the usurper of their element he who had snatched a glimpse of a miracle would now be dashed to death upon it he staved to yell but the speed of his fall stole the cry from his tongue the air roared in his ears and tore at his hair he tried to spread his arms to slow his descent but the attempt instead threw him head over heels and over again until he no longer knew earth from sky there was some mercy in this he dimly thought at least hed be blind to deaths proximity just tumbling and tumbling until the world went out he fell through a darkness unrelieved by stars the birds still loud in his ears and hit the ground hard it hurt and went on hurting which struck him as odd oblivion hed always assumed would be a painless condition and soundless too but there were voices say something one of them demanded if its only goodbye there was laughter now he opened his eyes a hairs breadth the sun was blindingly bright until gideons bulk eclipsed it have you broken anything the man wanted to know cal opened his eyes a fraction wider say something man he raised his head a few inches and looked about him he was lying in the yard on the carpet what happened you fell off the wall said shane must have missed your footing gideon suggested fell cal said pulling himself up into a sitting position he felt nauseous dont think youve done much damage said gideon a few scrapes thats all cal looked down at himself verifying the mans remark hed taken skin off his right arm from wrist to elbow and there was tenderness down his body where hed hit the ground but there were no sharp pains the only real harm was to his dignity and that was seldom fatal he got to his feet wincing eyes to the ground the weave was playing dumb there was no telltale tremor in the rows of knots no sign that hidden heights and depths were about to make themselves known nor was there any sign from the others that theyd seen anything miraculous to all intents and purposes the carpet beneath his feet was simply that a carpet he hobbled towards the yard gate offering a muttered thanks to gideon as he stepped out into the alley bazo said yer bird flew off cal gave a small shrug and went on his way what had he just experienced an hallucination brought on by too much sun or too little breakfast if so it had been startlingly real he looked up at the birds still circling overhead they sensed something untoward here too that was why theyd gathered either that or they and he were sharing the same delusion all in sum that he could be certain of was his bruising that and the fact that though he was standing no more than two miles from his fathers house in the city in which hed spent his entire life he felt as homesick as a lost child iv contact immacolata crossed the width of heatraddled pavement between thesteps of the hotel and the shaded interior of shadwells mercedes she suddenly let out a cry her hand went to her head the sunglasses she always wore in the kingdoms public places falling from her face shadwell was swiftly out of the car and opening the door but his passenger shook her head too bright she murmured and stumbled back through the swingdoors into the vestibule of the hotel it was deserted shadwell came in swift pursuit to find immacolata standing as far from the door as her legs would carry her the wraithsisters were guarding her their presences distressing the stale air but he couldnt prevent himself from snatching the opportunity in the guise of legitimate concern to reach and touch the woman such contact was anathema to her and a joy to him made more potent because she forbade it he was obliged therefore to exploit any occasion when he might pass such contact off as accidental the ghosts chilled his skin with their disapproval but immacolata was quite able to protect her inviolability she turned her eyes raging at his presumption he immediately removed his hand from her arm his fingers tingling he would count the minutes until he had a private moment in which to put them to his lips im sorry he said i was concerned a voice intervened the receptionist had emerged from his room a copy of sporting life in hand can i be of help he offered no no said shadwell the receptionists eyes were not on him however but on immacolata touch of heat stroke is it he said maybe said shadwell immacolata had moved to the bottom of the stairs out of the receptionists enquiring gaze thank you for your concern the receptionist made a face and returned to his armchair shadwell went to immacolata she had found the shadows or the shadows had found her what happened he said was it just the sun she didnt look at him but she deigned to speak i felt the fugue she said so softly he had to hold his breath to catch her words then something else he waited for further news from her but none came then as he was about to break the silence she said at the back of my throat she swallowed as if to dislodge some remembered bitterness the scourge the scourge had he heard her correctly either immacolata sensed his doubt or shared it for she said it was there shadwell and when she spoke even her extraordinary selfcontrol couldnt quite tame the flutter in her voice surely youre mistaken she made a tiny shake of her head its dead and gone he said her face could have been chiselled from stone only her lips moved and he longed for them despite the thoughts they shaped a power like that doesnt die she said it cant ever die it sleeps it waits what for why till the fugue wakes maybe she said her eyes had lost their gold become silvery motes of the menstruum turning like dust in a sunbeam dropped from her lashes and evaporated inches from his face hed never seen her like this before so close to exposing her feelings the spectacle of her vulnerability aroused him beyond words his prick was so hard it ached she was apparently dead to his arousal however or else chose to ignore it the magdalene the blind sister was not so indifferent she shadwell knew had an appetite for what a man might spill and horrid purposes to put it to even now he saw her form coagulating in a recess in the wall one hunger from scalp to sole i saw a wilderness immacolata said calling shawls attention from the magdalenes advances bright sun terrible sun the emptiest place on earth and thats where the scourge is now she nodded its sleeping i think its forgotten itself itll stay that way then wont it shadwell replied who the hells going to wake it his words failed to convince even himself look he said well find the fugue and sell it before the scourge can so much as roll over we havent come so far to stop now immacolata said nothing her eyes were still fixed on that nowhere shed sighted or tasted or both minutes earlier only very dimly did shadwell comprehend what forces were at work here finally he was only a cuckoo a human being and that limited his vision for which fact as now he was sometimes grateful one thing he did comprehend the fugue trailed legends in the years of their search hed heard it reported so many ways from cradlesong to deathbed confession and hed long ago given up attempting to sort fact from fiction all that mattered was that the many and the mighty longed for that place spoke of it in their prayers without knowing most of them that it was real or had been and what a profit he would turn when he had that dream on the block there had never been a sale its like or ever would be again they could not give up now not for fear of something lost in time and sleep it knows shadwell immacolata said even in its sleep it knows had he had the words to persuade her from her fear she would have been contemptuous of them instead he played the pragmatist the sooner we find the carpet and dispose of it the happier well all be he said the response seemed to stir her from the wilderness maybe in a while she replied her eyes flickering towards him for the first time since theyd stepped off the street maybe then well go looking all sign of the menstruum had abruptly vanished the moment of doubt had passed and the old certainty was back she would pursue the fugue to the end he knewas they had always planned no tumour even of the scourge would deflect her from her malice we may lose the trail if we dont hurry i doubt that she said well wait until the heat dies down ah so this was to be his punishment for that illconsidered touch it was his heat she made mocking reference to not that of the city outside he would be obliged to wait her pleasure as he had waited before and bear his stripes in silence not just because she alone could track the fugue by the rhythm of its woven life but because to wait another hour in her company bathing in the scent of her breath was an agony he would gladly endure for him it was a ritual of crime and punishment which would keep him hard for the rest of the day for her the power his desire lent her remained a diverting curiosity furnaces after all grew cold if left unstoked even stars went out after a millennium but the lust of cuckoos like so much else about that species defied all the rules the less it was fed the hotter it became v before the dark in all suzanna had probably met her maternal grandmother less than a dozen times even as a child before shed fully understood the words shed been taught that the old woman was not to be trusted though she could not remember ever hearing a reason offered as to why the mud had stuck however though in her early adulthood she was now she had learned to view her parents prejudices with a critical eye and come to suspect that whatever their anxiety regarding her grandmother it was likely to be perfectly irrational she could nevertheless not entirely forget the mythology that had grown up around mimi laschenski the very name was a stumbling block to the ear of a child it sounded more like a faerytale curse than a name and indeed there had been much about the woman that supported such a fiction suzanna remembered mimi as being small with skin that was always slightly jaundiced her black hair drawn back tightly from a face which she doubted capable of a smile perhaps mimi had reason for grief her first husband who had been some sort of circus performer had disappeared before the great war run away the family gossip went because mimi was such a harridan the second husband suzannas grandfather had died of lung cancer in his early forties smoked himself to death since then the old woman had lived in increasingly eccentric isolation alienated from her children and grand children alike in a house in liverpool a house to which at mimis enigmatic request suzanna was about to pay a longdelayed visit as she drove north she turned over her memories of mimi and of that house she recalled it being substantially larger than her parents place in bristol had been and darker a house that had not been painted since before the flood a stale house a house in mourning and the more she remembered the gloomier she became in the private storybook of her head this trip back to mimis was a return to the mire of childhood a reminder not of blissful careless years but of an anxious blinkered state from which adulthood had liberated her and liverpool had been that states metropolis a city of perpetual dusk where the air smelt of cold smoke and a colder river when she thought of it she was a child again and frightened of dreams of course shed shrugged off those fears years ago here she was at the wheel of her car perfect mistress of herself driving in the fast lane with the sun on her face what hold could those old anxieties have over her now yet as she drove she found herself drawing to her keepsakes from her present life like talismans to keep that city at bay she thought of the studio shed left behind in london and the pots shed left to be glazed and fired when in just a little while she got back she remembered finnegan and the flirtatious dinner shed had with him two nights ago she thought of her friends robust and articulate people any of a dozen of whom shed trust her fife and sanity to with so such clarity to arm her she could surely retread the paths of her childhood and remain untainted she travelled a broader brighter highway now the memories were still potent some like her picturing of mimi and the house were images shed recalled before one in particular however emerged item some hidden niche in her head unvisited since the day shed sealed it up there the episode didnt come as many had piece by piece it flashed before her all at once in astonishing particularity she was six they were in mimis house she and her mother and it was november wasnt it always drear and cold theyd come on one of their rare visits to granma a duty which father had always been spared she saw mimi now sitting in an armchair near to a fire that barely warmed the soot in the grate her fare soared and sad to the brink of tragedy was pale with powder the brows meticulously plucked the eyes glittering even in the dour tight through the lace curtains she spoke and her soft syllables drowned out the din of the motorway suzanna addressed from the past she listened ive something for you the childs heart had fallen from its place and thumped around in her belly say thank you suzie her mother chided the child did as she was told its upstairs mimi said in my bedroom you can go and get it for yourself cant you its all wrapped up at the bottom of the tallboy go on suzie she felt her mothers hand on her arm pushing her away towards the door hurry up now she glanced at her mother then back at mimi there was no mercy to be had from either they would have her up those stairs and no protest would mellow them she left the room and went to the bottom of the stairs they were a mountainface before her and the darkness at the summit a terror she tried not to contemplate in any other house she would not have been so fearful but this was mimis house mimis darkness she climbed her hand clinging to the bannister certain that something terrible awaited her on every stair but she reached the top without being devoured and crossed the landing to her grandmothers bedroom the drapes were barely parted what little light fell between was the colour of old stone a clock ticked on the mantelpiece at a quarter the speed of her pulse on the wall above the clock gazing down the length of the headhigh bed was an oval portrait photograph of a man in a suit that was buttoned up to the neck and to the left of the mantelpiece across a carpet that killed her footsteps was the tallboy twice her size and more she went to it quickly determined now that she was in the room to do the deed and be out before the ticking had its way with her and slowed her heart til it stopped reaching up she turned the chilly handle the door opened a little from inside bloomed the smell of mothballs shoe leather and lavender water ignoring the gowns that hung in the shadows she plunged her hand amongst the boxes and tissue paper at the bottom of the tallboy hoping to chance upon the present in her haste she pushed the door wide and something wildeyed lurched out of the darkness towards her she screamed it mocked her screaming back in her face then she was running towards the door tripping on the carpet in her flight before hurtling downstairs her mother was in the hallway what is it suzie there were no words to tell instead she threw herself into her mothers arms though as ever there was that moment when they seemed to hesitate before chasing to hold her and sobbed that she wanted to go home nor would she be placated even after mimi had gone upstairs and returned saying something about the mirror in the tallboy door theyd left the house soon after that and as far as she could now recall suzanna had never since entered mimis bedroom as for the gift it had not been mentioned again that was the bare bones of the memory but there was much else perfumes sounds nuances of light that fleshed those bones the incident once exhumed had more authority than events both more recent and ostensibly more significant she could not now conjure nor would ever she suspected the face of the boy to whom shed given her virginity but she would remember the smell from mimis tallboy as though it were still in her lungs memory was so strange and stranger still the letter at the beck of which she was making this journey it was the first missive shed received from her grandmother for over a decade that fact alone would have been sufficient to have her foresake the studio and come but the message itself spindly scrawlings on an airmail paper page had lent her further speed shed left london as soon as the summons had arrived as if shed known and loved the woman whod written it for half a hundred years suzanna it had begun not dear nor dearest simply suzanna forgive my scribbles im sick at the moment i feel weak some hours and not so weak others who knows how ill feel tomorrow thats why im writing to you now suzanna because im afraid of what may happen will you come to see me at the house we have very much to say to each other i think things i didnt want to say but now i have to none of this will make much sense to you i know that i cant be plain not in a letter there are good reasons please come things are different to the way i thought theyd be we can talk the way we should have talked many years ago my love to you suzanna mimi the letter was like a midsummer lake its surface placid but beneath such darkness things are different to the way i thought theyd be mimi had written what did she mean that life was over too soon and her sunlit youth had contained no clue as to how bitter mortality would be the letter had been delayed through the vagaries of the postal service by over a week when upon getting it shed rung mimis house shed received only the number disconnected tone leaving the pots she was making unfinished she had packed a bag and driven north she went straight to rue street but number eighteen was empty sixteen was also deserted but at the next house a grid woman by the name of violet pumphrey was able to offer some explanation mimi had fallen sick a few days earlier and was now in sefton general hospital close to death her creditors which included the gas and electricity boards and the council in addition to a dozen suppliers of food and drink had immediately made moves to claim some recompense like vultures they were said mrs pumphrey and her not even dead yet its shameful there they were taking everything they could lay their hands on mind you she was difficult hope you dont mind my being plain love but she was kept herself hidden away in the house most of the time it was a bloody fortress thats why they waited see til she was peggin out if theyd tried to get in with her there theyd have still been tryin had they taken the tallboy suzanna idly wondered thanking mrs pumphrey for her help she went back to have another look at number eighteen its roof so covered in birdshit it looked to have had its own private blizzard then went on to the hospital the nurse wore her show of compassion indifferently well im afraid mrs laschenskis very sick are you a close relative im her granddaughter has anybody else been to see her not that i know of there really isnt that much point shes had a major stroke miss parrish suzanna parrish your grandmothers unconscious most of the time im afraid i see so please dont expect too much the nurse led her down a short corridor to a room that was so quiet suzanna could have heard a petal drop but that there were no flowers she wasnt unfamiliar with death rooms ha mother and father had died three years before within six months of each other she recognised the scent and the hush as soon as she stepped inside shes not been awake today said the nurse as she stood back to let minds visitor approach the bed suzannas first thought was that thered been some colossal error this couldnt be mimi this poor woman was too frail too white the objection was on the tip of her tongue when she realized that the error was hers though the hair of the woman in the bed was so thin that her scalp gleamed through and the skin of her fare was draped slackly on her skull like wet muslin this was nevertheless mini robbed of power reduced by some malfunction of nerve and muscle to this unwelcome passivity but still mimi tears rose in suzanna seeing her grandmother tacked up like a child except that she was sleeping not in preparation for a new day but for endless night she had been so fierce this woman and so resolute now all that strength had gone and forever shall i leave you alone a while said the nurse and without waiting for a reply withdrew suzanna put her hand to her brow to keep the tears at bay when she looked again the old womans blueveined lids were flickering open for a moment it seemed mimis eyes had focused somewhere beyond suzanna then the gaze sharpened and the look that found suzanna was as compelling as she had remembered it mimi opened her mouth her lips were feverdried she passed her tongue across them to little effect utterly unnerved suzanna approached the bedside hello she said softly its me its suzanna the old womans eyes locked with suzannas i know who you are the stare said would you like some water a tiny frown nicked mimis brow water suzanna repeated and again the tiniest of frowns by way of reply they understood each other suzanna poured an inch of water from the plastic jug on the bedside table into a plastic glass and took the glass to mimis lips as she did so the old woman lifted her hand a fraction from the crisp sheet and brushed suzannas arm the touch was featherlight but it sent such a jolt through suzanna that she almost dropped the glass mimis breath had suddenly become uneven and there were tics and twitches around her eyes and mouth as she struggled to shape a word her eyes blazed with frustration but the most she could produce was a grunt in her threat its all right said suzanna the look on the parchment face refused such platitudes no the eyes said it isnt all right its very far from all right death is waiting at the door and i cant even speak the feelings i have what is it suzanna whispered bending closer to the pillow the old womans fingers still trembled against her arm her skin tingled at the contact her stomach churned how can i help you she said it was the vaguest of questions but she was shooting in the dark mimis ryes flickered dosed for an instant and the frown deepened she had given up trying to make words apparently perhaps she had given up entirely and then with a suddenness that made suzanna cry out the fingers that rested on her arm slid around her wrist the grip tightened til it hurt she might have pulled herself tree but she had no time a subtle marriage of scents was filling her head dust and tissuepaper and lavender the tallboy of course it was the perfume from the tallboy and with that recognition another certainty that mimi was somehow reaching into suzannas head and putting the perfume there there was an instant of panic the animal in her responding to this defeat of her minds autonomy then the panic broke before a vision of what she wasnt certain a pattern of some kind a which melted and reconfigured itself over and over again perhaps there was colour in the design but it was so subtle she could not be certain subtle too the shapes evolving in the kaleidoscope this like the perfume was mimis doing though reason protested suzanna couldnt doubt the truth of that this image was somehow of vital significance to the old lady that was why she was using the last drops of her wills resources to have suzanna share the sight in her minds eye but she had no chance to investigate the vision behind her the nurse said oh my god the voice broke mimis spell and the patterns burst into a storm of petals disappearing suzanna was left staring down at mimis fare their gazes momentarily locking before the old woman lost all control of her wracked body the hand dropped from suzannas wrist the eyes began to rove back and forth grotesquely dark spittle ran from the side of her mouth youd better wait outside the nurse said crossing to press the call button beside the bed suzanna backed off towards the door distressed by the choking sounds her grandmother was making a second nurse had appeared call doctor chai the first said then to suzanna please will you wait outside she did as she was told there was nothing she could do inside but hamper the experts the corridor was busy she had to walk twenty yards from the door of mimis room before she found somewhere she could take hold of herself her thoughts were like blind runners they rushed back and forth wildly but went nowhere time and again she found memory taking her to mimis bedroom in rue street the tallboy looming before her like some reproachful ghost what had granma wanted to tell her with the scent of lavender and how had she managed the extraordinary test of passing thoughts between them was it something shed always been capable of it so what other powers did she own are you suzanna parrish here at least was a question she could answer yes im doctor chai the face before her was round as a biscuit and as bland your grandmother mrs laschenski yes theres been a serious deterioration in her condition are you her only relative the only one in this country my mother and father are dead she has a son in canada do you have any way of contacting him dont have his telephone number with me but i could get it i think he should be informed said chai yes of course said suzanna what should i i mean can you tell me how long shes going to live the doctor sighed anybodys guess he said when she came in i didnt think shed last the night but she did and the next and the next shes just kept holding on her tenacitys really remarkable he halted looking straight at suzanna my belief is she was waiting for you for me i think so your names the only coherent word shes spoken since shes been here i dont think she was going to let go until youd come i sec said suzanna you must be very important to her he replied its good youve seen her so many of the old folks you know die in here and nobody ever seems to care where are you staying i hadnt thought a hotel i suppose perhaps youd give us a number to contact you at should the necessity arise of course so saying he nodded and left her to the runners they were no less blind for the conversation mimi laschenski did not love her as the doctor had claimed how could she she knew nothing of the way her grandchild had grown up they were like closed books to each other and yet something in what chai had said rang true perhaps she had been waiting fighting the good fight until her daughters daughter came to her bedside and why to hold her hand and expend her last ounce of energy giving suzanna a fragment of some tapestry it was a pretty gift but it signified either too much or too little whichever suzanna did not comprehend it she went back to room five the nurse was in attendance the old lady still as stone on her pillow eyes closed hands laid by her side suzanna stared down at the face slack once more it could tell her nothing she took hold of mimis hand and held it for a few moments tight then went on her way she would go back to rue street she decided and see if being in the house jogged a memory or two shed spent so much time forgetting her childhood putting it where it couldnt tail the bluff of hardwon maturity and now with the boxes sealed what did she find a mystery that defied her adult self and coaxed her back into the pass fn search of a solution she remembered the face in the tallboy mirror that had sent her robbing down the stairs was it waiting still and was it still her own vi mad mooney cal was frightened as he had never been frightened in his life before he sat in his room the door locked and shook the shaking had begun a few minutes after events at rue street almost twentyfour hours ago now and it hadnt shown much sign of stopping since sometimes it made his hands tremble so much he could hardly hold the glass of whisky hed nursed through an all but sleepless night other times it made his teeth chatter but most of the shaking didnt go on outside it was in it was as if the pigeons had got into his belly somehow and were flapping their wings against his innards and all because hed seen something wonderful and he knew in his bones that his life would never be the same again how could it hed climbed the sky and looked down on the secret place that hed been waiting since childhood to find hed always been a solitary child as much through choice as circumstance happiest when he could unshackle his imagination and let it wander it took little to get such journeys started looking back it seemed hed spent half his school days gazing out of the window transported by a line of poetry whose meaning he couldnt quite unearth or the sound of someone singing in a distant classroom into a world more pungent and more remote than the one he knew a world whose scents were carried to his nostrils by winds mysteriously warm in a chill december whose creatures paid him homage on certain nights at the foot of his bed and whose peoples he conspired with in sleep but despite the familiarity of this place the comfort he felt there its precise nature and location remained elusive and though hed read every book he could find that promised some rare territory he always came away disappointed they were too perfect those childhood kingdoms all honey and summer the true wonderland was not like that he knew it was as much shadow as sunlight and its mysteries could only be unveiled when your wits were about used up and your mind dose to cracking that was why he trembled now for that was how he felt like a man whose head was about to split hed woken early gone downstairs and cooked himself a fried egg and bacon sandwich then sat with the ruins of his gluttony until he heard his father stirring above he quickly called the firm and told wilcox that he was sick and wouldnt be in work today he told the same to brendan who was about his morning ablutions and with the door located couldnt see the ashen anxious face his son was wearing this morning then these duties done he went back to his room and sat on his bed to examine the events at rue street afresh hoping that the nature of yesterdays mysteries could eventually be made to come dear it did little good whichever way he turned events they seemed impervious to rational explanation and he was left only with the same razorsharp memory of the experience and the ache of longing that came with it everything hed ever wanted had been in that land he knew it everything his education had taught him to disbelieve all miracles all mystery all blue shadow and sweetbreathed spirits all the pigeon knew all the wind knew all the human world had once grasped and now forgotten all of it was waiting in that place hed seen it with his own eyes which probably made him insane haw else could he explain an hallucination of such precision and complexity no he was insane and why not he had lunacy in his blood his fathers father mad mooney ended his life crazy as a coot the man had been a poet according to brendan though tales of his life and times had been forbidden in chariot street hush your nonsense eileen had always said whenever brendan mentioned the man though whether this taboo was against poetry delirium or the irish cal had never decided whichever it was an edict his father had often broken when his wifes back was turned for brendan was fond of mad mooney and his verses cal had even learned a few at his fathers knee and now here he was carrying on that family tradition seeing visions and crying into his whisky the question was to tell or not to tell to speak what hed seen and endure the laughter and the sly looks or to keep it hidden part of him badly wanted to talk to spill everything to somebody brendan even and see what they made of it but another part said be quiet be careful wonderland doesnt come to those who blab about it only to those who keep their silence and wait so thats what he did he sat and shook and waited wonderland didnt turn up but geraldine did and she was in no mood for lunatics cal heard her voice in the hall below heard brendan telling her that cal was ill and didnt want to be disturbed heard her tell brendan that she intended to see cal whether he was sick or not then she was at the door she tried the handle found the door locked and rapped on it cal its me wake up he feigned wariness aided by a tongue now well whiskysodden who is it he said whys the door locked its me geraldine im not feeling too good let me in cal he knew better than to argue with her in such a mood he shambled to the door and turned the key you look terrible she said her voice mellowing as sow as she set eyes on him whats wrong with you im all right he protested really just had a fall why didnt you ring me i was expecting you at the wedding rehearsal last night had you forgotten the following saturday geraldines elder sister teresa wan to marry the love of her life a good catholic boy whose fertility could scarcely be in question has beloved was four months pregnant her swelling belly was not being allowed to overshadow proceedings however the wedding was to be a grand affair cal whod been courting geraldine for two years was a valued guest given the general expectation that hed be the next to exchange vows with one of norman kellaways four daughters doubtless his missing the rehearsal had been viewed as minor heresy i did remind you cal geraldine said you know how important it is to me i had a bit of trouble he told her i fell off a wall she looked incredulous what were you doing climbing on a wall she said as though at his age he should be well beyond such indignities he told her briefly about the escape of and the chase to rue street it was a bowdlerized account of course in it there was no mention of the carpet or what hed seen there did you find the bird she asked when hed finished recounting the chase in a manner of speaking he told her in fact hed come home to chariot street only to be told by brendan that had flown back to the loft in the late afternoon and was now back beside his speckled wife this he told geraldine so you missed the rehearsal looking for a pigeon that came home anyway she said he nodded but you know how dad loves his birds the mention of brendan softened geraldine further still she and cals father had been fast friends since cal had first introduced them she sparkles his father had told cal hold on to her because if you dont somebody else will eileen had never been so certain shed always been cool with geraldine a tact which had only made brendans praise more lavish the smile she offered now was gently indulgent though cal had been loath to let her in and have her spot his reverie he was suddenly grateful for her company he even felt the shaking fade a little its stale in here she said you need some fresh air why dont you open the window he did as she suggested when he turned round she was sitting crosslegged on the bed her back to the collage of pictures hed put up there in his youth and which his parents had never removed the wailing wall geraldine called it it had always upset her with its parade of movie stars and mushroom clouds politicians and pigs the dress is beautiful she said he puzzled over the remark a moment his mind sluggish teresas dress she prompted oh come and sit down cal he lingered by the window the air was balmy and clean it reminded him whats wrong she said the words were on the tip of his tongue i saw wonderland he wanted to say that was it in sum the rest the circumstances the description those details were niceties the three essential words were easy enough werent they i saw wonderland and it there was anybody in his life to whom he should say them it was this woman tell me cal she said are you ill he shook his head i saw he began she looked at him with plain puzzlement what she said what did you sec i saw he began again and again faltered his tongue refused the instruction he gave it the words simply wouldnt come he looked away from her face at the wailing wall the pictures he said finally theyre an eyesore a strange euphoria swept over him as he sailed so close to telling then away the part of him that wanted what hed seen kept secret had in that moment won the battle and perhaps even the war he could not tell her not now not ever it was a great relief to have made up his mind im mad mooney he thought to himself it wasnt such a bad idea at that youre looking better already she said it must be the fresh air and what lessons could he learn from the mad poet now that they were fellow spirits what would mad mooney do were he in cals shoes hed play whatever game was necessary came the answer and then when the world turned its back hed search search until he found the place hed seen and not care that in doing so he was inviting delirium hed find his dream and hold onto it and never let it go they talked a little while longer until geraldine announced that she had to leave there was wedding business to do that afternoon no more pigeonchasing she said to cal i want you there on saturday she put her arms around him youre too thin she said im going to have to feed you up she expects to be kissed now the mad poet whispered in his car oblige the lady we dont want her to think youve lost interest in copulation just because youve been half way to heaven and back kiss her and say something fetching the kiss cal could deliver though he was afraid the fact that his passion was prompted would show he neednt home feared she returned his fake fervour with the genuine article her body warm and tight against his thats it said the poet now find something seductive to say and send her off happy here cals confidence faltered he had no skill with sweettalk nor ever had see you saturday was all he could muster she seemed content with that she kissed him again and took her leave he watched her from the window counting her steps until she turned the corner then with his lover out of sight he went in search of his hearts desire part two births deaths and marriages the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed tis almost fairy time shakespeare a midsummer nights dream i the suit of lights the day cal stepped out into was humid and stale it could not be long before the summer let fall take its toll even the breeze seemed weary and its condition was contagious by the time cal reached the vicinity of rue street his feet felt swollen in his shoes and his brain in his skull and then to add insult to injury he couldnt find the damn street hed made his way to the house the previous day with his eyes on the birds rather than on the route he was following so he had only an impressionistic notion of its whereabouts knowing he could well wander for several hours and not find the street he asked the way from a gaggle of sixyearolds engaged in war games on a street corner he was confidently redirected either through ignorance or malice however the directions proved hopelessly incorrect and he found himself wandering around in ever more desperate circles his frustration mounting any sixth sense he might have hoped for some instinct that would lead him unerringly to the region of his dreams was conspicuous by its absence it was luck then pure luck that brought him finally to the corner of rue street and to the house that had once belonged to mimi laschenksi suzanna had spent much of the morning attempting to do as she had promised doctor chai notifying uncle charlie in toronto it was a frustrating business for one thing the small hotel shed found the previous night only boasted a single public telephone and other guests wanted access to it as well as she for another she had to call round several friends of the family until she located one who had charlies telephone number all of which took the best part of the morning when around one she finally made contact mimis only son took the news without a trace of surprise there was no offer to drop his work and rush to his mothers bedside only a polite request that suzanna call back when there was more news meaning presumably that he didnt expect her to ring again until it was time for him to send a wreath so much for filial devotion the call done she rang the hospital there was no change in the patients condition shes hanging on was the duty nurses phrase it conjured an odd image of mimi as mountaineer clinging to a cliffface she took the opportunity to ask about her grandmothers personal effects and was told that shed come into hospital without so much as a nightgown most probably the vultures mrs pumphrey had spoken of would by now have taken anything of worth from the house the tallboy included but she elected to call by anyway in case she could salvage anything to make mimis dwindling hours a little more comfortable she found a small italian restaurant in the vicinity of the hotel to lunch in then drove to rue street the back yard gate had been pushed closed by the removal men but left unbolted cal opened it and stepped into the yard if hr had expected some revelation he was disappointed there was nothing remarkably here just parched chickweed sprouting between the paving stones and a litter of chattels the trio had discarded as worthless even the shadows which might have hidden some glory were wan and unsecretive standing in the middle of the yard where all of the mysteries that had overturned his sanity had been unveiled he doubted for the first time truly doubted that anything had in had happened the previous day maybe there would be something inside the house he told himself some flotsam he could cling to that would bear him up in this flood of doubt he crossed the ground where the carpet had lain to the back door the removal men had left it unlocked or else vandals had broken in either way it stood ajar he stepped inside at least the shadows were heavier within there was some room for the fabulous he waited for his eyes to accommodate the murk was it really only twentyfour hours since hed been here he thought as his sharpening gaze scanned the grim interior only yesterday that hed entered this house with no more on his mind than catching a lost bird this time he had so much more to find he wandered through to the hallway looking everywhere for some echo of what hed experienced the day before with every step he took his hopes felt further shadows there were but they were deserted the place was shorn of miracles theyd gone when the carpet was removed half way up the stairs he halted what was the use of going any further it was apparent hed missed his chance if he was to rediscover the vision hed glimpsed and lost hed have to search elsewhere it was mere doggedness thereforeone of eileens attributes that made him continue to climb at the top of the stairs the air was so leaden it made drawing breath a chore that and the fact that he felt like a trespasser today unwelcome in this tomb made him anxious to confirm his belief that the place had no magic to show him then get gone as hr went to the door of the front bedroom something moved behind him he turned the labourers had piled several articles of furniture at the top of the stairs then apparently decided they werent worth the sweat of moving any further a chest of drawers several chairs and tables the sound had come from behind this furniture and now it came again hearing it he imagined rats the sound suggested several sets of scurrying paws live and let live he thought he had no more right to be here than they did less perhaps theyd probably occupied the house for rat generations he returned to the job at hand pushed open the door and stepped into the front room the windows were grimy and the stained lace curtains further clogged the light there was a chair overturned on the bare boards and three odd shoes had been placed on the mantelpiece by some wit otherwise empty he stood for a few moments and then hearing laughter in the street and needing its reassurance crossed to the window and drew the curtain aside but before he found the laughters source he foresook the search his belly knew before his senses could confirm it that somebody had entered the room behind him he let the curtain drop and looked around a wide man in late middleage dressed too well for this dereliction had joined him in the halflight the threads of his grey jacket were almost iridescent but more eyecatching still his smile a practised smile belonging on an actor or a preacher whichever it was the expression of a man looking for converts can i be of help he said his voice was resonant and warm but his sudden appearance had chilled cal help me he said floundering are you perhaps interested in purchasing property the other man said purchasing no was just you know looking around its a fine house said the stranger his smile as steady as a surgeons handshake and as antiseptic do you know much about houses the line was spoken like its predecessors without irony or malice when cal didnt reply the man said im a salesman my names shadwell he teased the calfskin glove from his thickfingered hand and yours cal mooney calhoun that is the bare hand was extended cal took two steps towards the man he was fully four inches taller than cals five foot eleven and shook hands the mans cool palm made cal aware that he was sweating like a pig the handshake broken friend shadwell unbuttoned his jacket and opened it to take a pen from his inside pocket this casual action briefly revealed the lining of the salesmans garment and by some trick of the light it seemed to shine as though the fabric were woven of mirrored threads shadwell caught the look on cals face his voice was featherlight as he said do you see anything you like cal didnt trust the man was it the smile or the calfskin gloves that made him suspicious whichever he wanted as little time in the mans company as possible but there was something in the jacket something that caught the light and made cals heart beat a little faster please shadwell coaxed have a look his hand went to the jacket again and opened it tell me he purred if theres anything there that takes your fancy this time he fully opened the jacket exposing the lining and yes cals first judgment had been correct it did shine i am as i said a salesman shadwell was explaining i make it a golden rule always to carry some samples of my merchandise around with me merchandise cal shaped the word in his head his eyes still fixed on the interior of the jacket what a word that was merchandise and there in the lining of the jacket he could almost see that word made solid jewellery was it that gleamed them artificial gems with a sheen that blinded the way curly the fake could he squinted into the glamour looking to make sense out of what he saw while the salesmans voice went about its persuasions tell me what youd like and its yours i cant say fairer than that can i a fine young man like you should be able to pick and choose the worlds your oyster i can see that open in front of you have what you like free gratis and without charge you tell me what you see in there and the next minute its in your hands look away something in cal said nothing comes free prices must be paid but his gaze was so infatuated with the mysteries in the folds of the jacket that he couldnt have averted his eyes now if his life depended upon it tell me the salesman said what you see ah there was a question and its yours he saw forgotten treasures things hed once upon a time set his heart upon thinking that if he owned them hed never want for anything again worthless trinkets most of them but items that awoke old longings a pair of xray spectacles hed seen advertised at the back of a comic book but had never been able to buy there they were now their plastic lens gleaming and seeing them he remembered the october nights hed lain awake wondering how they worked and what was that beside them another childhood fetish a photograph of a woman dressed only in stiletto heels and a sequinned gstring presenting her oversized breasts to the viewer the boy two doors down from cal had owned that picture stolen it from his uncles wallet hed claimed and cal had wanted it so badly he thought hed die of longing now it hung a dogeared memento in the glittering flux of shadwells jacket there for the asking but no sooner had it made itself apparent than it too faded and new prizes appeared in its place to tempt him what is it you see my friend the keys to a car hed longed to own a prize pigeon the winner of innumerable races that hed been so envious of hed have happily abducted just tell me what you see ask and its yours there was so much item that had seemed for an hour a day the pivot upon which his world turned alt hung now in the miraculous storeroom of the salesmans coat but they were fugitive all of them they appeared only to evaporate again there was something else there which prevented these trivialities from holding his attention for more than moments what it was he couldnt yet see he was dimly aware that shadwell was addressing him again and that the tone of the salesmans voice had altered there was some puzzlement in it now tinged with exasperation speak up my friend why dont you tell me what you want i cant quite see it then try harder concentrate cal tried the images came and went all insignificant stuff the motherlode still evaded him youre not trying the salesman chided if a man wants something badly he has to zero in on it has to make sure its dear in his head cal saw the wisdom of this and redoubled his efforts it had become a challenge to see past the tinsel to the real treasure that lay beyond a curious sensation attended this focusing a restlessness in his chest and throat as though some part of him were preparing to be gone out of him and along the line of his gaze gone into the jacket at the back of his head where his skull grew the tail of his spine the warning voices muttered on but he was too committed to resist whatever the lining contained it teased him not quite showing itself he pared and stared defying its decorum until the sweat ran from his temples shadwells coaxing monologue had gained fresh confidence its sugar coating had cracked and fallen away the nut beneath was bitter and dark go on he said dont be so damn weak theres something here you want isnt there very badly go on tell me spit it oat no use waiting you wait and your chance slims away finally the image was coming dear tell art and its yours cal felt a wind on his face and suddenly he was flying again and wonderland was spread out before him its deeps and its heights its rivers its towers all were displayed there in the lining of the salesmans jacket he gasped at the sight shadwell was lightning swift in his response what is it cal stared on speechless what do you see a confusion of feelings assailed cal he felt elated seeing the land yet fearful of what he would be asked to give in return for this peepshow shadwell had harm in him for all his smiles and promises tell me the salesman demanded cal tried to keep an answer from coming to his lips he didnt want to give his secret away what do you see the voice was so hard to resist he wanted to keep his silence but the reply rose in him unbidden i i see i see he sees the fugue the voice that finished the sentence was that of a woman are you sure said shadwell never more certain look at his eyes cal felt foolish and vulnerable so mesmerized by the sights still unfolding in the lining he was unable to cast his eyes in the direction of those who now appraised him he knows the woman said her voice held not a trace of warmth even perhaps of humanity you were right then said shadwell its been here of course goad enough said shadwell and summarily closed the jacket the effect on cal was cataclysmic with the world the fugue shed called it so abruptly snatched away he felt weak as a babe it was all he could do to stand upright queasily his eyes slid in the direction of the woman she was beautiful that was his first thought she was dressed in reds and purples so dark they were almost black the fabric wrapped tightly around her upper body so as to seem both chaste her ripeness bound and sealed and in the act of sealing eroticized the same paradox informed her features her hairline had been shaved back fully two inches and her eyebrows totally removed which left her face eerily innocent of expression yet her flesh gleamed as if oiled and though the shaving and the absence of any scrap of makeup to flatter her features seemed acts in defiance of her beauty her face could not be denied its sensuality her mouth was too sculpted and her eyes umber one moment gold the next too eloquent for the feelings there to be disguised what feelings cal could only vaguely read impatience certainly as though being here sickened her and stirred some fury cal had no desire to see unleashed contempt for him most likely and yet a great focus upon him as though she saw through to his marrow and was preparing to congeal it with a thought there were no such contradictions in her voice however it was steel and steel how long she demanded of him how long since you saw the fugue he couldnt meet her eyes for more than a moment his gaze fled to the mantelpiece and the tripods shoes dont know what youre talking about he said youve seen it you saw it again in the jacket its fruitless to deny it its better you answer shadwell advised cal looked from mantelpiece to door they had left it open you can both go to hell he said quietly did shadwell laugh cal wasnt certain we want the carpet said the woman it belongs to us you understand shadwell said we have a legitimate claim to it so if youd be so kind the womans lip curled at this courtesy tell me where the carpets gone and we can have the matter done with such easy terms the salesman said tell us and were gone claiming ignorance would be no defence cal thought they knew that ht knew and they wouldnt be persuaded otherwise he was trapped yet dangerous as things hue become he felt inwardly elated his tormentors had confirmed the existence of the world hed glimpsed the fugue the urge to be out of their presence as fast as possible was tempered by the desire to play them along and hope theyd tell him more about the vision hed witnessed maybe i did see it he said no maybe the woman replied its hazy he said i remember something but im not quite sure what you dont know what the fugue is said shadwell why should he the woman replied he came on it by luck but he saw said shadwell a lot of cuckoos have some sight it doesnt mean they understand hes lost like all of them cal resented her condescension but in essence she was right lost he was what you saw isnt your business she said to him just tell us where you put the carpet then forget you ever laid eyes on it i dont have the carpet he said the womans entire face seemed to darken the pupils of her eyes like moons barely eclipsing some apocalyptic light from the landing cal heard again the scuttling sounds hed previously taken to be rats now he wasnt so sure i wont be polite with you much longer she said youre a thief no he protested yes you came here to raid an old womans house and you got a glimpse of something you shouldnt we shouldnt waste time said shadwell cal had begun to regret his decision to play the pair along he should have run while he had half a chance the noise from the other side of the door was getting louder hear that said the woman those are some of my sisters bastards her byblows theyre vile said shadwell he could believe her once more she said the carpet and once more he told her i dont have it this time his words were more appeal than defence then we must make you tell said the woman be careful immacolata said shadwell if the woman heard him she didnt care for his warning softly she rubbed the middle and fourth fingers of her right hand against the palm of her left and at this all but silent summons her sisters children came running ii the skin of the teeth suzanna arrived in rue street a little before three and went first to tell mrs pumphrey of her grandmothers condition she was invited into the house with such insistence site couldnt refuse they drank tea and talked for ten minutes or so chiefly of mimi violet pumphrey spoke of the old woman without malice but the portrait she drew was far from flattering they turned off the gas and electricity in the house years ago violet said she hadnt paid the bills living in squalor she was and it werent for want of me keeping a neighbourly eye but she was rude you know if you enquired about her health she lowered her voice a little i know i shouldnt say it but your grandmother wasnt entirely of sound mind suzanna murmured something in reply which she knew would go unheard all she had was candles for light no television no refrigerator god alone knows what she was eating do you know if anyone has a key to the house oh no she wouldnt have done that she had more locks on that house than youve had hot dinners she didnt trust anybody you see not anybody i just wanted to look around well theres been people in and out since she went probably find the place wide open by now even though of having a look myself but i didnt fancy it some houses theyre not quite natural you know what i mean she knew standing finally on the doorstep of number eighteen suzanna confessed to herself that shed welcomed the various duties that had postponed this visit the episode at the hospital had validated much of the family suspicion regarding mimi she was different she could give her dreams away with a touch and whatever powers the old woman possessed or was possessed by would they not also haunt the house shed spent so many years in suzanna felt the grip of the past tighten around her except that it was no longer that simple she wasnt here hesitating on the threshold just because she feared a confrontation with childhood ghosts it was that here on a stage shed thought to have made a permanent exit from she dimly sensed dramas waiting to be played and that mimi had somehow cast her in a pivotal role she put her hand on the door despite what violet had said it was locked she peered through the front window into a room of debris and dust the desolation proved oddly comforting maybe her anxieties would yet prove groundless she went around the back of the house here she had more luck the yard gate was open and so was the back door she stepped inside the condition of the front room was reprised here practically all trace of mimi laschenskis presence with the exception of candles and valueless junk had been removed she felt an unhappy mixture of responses on the one hand the certainty that nothing of value would have survived this clearance and that shed have to go back to mimi emptyhanded and on the other an undeniable relief that this was so that the stage was deserted though her imagination hung the missing pictures on the walls and put the furniture bade in place it was all in her mind there was nothing here to spoil the calm good order of the life she lived she moved through from the parlour into the halfway glancing into the small sitting room before turning the corner to the stairs they were not so mountainous nor so dark but before she could climb them she heard a movement oft the floor above whos there she called out the words were sufficient to break immacolatas concentration the creatures shed summoned the byblows halted their advance towards cal awaiting instruction he took his opportunity and threw himself across the room kicking at the beast closest to him the thing lacked a body its four arms springing straight from a bulbous neck beneath which dusters of sacs hung wet as liver and lights cals blow connected and one of the sacs burst releasing a sewer stench with the rest of the siblings close upon him cal raced for the door but the wounded creature was fastest in pursuit sidling crablike on its hands and spitting as it came a spray of saliva hit the wall close to cals head and the paper blistered revulsion gave heat to his heels he was at the door in an instant shadwell moved to intercept him but one of the beasts got beneath his feet like an errant dog and before he could regain his equilibrium cal was out of the room and on to the landing the woman whod called out was at the bottom of the stairs face upturned she stood as bright day to the night hed almost succumbed to in the room behind him wide greyblue eyes curls of dark auburn hair framing her pale face a mouth upon which a question was rising but which his wild appearance had silenced get out of here he yelled as he hurtled down the stairs she stood and gaped the door he said for gods sake open the door he didnt look to see if the monsters were coming in pursuit but he heard shadwell cry out stop thief from the top of the stairs the womans eyes went to the salesman then back to cal then to the front door open it cal yelled and this time she moved to do so either she distrusted shadwell on sight or she had a passion for thieves whichever she flung the door wide sunlight poured in dust dancing in its beams cal heard a howl of protest from behind him but the girl did nothing to arrest his flight get out of here he said to her and then he was over the threshold and into the street outside he took half a dozen steps from the door and then turned around to see if the woman with the grey eyes was following but she was still standing in the hallway will you come on he yelled at her she opened her mouth to say something to him but shadwell was at the bottom of the stairs by now and pushing her out of the way he couldnt linger there were only a few paces between him and the salesman he ran the man with the greasedback hair made no real attempt at pursuit once his quarry was out in the open the young man was whippetlean and twice as fleet the other was a bear in a savile row suit suzanna had disliked him from the moment shed set eyes on him now he turned and said whyd you do that woman she didnt grace the demand with a reply for one thing she was still trying to make sense of what shed just seen for another her attention was no longer on the bear but on his partner or keeper the woman who had now followed him down the stairs her features were as blank as a dead childs but suzanna had never seen a face that exercised such fascination get out of my way the woman said as she reached the bottom of the stairs suzannas feet had already begun to move when she cancelled her acquiescence and instead stepped directly into the womans path blocking her route to the door a flood of adrenalin surged through her system as she did so as though shed stepped in front of a speeding juggernaut but the woman mopped in her tracks and the hook of her gaze caught suzanna and raised her face to be scrutinized meeting the womans eyes suzanna knew the adrenalln rush had been well timed she had just skirted death that gaze had killed shed swear to it and would again but not now now the woman studied suzanna with curiosity a friend of yours was he she finally said suzanna heard the words spoken but she couldnt have sworn that the womans lips had moved to form them at the door behind her the bear said damn thief then he poked at suzannas shoulder hard didnt you hear me telling you he said suzanna wanted to turn to the man and tell him to take his hands off her but the woman hadnt done with her study and held her with that gaze she heard the woman said this time her lips did move and suzanna felt the hold on her relax but the mere proximity of the other woman made her body tremble her groin and breasts felt pricked by tiny thorns who are you the woman demanded leave it be said the bear i warn to know who she is why shes here the gaze which had briefly flitted to the man settled on suzanna afresh and the curiosity had murder in its shadow theres nothing here we need the man was saying the woman ignored him come on now leave it be there was something in the tone of his voice of one coaxing an hysteric from the brink of an attack and suzanna was glad of his intervention its too public he said especially here after long breathless moment the woman made the tiniest of nods conceding the wit of this she suddenly seemed to completely lose interest in suzanna and turned back towards the stairs at the top of the flight where suzanna had once imagined terrors to be in wait for her the gloom was not quite at rest there were ragged forms moving up there so insubstantial she could not be certain whether she saw them or merely sensed their presence they were spilling down the stairs like poison smoke losing what little solidity they might have owned as they approached the open door until by the time they reached the woman who awaited them at the bottom their vapours were invisible she turned from the stairs and walked past suzanna to the door taking with her a cloud of cold and tainted air as though the wraiths that had come to her were now wreathed about her neck and clinging to the folds of her dress carried unseen into the sunlit human world until they could congeal again the man was already out on the pavement but before his companion stepped out to join him she turned back to suzanna she said nothing either with her tips or without her eyes were quite expressive enough their promises were all joyless suzanna looked away she heard the womans heel on the step when she looked up again the pair had gone drawing a deep breath she went to the door though the afternoon was growing old the sun was still warm and bright not surprisingly the woman and the bear had crossed over so as to walk on the shadowed side of the street twentyfour years was a third of a good span time enough to form some opinions on how the world worked up until mere hours ago suzanna would have claimed shed done just that certainly there were sizeable gaps in her comprehension mysteries both inside her head and out that remained unilluminated but that had only made her the more determined not to succumb to any sentiment or selfdelusion that would give those mysteries power over her a zeal that touched both her private and professional lives in her love affairs she had always tempered passion with practicality avoiding the emotional extravagance shed seen so often become cruelty and bitterness in her friendships shed pursued a similar balance neither too cloying nor too detached and no less in her craft the very appeal of making bowls and pots was its pragmatism the vagaries of art disciplined by the need to create a functional object the question she would ask viewing the most exquisite jug on earth would be does it poor and it was in a sense a quality she sought in every facet of her life but here was a problem which defied such simple distinctions that threw her oftbalance left her sick and bewildered first the memories then mimi more dead than alive but passing dreams through the air and now this meeting with a woman whose glance had death in it and yet had left her feeling more alive than perhaps shed ever felt it was that last paradox that made her leave the house without finishing her search slamming the door on whatever dramas it had waiting for her instinctively she made for the river there sitting awhile in the sun she might make some sense of the problem there were no ships on the mersey but the air was so clear she could see loud shadows moving over the hills of clwyd there was no such clarity within her however only a chaos of feelings all unsettlingly familiar as though theyd been inside her for years biding their time behind the screen of pragmatism shed established to keep them from sight like echoes waiting on a mountainface for the shout they were born to answer shed heard that shout today or rather met it face to face on the very spot in the narrow hallway where as a six yearold shed stood and trembled in fear of the dark the two confrontations were inextricably linked though she didnt know how all she knew was that she was suddenly alive to a space inside herself where the haste and habit of her adult life had no dominion she sensed the passions that drifted in that space only vaguely as her fingertips might sense fog but she would come to know them better with time those passions and the acts that theyd engender she was certain of that as shed been certain of nothing in days shed know them and god help her shed love them as her own iii selling heaven mr mooney mr brendan mooney thats right do you happen to have a son by the name of calhoun what business is it of yours brendan wanted to know then before the other could answer said nothings happened to him the stranger shook his head taking hold of brendans hand and pumping it vigorously youre a very lucky man mr mooney if i may make so bold that brendan knew was a lie what do you want he said are you selling something he withdrew his hand from the grip of the other man whatever it is i dont want it selling said shadwell perish the thought im giving mr mooney your sons a wise boy he volunteered your name and to and behold youve been selected by computer as the recipient of i told you i dont want it brendan interrupted and tried to close the door but the man already had one foot over the threshold please brendan sighed will you just leave me alone i dont want your prizes i dont want anything well that makes you a very remarkable man the salesman said pushing the door wide again maybe even unique theres really nothing in the entire world you want thats remarkable music drifted from the back of the house a recording of puccinis greatest hits which eileen had been given several years ago shed scarcely listened to it but since her death brendan who had never stepped inside an operahouse in his life and was proud of the fact had become addicted to the love duet from madam butterfly if hed played it once hed played it a hundred times and the tears would always come now all he wanted to do was get back to the music before it finished but the salesman was still pressing his suit brendan he said i may call you brendan dont call me anything the salesman unbuttoned his jacket really brendan we have a great deal to discuss you and i your prize for one the lining of the jacket scintillated drawing brendans eye hed never in his life seen a fabric its equal are you sure theres nothing you want the salesman said absolutely sure the love duet had reached a new plateau the voices of butterfly and pinkerton urging each other on to fresh confessions of pain brendan heard but his attention was increasingly focused on the jacket and yes there was something there that he wanted shadwell watched the mans eyes and saw the flame of desire ignited it never failed you do see something mr mooney yes brendan admitted softly he saw and the joy he felt at what he saw made his heavy heart light eileen had said to him once if i die first brendan ill find some way to tell you what heavens like i swear will hed hushed her with kisses then and said that if she were to die he would die too of a broken heart but he hadnt died had he hed lived three long empty months and more than once in that time hed remembered her frivolous promise and now just as he felt despair would undo him utterly here on his doorstep was this celestial messenger an odd choice perhaps to appear in the shape of a salesman but no doubt the seraphim had their reasons do you want what you see brendan the visitor asked who are you brendan breathed awestruck my names shadwell and you brought this for me of course but if you accept it brendan you must understand therell be a small charge for the service brendan didnt take his eyes off the prize the jacket housed whatever you say he replied we may ask for your help for instance which youd be obliged to furnish do angels need help once in a while then of course said brendan id be honoured good the salesman smiled then please he opened the jacket a little wider help yourself brendan knew how the letter from eileen would smell and feel long before he had it in his hands it did not disappoint him it was warm as hed expected and the scent of flowers lingered about it shed written it in a garden no doubt in the paradise garden so mr mooney we have a deal do we the dove duet had ended the house behind brendan was silent he held the letter close to his chest still fearful that this was all a dream and hed wake to find himself emptyhanded whatever you want he said desperate that this salvation not be snatched from him sweetness and light came the smiling reply thats all a wise man ever wants isnt it sweetness and light brendan was only halflistening he ran his fingers back and forth over the letter his name was on the front in eileens cautious hand so tell me mr mooney the seraphim said about cal cal can you tell me where i can find him hes at a wedding a wedding ah could you perhaps furnish me with the address yes of course weve got a little something for cal too lucky man iv nuptials geraldine had spent many long hours giving cal a working knowledge of her family tree so that come teresas wedding hed know who was who it was a difficult business the keltaway family was heroically fecund and cal had a poor memory for names so it wasnt surprising that many of the hundred and thirty guests who packed the reception hall this balmy saturday evening were unknown to him he didnt much mind he felt safe amongst such numbers even if he didnt know who they were and the drink which had flowed freely since four in the afternoon further allayed his anxieties he didnt even object when geraldine presented him before a parade of admiring aunts and uncles every one of whom asked him when he was going to make an honest woman of her he played the game smiled charmed did his best to seem sane not that a little lunacy would have been noticeable in such a heady atmosphere norman kellaways ambition for his daughters wedding day seemed to have been upped a notch for every inch her waistline had swelled the ceremony had been grand but necessarily decorous the reception however was a triumph of excess over good taste the hall had been decorated from floor to ceiling with streamers and paper lanterns ropes of coloured lights were looped along the walk and in the trees out at the back of the hall the bar was supplied with beer spirits and liqueurs sufficient to intoxicate a modest army food was in endless supply carried to the tables of those content to sit and gorge by a dozen harassed waitresses even with ail the doors and windows open the hall soon grew hot as hell the heat in part generated by those guests whod thrown inhibitions to the wind and were dancing to a deafening mixture of country and western and rock and roll the latter bringing comical exhibitions from several of the older guests applauded ferociously from all sides at the edge of the crowd lingering by the door that led out behind the hall the grooms younger brother accompanied by two young bucks whod both at some point courted teresa and a fourth youth whose presence was only countenanced because he had cigarettes stood in a litter of beer cans and surveyed the talent available the pickings were poor those few girls who were of beddable age were either spoken far or judged so unattractive that any approach would have been evidence of desperation only elroy teresas penultimate boyfriend could lay claim to any hint of success tonight since the ceremony hed had his eyes on one of the bridesmaids whose name hed yet to establish but whod twice chanced to be at the bar while he was there a significant statistic now he leaned against the door and watched the object of his lust across the smoky room the lights had been dimmed inside the hall and the mood at the dancing had changed from cavortings to slow smoochy embraces this was the moment he judged to make his approach hed invite the woman onto the dance floor then after a song or two take her out for a breath of fresh air several couples had already retired to the privacy of the bushes there to do what weddings were made to celebrate beneath the pretty vows and the flowers they were here in the name of fucking and he was damned if he was going to be left out hed caught sight of cal chatting with the girl earlier on itd be simplest he thought to have cal to introduce them he pressed through the crush of dancers to where cal was standing how you doin mate cal looked at elroy blearily the face before him was flushed with alcohol im doing fine didnt mach like the ceremony elroy said i think im allergic to churches do us a favour will yer what is it im in lust who with one of the bridesmaids she was over by the bar long blonde hair you mean loretta cal said shes a cousin of geraldines it was odd but the drunker he got the more of his lessons on the kellaway family he remembered shes a fucking cracker and shes been giving me the eye all night is that right i was wondering will you introduce us cal looked at elroys panting eyes i think youre too late he said why she went outside before elroy could voice his irritation cal felt a hand on his shoulder he turned it was norman the father of the bride a word cal mboy he said glancing across at elroy ill catch you later elroy said retreating in case norman nabbed him too are you enjoying yourself yes mr kellaway less of this mr kellaway shit cal call me norm he poured a generous measure of whisky from the bottle he was armed with into cals lager glass then drew on his cigar so tell me he said how long before i have to give my other little girl away dont think im pushing son im not but one bride in labours enough cal swilled the whisky around the bottom of his glass hoping for a prompt from the poet none came ive got a job for you at the works norm went on unfazed by cals silence i want to see my baby live in a little style youre a good lad cal her mother likes you a lot and i always trust her judgment so you think on it he transferred the bottle to his rigorwielding right hand and reached into his jacket the gesture innocent as it was brought a drill of recognition for an instant cal was back in rue street gazing into the enchanted cave of shadwells jacket but kellaway had simpler gifts to give have a cigar he said and went off to his duties as host elroy picked up another can of beer from the bar then head out into the garden in search of loretta the air was considerably cooler than inside and as soon as it hit him he felt sick as a flea in a lepers jock strap he tossed the beer aside and beaded towards the bottom of the garden where he could throw up unseen the coloured lights stopped a few yards from the hall where the cable petered out beyond was a welcoming darkness which he plunged into he was used to vomiting a week in which his stomach didnt rebel through some excess or other was poorly spent he efficiently discharged the contents of his belly over a rhododendron bush then turned his thoughts bade to the lovely loretta a little way from where he stood the leafshadow or something concealed by it moved he peered more closely trying to interpret what he saw but there was not sufficient illumination to make settee of it he heard a sigh however a womans there was a couple in the shelter of the tree he decided doing what darkness had been created to conceal perhaps it was loretta her skirt up and her knickers down it would break his heart but he had to see very quietly he advanced a couple of paces on his second step something grazed his face he stifled a cry of shock and put his hand up to find strands of matter in the air around his head for some reason he thought of phlegm cold wet threads of phlegm except that they moved against his flesh as if they were a part of something larger a heartbeat later this notion was confirmed as the matter which was adhering now to his legs and body pulled him off his feet he would have let out a cry but the filthy stuff had already sealed up his lips and then as if this were not preposterous enough he felt a chill around his lower bell his trousers were being torn open he started to fight like fury but resistance was fruitless there was a weight bearing dower on his abdomen and hips and he felt his manhood drawn up into a channel that might have been flesh but that it was corpse cold tears of panic blurred his vision but he could see that the thing astride him had a human form he could see no face but the breasts were heavy the way he liked them and though this was far from the scene hed pictured with loretta his lust ignited his little length responding to the chilly ministrations of the body that contained him he raised his head slightly wanting a better view of those sumptuous breasts but in doing so he caught sight of another figure behind the first she was the antithesis of the ripe gleaming woman that rode him a stained wretched thief with gaping holes in her body where coat and mouth and navel should have been so large the stars showed through from the other side he started to fight afresh but his thrashings did nothing to slow his mistress rhythm despite his panic he felt the familiar tremor in his balls in his head half a dozen pictures collided becoming one monstrous beauty the ragged woman a necklace of coloured lights hanging between her sisters breasts raised her skirts and the mouth between her legs was lorettas mouth flicking its tongue he could not resist this pornography his prick spat its load he howled against the seal at his mouth the pleasure was short the pain that followed agonizing whats your fuckin problem somebody said in the darkness it took him a moment to realize that his cry for help had been heard he opened his eyes the silhouettes of the trees loomed over him but that was all he started to shout again not caring that he was lying in the muck with his trousers around his ankles just needing to know he was still in the land of the living the first glimpse cal had of trouble was through the bottom of his grass as he upped it to drain the last of normans malt whisky at the door two of the printers from the kellaway factory who were acting as bouncers for the night were engaged in friendly conversation with a man in a wellcut suit laughing the man glanced into the hall it was shadwell the jacket was dosed and buttoned there was no need it seemed for supernatural seductions the salesman was buying his entrance with charm alone even as cal watched he patted one of the men on the shoulder as if theyd been bosom buddies since childhood and stepped inside cal didnt know whether to stay still and hope that the crowd would conceal him or make a move to escape and so risk drawing the enemys attention as it was he had no choke in the matter a hand was over his and at his side stood one of the aunts geraldine had introduced him to so tell me she said apropos of nothing have you been to america no he said looking away from her powdered face towards the salesman he was entering the hall with flawless confidence bestowing smiles hither and thither his appearance won admiring eyes on all sides somebody extended a hand to be shaken another asked him what he was drinking he played the crowd with ease a smiling word offered to every ear all the while his eyes ranging back and forth as he sought out his quarry as the distance between them narrowed cal knew he couldnt long avoid bring seen claiming his hand from the grip of the aunt he headed off into the thickest part of the crowd a hubbub drew his attention to the far end of the hall where he saw somebody it looked to be elroy being carried in from the garden his clothes in filthied disarray his jaw slack nobody looked much bothered by his condition every gathering had its share of professional drunkards there was laughter and some disapproving looks then a rapid return to jollification cal glanced back over his shoulder where was shadwell still close to the door pressing the flesh like an aspirant politician no hed moved cal scanned the room nervously the noise and the dancing went on unabated but now the sweating revelers seemed a mite too hungry for happiness the dancers only dancing because it put the world away for a little time there was a desperation in this jamboree and shadwell knew how to exploit it with his fake bonhomie and that air he pretended of one whod walked with the great and the good cal itched to get up onto a table and tell the revellers to stop their cavortings to see for themselves how foolish their revels looked and how dangerous the shark theyd invited into their midst but what would they do when hed shouted himself hoarse laugh behind their hands and quietly remind each other that he had a madmans blood in his veins hed find no allies here this was shadwells territory the safest thing would be to keep his head down and negotiate a route to the door then get away as far as possible as fast as possible he acted upon the plan immediately thanking god for the lack of light he began to slip between the dancers keeping his eyes peeled for the man with the coat of many colours there was a shout behind him he glanced round and through the milling figures caught sight of elroy who was thrashing about like an epileptic yelling blue murder somebody was calling for a doctor cal turned back towards the door and the shark was suddenly at his side calhoun said shadwell soft and low your father told me id find you here cal didnt reply to shadwells words merely pretended he hadnt heard the salesman wouldnt dare do anything violent in such a crowd surely and he was safe from the mans jacket as long as he kept his eyes off the lining where are you going shadwell said as cal moved off i want a word with you cal kept walking we can help each other somebody called cals name asking him if he knew what was wrong with elroy he shook his head and forged on through the crowd towards the door his plan was simple tell the bouncers to find geraldines father and have shadwell thrown out tell me where the carpet is the salesman was saying and ill make sure her sisters never get their hands on you his manner was placatory ive no argument with you he said i just want some information i told you said cal knowing even as he spoke that any appeal was a lost cause i dont know where the carpet went they were within a dozen yards of the vestibule now and with every step they took shadwells courtesy decayed further theyll drain you dry he warned those sisters of hers and i wont be able to stop them not once theyve got their hands on you theyre dead and the dead dont take discipline dead oh yes she killed them herself while the three of them were still in the womb strangled them with their own cords true or not the image was sickening and more sickening still the thought of the sisters touch cal tried to put both from his mind as he advanced shadwell still at his side all pretence to negotiation had vanished there were only threats now youre a dead man mooney if you dont confess i wont lift a finger to help you cal was within hailing distance of the men he shouted across to them they broke off their drinking and turned in his direction whats the problem this man cal began looking towards shadwell but the salesman had gone in the space of seconds hed left cals side and melted into the crowd an exit as skilful as his entrance got some trouble the bigger of the two men wanted to know cal glanced back at the man fumbling for woods there was no use his trying to explain he decided no he said im ail right i just need some air too much to drink said the other man and stood aside to let cal step out into the street it was chilly after the suffocation of the hall but that was fine by cal hr breathed deeply trying to clear his head then a familiar voice do you want to go home it was geraldine she was standing a short way from the door a coat draped over her shoulders im all right he told her wheres your father i dont know why do you want him theres somebody in there who shouldnt be said cal crossing to where she stood to his drunken gaze she seemed more glamorous than hed ever seen her eyes shining like dark gems why dont we walk together a little way she said i have to speak to your father he insisted but she was already turning from him laughing lightly before he could voice a protest she was away around the corner he followed there were a number of lamps not working along the street and the silhouette he dogged was fitful but she trailed her laughter still and he went after it where are you going he wanted to know she only laughed again above their heads the clouds were moving quickly stars glimmering between their fires too feeble to illuminate much below they caught cals eye for an instant and when he looked back at geraldine she was turning to him making a sound somewhere between a sigh and a word the shadows that embraced her were dense but they unfolded even as he watched and what they revealed made his gut somersault geraldines fare had dislodged somehow her features running like heated wax and now as the facade fell away he saw the woman beneath saw and knew the browless fare the joyless mouth who else but immacolata he would have run then but that he felt the cold muzzle of a gun against his temple and the salesmans voice said make a sound and its going to hurt he kept his silence shadwell gestured towards the black mercedes that was parked at the next intersection move he said cal had no choice scarcely believing even as he walked that this scene was taking place on a street whose paving cracks hed counted since he was old enough to know one from two he was ushered into the back of the car separated from his captors by a partition of heavy glass the door was locked he was powerless all he could do was watch the salesman slide into the drivers seat and the woman get in beside there was little chance hed be missed from the party he knew and littler chance still that anyone would come looking for him it would simply be assumed that hed tired of the festivities and headed off home he was in the hands of the enemy and helpless to do anything about it what would mad mooney do now he wondered the question vexed him only a moment before the answer came taking out the celebratory cigar norman had given him he leaned back in the leather seat and lit up good said the poet take what pleasure you can while theres still pleasure to be had and breath to take it with v in the arms of mama pus in the haze of fear and cigar smoke he soon lost track of their route his only clue to their whereabouts when they finally came to a halt was that the air smelt sharply of the river or rather of the acreage of black mud that was exposed at low tide expanses of muck which hed had a terror of as a child it wasnt until hed reached double figures that hed been able to walk along otterspool promenade without an adult between him and the railings the salesman ordered him from the car he got out obediently it was difficult not to be obedient with a gun in his face shadwell immediately snatched the cigar from cads mouth grinding it beneath his heel then escorted him through a gate into a walled compound only now as he laid ryes on the canyons of household refuse ahead did cal realize where theyd brought him the municipal rubbish tip in former years acres of parkland had been built on the citys detritus but there was no longer the money to transform trash into lawns trash it remained its stench the sweet and sour of rotting vegetable matter even overpowered the smell of the river stop said shadwell when they reached a place that seemed in no way particular cal looked round in the direction of the voice he could see very little but it seemed shadwell had pocketed his gun seizing the instant he began to run not choosing any particular direction merely seeking escape hed counted maybe four paces when something tangled with his legs and he fell heavily the breath knocked from him before he had a chance to get to his feet forms were converging on him from every side an incoherent mass of limbs and snarls that could only be the wraithsisters children he was glad of the darkness at least he couldnt see their deformities but he felt their limbs upon him heard their teeth snapping at his neck they didnt intend to devour him however at some cue he neither saw nor heard their violence dwindled to mere bondage he was held fast his body so knotted up his joints creaked while a terrible spectacle unfolded a few yards in hunt of him it was one of immacolatas sisters he had no doubt of that a naked woman whose substance flickered and smoked as though her marrow was on fire except that she could have no marrow for surely she had no bones her body was a column of grey gas laced with strands of bloody tissue and from this flux fragments of finished anatomy emerged a seeping breast a belly swollen as if by a pregnancy months beyond its term a smeared fare in which the eyes were sewnup slits that explained no doubt her hesitant advance and the way her smoky limbs extended from her body to test the ground ahead the ghost was blind by the light this unholy mother gave off cal could see the children more clearly no perversion of anatomy had been overlooked amongst them bodies turned inside out to parade the bowel end stomach organs whose function seemed simply to seep and wheeze lining the belly of one like teats and mounted like a coxcomb on anothers head yet despite their corruptions their heads were all turned adoringly upon mama pus their eyes unblinking so as not to miss a moment of her presence she was their mother they her loving children suddenly she started to shriek cal turned to look at her again shed taken up a squatting posture her legs splayed her head thrown back as she voiced her agony behind her there now stood a second ghost as naked as the first more so perhaps for she could scarcely lay claim to flesh she was obscenely withered her dugs like empty purses her face collapsed upon itself in a jumble of toothshard and hair shed taken hold of her squatting sister whose scream had now reached a nerveshredding height as the swollen belly came close to bursting there was an issue of smouldering matter from between the mothers legs the sight was greeted with a chorus of welcomes from the children they were entranced so in his horrified way was cal mama pus was giving birth the scream became a series of smaller rhythmic shouts as the child began its journey into the living world it was less born than shat dropping from between its parents legs like a vast mewling turd no sooner had it hit the ground than the withered midwife was about her business coming between mother and spectators to draw away veils of redundant matter from the childs body the mother her labours over stood up the flame in her flesh dying and left the child to her sisters ministrations now shadwell came back into view he looked down at cal do you see he said his voice all but a whisper what kind of horrors these are i warned you tell me where the carpet is and ill try to make sure the child doesnt touch you i dont know i swear i dont the midwife had withdrawn shadwell a sham of pity on his fare now did the same in the dirt a few yards from cal the child was already standing up it was the size of a chimpanzee and shared with its siblings the appearance of something traumatically wounded portions of its inner workings were teased out through its skin leaving its torso to collapse upon itself in places and in others sport ludicrous appendages of gut twin rows of dwarf limbs hung from its belly and between its legs a sizeable scrotum depended smoking like a censer uncompanioned by any organ to discharge what boiled within the child knew its business from its first breath to terrorize though its face was still wreathed with afterbirth its gummy eyes found cal and it began to shamble towards him oh jesus cal began looking for the salesman but the man had vanished i told you he yelled into the darkness i dont know where the fucking carpet is shadwell didnt respond cal shouted again mama pus bastard was almost upon him jesus shadwell listen to me will you then the byblow spoke cal it said he stopped struggling against his restraints a moment and looked at it in disbelief it spoke again the same syllable cal even as it pronounced his name its fingers pulled at the muck about its head the face that appeared from beneath lacked a complete skull but it was recognizably that of its father elroy seeing familiar features in the midst of such deformity was the crowning horror as elroys child reached to touch him cal started yelling again scarcely aware of what he was saying only begging shadwell to keep the thing from touching him the only reply was his own voice echoing back and forth until it died the childs arms jerked forward and its long fingers latched onto cals fare he tried to fight it off but it drew closer to him its sticky body embracing him the more he struggled the more he was caught the rest of the byblows loosed their hold on him now leaving him to the new child it was only minutes old but its strength was phenomenal the vestigial hands on its belly raking cals skin its grip so tight his lungs laboured for breath with its face inches from cals it spoke again but the voice that came from the ruined mouth was not its fathers this time but that of immacolata confess she demanded confess what you know i just saw a place he said trying to avoid the trail of spittle that was about to fall tram the beasts chin he failed it hit his check and burned like hot fat do you know what place the incantatrix demanded no he said no i dont but youve dreamt it havent you wept for it yes was the answer of course hed dreamt it who hadnt dreamt of paradise momentarily his thoughts leapt from present terror to past joy to his floating over the fugue the sight of that wonderland kindled a sudden will to resist in him the glories he saw in his minds eye had to be preserved from the foulness that embraced him from its makers and masters and in such a struggle his life was not so hard to forfeit though he knew nothing about the carpets present whereabouts he was ready to perish rather than risk letting anything slip that shadwell might profit by and while he had breath hed do all in his power to confound them elroys child seemed to read this newfound resolution it drew its arms more tightly about him ill confess he yelled in its fare ill tell you everything you want to know immediately he began to talk the substance of his confession was not however what they wanted to hear instead he began to recite the train timetable out of lime street which he knew by heart hed first started learning it at the age of eleven having seen a memory man on television whod demonstrated his skills by recalling the details of randomly chosen football matches teams scores scorers backto the s it was a perfectly useless endeavour but its heroic scale had impressed gal mightily and hed spent the next few weeks committing to memory any and every piece of information he could find until it struck him that his magnum opus was passing to and fro at the bottom of the garden the trains hed begun that day with the local lines his ambition elevated each time he successfully remembered a days times faultlessly hed kept his information up to date for several years as services were cancelled or stations closed and his mind which had difficulty putting names to faces could still spew this perfectly redundant information out upon request thats what he gave them now the services to manchester crewe stafford wolverhampton birmingham coventry cheltenham spa reading bristol exeter salisbury london colchester all the times of arrival and departure and footnotes as to which services only operated on saturdays and which never ran on bank holidays im mad mooney he thought as he delivered this filibuster listing the services with a bright clear voice as if to an imbecile the trick confounded the monster utterly it stared at cal as he talked unable to understand why the prisoner had forsaken fear immacolata cursed cal through her nephews mouth and offered up new threats but he scarcely heard them the timetables had their own rhythm and he was soon carried along by it the beasts embrace grew tighter it could not be long before cols bones began to break but he just went on talking drawing in gulps of breath to start each day and letting his tongue do the rest its poetry my boy said mad mooney never heard its like pure poetry and maybe it was verses of days and lines of hours transmuted into the stuff of poets because it was all spat into the face of death theyd kill him for this defiance he knew when they finally realized that hed never exchange another meaningful word with them but wonderland would have a gate for ghosts hr had just begun the scottish services to edinburgh glasgow perth inverness abe and dundee when he caught sight of shadwell from the comer of his eye the salesman was shaking his head and now exchanged some words with immacolata something about having to ask the old woman then he turned and walked into the darkness theyd given up on their prisoner the coup de grace could only be seconds away he felt the grip relax his recitation faltered for an instant in anticipation of the fatal blow it didnt come instead the creature withdrew its arms from around him and followed behind shadwell leaving cal lying on the ground though released he could scarcely move his bruised limbs were rigid with cramp after being held fast far so lung and now he realized that his troubles were not over he felt the sweat on his face turning cold as the mother of elroys terrible infant drew herself towards him he could not escape her she straddled his body then reached down and drew his face up towards her breasts his muscles complained at this contortion but the pain was forgotten an instant after as she put her nipple to his lips a longneglected instinct made him accept it the breast spurted a bitter fluid down his throat he wanted to spit it out but his body lacked the strength to reject it instead he felt his conciousness flee from this last degeneracy a dream eclipsed the horror he was lying in darkness on a scented bed while a womans voice sang to him some wordless lullaby whose cradle rhythms were shared by a featherlight touch upon his body fingers were playing on his abdomen and groin they were cold but they knew more tricks than a whore he was hard in a heartbeat gasping in two hed never felt such caresses coaxed by agonizing degrees to the point of no return his gasps became cries but the lullaby drowned them out matting his manhood with its nursery lilt he was a helpless infant despite his erection or perhaps because of it the touch grew more demanding his cries more urgent for an instant his thrashings shook him from his dream and his eyes flickered open long enough to see that he was still in the sisters sepulchral embrace then the smothering slumber claimed him again and he discharged into an emptiness so profound it devoured not only his seed but the lullaby and its singer and finally the dream itself he woke alone and weeping every ligament tenor he untied the knot hed made of himself and stood up his watch read nine minutes after two the last train of the night had left lime street long ago and the first of sunday morning would not run for many hours yet vi sick souls sometimes mimi woke sometimes she slept but one was much like the other now sleep marred by distress and discomfort wakefulness full of unfinished thoughts that faded into scraps of nonsense like dreams one moment she was certain there was a small child crying in the turner of the room until the night nurse came in and wiped the tears from her patients eyes another moment she could see as if through a dirtied window some place she knew but had lost and her old bones ached with wanting to be there but then came another vision and this one she hoped against hope was a dream it was not mimi said the dark woman the stroke that had crippled mimi had dimmed her eyes but she had sight enough to recognize the figure standing at the bottom of her bed after years of being alone with her secret somebody from the fugue had finally found her but there would be no tearful reunions tonight not with this visitor nor her dead sisters the incantatrix immacolata had come here to fulfil a promise shed made before the fugue had been hidden that if she could not rule the seerkind shed destroy them she was liliths descendant shed always claimed the last pure line from the first state of magic her authority over them was therefore unquestionable theyd laughed at her for her presumption it wasnt their nature to be ruled nor to count much on genealogy immacolata had been humiliated a fact a woman like her possessed it had to be admitted of powers that were purer than most would not easily forget now shed found the carpets last custodian and shed have blood if she could get it an age ago the council had bequeathed mimi some of the tactics of the old silence to arm her against a situation such as this they were minor raptures no more devices to distract an enemy nothing fatal that took more time to learn than theyd had shed been grateful for them at the time however theyd offered some smidgen of comfort as she faced life in the kingdom without her beloved romo but the year had gone by and nobody had come either to tell her that the waiting was over and the weave could give up its secrets or to try and take the fugue by force the excitement of the early years knowing she stood between magic and its destruction dwindled to a weary watchfulness she became lazy and forgetful they all did only towards the end when she was alone and she realized just how frail she was becoming did she shake off the stupor that living amongst the cuckoos had brought on and try to set her beleaguered mental powers to the proem of the secret shed protected for so long but by that time her mind was wandering the first symptoms of the stroke that would incapacitate her it took her a day and a half to compose the short letter shed written to suzanna a letter in which shed risked saying more than she vented to because time was getting short and she sensed danger shed been right here it was immacolata had probably sensed the signal mimi had sent up at the very last a summons to any kingdombound seerkind who might have come to her aid that with hindsight had probably been her greatest error an incantatrix of immacolatas strength would not have missed suchs alarms here she was come to visit mind like a dispossessed child eager to make good at the deathbed and so claim her inheritance it was an analogy not lost on the creature i told the nurse i was your daughter she said and that i heeded some time with you alone mimi would have spat in disgust had she had the strength or the spittle i know youre going to die so ive come to say goodbye after all these years youve lost the power of speech i hear so im not to expect you to babble your confession there are other ways we know how the mind can be laid bare without words dont we she stepped a little closer to the bed mimi knew what the incantatrix said was true there were ways a body even one as wretched and dose to death as her own could be made to give up its secrets if the interrogator knew the methods and immacolata did she the slaughterer of her own sisters she the eternal virgin whose celibacy gave her access to powers lovers were denied she had ways mini would have to turn some final trick or all would be lost from the corner of her eye mimi saw the hag the withered sister hunkered up beside the wall her toothless maw wide the magdalene immacolatas second sister was occupying the visitors chair her legs splayed they were waiting for the fun to begin mimi opened her mouth as if to speak something to say immacolata asked as the incantatrix spoke mimi used what little strength she had to turn her left hand palm up there amid the grid of her life and love lines was a symbol drawn in henna and reworked so often that her skin was now irredeemably stained a symbol taught to her hours before the great weaving by a baba in the council shed longago forgotten what it meant or did if shed ever been told but it was one of the few defences theyd given her that she was in any condition to use the raptures of the lo were physical and her body was too paralysed to perform them those of the aia were musical and being tone deaf had been the first shed forgotten the yeme the seerkind whose genius was weaving hadnt given her raptures at all theyd been too busy during those last hectic days with the business of their magnum opus the carpet that was soon to conceal the fugue from sight for an age indeed most of what that babu had taught her was beyond her present power to use word raptures were valueless if your lips couldnt shape them all she had left was this obscure sign little more than a dirtmark on her palsied hand to keep the incantatrix at bay but nothing happened there was no release of power not even a breath she tried to recall if the babu had given her some specific instruction about activating the rapture but all her mind would conjure was his face and a smile hed given her and the trees behind his head sieving sunlight through their branches what days theyd been and she so young and it all an adventure no adventure now just death on a stale bed suddenly a roar and from her palm released by the memory perhaps the rapture broke a ball of energy leapt from her hand inunacolata stepped back as a humming net of light came down around the bed keeping malice at bay the incantatrix was quick to respond the menstruum that stream of bright darkness which was the blood of her subtle body spilled from her nostrils it was a power mimi had seen manifested no more than a dozen times always and only by women an etheric solution in which it was said the wielder could dissolve ail experience and make it again in the image of her desire while the old science was a democracy of magic available to all independent of gender age or moral standing the menstruum seemed to choose those it favoured it had driven a fair number of those chosen to suicide with its demands and its visions but it was undeniably a power perhaps even a condition of the flesh that knew no bounds it took a few droplets only their spheres becoming barbed in the air to lacerate the net that the babu rapture had created leaving mimi utterly vulnerable immacolata stared down at the old woman fearful of what would come next doubtless the council had left the custodian with some endgame rapture which in extremis shed unleash that was why shed counselled shadwell that they try other routes of investigation first in order to avoid this potentially lethal confrontation but those routes had all been culdesacs the house in rue street had been robbed of its treasure the sole witness mooney had lost his wits shed been obliged to come here and face the custodian not fearing mimi herself but rather the scale of the defenses the council had surely lodged with her go on she said do your worst the old woman just lay there her eyes full of anticipation we havent got forever immacolata said if youve got raptures show them still she just lay there with the arrogance of one who had power in plentiful supply immacolata could bear the waiting no longer she took a step towards the bed in the hope of making the bitch show her powers whatever they were them was still no response was it possible that shed misread the signs was it perhaps not arrogance that made the woman lie so still but despair dare she hope that the custodian was somehow miraculously she touched mimis open palm brushing the spent calligraphy the power there was defunct and nothing further came to meet her from the woman on the bed if immacolata knew pleasure she knew it then unlikely as it seemed the custodian was unarmed she possessed no final devastating rapture it shed ever had such authority age had decayed it time to unburden yourself she said and let a dribble of torment climb into the air above mimis trembling head the night nurse consulted the clock on the wall it was thirty minutes since shed left the tearful daughter with mrs laschenki strictly speaking she should have told the visitor to return the following morning but the woman had travelled through the night and besides there was every chance the patient would not make it to first light rules had to be tempered with compassion but half an hour was enough as she started down the corridor she heard a cry issuing from the old ladys room and the sound of furniture being overturned she was at the door in seconds the handle was clammy and refused to turn she rapped on the door as the noise within grew louder still whats going on she demanded inside the incantatrix looked down at the bag of dry bones and withered flesh on the bed where did this woman find the willpower to defy her to resist the needles of interrogation the menstruum had driven up through the roof of her mouth into her very thoughts the council had chosen well electing her as one of the three guardians of the weaveworld even now with the menstruum probing the seals of her brain she was preparing a final and absolute defence she was going to die immacolata could see her willing death upon herself before the needles pricked her secrets out on the other side of the door the nurses enquiries rose in pitch and volume open the door please will you open the door time was running out ignoring the nurses calls immacolata closed her eyes and dug into the past for a marriage of forms that she hoped would unseat the old womans reason long enough for the needles to do their work one part of the union was easily evoked an image of death plucked from her one true refuge in the kingdom the shrine of the mortalities the other was more problematic for shed only seen the man mimi had left behind in the fugue once or twice but the menstruum had its way of dredging the memory up and what better proof of the illusions potency than the look that now came over the old womans face as her lost love appeared to her at the bottom of the bed raising his rotting arms taking her cue immacolata pressed the points of her enquiry into the custodians cortex but before she had a chance to find the carpet there mimi with one last gargantuan effort seized hold of the sheet with her good hand and flung it towards the phantom a punning call on the incantatrixs bluff then she fell sideways from the bed dead before she hit the floor immacolata shrieked her fury and as she did so the nurse flung the door open what the woman saw in room six she would never tell not for the rest of her long life in part because she feared the derision of her peers in part because if her eyes told the truth and there were in the living world such terrors as she glimpsed in mimi laschenskis room to talk of them might invite their proximity and she a woman of her times had neither prayers nor wit enough to keep such darkness at bay besides they were gone even as her eyes fell upon them the naked woman and the dead man at the foot of the bed gone as if theyd never been and there was just the daughter saying no no and her mother dead on the floor ill get the doctor said the nurse please stay here but when she got back to the room the grieving woman had made her final farewells and left what happened said shadwell as they drove from the hospital shes dead said immacolata and said no more until theyd driven two miles from the gates shadwell knew better than to press her she would tell what she had to tell in her own good time which she did saying she had no defence shadwell except some poxy trick i learned in my cot hows that possible maybe she just grew old came immacolatas reply her mind rotted and the other custodians who knows dead maybe wandered off into the kingdom she was on her own at the last the incantatrix smiled an expression her face was not familiar with there was i being cautious and calculating afraid shed have raptures thatd undo me and she had nothing nothing just an old woman dying in a bed if shes the last theres noone to stop us is there noone to keep us from the fugue so itd seem immacolata replied then lapsed into silence again content to watch the sleeping kingdom slide past the window it still amazed her this woeful place not in its physical particulars but in its unpredictability theyd grown old here the keepers of the weave they whod loved the fugue enough to give their lives to keep it from harm theyd finally wearied of their vigil and withered into forgetfulness hate remembered though hate remembered long after love had forgotten she was living proof of that her purpose to find the fugue and break its bright heart was undimmed after a search that had occupied a human lifetime and that search would soon be over the fugue found and put up for auction its territories playgrounds for the cuckoos its peoples the four great families sold into slavery or left to wander in this hopeless place she looked out at the city a fidgety light was washing brick and concrete frightening off what little enchantment the night might have lent the magic of the seerkind could not survive long in such a world and stripped of their raptures what were they a lost people with visions behind their eyes and no power to make them true they and this tarnished forsaken city would have much to talk about vii the tallboy eight hours before mimis death in the hospital suzanna had returned to the house in rue street evening was falling and the building pierced from front to back with shafts of amber light was almost redeemed from its dreariness but the glory didnt last for long and when the sun took itself off to another hemisphere she was obliged to light the candles many of which remained on the sills and the shelves set in the graves of their predecessors the illumination they offered was stronger than shed expected and more glamorous she moved from room to room accompanied everywhere by the scent of melting wax and could almost imagine mimi might have been happy here in this cocoon of the design which her grandmother had shown her she could find no sign it was not in the grain of the floorboards nor in the pattern of the wallpaper whatever it had been it was gone now she didnt look forward to the melancholy task of breaking that news to the old lady what she did find however all but concealed behind the stack of furniture at the top of the stairs was the tallboy it took a little time to remove the items piled in front of it but there was a revelation waiting when she finally set the candle on the floor before it and opened the doors the vultures whod picked the household clean had forgotten to rifle the contents of the tallboy mimis clothes still hung on the rails coats and furs and ballgowns all most likely unworn since last suzanna had opened this treasure trove which thought reminded her of what shed sought on that occasion she went down on her haunches telling herself that it was folly to think her gift would still be there and yet knowing indisputably that it was she was not disappointed there amongst the shoes and tissue she found a package wrapped in plain brown paper and marked with her name the gift had been postponed but not lost her hands had begun to tremble the knot in the faded ribbon defied her for half a minute and then came free she pulled the paper off inside a book not new to judge by its scuffed corners but finely bound in leather she opened it to her surprise she found it was in german geschichten der geheimen orte the title read which she hesitatingly translated as stories of the secret places but even if she hadnt had a smattering of the language the illustrations would have given the subject away it was a book of faerytales she sat down at the top of the stairs candle at her side and began to study the volume more closely the stories were familiar of course shed encountered them in one form or another a hundred times shed seen them reinterpreted as hollywood cartoons as erotic fables as the subject of learned theses and feminist critiques but their bewitchment remained undiluted by commerce or academe sitting there the child in her wanted to hear these stories told again though she knew every twist and turn and had the end in mind before the first line was spoken that didnt matter of course indeed their inevitability was part of their power some tales could never be told too often experience had taught her much and most of the news was bad but these stories taught different lessons that sleep resembled death for instance was no revelation but that death might with kisses be healed into mere sleep that was knowledge of a different order mere wishfulfilment she chided herself real life had no miracles to offer the devouring beast if cut open did not disgorge its victims unharmed peasants were not raised overnight to princedom nor was evil ever vanquished by a union of true hearts they were the kind of illusions that the pragmatist shed striven so hard to be had kept at bay yet the stories moved her she couldnt deny it and they moved her in a way only true things could it wasnt sentiment that brought tears to her eyes the stories werent sentimental they were tough even cruel no what made her weep was being reminded of an inner life shed been so familiar with as a child a life that was both an escape from and a revenge upon the pains and frustrations of childhood a life that was neither mawkish nor unknowing a life of mindplaces haunted soaring that shed chosen to forget when shed took up the cause of adulthood more than that in this reunion with the tales that had given her a mythology she found images that might help her fathom her present confusion the outlandishness of the story shed entered coming back to liverpool had thrown her assumptions into chaos but here in the pages of the book she found a state of being in which nothing was fixed where magic ruled bringing transformations and miracles shed walked there once and far from feeling lost could have passed for one of its inhabitants if she could recapture that insolent indifference to reason and let it lead her through the maze ahead she might comprehend the forces she knew were waiting to be unleashed around her it would be painful to relinquish her pragmatism however it had kept her from sinking so often in the face of waste and sorrow shed held on by staying cool rational even when her parents had died separated by some unspoken betrayal which kept them even at the last from comforting each other shed coped simply by immersing herself in practicalities until the worst was over now the book beckoned with its chimeras and its sorceries all ambiguity all flux and her pragmatism would be worthless no matter whatever the years had taught her about loss and compromise and defeat she was here invited back into a forest in which maidens tamed dragons and one of those maidens still had her face having scanned three or four of the stories she turned to the front of the book in search of an inscription it was brief to suzanna it read love from ml it shared the page with an odd epigram das was man sich vorstellt braucht man nie zu verlieren she struggled with this suspecting that her rusty german might be missing the felicities the closest approximation she could make was that which is imagined need never be lost with this oblique wisdom in mind she returned to the stories lingering over the illustrations which had the severity of woodcuts but on closer inspection concealed all manner of subtleties fish with human faces gazed up from beneath the pristine surface of a pool two strangers at a banquet exchanged whispers that had taken solid form in the air above their heads in the heart of a wild wood figures all but hidden amongst the trees showed pale expectant faces the hours came and went and when having been through the book from cover to cover she briefly closed her eyes to rest them sleep overcame her when she woke she found her watch had stopped a little after two the wick at her side flickered in a pool of wax close to drowning she got to her feet limping around the landing until the pins and needles had left her foot and then went into the back bedroom in search of a fresh candle there was one on the window ledge as she picked it up her eye caught a movement in the yard below her heart jumped but she stood absolutely still so as not to draw attention to herself and watched the figure was in shadow and it wasnt until he forsook the corner of the yard that the starlight showed her the young man shed seen here the day before she started downstairs picking up a fresh flame on the way she wanted to speak to the man wanted to quiz him on the reasons for his flight arid the identity of his pursuers as she stepped out into the yard he rose from his hiding place and made a dash for the back gate wait she called after him its suzanna the name could mean little to him but he halted nevertheless who he said i saw you yesterday you were running the girl in the hall cal realized the one whod come between him and the salesman what happened to you she said he looked terrible his clothes were ripped his face dirtied and though she couldnt be sure bloodied too i dont know he said his voice scraping gravel i dont know anything any longer why dont you come inside he didnt move how long have you been here he said hours and the house is empty except for me yes with this ascertained he followed her through the back door she lit several more candles the light confirmed her suspicions there was blood on him and a cesspit smell is there any running water he said i dont know we can try they were in luck the water board had not turned off the supply the kitchen tap rattled and the pipes roared but finally a stream of icy water was spat forth cal slung off his jacket and doused his face and arms til see if i can find a towel said suzanna whats your name by the way cal she left him to his ablutions with her gone he stripped off his shirt and sluiced down his chest neck and back with chilly water she was back before he was done with a pillowslip nearest thing i can find to a towel she said she had set two chairs in the lower front room and lit several candles there they sat together and talked why did you come back she wanted to know after yesterday i saw something here he said cautiously and you why are you here this is my grandmothers house shes in hospital dying i came back to look around the two i saw yesterday cal said were they friends of your grandmothers i doubt it what did they want with you here cal knew he got into sticky ground how could he begin to tell her what joys and fears the last few days had brought its difficult he said i mean im not sure anything thats happened to me recently makes much sense that makes two of us she replied he was looking at his hands like a palmist in search of a future she studied him his torso was covered in scratches as though hed been wrestling wolves when he looked up his pale blue eyes fringed with black lashes caught her scrutiny he blushed slightly you said you saw something here she said can you tell me what it was a simple question and he saw no reason not to tell her if she disbelieved him that was her problem not his but she didnt indeed as soon as he described the carpet her eyes grew wide and wild of course she said a carpet of course you know about it he said she told him what had happened at the hospital the design mimi had tried to show her now any lingering doubts about telling the whole story were forgotten he gave her the adventure from the day the bird had escaped his vision of the fugue shadwell and his coat immacolata the byblows their mother and the midwife events at the wedding and after she punctuated his narrative with insights of her own about mimis life here in the house the doors bolted the windows nailed down living in a fortress as if awaiting siege she must have known somebody would come for the carpet sooner or later not for the carpet said cal for the fugue she saw his eyes grow dreamy at the word and envied him his glimpse of the place its hills its lakes its wild woods and were there maidens amongst those trees she wanted to ask who tamed dragons with their song that was something she would have to discover for herself so the carpets a doorway is it she said i dont know he replied i wish we could ask mimi maybe she before the sentence was out cal was on his feet oh my god only now did he recall shadwells words on the rubbish tip about going to peak to the old woman hed meant mimi who else as he pulled on his shirt he told suzanna what hed heard we have to go to her he said christ why didnt i think his agitation was infectious suzanna blew out the candles and was at the front door before him surely mimill be safe in a hospital she said nobodys safe he replied and she knew it was true on the step she aboutfaced and disappeared into the house again returning seconds later with a battered book in her hands diary he said map she replied viii following the thread mimi was dead her killers had come and gone in the night leaving an elaborate smokescreen to conceal their crime theres nothing mysterious about your grandmothers death doctor chai insisted she was failing fast there was somebody here last night thats right her daughter she only had one daughter my mother and shes been dead for two and a half years whoever it was she did mrs laschenski no harm your grandmother died of natural causes there was little use in arguing suzanna realized any further attempt to explain her suspicions would end in confusion besides mimis death had begun a new spiral of puzzles chief amongst them what had the old woman known or been that she had to be dispatched and how much of her part in this puzzle would suzanna now be obliged to assume one question begged the other and both with mimi silenced would have to go unanswered the only other source of information was the creature whod stooped to kill the old woman on her deathbed immacolata and that was a confrontation suzanna felt far from ready for they left the hospital and walked she was badly shaken shall we eat cal suggested it was still only seven in the morning but they found a cafe that served breakfast and ordered gluttons portions the eggs and bacon toast and coffee restored them both somewhat though the price of a sleepless night still had to be paid til have to phone my uncle in canada said suzanna tell him what happened all of it said cal of course not she said thats between the two of us he was glad of that not just because he didnt like the thought of the story spreading but because he wanted the intimacy of a secret shared this suzanna was like no woman he had ever met before there was no facade no gamesplaying they were in one night of confessionals and this sad morning suddenly companions in a mystery which though it had brought him closer to death than hed ever been hed happily endure if it meant he kept her company there wont be many tears shed over mimi suzanna was saying she was never loved not even by you i never knew her she said and gave cal a brief synopsis of mimis life and times she was an outsider suzanna concluded and now we know why which brings us back to the carpet we have to trace the house cleaners you need some sleep first no ive got my second wind but i do want to go home just to feed the pigeons cant they survive without you for a few hours cal frowned if it werent for them he said i wouldnt be here sorry do you mind if i come with you id like that maybe you can give dad something to smile about as it was brendan had smiles aplenty today cal had not seen his father so happy since before eileens illness the change was uncanny he welcomed them both into the house with a stream of banter coffee anybody he offered and went off into the kitchen by the way cal geraldine was here what did she want she brought some books youd given her said she didnt want them any longer he turned from the coffeebrewing and stared at cal she said youve been behaving oddly must be in the blood said cal and his father grinned im going to look at the birds ive already fed them today and cleaned them out youre really feeling better why not said brendan ive got people watching over me cal nodded not quite comprehending then he turned to suzanna want to see the champions he said and they stepped outside the day was already balmy theres something off about dad said cal as he led the way down the clogged path to the loft two days ago he was practically suicidal maybe the bad times have just run their course she said maybe he replied as he opened the loft door as he did so a train roared by making the earth tremble ninetwentyfive to penzance cal said as he led her inside doesnt it disturb the birds she asked being so close to the tracks they got used to it when they were still in their shells he replied and went to greet the pigeons she watched him talking to them paddling his fingers against the wire mesh he was a strange one no doubt of that but no stranger than she probably what surprised her was the casual way they dealt with the imponderables which had suddenly entered their lives they stood she sensed on a threshold in the realm beyond a little strangeness might be a necessity cal suddenly turned from the cage gikhrist he said with a fierce grin i just remembered they talked about a guy called gilchrist who did when i was on the wall the removal men god yes i looked at the birds and it all came back i was on the wall and they were talking about selling the carpet to someone called gilchrist thats our man then cal was back in the house in moments i dont have any cake brendan said as his son made for the telephone in the hallway whats the panic its nothing much said suzanna brendan poured her a cup of coffee while cal rifled through the directory youre not a local lass are you brendan said i live in london never liked london he commented soulless place ive got a studio in muswell hill youd like it when brendan looked puzzled at this she added i make pottery ive found it said cal directory in hand k w gilchrist he read secondhand retailer whats all this about said brendan ill give them a call cal said its sunday said suzanna lot of these places are open sunday morning he replied and returned to the hallway are you buying something brendan said in a manner of speaking suzanna replied cal dialled the number the receiver at the other end was picked up promptly a woman said gilchrists hello said cal id like to speak to mr gilchrist please there was a beats silence then the woman said mr gilchrists dead jesus shadwell was fast cal thought but the telephonist hadnt finished hes been dead eight years she said her voice had less colour than the speaking clock whats your enquiry concerning a carpet said cal you want to buy a carpet no not exactly i think a carpet was brought to your saleroom by mistake by mistake thats right and i have to have it back urgently im afraid youll have to speak to mr wilde about that could you put me through to mr wilde then please hes in the isle of wight when will he be back thursday morning youll have to ring back then surely that must be he stopped realizing the line was dead damn he said he looked up too see suzanna standing at the kitchen door nobody there to talk to he sighed where does that leave us like thieves in the night she replied softly when cal and the woman had gone brendan sat awhile watching the garden hed have to get to work on it soon eileens letter had chastized him for being so lax in its upkeep musing on the letter inevitably led him back to its carrier the celestial mr shadwell without analysing why he got up and went to the phone consulting the card the angel had given him then dialled his memory of the encounter with shadwell had almost been burned away by the brightness of the gift the salesman had brought but thered been a bargain made that he did remember and it somehow concerned cal is that mr shadwell who is this please its brendan mooney oh brendan how good to hear your voice do you have something to tell me about cal he went to a warehouse for furniture and such did he indeed then we shall find him and make him a happy man was he alone no there was a woman with him a lovely woman her name suzanna parrish and the warehouse a vague twinge of doubt touched brendan why is it you need cal i told you a prize oh yes a prize something to take his breath away the warehouse brendan we have a deal after all fairs fair brendan put his hand into his pocket the letter was still warm there was no harm in making bargains with angels was there what could be safer he named the warehouse they only went for a carpet brendan said the receiver clicked are you still there he said but the divine messenger was probably already winging his way ix finders keepers gilchrists secondhand furniture warehouse had once been a cinema in the years when cinemas were still palatial follies a folly it remained with its mockrococo facade and the unlikely dome perched on its roof but there was nothing remotely palatial about it now it stood within a stones throw of the dock road the only property left in its block that remained in use the rest were either boarded up or burned out standing at the corner of jamaica street staring across at the dereliction cal wondered if the late mr gilchrist would have been proud to have his name emblazoned across such a decayed establishment business could not flourish here unless they were the kind of dealings best done out of the public eye the opening times of the warehouse were displayed on a weatherbeaten board where the cinema had once announced its current fare sundays it was open between ninethirty and twelve it was now onefifteen the doubledoors were closed and bolted and a pair of huge ironwork gates a grotesque addition to the facade padlocked in front of the doors what are your housebreaking skills like cal asked suzanna underdeveloped she replied but im a fast learner they crossed jamaica street for a closer inspection there was little need to pretend innocence there had been no pedestrians on the street since theyd arrived and traffic was minimal there must be some way in said suzanna you head round the far side ill go this way right meet you at the back they parted whereas cals route had taken him into shadow suzannas left her in bright sunlight oddly she found herself longing for some clouds the heat was making her blood sing as though she was tuned in to some alien radiostation and its melodies were whining around her skull as she listened to them cal stepped around the corner startling her ive found a way he said and led her round to what had once been the cinemas emergency exit it too was padlocked but both chain and lock were well rusted he had already found himself half a brick with which he now berated the lock brickshards flew off in all directions but after a dozen blows the chain surrendered cal put his shoulder to the door and pushed there was a commotion from inside as a mirror and several other items piled against the door toppled over but he was able to force a gap large enough for them to squeeze through the interior was a kind of purgatory in which thousands of household items armchairs wardrobes lamps large and small curtains rugs awaited judgment piled up in dusty wretchedness the place stank of its occupants of things claimed by woodworm and rot and sheer usage of once fine pieces now so ageworn even their makers would not have given them house room and beneath the smell of decrepitude something more bitter and more human the scent of sweat perhaps soaked up by the boards of a sick bed or in the fabric of a lamp that had burned through a night whose endurer had known no morning not a place to linger too long they separated once more for speeds sake anything that looks promising cal said holler he was now eclipsed by piles of furniture the whine in suzannas skull did not die down once she was out of the sun it worsened maybe it was the enormity of the task before them that made her head spin like an impossible quest from some faerytale seeking a particle of magic in the wilderness of decay the same thought though formulated differently was passing through cals mind the more he searched the more he doubted his memory maybe it hadnt been gilchrist theyd named or perhaps the removal men had decided the profit made bringing the carpet here would not repay their effort as he turned a corner he heard a scraping sound from behind a stack of furniture suzanna he said the word went out and returned unanswered the noise had already faded behind him but it had sent adrenalin rushing through his system and it was with speedier step that he made his way to the next mountain of goods and chattels even before he came within five yards of it his eyes had alighted upon the rolled carpet that was all but concealed beneath half a dozen dining chairs and a chest of drawers all of these items lacked pricetags which suggested they were recent unsorted acquisitions he went down on his knees and pulled at the edge of the carpet in an attempt to see the design the border was damaged the weave weak when he pulled he felt strands snap but he could see enough to confirm what his gut already knew that this was the carpet from rue street the carpet which mimi laschenski had lived and died protecting the carpet of the fugue he stood up and started to unpile the chairs deaf to the sound of approaching footsteps at his back the first thing suzanna saw was a shadow on the ground she looked up a face appeared between two wardrobes only to move off again before she could call it by its name mimi it was mimi she walked over to the wardrobes there was no sign of anyone was she losing her sanity first the din in her head now hallucinations and yet why were they here if they didnt believe in miracles doubt was drowned in a sudden rush of hope that the dead might somehow break the seal on the invisible world and come amongst the living she called her grandmothers name softly and she was granted an answer not in words but in the scent of lavender water off to her left down a corridor of piled teachests a ball of dust rolled and came to rest she went towards it or rather towards the source of the breeze that had carried it the scent getting stronger with every step she took thats my property i believe said the voice at cals back he turned shadwell was standing a few feet from him his jacket was unbuttoned perhaps youd stand aside mooney and let me claim whats mine cal wished hed had the presence of mind to come here armed at that moment hed have had no hesitation in stabbing shadwell through his gleaming eye and calling himself a hero for it as it was all he had were his bare hands theyd have to suffice he took a step towards shadwell but as he did so the man stood aside there was somebody standing behind him one of the sisters no doubt or their bastards cal didnt wait to see but turned and picked up one of the chairs from those dumped on the carpet his action brought a small avalanche chairs spilling between him and the enemy he threw the one he held towards the shadowy form that had taken shadwells place he picked up a second and threw it the way of the first but now the target had disappeared into the labyrinth of furniture so had the salesman cal turned his muscles fired and put his back into shifting the chest of drawers he succeeded the chest toppled backwards knocking over several other pieces as it fell he was glad of the commotion perhaps it would draw suzannas attention now he reached to take possession of the carpet but as he did so something seized him from behind he was dragged bodily from his prize a small section of the carpet coming away in his hand then he was flung across the floor he came to a halt against a pile of ornately framed paintings and photographs several of which toppled and smashed he lay amid the litter of glass for a moment to catch his breath but the next sight snatched it from him again the byblow was coming at him out of the gloom get up it told him he was dead to its instruction his attention claimed by the face before him it wasnt elroys offspring though this monstrosity also had its fathers features no this child was his the horror hed glimpsed stirring from the lullaby hed heard lying in the dirt of the rubbish tip had been all too real the sisters had squeezed his seed from him and this beast with his face was the consequence it was not a fine likeness its naked body was entirely hairless and there were several horrid distortions the fingers of one hand were twice their natural length and those of the other halfinch stumps while from the shoulder blades eruptions of matter sprang like malformed wings parodies perhaps of the creatures his dreams envied it was made in more of its fathers image than the other beasts had been however and faced with himself he hesitated it was enough that hesitation to give the beast the edge it leapt at him seizing his throat with its longfingered hand its touch without a trace of warmth its mouth sucking at his as if to steal the breath from his lips it intended patricide no doubt of that its grip was unconditional he felt his legs weaken and the child allowed him to collapse to his knees following him down the knuckles of his fingers brushed against the glass shards and he made a fumbling attempt to pick one up but between mind and hand the instruction lost urgency the weapon dropped from his hand somewhere in that place of breath and light from which he was outcast he heard shadwell laughing then the sound stopped and he was staring at his own face which looked back at him as if from a corrupted mirror his eyes which hed always liked for the paleness of their colour the mouth which though it had been an embarrassment to him as a child because hed thought it too girlish hed now trained into a modicum of severity when the occasion demanded and which was he was told capable of a winning smile the ears large and protuberant a comedians ears on a face that warranted something sleeker probably most people slip out of the world with such trivialities in their heads certainly it was that way for cal thinking of his ears the undertow took hold of him and dragged him down x the menstruum suzanna knew the instant before she stepped into what had once been the cinema foyer that this was an error even then she might have retreated but that she heard mimis voice speak her name and before any argument could stay her step her feet had carried her through the door the foyer was darker than the main warehouse but she could see the vague figure of her grandmother standing beside the boardedup boxoffice mimi she said her mind a blur of contrary impressions here i am said the old lady and opened her arms to suzanna the proffered embrace was also an error of judgment but on the part of the enemy gestures of physical affection had not been mimis forte in life and suzanna saw no reason to suppose her grandmother would have changed her habits upon expiring youre not mimi she said i know its a surprise seeing me the wouldbe ghost replied the voice was soft as a featherfall but theres nothing to be afraid of who are you you know who i am came the response suzanna didnt linger for any further words of seduction but turned to retrace her path there were perhaps three yards between her and the exit but now they seemed as many miles she tried to take a step on that long road but the commotion in her head suddenly rose to deafening proportions the presence behind her had no intention of letting her escape it sought a confrontation and it was a waste of effort to defy it so she turned and looked the mask was melting though there was ice in the eyes that emerged from behind it not fire she knew the face and though shed not thought herself ready to brave its fury yet she was strangely elated by the sight the last shreds of mimi evaporated and immacolata stood revealed my sister she said the air around her dancing to her words my sister the hag had me play that part she thought she saw mimi in your face she was right wasnt she youre her child grandchild suzanna murmured child came the certain reply suzanna stared at the woman before her fascinated by the masterwork of grief halfconcealed in those features immacolata flinched at her scrutiny how dare you pity me she said as if shed read suzannas thought and on the words something leapt from her face it came too fast for suzanna to see what it was she had time only to throw herself out of its whining path the wall behind her shook as it was struck the next instant the face was spilling more brightness towards her suzanna was not afraid the display only elated her further this time as the brightness came her way her instinct overruled all constraints of sanity and she put her hand out as if to catch the light it was like plunging her arm into a torrent of icewater a torrent in which innumerable fish were swimming fast fast against the flood swimming to spawn she closed her fist snatching at this brimming tide and pulled the action had three consequences one a cry from immacolata two the sudden cessation of the din in suzannas head three all that her hand had felt the chill the torment and the shoal it contained all of that was suddenly within her her body was the flood not the body of flesh and bone but some other anatomy made more of thought than of substance and more ancient than either somehow it had recognized itself in immacolatas assault and thrown off its sleep never in her life had she felt so complete in the face of this feeling all other ambition for happiness for pleasure for power all others faded she looked back at immacolata and her new eyes saw not an enemy but a woman possessed of the same torrent that ran in her own veins a woman twisted and full of anguish but for all that more like her than not that was stupid said the incantatrix was it said suzanna she didnt think so better you remained unfound better you never tasted the menstruum the menstruum now youll know more than you wish to know feel more than you ever wanted to feel there seemed to be something approximating pity in immacolatas voice so the grief begins she said and it will never end believe me you should have lived and died a cuckoo is that how mimi died said suzanna the ice eyes flickered she knew what risks she took she had seerkind blood and thats always run freely youre of their blood too through that bitch granddam of yours seerkind so many new words are they the fugue people theyre dead people came the reply dont look to them for answers theyre dust soon enough gone the way everything in this stinking kingdom goes to dirt and mediocrity well see to that youre alone like she was that we reminded her of the salesman and the potency of the coat he wore is shadwell a seerkind she asked him the thought was apparently preposterous no any power hes gots my gift why said suzanna she understood little of immacolata but enough to know that she and shadwell were not a perfect match he taught me the incantatrix began her hand moving up to her face he taught me the show the hand passed across her features and upon reappearing she was smiling almost warmly youll need that now and for that youre his mistress the sound that came from the woman might have been a laugh but only might i leave love to the magdalene sister shes an appetite for it ask mooney cal shed forgotten cal if he has the breath to answer suzanna glanced back towards the door go on said immacolata go find him i wont stop you the brightness in her the menstruum knew the incantatrix was telling the truth that flood was part of them both now it bonded them in ways suzanna could not yet guess at the battles already lost sister immacolata murmured as suzanna reached the threshold while you indulged your curiosity the fugues fallen into our hands suzanna stepped back into the warehouse fear beginning for the first time not for herself but for cal she yelled his name into the murk too late said the woman behind her cal there was no reply she started to search for him calling his name at intervals her anxiety growing with each unanswered shout the place was a maze twice she found herself in a location shed already searched it was the glitter of broken glass that drew her attention and then lying face down a little way from it cal before she got close enough to touch him she sensed the profundity of his stillness he was too brittle the menstruum in her said you know how these cuckoos are she rejected the thought it wasnt hers dont be dead that was hers it slipped from her as she knelt down beside him a plea to his silence please god dont be dead she was frightened to touch him for fear of discovering the worst all the while knowing that she was the only help he had his head was turned towards her his eyes closed his mouth open trailing bloodtinged spittle instinctively her hand went to his hair as if she might stroke him awake but pragmatism had not entirely deserted her and instead her fingers sought the pulse in his neck it was weak so the grief begins immacolata had said mere minutes before had she known even as she offered that prophecy that cal was half way to dying already of course shed known known and welcomed the grief this would bring because she wanted suzannas pleasure in the menstruum soured from its discovery wanted them sisters in sorrow distracted by the realization she focused again on cal to find that her hand had left his neck and was once again stroking his hair why was she doing this he wasnt a sleeping child he was hurt he needed more concrete help but even as she rebuked herself she felt the menstruum start to rise from her lower abdomen washing her entrails and lungs and heart and moving without any conscious instruction down her arm towards cal before it had been indifferent to his wounding you know how these cuckoos are it had said to her but her rage or perhaps her sadness had chastened it now she felt its energies carry her need to wake him to heal him through the palm of her hand and into his sealed head it was both an extraordinary sensation and one she felt perfectly at ease with when at the last moment it seemed not to want to go she pressed it forward and it obeyed her its stream flowing into him it was hers to control she realized with a rush of exhilaration which was followed immediately by an ache of loss as the body below her drank the torment down he was greedy for healing her joints began to jitter as the menstruum ran from her and in her skull that alien song rose like a dozen sirens she tried to take her hand from his head but her muscles wouldnt obey the imperative the menstruum had taken charge of her body it seemed shed been too hasty assuming control would be easy it was deliberately depleting itself to teach her not to press it an instant before she passed out it decided enough was enough and removed her hand the flow was abruptly stemmed she put her shaking hands up to her face cals scent on her fingertips by degrees the whine in her skull wound down the faintness began to pass are you all right cal asked her she dropped her hands and looked across at him hed raised himself from the ground and was now gingerly investigating his bloodied mouth i think so she said you til do he replied i dont know what happened the words trailed away as the memory came back and a look of alarm crossed his face the carpet he hauled himself to his feet looking all around i had it in my hand he said jesus i had it in my hand theyve taken it she said she thought he was going to cry the way his features crumpled up but it was rage that emerged fucking shadwell he shouted sweeping a copse of tablelamps off the top of a chestofdrawers ill kill him i swear she stood up still feeling giddy and her downcast eyes caught sight of something in the litter of broken glass beneath their feet she stooped again cleared the fragments and there was a piece of the carpet she picked it up they didnt get it all she said offering the find to cal the anger melted from his face he took it from her almost reverentially and studied it there were half a dozen motifs worked into the piece though he could make no sense of them suzanna watched him he held the fragment so delicately as though it might bruise then he sniffed hard and wiped his nose with the back of his hand fucking shadwell he said again but softly now numbly what do we do now she wondered aloud he looked up at her this time there were tears in his eyes get out of here he said see what the sky says huh he offered a tiny smile sorry he said must be mad mooney talking part three the exiles wandering between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born matthew arnold the grande chartreuse i the river the defeat theyd sustained was utter the salesman had snatched the weave from cals very fingers but though they had nothing to be jubilant about they had at least survived the clash was it simply that fact that made his spirits rise when they stepped out of the warehouse into the warm air it smelt of the mersey of silt and salt and it was there at suzannas instigation they went they walked without exchanging a word down jamaica street to the dock road then followed the high black wall that bounded the docks until they found a gate that gave them access to the wharfs the region was deserted it was years since the last of the big cargo vessels had berthed here to unload they wandered through a ghosttown of empty warehouses to the river itself cals gaze creeping back and back again to the face of the woman at his side there was some change in her he sensed some freight of hidden feeling which he couldnt unlock the poet had something to say on the subject lost for words boy he piped up in cals head shes a strange one isnt she that was certainly the truth from his first sight of her at the bottom of the stairs shed seemed haunted they had that in common they shared too the same determination fuelled perhaps by an unspoken fear that theyd lose sight of the mystery theyd dreamt of for so long or was he kidding himself reading lines from his own story into her face was it just his eagerness to find an ally that made him see similarities between them she was staring into the river snakes of sunlight from the water playing on her face hed known her only a night and a day but she awoke in him the same contradictions unease and profound contentment a sense that she was both familiar and unknown that his first glimpse of the fugue had aroused he wanted to tell her this and more if he could just find the words but it was suzanna who spoke first i saw immacolata she said while you were facing shadwell yes i dont quite know how to explain what happened she began haltingly still staring at the river as though mesmerized by its motion he understood some of what she was telling him that mimi was part of the seerkind the occupants of the fugue and suzanna her granddaughter had that peoples blood in her but when she began to talk about the menstruum the power shed somehow inherited or plugged into or both he lost any hold on what she was saying in part because her talk became vaguer dreamier in part because staring at her as she struggled to find the words for her feelings gave him the words for his own i love you he said she had stopped trying to describe the torrent of the menstruum just given herself over to the rhythm of the water as it lapped against the wharf he wasnt sure shed heard him she didnt move didnt speak finally she just said his name he suddenly felt foolish she didnt want professions of love from him her thoughts were somewhere else entirely in the fugue perhaps where after this afternoons revelations she had more right to be than he im sorry he muttered attempting to cover his faux pas with further fumblings i dont know why i said that forget i spoke his denial stung her from her trance her gaze left the river and found his face a look of hurt in her eyes as though drawing her gaze from its brilliance pained her dont say that she said never say that she stepped towards him and put her arms around him holding him hard he answered the demand and hugged her in return her face was hot against his neck wetting him not with kisses but with tears they didnt speak but stood like that for several minutes while the river flowed on at their side eventually he said shall we go back to the house she stepped back and looked at him seeming to study his face is it all over or just beginning she asked he shook his head she made a tiny sideways glance back at the river but before its liquid life could claim her again he took hold of her hand and led her back towards the concrete and the brick ii waking in the dark they returned through a dusk that had autumn in its hollows to chariot street there they scoured the kitchen for something to placate their growling stomachs ate then retired to gals room with a bottle of whisky theyd bought on the way back the intended debate on what they should do next soon faltered a mixture of tiredness and an unease generated by the scene at the river made the conversation hesitant they circled the same territory over and over but there were no inspirations as to how they should proceed the only token they had of their adventures to date was the carpet fragment and it offered up no clues the exchange dwindled halffinished sentences punctuated by longer and still longer silences around eleven brendan came home hailing cal from below then retired to bed his arrival stirred suzanna i should go she said its late the thought of the room without her made cals heart sink why not stay he said its a small bed she replied but its comfortable she put her hand to his face and brushed the bruised place around his mouth were not meant to be lovers she said quietly were too much alike it was bluntly put and it hurt to have it said but in the same moment as having any sexual ambition dampened he had a different and finally more profound hope confirmed that they belonged together in this enterprise she the child of the fugue he the innocent trespasser against the brief pleasure of making love to her he set the grander adventure and he knew despite the dissension from his cock that he had the better of the deal then well sleep he said if you want to stay she smiled i want to stay she said they stripped off their dirty clothing and slipped beneath the covers sleep was upon them before the lamp had cooled it was not empty sleep far from it there were dreams or rather a particular dream which filled both their heads they dreamt a noise a planet of bees all buzzing fit to burst their honeyed hearts a rising swell that was summers music they dreamt smell a confusion of scents of streets after rain and faded cologne and wind out of a warm country but most of all they dreamt sight it began with a pattern a knotting and weaving of countless strands dyed in a hundred colours carrying a charge of energy which so dazzled the sleepers they had to shield their minds eyes and then as if the pattern was becoming too ambitious to hold its present order the knots began to slide and slip the colours at each intersection bled into the air until the vision was obscured in a soup of pigments through which the loosed strands described their liberty in line and comma and dot like the brushstrokes of some master calligrapher at first the marks seemed quite arbitrary but as each trace drew colour to itself and another stroke was laid upon it and another upon that it became apparent that forms were steadily emerging from the chaos where dreammoments ago thered been only warp and weft there were now five distinct human forms appearing from the flux the invisible artist adding detail to the portraits with insolent facility and now the voices of the bees rose singing in the sleepers heads gave names to these strangers the first of the quintet to be called was a young woman in a long dark dress her small face pale her closed eyes fringed with ginger lashes this the bees said is lilia pellida as if waking to her name lilia opened her eyes as she did so a rotund bearded individual in his fifties a coat draped over his shoulders and a brimmed hat on his head stepped forward frederick cammell the bees said and the eyes behind the coinsized lenses of his spectacles snapped open his hand went to his hat immediately and took it off to reveal a head of immaculately coiffured hair oiled to his scalp so he said and smiled two more now one impatient to be free from this world of dyes was also dressed as if for a wake the dour face of this third visitor did not suggest a taste for such indulgence apolline dubois the bees announced and the woman opened her eyes the scowl that instantly came to her face displaying teeth the colour of old ivory the last members of this assembly arrived together one a negro whose fine face even in repose was shaped for melancholy the other the naked baby he held in his arms drooling on his protectors shirt jerichau st louis the bees said and the negro opened his eyes he immediately looked down at the child he held who had begun to bawl even before his name was heard nimrod the bees called and though the baby was surely not yet a year old he already knew the two syllables of his name he raised his lids to reveal eyes that had a distinctly golden cast to them his waking brought the process to an end the colours the bees and the threads all retreated their tide leaving the five strangers stranded in cals room it was apolline dubois who spoke first this cant be right she said making for the window and pulling back the curtains where the hell are we and where are the others said frederick cammell his eyes had found the mirror on the wall and he was scrutinizing himself in it tutting he took a pair of scissors from his pocket and began to snip at some overlong hairs on his cheek thats a point said jerichau then to apolline what does it look like out there deserted said the woman its the middle of the night and what look for yourself she said sucking spit through her broken teeth theres something amiss here she turned from the window things arent the way they were it was lilia pellicia who took apollines place at the sill shes right the girl said things are different and whys it only us who are here frederick asked for the second time thats the real point somethings happened said lilia softly something terrible no doubt you feel it in your kidneys apolline remarked as usual lets keep it civil miss dubois said frederick with the pained expression of a school master dont call me miss apolline said im a married woman immersed in sleep cal and suzanna listened to these exchanges entertained by the nonsenses their imaginations had conjured up yet for all the oddity of these people their antiquated clothes their names their absurd conversations they were uncannily real every detail perfectly realized and as though to confuse the dreamers further the man the bees had called jerichau now looked towards the bed and said perhaps they can tell us something lilia turned her pale gaze towards the slumbering pair we should wake them she said and reached to shake the sleepers this is no dream suzanna realized as she pictured lilias hand approaching her shoulder she felt herself rising from sleep and as the girls fingers touched her she opened her eyes the curtains had been pulled apart as shed imagined theyd been the street lamps cast their light into the little room and there standing watching the bed were the five her dream made flesh she sat up the sheet slipped and the gaze of both jerichau and the child nimrod flitted to her breasts she pulled the sheet over her and in so doing uncovered cal the chill stirred him he peered at her through barely open eyes whats going on he asked his voice slurred by sleep wake up she said weve got visitors i had this dream he muttered then visitors he looked up at her following her gaze into the room oh sweet jesus the child was laughing in jerichaus arms pointing a stubby finger at cals pissproud groin he snatched up a pillow and concealed his enthusiasm is this one of shadwells tricks he whispered i dont think so said suzanna whos shadwell apolline wanted to know another cuckoo no doubt said frederick who had his scissors at the ready should either of these two prove belligerent at the word cuckoo suzanna began to understand immacolata had first used the term speaking of humankind the fugue she said naming the place had every eye upon her and jerichau demanding what do you know about the fugue not much she replied you know where the others are frederick asked what others and the land said lilia where is it all cal had taken his eyes off the quintet and was looking at the table beside the bed where hed left the fragment of the weave it had gone they came from that piece of carpet he said not quite believing what he was saying that was what i dreamt i dreamt it too said suzanna a piece of the carpet said frederick aghast you mean were separated yes cal replied wheres the rest apolline said take us to it we dont know where it is said cal shadwells got it damn cuckoos the woman erupted you cant trust any of them all twisters and cheats hes not alone suzanna replied his partners one of your breed i doubt that said frederick its true immacolata the name brought an exclamation of horror from both frederick and jerichau apolline ever the lady simply spat on the floor have they not hanged that bitch yet she said twice to my certain knowledge jerichau replied she takes it as flattery lilia remarked cal shuddered he was cold and tired he wanted dreams of sunlit hills and bright rivers not these mourners their faces riddled with spite and suspicion ignoring their stares he threw away the pillow walked over to where his clothes lay on the floor and started to pull on his shirt and jeans and where are the custodians said frederick addressing the entire room does anyone know that my grandmother said suzanna mimi yes said frederick homing in wheres she dead im afraid there were other custodians said lilia infected by fredericks urgency where are they i dont know you were right said jerichau his expression almost tragic something terrible has happened lilia returned to the window and threw it open can you sniff it out frederick asked her is it nearby lilia shook her head the air stinks she said this isnt the old kingdom its cold cold and filthy cal whod dressed by now pushed his way between frederick and apolline and picked up the bottle of whisky want a drink he said to suzanna she shook her head he poured himself a generous measure and drank we have to find this shadwell of yours jerichau said to suzanna and get the weave back whats the hurry said apolline with a perverse nonchalance she waddled over to cal mind if i partake she said reluctantly he handed her the bottle what do you mean whats the hurryt frederick said we wake up in the middle of nowhere alone were not alone said apolline swallowing a gulletful of whisky weve got our friends here she cocked a lopsided smile at cal whats your name sweet calhoun and hert suzanna im apolline this is freddy cammell made a small formal bow thats lilia pellicia over there and the brat is her brother nimrod and im jerichau there said apolline now were all friends right we dont need the rest of them let em rot theyre our people jerichau reminded her and they need our help is that why they left us in the border she retorted sourly the whisky bottle hovering at her lips again no they put us where we could get lost and dont try and make any better of it were the din bandits and bawds and god knows what else she looked at cal oh yes she said youve fallen amongst thieves we were a shame to them every one of us then to the others its better were separated we get to have some wild times as she spoke cal seemed to see flashes of iridescence ignite in the folds of her widows weeds theres a whole world out there she said ours to enjoy lost is still lost said jerichau apollines reply was a bullish snort hes right said freddy without the weave were refugees you know how much the cuckoos hate us always have always will youre damn fools said apolline and returned to the window taking the whisky with her were a little out of touch freddy said to cal maybe you could tell us what year this is cal laughed give or take eighty years he said the other man visibly paled turning his face to the wall lilia let out a pained sound as though shed been stabbed shaking she sat down on the edge of the bed eighty years jerichau murmured why did they wait so long freddy asked of the hushed room what happened that they should wait so long please stop talking in riddles suzanna said and explain we cant said freddy youre not seerkind oh dont talk such drivel apolline snapped wheres the harm tell them lilia said jerichau i protest freddy said tell them as much as they need to know said apolline if you tell it all were here til doomsday lilia sighed why me she said still shaking why should i have to tell it because youre the best liar jerichau replied with a tight smile you can make it true she threw him a baleful glance very well she said and began to tell iii what she told we werent always lost she began once we lived in a garden two sentences in and apolline was interrupting thats just a story she informed cal and suzanna so let her tell it damn you jerichau told her believe nothing apolline advised this woman wouldnt know the truth if it fucked her in response lilia merely passed her tongue over her lips and took up where shed left off it was a garden she said thats where the families began what families said cal the four roots of the seerkind the lo the yeme the aia and babu the families from which were all descended some of us came by grubbier roads than others of course she said casting a barbed glance at apolline but all of us can trace our line back to one of those four me and nimrod were yeme it was our root that wove the carpet and look where it got us cammell growled serves us right for trusting weavers clever ringers and dull minds now the aia thats my root we have the craft and the grasp and you said cal to apolline reaching over and retrieving his bottle it had at best two swallows of spirits left in it all on my mothers side the woman replied thats what gave me my singing voice and on my fathers nobodys really sure he could dance a rapture could my father when he was sober said freddy what would you know apolline grimaced you never met my father once was enough for your mother freddy replied in an instant the baby laughed uproariously at this though the sense of it was well beyond his years anyhow said apolline he could dance which meant he had lo blood in him somewhere and babu too by the way you talk said lilia here jerichau broke in im babu he said take it from me breaths too precious to waste breath dancing music carpets cal tried to keep track of these skills and the families who possessed them but it was like trying to remember the kellaway clan the point is said lilia all the families had skills that humankind dont possess powers youd call miraculous to us theyre no more remarkable than the fact that bread rises theyre just ways to delve and summon raptures said cal is that what you called them thats right said lilia we had them from the beginning thought nothing of it at least not until we came into the kingdom then we realized that your kind like to make laws like to decree whats what and whether its good or not and the world being a loving thing and not wishing to disappoint you or distress you indulges you behaves as though your doctrines are in some way absolute thats arguable metaphysics freddy muttered the laws of the kingdom are the cuckoos laws said lilia thats one of capras tenets then capra was wrong came freddys reply seldom said lilia and not about this the world behaves the way the cuckoos choose to describe it out of courtesy thats been proved until somebody comes up with a better idea wait a minute said suzanna are you saying the earth somehow listens to us that was capras opinion and whos capra a great man or woman said apolline who may or may not have lived freddy went on but even if she didnt apolline said had a great deal to say for herself which answers nothing said suzanna thats capra for you said cammell go on lilia said cal tell the rest of the story she began again so theres you humankind with all your laws and your perimeters and your bottomless envy and theres us the families of the seerkind as different from you as day from night not so different said jerichau we lived amongst them once remember that and we were treated like filth said lilia with some feeling true said jerichau the skills we had she went on you cuckoos called magic some of them wanted it for themselves some were afraid of it but few loved us for it cities were small then you must understand it was difficult to hide in them so we retreated into the forests and the hills where we thought wed be safe there were many of us whod never ventured amongst the cuckoos in the first place said freddy especially the aia nothing to sell you see no use suffering the cuckoos if you had nothing to sell better be out in the great green thats pretension said jerichau you love cities as much as any of us true said freddy i like bricks and mortar but i envy the shepherd his solitude or his sheep his pastoral pleasures you cretin freddy said then to suzanna mistress you must understand that i do not belong with these people truly i dont he is a convicted thief she ran a bordello and this one she and her little brother there have so much grief on their hands a child said lilia looking at the baby how could you accuse an innocent please spare us the histrionics said freddy your brother may look like a babe in arms but we know better masquers both of you or else why were you in the border i might ask you the same question lilia retorted i was conspired against he protested my hands are clean never did trust a man with clean hands apolline muttered whore said freddy barber said the other which brought the outburst to a halt cal exchanged a disbelieving look with suzanna there was no love lost between these people that much was apparent so said suzanna you were telling us about hiding in the hills we werent hiding said jerichau we just werent visible theres a difference said cal oh certainly there are places sacred to us which most cuckoos could stand a yard from and not see and we had raptures said lilia to cover our tracks if humankind came too close which they did on occasion jerichau said some got curious started to poke around in the forests looking for trace of us they knew what you were then said suzanna no said apolline shed thrown a pile of clothes off one of the chairs and was straddling it no all they knew was rumour and hearsay called us all kinds of names shades and faeries all manner of shite only a few got really close though and that was only because we let them besides there werent that many of us said lilia weve never been very fertile never had much of a taste for copulation speak for yourself said apolline and winked at cal the point is we were mostly ignored and like apolline said when we did make contact it was for our own reasons perhaps one of your kind had some skill we could profit by horsebreeders winemerchants but the fact is as the centuries went by you became a lethal breed true said jerichau what little contact we had with you dwindled to almost nothing we left you to your bloodbaths and your envy why do you keep harking on envy said cal its what your kinds notorious for said freddy always after what isnt yours just for the having youre a perfect bloody species are you said cal hed tired of the endless remarks about cuckoos if we were perfect said jerichau wed be invisible wouldnt we the response fazed cal utterly no were flesh and blood like you he went on so of course were imperfect but we dont make such a song and dance about it you people you have to feel theres some tragedy in your condition or you think youre only half alive so why trust my grandmother to look after the carpet said suzanna she was a cuckoo wasnt she dont use that word said cal she was human she was of mixed blood apolline corrected him seerkind on her mothers side and cuckoo on her fathers i talked with her on two or three occasions we had something in common you see both had mixed marriages her first husband was seerkind and my husbands were all cuckoos but she was only one of several custodians the only woman the only one with any human blood too if i remember rightly we had to have at least one custodian who knew the kingdom who would seem perfectly unremarkable that way we hoped wed be ignored and finally forgotten all this just to hide from humankind said suzanna oh no said freddy we might have continued to live as we had on the margins of the kingdom but things changed i cant remember the year it began said apolline said lilia it was the year of the first fatalities what happened said cal to this day nobodys certain but something appeared out of the blue some creature with only one ambition to wipe us out what sort of creature lilia shrugged nobody ever saw its face and survived human said cal no it wasnt blind the way the cuckoos are blind it could sniff us out even our most vivid raptures couldnt deceive it for long and when it had passed by it would be as if those it had looked on had never existed we were trapped said jerichau on one side humankind growing more ambitious for territory by the day til we had scarcely a place left to hide and on the other the scourge as we called it whose sole intention seemed to be genocide we knew it could only be a matter of time before we were extinct which would have been a pity said freddy drily it wasnt all gloom and doom said apolline seems odd to say it but i had a fine time those last years desperation you know its the best aphrodisiac she grinned and we found one or two places where we were safe awhile where the scourge never sniffed us out i dont remember being happy said lilia i just remember the nightmares what about the hill said apolline what was it called the hill where we stayed the last summer i remember that as if it was yesterday rayments hill thats right rayments hill i was happy there but how long would it have lasted said jerichau sooner or later the scourge would have found us perhaps said apolline we had no choice said lilia we needed a hiding place somewhere the scourge would never look for us where we could sleep awhile until wed been forgotten the carpet said cal yes said lilia that was the refuge the council chose after endless debate said freddy during which time hundreds more died that final year when the loom was at work there were fresh massacres every week terrible stories terrible we were vulnerable of course said lilia because there were refugees coming from all over some of them bringing fragments of their territories things that had survived the onslaught all converging on this country in the hope of finding a place in the carpet for their properties like what houses pieces of land usually theyd get a good babu in who could put the field or the house or whatever it was into a screed that way it could be carried you see no i dont see said cal explain its your family said lilia to jerichau you explain we babus can make hieroglyphs jerichau said and carry them in our heads a great technician like my master quekett he could make a screed that could carry a small city i swear he could and speak it out again perfect down to the last tile describing this his long face brightened then a memory brought his joy down my master was in the low countries when the scourge found him he said gone he clicked his fingers like that whyd you all gather in england suzanna wanted to know it was the safest country in the world and the cuckoos of course were busy with empire we could get lost in the crowd while the fugue was woven into the carpet what is the fugue said cal its everything we could save from destruction pieces of the kingdom that the cuckoos had never truly seen and so wouldnt miss when they were gone a forest a lake or two a bend of one river the delta of another some houses which wed occupied some city squares even a street or two we put them together in a township of sorts nonesuch they called it said apolline damn fool name at first there was an attempt to put all this property into some kind of order said freddy but that soon fell by the wayside as refugees kept arriving with more to be woven into the carpet more every day thered be people waiting outside capras house for nights on end with some little niche they wanted kept from the scourge thats why it took so long said lilia but nobody was turned away said jerichau that was understood from the beginning anyone who wanted a place in the weave would be granted it even us said apolline who werent exactly lilywhites we were granted our places but why a carpet said suzanna whats more easily overlooked than the thing youre standing on said lilia besides the craft was one we knew everything has its pattern freddy put in if you find it the great can be contained within the small not everyone wanted to go into the weave of course said lilia some decided to stay amongst the cuckoos and take their chance but most went and what was it like like sleep like dreamless sleep we didnt age we didnt hunger we just waited until the custodians judged that it was safe to wake us again what about the birds said cal oh theres no end of flora and fauna woven in i dont mean in the fugue itself i mean my pigeons what have your pigeons got to do with this said apolline cal gave them a brief summary of how hed first come to discover the carpet thats the gyres influence said jerichau the gyre when you had your glimpse of the fugue said apolline you remember the clouds in its heart thats the gyre its where the looms housed how can a carpet contain the loom it was woven on said suzanna the loom isnt a machine said jerichau its a state of making it drew the elements of the fugue into a rapture which resembles a commonplace carpet but theres a good deal there that denies your human assumptions and the closer you get to the gyre the stranger things become there are places there in which ghosts of the future and past are at play we shouldnt talk about it said lilia its bad luck how much worse can our luck become freddy observed so few of us well wake the families as soon as we recover the carpet said jerichau the gyre must be getting restless or else how did this man get a look the weave cant hold forever hes right said apolline i suppose were obliged to do something about it but it isnt safe said suzanna safe for what out here i mean in the world in england the scourge must have given up said freddy after all these years so why didnt mimi wake you freddy pulled a face maybe she forgot about us forgot said cal impossible easy to say apolline replied but you have to be strong to resist the kingdom get in too deep and next thing you cant even remember your name i dont believe she forgot said cal our first priority said jerichau ignoring cals protest is to retrieve the carpet then we get out of this city and find a place where immacolata will never come looking what about us said cal what about you dont we get to see see what the fugue damn you cal said infuriated by the lack of anything approaching courtesy or gratitude from these people its not your concern now said freddy it damn well is he said i saw it almost got killed for it better you stay away then said jerichau if youre so concerned for your breath thats not what i meant cal said suzanna putting her hand on his arm her attempt to calm him merely inflamed him further dont side with them he said its not a question of sides she began but he wasnt about to be placated its easy for you he said youve got connections thats not fair and the menstruum what said apolline her voice silencing cal you apparently suzanna said and it didnt dissolve the flesh off your bones why should it do that not in front of him said lilia looking at cal that was the limit all right he said you dont want to talk in front of me thats fine you can all go fuck yourselves he started towards the door ignoring suzannas attempts to call him back behind him nimrod was tittering and you can shut the fuck up he told the child and left the room to its usurpers iv night terrors shadwell woke from a dream of empire a familiar fantasy in which he owned a vast store so vast indeed that it was impossible to see the far wall and he was selling doing trade to make an accountant weep for joy merchandise of every description heaped high on all sides ming vases toy monkeys sides of beef and customers beating at the doors desperate to join the throngs already clamouring to buy it wasnt oddly enough a dream of profit money had become an irrelevancy since hed stumbled upon immacolata who could conjure all they needed from thin air no the dream was one of power he the owner of the goods that people were bleeding to buy standing back from the crowd and smiling his charismatic smile but suddenly he was awake the clamour of customers was fading and he heard the sound of breathing in the darkened room he sat up the sweat of his enthusiasm chilling on his brow immacolata she was there standing against the far wall her palms seeking some hold in the plaster her eyes were wide but she saw nothing at least nothing that shadwell could share hed known her like this before most recently two or three days ago in the foyer of this very hotel he got out of bed and put on his dressing gown sensing his presence she murmured his name im here he replied again she said i felt it again the scourge he said his voice grey of course we have to sell the carpet and be done with it we will we will he said slowly approaching her the arrangements are underway you know that he spoke evenly to calm her she was dangerous at the best of times but these moods scared him more than most the calls have been made he said the buyersll come theyve been waiting for this theyll come and well make our sale and itll all be over with i saw the place it lives she went on there were walls huge walls and sand inside and out like the end of the world now her eyes found him and the hold this vision had on her seemed to deteriorate when shadwell she said when what the auction the day after tomorrow as we arranged she nodded strange she said her tone suddenly conversational the speed with which her moods changed always caught him unawares strange to have these nightmares after so long its seeing the carpet said shadwell it reminds you its more than that she said she went to the door that led through to the rest of shadwells suite and opened it the furniture had been pushed to the edges of the large room beyond so that their prize the weaveworld could be laid out she stood on the threshold staring at the carpet she didnt set her bare soles on it some superstition kept her from that trespass but paced along the border scrutinizing every inch half way along the far edge she stopped there she said and pointed down at the weave shadwell went to where she stood what is it a piece missing he followed her gaze the woman was right a small portion of the carpet had been torn away in the struggle at the warehouse most likely nothing significant he commented it wont bother our buyers believe me i dont care about the value she said what then use your eyes shadwell every one of those motifs is one of the seerkind he went down on his haunches and examined the markings in the border they were scarcely recognizable as human more like commas with eyes these are people he said oh yes riffraff the lowest of the low thats why theyre at the edge theyre vulnerable there but theyre also useful for what as a first defence immacolata replied her eyes fixed on the tear in the carpet the first to be threatened the first to wake said shadwell to wake you think theyre out there now he said his gaze went to the window theyd closed the curtains to keep anyone from spying on their treasure but he could picture the benighted city beyond the thought that there might be magic loose out there brought an unexpected charge yes the incantatrix said i think theyre awake and the scourge smells them in its sleep it knows shadwell so what do we do we find them before they attract any more attention the scourge may be ancient may be slow and forgetful but its power her voice faded away as though words were valueless in the face of such terrors she drew a deep breath before beginning again a days scarcely gone by she said when i havent watched the menstruum for a sign of it coming and itll come shadwell not tonight maybe but itll come and on that day therell be an end to all magic even to you even to me so we have to find them said shadwell not we said immacolata we neednt dirty our hands she started to walk back towards shadwells bedroom they cant have gone far she said as she went theyre strangers here at the door she stopped and turned to him on no account leave this room until we call you she said im going to summon someone to be our assassin who said shadwell nobody you ever met the incantatrix replied he was dead a hundred years before you were born but you and he had a good deal in common and where is he now in the ossuary at the shrine of the mortalities where he lost his life he wanted to prove himself my equal you see to seduce me so he tried to become a necromancer he might have done it too there was nothing he wouldnt dare but it went awry he brought the surgeons from some netherworld or other and they werent amused they pursued him from one end of london to the other at the last he broke into the shrine begged me to call them off her voice had become a whisper now but how could i she said hed made his conjurations all i could do was let the surgeons perform what tricks surgeons must and at the end when he was all blood he said to me take my soul she stopped then said so i did she looked at shadwell stay here she said and closed the door shadwell didnt need any encouragement to stay clear of the sisters while they were plotting if he never again set eyes on the magdalene and the hag he would count himself a lucky man but the ghosts were inseparable from their living sister each in some fashion incomprehensible to him a part of the other their perverse union was only one of the mysteries that attended them there were many others the shrine of mortalities for one it had been a gathering place for her cult when shed been at the height of her power and ambition but shed fallen from grace her desire to rule the fugue which had then still been a ragged collection of farflung settlements had been frustrated her enemies had assembled evidence against her listing crimes that had begun in her mothers womb and she and her followers had retaliated there had been bloodshed though shadwell had never gathered the scale of it the consequence however he had gathered vilified and humiliated immacolata had been forbidden to tread the magic earth of the fugue again she had not taken this exile well unable to mellow her nature and so pass unseen amongst the cuckoos her history became a round of bloodlettings pursuits and further bloodlettings though she was still known and worshipped by a cognoscenti who called her by a dozen different names the black madonna the lady of sorrows mater malifecorium she became nevertheless a victim of her own strange purity madness beckoned the only refuge from the banality of the kingdom she was exiled in that was how she had been when shadwell had found her a mad woman whose talk had been like none hed heard before and who spoke in her ramblings of things that could he but lay his hands upon them would make him mighty and now here they were those wonders all contained within a rectangle of carpet he approached the middle of it staring down at the spiral of stylized clouds and lightning called the gyre how many nights had he lain awake wondering what it would be like in that flux of energies like being with god perhaps or the devil he was shaken from these thoughts by a howl from the adjacent room and the lamp above his head suddenly dimmed as its light was sucked beneath the intersecting door testament to the profundity of darkness on the far side he moved to the opposite end of the room and sat down how long until dawn he wondered there was still no sign of morning when hours later it seemed the door opened there was only blackness beyond out of it immacolata said come and see he stood up his limbs stiff and hobbled to the door a wave of heat met him at the threshold it was like stepping into an oven in which cakes of human dirt and blood had been cooking dimly he could see immacolata standing floating perhaps a little way from him the air pressed against his throat he badly wanted to retreat but she beckoned look she instructed him staring off into the darkness our assassin came this is the rake shadwell could see nothing at first then a shred of fugitive energy skittered up the wall and upon contact with the ceiling threw down a wash of cankered light by it he saw the thing she called the rake had this once been a man it was difficult to believe the surgeons immacolata had spoken of had reinvented his anatomy he hung in the air like a slashed coat left on a hook his body somehow drawn out to superhuman height then as though a breeze had gusted up from the earth the body moved swelling and rising its upper limbs pieces of what might once have been human tissue held in an uneasy alliance by threads of mercurial cartilage were raised as if it were about to be crucified the gesture unwound the matter that blinded its head they fell away and shadwell could not prevent a cry from escaping him as he understood what surgery had been performed upon the rake theyd filleted him theyd taken every bone from his body and left a thing more fit for the oceanbed than the breathing world a wretched echo of humanity fuelled by the raptures the sisters had devised to bring it from limbo it swayed and swelled its skullless head taking on a dozen shapes as shadwell watched one moment it was all bulging eyes the next only a maw which howled its displeasure at waking to this condition hush immacolata told it the rake shuddered and its arms grew longer as if it wanted to kill the woman that had done this to it but it fell silent nevertheless domville immacolata said you once professed love for me it threw back its head then as if despairing of what desire had brought it to are you afraid my rake it looked at her its eyes like blood blisters close to bursting weve given you a little life she said and enough power to turn these streets upside down i want you to use it the sight of the thing made shadwell nervous is he in control of himself he whispered suppose he goes berserk let him she said i hate this city let him burn it up as long as he kills the seerkind i dont care what he does he knows he wont be allowed to rest until hes done as i ask and deaths the best promise hes ever had the blisters were still fixed on immacolata and the look in them confirmed her words very well shadwell said and turned away heading back into the adjoining room there was only so much of this magic a man could take the sisters had an appetite for it they liked to immerse themselves in these rites for himself he was content to be human well almost content v from the mouths of babes dawn crept over liverpool cautiously as if fearful of what it would find cal watched the light uncover the city and it seemed to him it was grey from gutter to chimney stack hed lived here all his life this had been his world the television and the glossy magazines had shown him different vistas on occasion but somehow hed never quite believed in them they were as remote from his experience or indeed from what he hoped to know in his seventy years as the stars that were winking out above his head but the fugue had been different it had seemed for a short sweet time a place he might truly belong hed been too optimistic the land might want him but its people didnt as far as they were concerned he was contemptibly human he loitered on the streets for an hour or so watching another liverpool monday morning get started were they so bad these cuckoos whose tribe he shared they smiled as they welcomed their cats in from a night of philandering they hugged their children as they departed for the day their radios played lovesongs at the breakfast table as he watched them he became fiercely defensive damn it hed go back and tell the seerkind what bigots they were as he approached the house he saw that the front door was wide open and that a young woman he recognized as a local but didnt know by name was standing at the top of the path staring into the house it was only as he came within a couple of paces of the front gate that he set eyes on nimrod he was standing on the welcome mat wearing a pair of sunglasses that hed filched from beside cals bed and a toga made from one of cals shirts is that your kid the woman asked cal as he opened the gate in a manner of speaking he started banging on the window when i went past isnt there anyone to look after him there is now said cal he looked down at the child remembering what freddy had said about nimrod only seeming to be a babe in arms having slid the sunglasses up onto his forehead nimrod was giving his visitor a look that fully confirmed cammells description cal had little option however but to play the part of father he picked nimrod up what are you doing he whispered to the child bussteds nimrod replied he was having some difficulty mastering the infantile palate el killum who but as nimrod went to answer the woman whod come down the path and was standing half a yard from the door spoke hes adorable she cooed before cal could make his excuses and close the door the child raised his arms and reached towards her a stagemanaged gurgle in his throat oh said the woman sweet thing and shed claimed nimrod from cal before he could prevent her cal caught a gleam in nimrods eyes as he was pressed to the womans ample bosom wheres his mother she asked shell be back in a while said cal making an attempt to claim nimrod from his luxury he didnt want to go he was beaming as he was rocked his pudgy fingers grappling with the womans breasts as soon as cal laid hands on him he began to bawl the woman hushed him pressing him closer to her at which nimrod began to toy with her nipples through the thin fabric of her blouse will you excuse us said cal braving nimrods fists and taking the babe from his pillows before he began to suckle shouldnt leave him alone the woman said absentmindedly touching her breast where nimrod had fondled her cal thanked her for her concern bye bye beautiful she said to the child nimrod blew a kiss at her a flash of confusion crossed her face then she backed away towards the gate the smile shed offered the child sliding from her lips what a damn fool thing to do nimrod was unrepentant he stood in the hallway where hed been set down and stared up at cal defiantly where are the others cal wanted to know out said nimrod well go too he was gaining control of his tongue by the syllable and of his limbs too he tottered to the front door and reached up towards the handle em sick of here he said too much bad news his fingers fell inches short of the handle however and after several failed attempts to snatch at it he beat his fists against the wood i want to see he said all right cal agreed just keep your voice down take me out the cry was genuinely forlorn there was little harm in giving the child a brief tour of the neighbourhood cal decided there was something perversely satisfying about the thought of carrying this miraculous creature out into the open air for all to see and more satisfying still the knowledge that thechild whom hed left laughing at him would be dependent upon him any lingering anger towards nimrod evaporated very quickly however as his powers of speech became more sophisticated they were soon involved in a fluent and animated exchange careless of the glances they were garnering they left me there he protested told me to fend for myself he held up his miniscule hand how i ask you how why are you shaped like this in the first place cal asked it seemed like a good idea at the time nimrod replied i had an irate husband in pursuit of me so i hid in the most unlikely form i could think of i thought id keep my head down for a few hours then loose myself again stupid really a rapture like this takes power and of course once the final weave began there was none to be had i was obliged to go into the carpet like this so how do you get back to normality i cant not until im back on fugue soil im helpless he pushed the sunglasses up to take a look at a passing beauty did you see the hips on her he said dont slaver babies are supposed to slaver not the way youre doing it nimrod ground his gums its noisy this world of yours he said and dirty dirtier than much i like it though you must tell me about it oh jesus said cal where do i begin anywhere you like nimrod replied youll find me a fast learner what he said was true on their halfhour walk around the vicinity of chariot street he questioned cal on a wild selection of topics some stimulated by something they saw in the street others more abstract first they talked of liverpool then of cities in general then of new york and hollywood talk of america took them on to eastwest relations at which point cal listed all the wars and assassinations he could remember since they touched briefly on the irish question and the state of english politics then on to mexico which they both had a yearning to visit and thence to mickey mouse the basic principle of aerodynamics and back via nuclear war and the immaculate conception to nimrods favourite subject women or rather to two in particular whod caught his eye in return for this short introduction to the late twentieth century nimrod gave cal a beginners guide to the fugue telling him first of capras house which was the building in which the council of the families met to debate then of the mantle the cloud that hid the gyre and the narrow bright the passage that led into its folds and from there to the firmament and the requiem steps the very names filled cal with yearning much was learned on both sides not least the fact that they might with time become friends no more talk said cal as they came full circle to the gate of the mooney house youre a baby remember how could i forget said nimrod with a pained look cal let himself in and called out to his father the house however was silent from attic to foundations hes not here said nimrod for gods sake put me down cal deposited the baby on the hallway floor he immediately began towards the kitchen i need a drink he said and i dont mean milk cal laughed til see what i can find he said and went through to the back room cals first impression seeing his father sitting in the armchair with his back to the garden was that brendan had died his stomach turned over he almost cried out then brendans eyes flickered and he looked up at his son dad said cal whats wrong tears were spilling down brendans cheeks he made no attempt to brush them away nor to stifle the sobs that shook him oh dad cal crossed to his father and went down on his haunches beside the chair its all right he said putting his hand on his fathers arm been thinking about mum brendan shook his head the tears tumbled words would not come cal didnt ask any further questions but held onto his fathers arm hed thought brendans melancholy had been lifting that the grief was blunted now apparently not at last brendan said i i had a letter a letter from your mother brendans liquid gaze fell on his son am i mad cal he said of course not dad of course not well i swear he put his hand down the side of the chair and plucked out a sodden handkerchief he wiped his nose its over there he said nodding towards the table look for yourself cal went to the table it was in her handwriting brendan said there was indeed a piece of paper lying on the table it had been much folded and unfolded and more recently wept upon it was a lovely letter he said telling me she was happy and i wasnt to go on grieving she said he stopped as a new bout of sobs overtook him cal picked the sheet up it was thinner than any paper hed ever set eyes on and it was blank on both sides she said she was waiting for me but that i shouldnt fret about that because waiting was a joy up there and and i should just get on with enjoying life for a while til i was called it wasnt just that the paper was thin cal now realized it seemed to be growing more insubstantial as he watched he put it back on the table the small hairs at the nape of his neck prickling i was so happy cal brendan was saying it was all i wanted knowing that she was happy and id be with her again one day theres nothing on the paper dad cal said softly its blank there was cal i swear it there was it was in her handwriting id know it anywhere then god in heaven it just faded away cal turned from the table to see his father practically folded up double in the chair sobbing as though his grief was beyond bearing he put his hand on his fathers hand which was gripping the threadbare arm of the chair hold on dad he murmured its a nightmare son brendan said its like i lost her twice you havent lost her dad why did her writing disappear like that i dont know dad he glanced back at the letter the sheet of paper had practically faded altogether where did the letter come from the old man frowned do you remember no no not really its hazy i remember somebody came to the door yes that was it somebody came to the door he told me he had something for me it was in his coat tell me what you see and its yours shadwells words echoed in cals skull have what you like free gratis and without charge that was a lie of course one of many there was always a charge what did he want dad in exchange can you remember brendan shook his head then frowning as he tried to recollect something about you he said i think he said he knew you he looked up at cal yes he did i remember now he said he knew you it was a trick dad a disgusting trick brendan narrowed his eyes as if trying to comprehend this and then suddenly the solution seemed to come clear i want to die cal no dad yes i do really i do i dont want to bother any longer youre just sad cal said softly itll pass i dont want it to brendan replied not now i just want to fall asleep and forget i ever lived cal reached and put his arms around his fathers neck at first brendan resisted the embrace hed never been a demonstrative man but then the sobs mounted again and cal felt his fathers thin arms stretch around him and they hugged each other tight forgive me cal brendan said through his tears can you do that shush dad dont be daft i let you down i never said the things all the things i felt not to her either never told her how much never could tell her how much i loved her she knew dad said cal his own tears blinding him now believe me she knew they held each other a little while longer it was small comfort but there was a heat of anger in cal that he knew would dry his tears soon enough shadwell had been here shadwell and his suit of deceptions in its folds brendan had imagined the letter from heaven and the illusion had lasted for as long as the salesman had needed him now brendan was redundant the carpet had been found so the magic no longer held the words had faded and finally the paper too returned to that nomans land between desire and consummation ill make some tea dad cal said it was what his mother would have done in the circumstances boiled some fresh water warmed the pot and counted out the spoonfuls of tea setting domestic order against the chaos in the hope of winning some temporary reprieve from the vale of tears vi events in a high wind as he stepped back into the hall cal remembered nimrod the back door was ajar and the child had tottered out into the wilderness of the garden dwarfed by the bushes cal went to the door and called after him but nimrod was busy pissing into a bed of rampant sweet william cal left him to it in his present condition the most gratification nimrod could hope for was a good piss as he set the kettle on the stove the bournemouth train thundered past a moment later nimrod was at the door good god he said how did you ever sleep here you get used to it said cal and keep your voice down my dadll hear you what happened to my drink itll have to wait ill bawl nimrod warned so bawl his bluff called nimrod shrugged and turned back to survey the garden i could get to love this world he announced and stepped out again into the sunlight cal picked up a soiled cup from the sink and rinsed it clean for his father then he crossed to the refrigerator in search of milk as he did so he heard nimrod make a small sound he turned and went to the window nimrod was staring up at the sky his face wide with wonder he was watching a plane go over no doubt cal retraced his steps as he took the milk which was practically the sole occupant of the refrigerator off the shelf there was a rapping on the front door he looked up again and two or three impressions hit him at the same time one that a breeze had suddenly got up from somewhere two that nimrod was stepping back into the thicket of raspberry bushes in search of a hiding place and three that it was not wonder on his face but fear then the rapping became a beating fists on the door as he made his way through the hall he heard his father say cal theres a child in the garden and from the garden a shout cal a child from the corner of his eye he saw brendan walk through the kitchen heading for the garden wait dad he said as he opened the front door freddy was on the step but it was lilia standing a little way behind him who said wheres my brother out in the garden he was going to say but the street scene outside left him mute the wind had picked up every item not nailed down litter dustbin lids pieces of garden furniture and flung them into an aerial tarantella it had uprooted flower beds and was picking up the soil from the borders staining the sun with a veil of earth a few pedestrians caught in this hurricane were clinging to lampposts and fences some were flat on the ground hands over their heads lilia and freddy stepped into the house the wind followed eager for fresh conquest roaring through the house and out again into the back garden its sudden gusts so strong cal was almost flung off his feet shut the door freddy yelled cal pushed the door closed and bolted it it rattled as the wind beat on the other side jesus said cal whats happening somethings come after us said freddy what i dont know lilia was already half way to the kitchen through the open door at the back it was almost night the air was so full of dirt and cal saw his father stepping over the threshold shouting something against the banshee howl of the wind beyond him only visible because of his toga nimrod was clinging to a bush as the wind tried to pick him up cal followed lilia at a run and overtook her at the kitchen door there was a commotion on the roof as a pack of slates were ripped away brendan was in the garden now all but eclipsed by the wind wait dad cal yelled as he crossed the kitchen his eyes grazed the teapot and the cup beside it and the utter absurdity of all this hit him like a hammer blow im dreaming he thought i fell from the wall and ive been dreaming ever since the world isnt like this the world is the teapot and the cup it isnt raptures and tornadoes in that instant of hesitation the dream became a nightmare through the gusting dirt he saw the rake it hung on the wind for a moment its form caught in a sliver of sun done for said freddy the words stung cal into moving he was through the back door and out into the garden before the rake could fall upon the pitiful figures below the beast drew cals astonished eyes he saw the morbid fashioning of its skin which made it billow and swell and heard again the howl that hed thought was simply the wind it was nothing so natural the sound came out of this phantasm from a dozen places either the din or the breath it rose on drawing most of the gardens contents out of the ground and throwing them into the air a rain of plants and stones came down on the occupants of the garden cal covered his head with his hands and ran blindly towards the spot where hed last seen his father brendan was flat on the ground shielding himself nimrod was not with him cal knew the route the garden path took like the back of his hand spitting out mud as he went he headed away from the house somewhere above now mercifully hidden the rake howled again and cal heard lilia cry out he did not look behind him for ahead he now saw nimrod who had reached the back fence and was attempting to tear at the rotted timbers he was having some success too despite his size cal ducked his head down as another rain of earth fell and ran past the pigeon loft towards the fence the howls had stopped but the wind was far from spent to judge by the din from the other side of the house it was tearing chariot street apart as he reached the fence cal turned round the sun stabbed the veil of dirt and he saw blue sky for an instant then a form blocked the sight and cal threw himself at the fence and started to scramble over as the creature moved towards him at the top his belt snagged on a nail he reached to release it certain that the rake was at his neck but mad mooney must have been pushing from behind for as he pulled his belt from its mooring he fell over the far side of the fence life and limb intact he stood up and saw why the boneless beast was hovering beside the loft its head weaving back and forth as it listened to the pigeons within silently blessing the birds cal ducked down and tore another plank of the fence away sufficient to pull nimrod through as a child hed had the dangers of this nomans land between fence and railway track beaten into him now such dangers seemed negligible beside whatever it was that loitered at the loft picking nimrod up in his arms cal climbed the gravel embankment towards the rails run said nimrod its just behind us run cal looked north and south the wind had reduced visibility to ten or fifteen yards in both directions heart in mouth he stepped over the first rail and onto the oilslicked space between the sleepers there were four tracks altogether two in each direction he was stepping towards the second when he heard nimrod say shit cal turned heels grinding in the gravel to see that their pursuer had forsaken birdfancying and was rising over the fence behind the beast he saw lilia pellicia she was standing in the ruins of the mooney garden her mouth open as if to shout but no sound emerged or at least none that cal could hear the beast was not so insensitive however it halted in its advance turning back towards the garden and the woman in it what happened next was confused both by the wind and nimrod who forseeing his sisters slaughter began to struggle in cals arms all cal saw was the billowing form of their pursuer suddenly flicker and the next moment he heard lilias voice swoop into an audible register it was a cry of anguish she let loose echoed by nimrod then the wind blew up again shrouding the garden just as cal glimpsed lilias form swathed in white fire the cry stopped abruptly as it did so a tingling in the soles of his feet announced the approach of a train which direction was it coming from and on which track the murder of lilia had further excited the wind he could now see less than ten yards down the line in either direction knowing there was no safety the way theyd come he turned from the garden as the beast let out another scalpcrawling commotion think he told himself in moments it would be after them again he wrenched his arm around nimrod and looked at his watch it read twelve thirtyeight where would the train be heading at twelve thirtyeight to lime street station or from it think nimrod had begun to cry not an infantile bawling but a deep heartfelt sob of loss cal glanced over his shoulder as the trembling in the gravel grew more insistent again a tear in the veil of dust gave him a glimpse of the garden lilias body had disappeared but cal could see his father standing in the devastation as lilias killer rose above him brendans face was slack either he failed to comprehend his danger or didnt care he moved not a muscle the shout said cal to nimrod lifting the child up so that they were face to snotty face the shout she made nimrod just sobbed can you make that shout the beast was almost upon brendan make it cal yelled at nimrod shaking him til his gums rattled make it or ill fucking kill you nimrod believed him go on cal said and nimrod opened his mouth the beast heard the sound it swung its ballooning head around and began to come at them again all this had taken seconds only but seconds in which the reverberations had deepened how far away was the train now a mile a quarter of a mile nimrod had ceased the shout and was fighting to be free of cal christ man he was yelling eyes on the terror approaching through the smoke its going to kill us cal tried to ignore nimrods cries and dug for access to that cool region of memory where the dates and destinations of the trains lay which line was it on and from which direction his mind flipped through the numbers like a station announcement board looking for a train six or seven minutes from departure or arrival at liverpool lime street the beast was climbing the gravel embankment the wind gave it skirts of dust and danced in and out of its lacerated frame moaning as it went the percussion of the trains approach was enough to make cals belly tremble and still the numbers flipped over where to where from fast train or slow think damn you the beast was almost upon them think he took a step backwards behind him the furthest track began to whine and with the whine came the answer it was the stafford train via runcorn its rhythm rose through his feet as it thundered to its destination twelve fortysix from stafford he said and stepped onto the humming line what are you doing nimrod demanded twelve fortysix he murmured it was a prayer by numbers the slaughterer was crossing the first of the northbound lines it had nothing but death to give no curse no sentence only death come and get us cal yelled at it are you insane nimrod said by way of reply cal lifted the bait a little higher nimrod bawled the pursuers head grew vast with hunger come on it had crossed both the northbound lines now it stepped onto the first of those headed south cal took another stumbling step backwards his heel hitting the furthest rail the voice of the beast and the roar in the ground shaking the fillings loose in his teeth the last thing he heard as the creature came to fetch him was nimrod running through a celestial checklist in search of a redeemer and suddenly as if in answer to his call the veil of dirty air divided and the train was upon them cal felt his foot catch on the rail and raised it an inch higher to step back then fell away from the track what followed was over in seconds one moment the creature was on the line its maw vast its appetite for death vaster still the next the train hit it there was no cry no moment of triumph seeing the monster undone just a foul stench as if every dead man in the vicinity had sat up and expelled a breath then the train was rushing by smeared faces peering from the windows and just as suddenly as it had appeared it was away through the curtain on its way south the whine in the rails receded to a sibilant whisper then even that was gone cal shook nimrod from his rollcall of deities its over he said it took nimrod a little while to accept the fact he peered through the smoke expecting the rake to come at them again its gone said cal i killed it the train killed it said nimrod put me down cal did so and without looking right or left nimrod started back across the tracks towards the garden where his sister had perished cal followed the wind that had come with the boneless creature or borne it had dropped completely as there was not even a light breeze to keep the dirt it had swept up aloft a deluge now descended small stones fragments of garden furniture and fencing even the remains of several household pets whod been snatched away a rain of blood and earth the like of which the good people of chariot street had not expected to see this side of judgment day vii the aftermath when the dust had begun to settle it was possible to assess the extent of the devastation the garden had been turned upside down of course as had all the other gardens along the row there were dozens of slates missing from the roof and the chimney stack looked less than secure the wind had been equally lethal at the front of the house all along the street havoc had been wreaked lamps toppled walls demolished car windows smashed by flying trash mercifully there seemed to be no serious casualties just cuts bruises and shock lilia of whom no sign remained was the only fatality that was immacolatas creature nimrod said til kill her for that i swear i will the threat sounded doubly hollow coming from his diminutive body whats the use said cal despondently he was watching through the front window as the occupants of chariot street wandered around in a daze some staring at the wreckage others squinting up at the sky as if expecting some explanation to be written there we won a substantial victory this afternoon mr mooney said frederick dont you understand that and it was your doing some victory said cal bitterly my dad sitting next door not saying a word lilia dead half the street torn apart well fight again said freddy until the fugues safe fight will we said nimrod and where were you when the shit was flying cammell was about to protest then thought better of it letting silence confess his cowardice two ambulances and several police cars had arrived at the far end of chariot street hearing the sirens nimrod joined cal at the window uniforms he muttered they always mean trouble as he spoke the door of the lead police car swung open and a sobersuited man stepped out smoothing his thinning hair back with the palm of his hand cal knew the fellows face his eyes so ringed with shadow he seemed not to have slept in years but as ever he could put no name to it we should get gone said nimrod theyll want to talk with us already a dozen uniformed police were fanning out amongst the houses to begin their enquiries what would his fellow charioteers have to report cal wondered had they glimpsed anything of the creature that had killed lilia and if so would they admit to it i cant go said cal i cant leave dad you think they wont sniff a rat if they speak to you said nimrod dont be an imbecile let your father tell them all he has to tell they wont believe it cal saw the sense in this but he was still reluctant to leave brendan alone what happened to suzanna and the others asked cammell as cal turned the problem over they went back to the warehouse to see if they could trace shadwell from there said freddy isnt likely is it said cal it worked for lilia said freddy you mean you know where the carpet is almost she and i went back to the laschenski house you see to take bearings from there she said the echoes were very strong echoes back from where the carpet now is to where it had been freddy fished in his pocket and brought out three shiny new paperbacks one of which was a liverpool and district atlas the others were murder mysteries i borrowed these from a confectioners he said to trace the carpet but you didnt succeed said cal as i said almost we were interrupted when she felt the presence of that thing that killed her she was always acute said nimrod that she was freddy replied as soon as she sniffed the beast on the wind she forgot about the carpet demanded we came to warn you that was our error we should have stayed put then it would have picked us off one by one said nimrod i hope to god it didnt go after the others first said cal no theyre alive said freddy wed feel it if they werent hes right said nimrod we can pick up their trail easily but we have to go now once the uniforms get here were trapped all right i heard you first time said cal let me just say goodbye to dad he went next door brendan hadnt moved since cal had settled him in the chair dad can you hear me brendan looked up from his sorrows havent seen a wind like that since the war he said out in malaya saw whole houses blown down didnt think to see it here he spoke distractedly his gaze on the empty wall the police are in the street said cal at least the lofts still standing eh brendan said a wind like that his voice faded then he said will they come here the police t would think so dad are you all right to speak to them i have to go of course you do brendan murmured you go on do you mind if i take the car take it i can tell them again he halted before picking up his thoughts havent seen a wind like that since oh since the war the trio left by the back door climbing the fence and making their way along the embankment to the footbridge at the end of chariot street from there they could see the size of the crowd that had already gathered from neighbouring streets eager to view the spectacle part of cal itched to go down and tell them what hed seen to say the world isnt just the teacup and the pot i know because ive seen but he held onto his words knowing how theyd look at him thered maybe come a time to be proud to tell his tribe about the terrors and miracles they shared with the world but this wasnt it viii necessary evils the name of the man with the dark suit whom cal had seen getting out of the policecar was inspector hobart he had been in the force for eighteen of his fortysix years but it was only recently with the riots that had erupted in the city during the late spring and summer of the previous year that his star had come into the ascendant the origins of those riots were still the subject of both public enquiry and private argument but hobart had no time for either it was the law and how to keep it that obsessed him and in that year of civil disturbance his obsession had made him the man of the moment not for him the niceties of the sociologist or the civic planner his sacred task was to preserve the peace and his methods which his apologists described as uncompromising found sympathy with his civic masters he rose in the ranks within weeks and behind closed doors he was offered carte blanche to deal with the anarchy that had already cost the city millions he was not blind to the politics of this manoeuvre no doubt the higher echelons for whom he had utter but unspoken contempt were fearful of the backlash should they wield too strong a whip themselves no doubt too he would be the first to be sacrificed to the ferocity of public indignation should the techniques he brought to bear fail but they did not fail the elite he formed men chosen from the divisions for their sympathy with hobarts methods was quickly successful while the conventional forces kept the blue line unbroken on the streets hobarts special force known to those who knew of it at all as the fire brigade was acting behind the scenes to terrorize any suspected of fuelling the agitation either by word or deed within weeks the riots died down and james hobart was suddenly a force to be reckoned with there had followed several months of inactivity and the brigade languished it had not escaped hobart that being the man of the hour was of little consequence once that hour had passed and through the spring and early summer of this the following year that seemed to be the case until now today he dared hope he still had a fight on his hands thered been chaos and here in front of him the gratifying evidence whats the situation his righthand man richardson shook his head theres talk of some kind of whirlwind he said whirlwind hobart indulged a smile at the absurdity of this when he smiled his lips disappeared and his eyes became slits no felons not that weve had reported apparently it was just this wind hobart stared at the spectacle of destruction in front of him this is england he said we dont have whirlwinds well something did this somebody bryn anarchists theyre like rats these people you find a poison that does the job and they learn how to get fat on it he paused you know i think its going to begin again as he spoke another of his officers one of the bloodspattered heroes of the previous years confrontations a man called fryer approached sir weve got reports of suspects seen crossing the bridge get after them said hobart lets have some arrests and bryn you talk to these people i want testimonies from everyone in the street the two officers went about their business leaving hobart to ponder the problem there was no doubt in his mind that events here were of human making it might not be the same individuals whose heads hed broken last year but it was essentially the same animal in his years of service hed confronted that beast in its many guises and it seemed to him that it grew more devious and damnable every time he stared into its maw but the enemy was a constant whether it concealed itself behind fire flood or whirlwind he took strength from that fact the battlefield might be new but the war was old it was the struggle between the law of which he was the representative and the rot of disorder in the human heart he would let no whirlwind blind him to that fact sometimes of course the war required that he be cruel but what cause worth fighting for did not require cruelty of its champions once in a while he had never shirked that responsibility and he would not shirk now let the beast come again in whatever fancy dress it chose he would be ready ix on the might of princes the incantatrix did not look towards shadwell when he entered indeed it seemed shed not moved a muscle since the night before the hotel room was stale with her breath and sweat shadwell inhaled deeply my poor libertine she murmured hes destroyed hows that possible shadwell replied the image of the creature was still lodged in his head in all its appalling magnificence how could a thing so powerful be killed especially as it had already been dead it was the cuckoos she said mooney or the girl mooney and the carpet crawlers all survived but one said immacolata am i right sister the hag was squatting in the corner her body like phlegm on a wall her reply to immacolata was so soft shadwell missed it yes the incantatrix said my sister saw one of them dispatched the rest escaped and the scourge i hear only silence good said shadwell til have the carpet moved this evening where to a house across the river that belongs to a man i once did business with shearman well hold the auction there this place is too public for our clients are they coming then shadwell grinned of course theyre coming theyve waited years these people just for a chance to bid and im going to give it to them it pleased him to think of how readily they sprang to his command the seven mighty bidders whom hed invited to this sale of sales among their members were some of the wealthiest individuals in the world between them fortunes sufficient to trade in nations none of the seven had a name that would have meant anything to the hoipolloi they were like the truly mighty anonymously great but shadwell had done his researches well he knew that these seven had something else in common besides wealth beyond calculation all he knew hungered for the miraculous that was why they were even now leaving their chateaux and penthouses and hurrying to this grimy city their palates dry their palms sweaty he had something each of them wanted almost as much as life itself and perhaps more than wealth mighty they were but today was he not mightier x humankindness so much desire apolline commented to suzanna as they walked the streets of liverpool theyd found nothing at gilchrists warehouse but suspicious stares and had made a quick exit before enquiries were made once out apolline had demanded to take a tour of the city and had followed her nose to the busiest thoroughfare she could find its pavements crammed with shoppers children and deadbeats desire said suzanna it wasnt a motive that sprang instantly to mind on this dirty street everywhere said apolline dont you see she pointed across at a billboard advertising bedlinen which depicted two lovers languishing in a postcoital fatigue beside it a car advertisement boasted the perfect body and made its point as much in flesh as steel and there said apolline directing suzanna to a window display of deodorants in which the serpent tempted a fetchingly naked adam and eve with the promise of confidence in crowds the place is a whorehouse said apolline clearly approving only now did suzanna realize that theyd lost jerichau hed been loitering a few paces behind the woman his anxious eyes surveying the parade of human beings now hed gone they retraced their steps through the throng of pedestrians and found him standing in front of a video rental shop entranced by bank upon bank of monitors are they prisoners he said as he stared at the talking heads no said suzanna its a show like a theatre she plucked at his oversized jacket come on she said he looked around at her his eyes were brimming the thought that he had been moved to tears by the sight of a dozen television screens made her fear for his tender heart its all right she said coaxing him away from the window theyre quite happy she put her arm through his a flicker of pleasure crossed his face and together they moved through the crowd feeling his body trembling against hers it was not difficult to share the trauma he was experiencing shed taken the harlot century shed been born into for granted knowing no other but now seeing it with his eyes hearing it with his ears she understood it afresh saw just how desperate it was to please yet how dispossessed of pleasure how crude even as it claimed sophistication and despite its zeal to spellbind how utterly unenchanting for apolline however the experience was proving a joy she strode through the crowd trailing her long black skirts like a widow on a postfunereal spree i think we should get off the main street said suzanna when theyd caught up with her jerichau doesnt like the crowd well hed best get used to it said apolline shooting a glance at jerichau this is going to be our world soon enough so saying she turned and started away from suzanna again wait a minute suzanna went in pursuit before they lost each other in the throng wait she said taking hold of apollines arm we cant wander around forever we have to meet with the others let me enjoy myself awhile said apolline ive been asleep too long i need some entertainment later maybe said suzanna when weve found the carpet fuck the carpet was apollines prompt reply they were blocking the flow of pedestrians as they debated receiving sour looks and curses for their troubles one pubescent boy spat at apolline who promptly spat back with impressive accuracy the boy retreated with a shocked look on his bespittled face i like these people she commented they dont pretend to courtesy weve lost jerichau again suzanna said damn him hes like a child i see him apolline pointed down the street to where jerichau was standing striving to keep his head above the crowd as though he feared drowning in this sea of humanity suzanna started back towards him but she was pressing against the tide and it was tough going but jerichau didnt move he had his fretful gaze fixed on the empty air above the heads of the crowd they jostled and elbowed him but he went on staring we almost lost you suzanna said when she finally reached his side his reply was a simple look though she was several inches shorter than he she followed the direction of his stare as best she could i dont see anything whats he troubling about now apolline whod now joined them demanded to know theyre all so sad jerichau said suzanna looked at the faces passing by irritable they were and sluggish some of them and bitter but few struck her as sad do you see said jerichau before she had a chance to contradict him the lights no she doesnt see them said apolline firmly shes still a cuckoo remember even if she has got the menstruum now come on jerichaus gaze now fell on suzanna and he was closer to tears than ever you must see he said i want you to see dont do this said apolline its not wise they have colours jerichau was saying remember the principles apolline protested colours said suzanna like smoke all around their heads jerichau took hold of her arm will you listen apolline said capras third principle states suzanna wasnt attending she was staring at the crowd her hand now grasping jerichaus hand it was no longer simply his senses she shared but his mounting panic trapped amongst this hotbreathed herd an empathic wave of claustrophobia rose in her she closed her lids and told herself to be calm in the darkness she heard apolline again talking of some principle then she opened her eyes what she saw almost made her cry out the sky seemed to have changed colour as though the gutters had caught fire and the smoke was choking the street nobody seemed to have noticed however she turned to jerichau seeking some explanation and this time she let out a yell he had gained a halo of fireworks from which a column of light and vermilion smoke was rising oh christ she said whats happening apolline had taken hold of her shoulder and was pulling on her come away she shouted itll spread after three the multitude huh the principle but her warning went uncomprehended suzanna her shock becoming exhiliration was scanning the crowd everywhere she saw what jerichau had described waves of colour plumes of it rising from the flesh of humankind almost all were subdued some plain grey others like plaited ribbons of grimy pastel but once or twice in the throng she saw a pure pigment brilliant orange around the head of a child carried high on her fathers back a peacock display from a girl laughing with her lover again apolline tugged at her and this time suzanna acquiesced but before theyd got more than a yard a cry rose from the crowd behind them then another and another and suddenly to right and left people were putting their hands to their faces and covering their eyes a man fell to his knees at suannas side spouting the lords prayer somebody else had begun vomiting others had seized hold of their nearest neighbour for support only to find their private horror was a universal condition damn you said apolline now look what youve done suzanna could see the colours of the haloes changing as panic convulsed those who wore them the vanquished greys were shot through with violent greens and purples the mingled din of shrieks and prayers assaulted her ears why said suzanna capras principle apolline yelled back at her after three the multitude now suzanna grasped the point what two could keep to themselves became public knowledge if shared by three as soon as shed embraced apolline and jerichaus vision one theyd known from birth the fire had spread a mystic contagion that had reduced the street to bedlam in seconds the fear bred violence almost instantly as the crowd looked for scapegoats on which to blame these visions shoppers forsook their purchases and leapt upon each others throats secretaries broke their nails on the cheeks of accountants grown men wept as they tried to shake sense from their wives and children what might have been a race of mystics was suddenly a pack of wild dogs the colours they swam in degenerating into the grey and umber of a sick mans shit but there was more to come no sooner had the fighting begun than a welldressed woman her makeup smeared in the struggle pointed an accusing finger at jerichau him she shrieked it was him then she flung herself at the guilty party ready to take out his eyes jerichau stumbled back into the traffic as she came after him make it stop she yelled make it stop at her cacophony several members of the crowd forgot their private wars and set their sights on this new target to suzannas left somebody said kill him an instant later the first missile flew it hit jerichaus shoulder a second followed the traffic had come to a halt as the drivers slowed by curiosity came under the influence of the vision jerichau was trapped against the cars as the crowd turned on him suddenly suzanna knew the issue was life and death confused and frightened this mob was perfectly prepared eager even to tear jerichau and anyone who went to his rescue limb from limb another stone struck jerichau bringing blood to his cheek suzanna advanced towards him calling for him to move but he was watching the advancing crowd as if mesmerized by this display of human rage she pushed on climbing over a car bonnet and squeezing between bumpers to get to where he stood but the leaders of the mob the smeared woman and two or three others were almost upon him leave him be she yelled nobody paid the least attention there was something almost ritualistic about the way victim and executioners were playing this out as though their cells knew it of old and had no power to rewrite the story it was the police sirens that broke the spell the first time suzanna had heard that gutchurning wail and been thankful for it the effect was both immediate and comprehensive members of the crowd began to moan as though in sympathy with the sirens those still in combat forsaking their enemies throats the rest staring down at their trampled belongings and bloodied fists in disbelief one or two fainted on the spot several others began weeping again this time more in confusion than fear many deciding discretion bettered arrest took to their heels shocked back into their cuckoo blindness they fled in all directions shaking their heads to dislodge the last vestiges of their vision apolline had appeared at jerichaus side having manoeuvred her way round the back of the mob during the previous few minutes she bullied him from his trance of sacrifice shaking him and shouting then she hauled him away her rescue attempt came not a moment too soon for though most of the lynchparty had dispersed a dozen or so werent ready to give up their sport they wanted blood and would have it before the law arrived suzanna looked around for some escape route a small street off the main road offered some hope she summoned apolline with a shout the arrival of the patrol cars proved a useful distraction there was a further scattering of the mob but the hard core of dedicated lynchers came in pursuit as apolline and jerichau reached the street corner the first of the mob the woman with the smeared face snatched at apollines dress apolline let go of jerichau and turned on her attacker delivering a punch to the womans jaw that threw her to the ground a couple of the officers had caught sight of the chase and were now chasing in their turn but before they could step in to prevent violence jerichau stumbled in that second the mob was on him suzanna turned back to lend him a hand as she did so a car raced towards her skirting the kerb the next second it was at her side the door flung open and cal was yelling get in get in wait she called to him and looked back to see jerichau being flung against a brick wall cornered by the hounds apolline whod laid another of the mob out for good measure was now making for the open car door but suzanna couldnt leave jerichau she ran back towards the knot of bodies that now eclipsed him blotting out the sound of cals voice calling her to get away while she could by the time she reached jerichau hed given up all hope of resistance he was just sliding down the wall sheltering his bloodied head from a hail of spittle and blows she shouted for the assault to stop but anonymous hands dragged her from his side again she heard cal shout but she couldnt have gone to him now if shed wanted to drive she yelled praying to god he heard her and got going then she flung herself at the most vicious of jerichaus tormentors but there were simply too many hands holding her back some covertly molesting her in the confusion of the moment she struggled and shouted but it was hopeless in desperation she reached for jerichau and hung onto him for dear life covering her head with her other arm as the bruising hail intensified quite suddenly the beating and the cursing and the kicks all ceased as two officers broke into the ring of lynchers two or three of the mob had already taken the opportunity to slope away before they were detained but most of them showed not the least sign of guilt quite the reverse they wiped the spit from their lips and began to justify their brutality in shrill voices they started it officer said one of the number a balding individual who before the blood had stained his knuckles and shirt might have been a bank cashier is that right said the officer taking a look at the black derelict and his sullen mistress get the fuck up you two he said youve got some questions to answer xi three vignettes we should never have left them cal said when theyd made a circuit of the block and come back up lord street again to find the street crawling with officers and no sign of jerichau or suzanna theyve been arrested he said damn it we shouldnt have be practical said nimrod we had no choice they almost murdered us said apolline she was still panting like a horse at this point our priority has to be the weave nimrod said i think were agreed on that lilia saw the carpet freddy explained to apolline from the laschenski house is that where she is now apolline enquired nobody replied to the question for several seconds then nimrod spoke shes dead he said flatly dead apolline replied how not one of the cuckoos no said freddy it was something immacolata raised our man mooney here destroyed it before it killed us all she knows were awake then said apolline cal caught her reflection in the mirror her eyes had become like black pebbles in the puffed dough of her face nothings changed has it she said humankind on one side and bad raptures on the other the scourge was worse than any rapture said freddy its still not safe to wake the rest of them apolline insisted the cuckoos are more dangerous than ever if we dont wake them what happens to us said nimrod we become custodians said apolline we watch over the carpet until times get better if they ever do said freddy that remark put an end to the conversation for a good long while hobart looked at the blood that was still bright on the paving stones of lord street and knew for certain that the debris the anarchists had left on chariot street had been only a curtainraiser here was something more graspable a spontaneous eruption of lunacy amongst an ordinary crosssection of people their violence whipped up by the two rebels who were now in custody awaiting his interrogation last years weapons had been bricks and homemade bombs this years terrorists had more access to more sophisticated equipment it seemed thered been talk of a mass hallucination here on this unremarkable street the testimonies of perfectly sane citizens spoke of the sky changing colour if the forces of subversion had indeed brought new weapons into the field mindaltering gases perhaps then hed be well placed to press for more aggressive tactics heavier armaments and a freer hand to use them there would be resistance from the higher ranks he knew from experience but the more blood that was seen to be spilled the more persuasive his case became you he said calling one of the press photographers over he directed the mans attention to the splashes on the paving underfoot show that to your readers he said the man duly photographed the splashes then turned his lens towards hobart he had no opportunity to snatch a portrait before fryer stepped in and wrenched the camera from his grip no pictures he said got something to hide the photographer retorted give him his property back said hobart hes got a job to do like all of us the journalist took his camera and withdrew scum hobart muttered as the man turned his back then anything from chariot street weve got some damn peculiar testimonies oh nobodys actually confessed to seeing anything but apparently around the time of this whirlwind things got crazy the dogs went wild all the radios cut off something strange went on there no doubt of that and here too said hobart i think its time we spoke to our suspects the haloes had faded by the time the officers threw open the back of the black maria and ordered suzanna and jerichau out into the yard of hobarts headquarters all that was left of the vision shed shared with jerichau and apolline was vague nausea and an aching skull they were taken into the bleak concrete building and separated their belongings were taken from them suzanna had nothing she cared much about but mimis book which shed kept in either hand or pocket since rinding it though she protested at its confiscation it too was taken from her there was a brief exchange between the arresting officers as to where she was to be lodged then she was escorted down a flight of stairs to a bare interrogation cell somewhere in the bowels of the building here an officer filled in a form of her personal details she answered his questions as best she could but her thoughts kept drifting off to cal to jerichau and to the carpet if things had looked bad at dawn they looked a good deal worse now she told herself to cross each bridge as she came to it and not fret uselessly about matters she could do nothing to influence her first priority was to get herself and jerichau out of custody shed seen his fear and desperation when they were separated he would be easy meat if anyone chose to get rough with him her thoughts were interrupted by the door opening a pale man in a charcoalgrey suit was staring at her he looked not to have slept in a long while thank you stillman he said the interviewing officer vacated the chair opposite suzanna wait outside would you the man withdrew the door slammed im hobart the newcomer announced inspector hobart we have some talking to do she could no longer see even the merest shadow of a halo but she knew even before he sat down in front of her the colour of this mans soul it gave her no comfort part four what price wonderland caveat emptor latin motto to sell is to own that was the most important lesson shadwell had learned as a salesman if what you possessed was desired ardently enough by another person then you as good as possessed that person too even princes could be owned here they were now or their modern equivalent all assembled at his call the old money and the new the aristocracy and the arrivistes watching each other warily and eager as children for a glimpse of the treasure they were here to fight over paul van niekerk reputed to own the finest collection of erotica in the world outside the walls of the vatican marguerite pierce who had with the death of her parents inherited at the tender age of nineteen one of the largest personal fortunes in europe beauclerc norris the hamburger king whose company owned small states the oil billionaire alexander a who was within hours of death in a washington hospital but had sent his companion of many years a woman who answered only to mrs a michael rahimzadeh the origins of whose fortune were impossible to trace its previous owners all recently and suddenly deceased leon devereaux whod come hotfoot from johannesburg his pockets lined with gold dust and finally an unnamed individual whose features had been toyed with by a succession of surgeons who could not take from his eyes the look of a man with an unspeakable history that was the seven theyd started to arrive at shearmans house which stood in its own grounds on the edge of thurstaston common in the middle of the afternoon by sixthirty they had all gathered shadwell played the perfect host plying them with drinks and platitudes but letting few hints drop as to what lay ahead it had taken him years and much conniving to get access to the mighty and more trickery still to learn which of them had dreams of magic when pressed hed used the jacket seducing those who fawned upon the potentates into revealing all they knew many had no tales to tell their masters made no sign of mourning a lost world but for every atheist there was at least one who believed one prone to moping over lost dreams of childhood or to midnight confessions on how their search for heaven had ended only in tears and gold from that list of believers shadwell had then narrowed the field down to those whose wealth was practically unfathomable then using the jacket once more he got past the underlings and met his elite circle of buyers face to face it was an easier pitch to make than hed imagined it seemed that the existence of the fugue had long been rumoured in both the highest places and the lowest extremes which more than one of this assembly knew with equal intimacy and he had enough detail of the weaveworld from immacolata to persuade them that he would soon enough be able to offer that place for sale there was one from his shortlist who would have no truck with the auction muttering that such forces could not be bought and sold and that shadwell would regret his acquisitiveness another had died the previous year the rest were here their fortunes trembling in readiness to be spent ladies and gentlemen he announced perhaps the time has come for us to view the object under consideration he led them like sheep through the maze of shearmans manse to the room on the first floor where the carpet had been laid the curtains were drawn a single light shed a warm illumination onto the weave which almost covered the floor shadwells heart beat a little faster as he watched them inspect the carpet this was the essential moment when the purchasers eyes first alighted upon the merchandise the moment when any sale was truly made subsequent talk might massage the price but no words however cunning could compete with this first exchange of glance and goods upon that everything pivoted and he was aware that the carpet however mysterious its designs appeared to be simply that a carpet it required the clients imagination stoked by longing to see the geography that lay in wait there now as he scanned the faces of the seven he knew his gambit had not failed though several of them were tactical enough to try and disguise their enthusiasm they were mesmerized each and every one this is it devereaux said his usual severity confounded by awe i didnt really think that it was real rahimzadeh prompted oh its real enough said norris hed already gone down on his haunches to finger the goods take care said shadwell its volatile what dyou mean the fugue wants to show itself shadwell replied its ready and waiting yes said mrs a i can feel it she clearly didnt like the sensation very much alexander said it would look just like an ordinary carpet and i suppose it does but i dont know theres something odd about it its moving said the man with the lifted face norris stood up where he said in the centre all eyes studied the intricacies of the gyre design and yes there did seem the subtlest eddying in the weave even shadwell had not noticed this before it made him more eager than ever to have the business over and done with it was time to sell does anybody have any questions he asked how can we be certain said marguerite pierce that this is the carpet you cant said shadwell hed anticipated this challenge and had his reply to hand you either know in your gut that the fugue is waiting in the weave or else you leave the door is open please help yourself the woman said nothing for several seconds then ill stay she said of course said shadwell shall we begin ii tell me no lies the room theyd put suzanna in was cold and charmless enough but it could have taken lessons from the man who sat opposite her he handled her with an ironic courtesy that never quite concealed the hammer head beneath not once during the hour of their interview had he raised his voice above the conversational nor shown the least impatience at repeating the same enquiries whats the name of your organization i have none shed told him for the hundredth time youre in very serious trouble he said do you understand that i demand to see a solicitor therell be no solicitor i have rights she protested you forfeited your rights on lord street he said now the name of your confederates i dont have any confederates damn you she told herself to be calm but the adrenalin kept pumping he knew it too he didnt take his lizard eyes off her for an instant just kept watching and asking the same old questions winding her up until she was ready to scream and the nigger he said hes in the same organization no no he doesnt know anything so you admit the organization exists i didnt say that you just admitted as much youre putting words in my mouth again the sour civility then please speak for yourself ive nothing to say weve witnesses thatll testify that you and the nigger dont keep calling him that that you and the nigger were at the centre of the riot who supplies your chemical weapons dont be ridiculous she said thats what you are youre ridiculous she could feel herself flushing and tears threatened damn it she wouldnt give him the satisfaction of seeing her cry he must have sensed her determination because he gave up that line of questioning and tried another tell me about the code he said this perplexed her utterly what code he took mimis book from the pocket of his jacket and laid it on the table between them his wide pale hand placed proprietorially across it what does this mean he said its a book dont take me for a fool i dont she thought youre dangerous and you make me afraid but she replied really its just a book of faerytales he opened it flicking through the pages you read german a little the book was a present from my grandmother he paused here and here to glance at the illustrations he lingered over one a dragon its coils gleaming in a midnight forest before passing on you realize i hope that the more you lie to me the worse things will get for you she didnt grace the threat with a reply im going to take your little book apart he said please dont she knew hed read her concern as confirmation of her guilt but she couldnt help herself page by page he said word by word if i have to theres nothing in it she insisted its just a book and its mine its evidence he corrected her it means something faerytales i want to know what she hung her head so as not to let him enjoy her pain he stood up wait for me would you he said as if she had any choice in the matter im going to have a word with your nigger friend two of this citys finest have been keeping him company he paused to let the subtext sink in im sure by now hell be ready to tell me the whys and the wherefores ill be back in a little while she put her hand over her mouth to stop herself begging him to believe her it would do no good he rapped on the door it was unbolted he stepped out into the corridor the door was locked behind him she sat at the table for several minutes and tried to make sense of the feeling that seemed to narrow her windpipe and her vision leaving her breathless and blind to everything but the memory of his eyes never in her life had she felt anything quite like it it took a little time before she realized that it was hate iiii so near so far the echoes that cammell had spoken of were still loud and clear in rue street when as evening drew on cal and his passengers arrived there it was left to apolline using pages torn from the atlas spread out like playing cards on the bare boards of the upper room to compute the carpets present location to cals untutored eye it seemed she did this much the same way his mother had chosen horses for her annual flutter on the derby with closed eyes and a pin it was only to be hoped that apollines method was more reliable eileen mooney had never chosen a winner in her life there was a burst of controversy half way through the process when apolline who appeared to have entered a trance of some kind spat a hail of pips onto the floor freddy made some scathing remark at this and apollines eyes snapped open will you keep your damn silence she said this is bloody hard work its not wise to use the giddies he said theyre unreliable you want to take over she challenged him you know ive got no skill with that then bite your tongue she snapped and leave me to it will you go on she got to her feet and pushed him towards the door go on get out of here all of you they withdrew to the landing where freddy continued to complain the womans lazy he said lilia didnt need the fruit lilia was special said nimrod sitting at the top of the stairs still wrapped in his tattered shirt let her do it her way will you shes not stupid freddy sought solace with cal i dont belong to these people he protested its all a terrible error im not a thief what is your profession then im a barber and you i work in an insurance company it seemed odd to think of that of his desk the claim forms piling up in the tray of the doodles hed left on the blotting paper it was another world the bedroom door opened apolline was standing there with one of the pages from the atlas in her hand well said freddy she handed the page to cal ive found it she said the trail of echoes led them across the mersey through birkenhead and over irby hill to the vicinity of thurstaston common cal knew the area not at all and was surprised to find such rural territory within a hop skip and a jump of the city they circled the area apolline in the passenger seat eyes closed until she announced its here stop here cal drew up the large house they had arrived outside was in darkness although there were several impressive vehicles in the driveway they vacated the car climbed the wall and approached this is it apolline announced i can practically smell the weave cal and freddy made two complete circuits of the building looking for an entrance that wasnt locked and on the second trip found a window which while too small for an adult offered easy access to nimrod softly softly does it cal counselled as he hoisted nimrod through well wait by the front door what are our tactics cammell enquired we get in we take the carpet we bugger off again said cal there was a muffled thump as nimrod leapt or tumbled from the sill on the other side they waited a moment there was no further sound so they returned to the front of the house and waited in the darkness a minute passed and another and yet another finally the door opened and nimrod was standing there beaming lost my way he whispered they slipped inside both lower and upper floors were unlit but there was nothing restful about the darkness the air was agitated as if the dust couldnt quite bear to settle i dont think theres anyone here said freddy going to the bottom of the stairs wrong cal whispered there was no doubting the origin of the chill in the air freddy ignored him he had already climbed two or three steps it passed through cals head that his foolhardy show of indifference to danger which was more than likely compensation for his cowardice at chariot street would do no good to anyone but apolline was already accompanying freddy upstairs leaving cal and nimrod to investigate the ground floor their route led them through a murky assault course which nimrod being much the smaller negotiated with more ease than cal tolls right nimrod whispered as they passed from room to room the weaves here i can feel it so could cal and at the thought of the fugues proximity he felt his courage bolstered this time he wasnt alone against shadwell he had allies with powers of their own and they had the element of surprise on their side with a little luck they might steal the salesmans booty from under his nose then there was a cry from the upper landing it was unmistakably freddy his voice anguished the next moment came the stomachturning sound of his body tumbling down the stairs two minutes in and the game was up nimrod had already started back the way theyd come apparently careless of the consequences cal followed but stumbled into a table in the darkness the corner of which found his groin as he stood upright cupping his balls he heard immacolatas voice her whisper seemed to come from every direction at once as though she was in the very walls seerkind she said the next moment he felt an icy air against his face he knew the sour stench it carried from that night in the trash canyons by the river it was the smell of corruption the sisters corruption and with it came a dismal light by which he could pick out the geography of the room he occupied of nimrod there was no sign hed gone ahead into the hall where the light was sourced and now cal heard him cry out the light flickered the cry stopped the wind was chillier as the sisters came in search of further victims he had to hide and quickly eyes on the passage ahead down which the light was spilling he backed away towards the only exit door available the room he stepped into was the kitchen and it offered nothing in the way of hiding places his bladder aching he went to the back door it was securely locked there was no key panic mounting he glanced back through the kitchen door the magdalene was floating through the room hed just left her blind head moving back and forth as she scoured the air for a trace of human heat it seemed he could feel her fingers at his throat already her lips on his mouth despairing he scanned the kitchen one more time and his gaze alighted on the refrigerator as the magdalene approached the kitchen he crossed to the refrigerator and opened the door arctic air billowed out to greet him he threw the door as wide as possible and bathed himself in the chill the magdalene was on the kitchen threshold now trails of her poison milk seeping from her breasts there she hovered as if uncertain of whether she sensed life here or not cal stood absolutely still praying the cold air would cancel his warmth his muscles had begun to jitter and the urge to piss was near enough unbearable still she didnt move except to put her hand on her perpetually swollen belly and pat whatever slept there and then from the next room he heard the cracked voice of the hag sister she whispered she was coming through he was lost if she entered the magdalene advanced into the kitchen a little way and her head turned with horrid intent in his direction she glided a little closer cal held his breath the creature was within two yards of him now her head still moving back and forth on a neck of mucus and ether beads of her bitter milk floated towards him and broke against his face she sensed something that was clear but the cold air was confusing her he set the muscles of his jaw to prevent his teeth from chattering praying for some diversion from above the shadow of the hag fell through the open door sister she said again are we alone the magdalenes head drifted forward her neck becoming grotesquely long and thin until her blind face hovered a foot from gals it was all he could do to prevent himself from running then she seemed to make up her mind she turned towards the door all alone she said and drifted back to join her sister with every foot of ground she covered he was certain shed think better of her retreat and come in search of him again but she disappeared through the kitchen door and they left to get on with business elsewhere he waited for a full minute until the last vestiges of their phosphorescence had faded then gasping for breath he stepped away from the refrigerator from above he heard shouts he shuddered to think what entertainments were afoot here shuddered too at the thought that he was now alone iv breaking the law it was jerichaus voice she heard suzanna had no doubt of that and it was raised in wordless protest the cry startled her from the murky pit that had claimed her since hobarts departure she was at the door in seconds and beating on it whats happening she demanded there was no reply from the guard on the other side only another heartrending shout from jerichau what were they doing to him shed lived all her life in england and never having had more than a casual acquaintance with the law had assumed it a fairly healthy animal but now she was in its belly and it was sick very sick again she beat a tattoo on the door again it went unanswered tears of impotence began stinging her sinuses and eyes she put her back to the door and tried to stifle the sobs with her hand but they wouldnt be quelled aware that the officer in the corridor could hear her sorrows she started across to the other side of the cell but something stopped her dead in her tracks through her watery vision she saw that the tears shed shed on the back of her hand no longer resembled tears at all they were almost silvery and bursting as she watched into tiny spheres of luminescence it might have come from a story in mimis book a woman who wept living tears except that this was no faerytale the vision was somehow more real than the concrete walls that imprisoned her more real even than the pain that had brought these tears to her eyes it was the menstruum she was weeping she hadnt felt it move in her since shed knelt beside cal at the warehouse and events had proceeded so speedily from there she had given little thought to it now she felt the torrent afresh and a wave of elation swept her down the corridor jerichau cried out again and in response the menstruum bright to blinding brimmed in her subtle body unable to prevent herself she yelled and the stream of brightness became a flood spilling from her eyes and nostrils and from between her legs her gaze fell on the chair which hobart had occupied and it instantly flung itself against the far wall rattling against the concrete as if panicking to be gone from her presence the table followed smashing itself to splinters from outside the door she heard voices raised in consternation she didnt care her consciousness was in and of the tide her sight running to the edge of the menstruums reach and looking back at herself wildeyed smiling a river she was looking down from the ceiling too where her liquid self was rising in spume behind her they were unlocking the door theyll come with cudgels she thought these men are afraid of me and with reason im their enemy and theyre mine she turned the officer in the doorway looked pitifully frail his boots and buttons a weak mans dream of strength he gaped at the scene before him the furniture reduced to tinder the light dancing on the walls then the menstruum was coming at him she followed in its wake as it threw the man aside parts of her consciousness trailed behind her snatching the truncheon from his hand and breaking it in pieces other parts surged ahead of her physical body turning corners seeking under doors calling jerichaus name the interrogation of the male suspect had proved disappointing for hobart the man was either an imbecile or a damn good actor one minute answering his questions with more questions the next talking in riddles hed despaired of getting any sense from the prisoner so hed left him in the company of laverick and boyce two of his best men theyd soon have the man spitting the truth and his teeth with it upstairs at his desk hed just begun a closer analysis of the book of codes when he heard the sound of breakage from below then patterson the officer hed left guarding the woman began yelling he was heading down the stairs to investigate when he was inexplicably seized by the need to void his bladder an ache which became an agonizing pain as he descended he refused to let it slow his progress but by the time he reached the bottom of the stairs he was almost doubled up patterson was sitting in the corner of the passageway his hands over his face the cell door was open stand up man hobart demanded but the officer could only sob like a child hobart left him to it boyce had seen the expression on the suspects face change seconds before the cell door was blown open and it had almost broken his heart to see a smile so lavish appear on features hed sweated to terrorize he was about to beat the smile to kingdom come when he heard laverick whod been enjoying a midsession cigarette in the far corner of the room say jesus christ and the next moment what had happened in that next moment first the door had rattled as if an earthquake was waiting on the other side then laverick had dropped his cigarette and stood up and boyce suddenly feeling sick as a dog had reached out to take the suspect hostage against whatever was beating on the door he was too late the door was flung wide brightness flooded in and boyce felt his body weaken to the point of near collapse an instant later something took hold of him and turned him round and round on his heels he was helpless in its embrace all he could do was cry out as the cool force made gushing entry into him through every hole in his body then as suddenly as hed been snatched he was let go he hit the cell floor just as a woman who seemed both naked and dressed to him stepped through the door laverick had seen her too and was shouting something which the rushing in boyces ears as if his skull was being rinsed in a river drowned out the woman terrified him as hed only been terrified in dreams his mind struggled to recall a ritual of protection against such terrors one hed known before his own name he had to be quick he knew his mind was close to being washed away suzannas gaze lingered on the torturers for only an instant it was jerichau that concerned her his face was raw and puffed up with repeated beatings but smiling at the sight of his rescuer quickly she said extending a hand to him he stood up but he wouldnt approach her hes afraid too she thought or if not afraid at least respectful we must go he nodded she stepped out into the corridor again trusting that hed follow in the scant minutes since the menstruum had flowed in her shed begun to exercise some control over it like a bride learning to trail and gather the length of her train now when she left the cell she mentally called the wash of energy after her and it came to her she was glad of its obedience for as she began along the corridor hobart appeared at the far end her confidence momentarily faltered but the sight of her or whatever he saw in her place was enough to make him stop in his tracks he seemed to doubt his eyes for he shook his head violently gaining confidence she began to advance towards him the lights were swinging wildly above her head the concrete walls creaked when she laid her fingers on them as though with a little effort she might crack them wide the thought of such a thing began to make her laugh the sound of her laughter was too much for hobart he retreated and disappeared up the stairs no further challenge was offered as they made their escape they climbed the stairs then crossed the abruptly deserted office her very presence threw mounds of paperwork into the air that spiralled down around her like vast confetti then she was stepping through the doors into the evening beyond jerichau a respectful distance behind there were no thanks forthcoming he merely said you can find the carpet i dont know how let the menstruum show you he told her the reply didnt make much sense to her until he extended his hand palm up i never saw the menstruum so strong in anyone he said you can find the fugue it and i he didnt need to finish his sentence she understood he and the carpet were made of the same stuff the weave was the woven and vice versa she seized hold of his hand in the building behind them alarm bells had begun to ring but she knew they would not come after her not yet jerichaus face was a knot of anguish her touch was not kind to him but in her head lines of force spiralled and converged images appeared a house a room and yes the carpet lying in splendour before hungry eyes the lines twisted other images fought for her attention was that blood spilled so copiously on the floor and cals heel slipping in it she let go of jerichaus hand he made a fist of it well he said before she could reply a patrol car squealed into the yard the drivers partner alerted by the alarm was already stepping from the car demanding that the escapees halt he began towards them but the menstruum threw a ghostwave towards him which caught him up and washed him out into the street the driver threw himself out of the car and fled towards the safety of brick and mortar leaving the vehicle free for the taking the book said suzanna as she slipped into the drivers seat hobarts still got my book weve no time to go back said jerichau easily said it hurt to think of leaving mimis gift in the hands of hobart but in the time it would take her to find him and claim it back the carpet might be lost she had no choice shed have to leave it in his possession odd as it seemed she knew there were few hands in which it was more secure hobart retired to the toilet and gave vent to his bladder before he filled his trousers then went out to face the chaos that had turned his wellordered headquarters into a battlefield the suspects had escaped in a patrol car he was informed that was some comfort the vehicle would be easy to trace the problem was not finding them again but subduing them the woman possessed the skill to induce hallucinations what other powers might she evidence if cornered with this and a dozen other questions in his head he went down in search of laverick and boyce there were a few men lingering at the cell door clearly unwilling to step inside shes slaughtered them he thought and could not deny a spasm of satisfaction that the stakes were suddenly so much higher but it was not blood he smelt as he reached the door it was excrement laverick and boyce had stripped off their uniforms and smeared themselves from head to foot with the product of their own bowels now they were crawling around like animals grinning from ear to ear apparently well content with themselves jesus christ said hobart at the sound of his masters voice laverick looked up and tried to get his tongue around some words of explanation but his palate wasnt the equal of it instead he crawled into a corner and hid his head youd better get them hosed down hobart told one of the officers we cant have their wives seeing them like that what happened sir the man asked i dont know yet patterson had appeared from the cell where the woman had been held tearstains on his face he had some words of explanation shes possessed sir he said i opened the door and the furniture was half way up the wall keep your hysteria to yourself hobart told him i swear it sir patterson protested i swear it and there was this light no patterson you saw nothing hobart wheeled round on the rest of the spectators if any of you breathe a word of this therell be worse than shit to eat you understand me there were mute nods from the assembly what about them said one glancing back into the cell i told you scrub them down and take them home but theyre like children someone said no children of mine hobart replied and took himself off upstairs where he could sit and look at the pictures in the book in private v threshold whats the disturbance van niekerk demanded to know shadwell smiled his smile though he was irritated by the interruption to the auction it had served to lend further heat to the buyers eagerness an attempt to steal the carpet he said by whom mrs a asked shadwell pointed to the border of the carpet there is youll observe a portion of the weave missing he admitted small as it is its knots concealed several inhabitants of the fugue he watched the buyers faces as he spoke they were utterly mesmerized by his story desperate for some confirmation of their dreams and they came here said norris they did indeed lets see them the hamburger king demanded if theyre here lets see them shadwell paused before replying maybe one he said hed been fully prepared for the request and had already planned with immacolata which of the prisoners theyd display he opened the door and nimrod released from the hags embrace tottered onto the carpet whatever the buyers had expected the sight of this naked child was not it what is this rahimzadeh snorted do you think were fools nimrod looked up from the weave underfoot at the puzzled faces that surrounded him he would have set them right on any number of matters but that immacolata had laid her fingers on his tongue and he couldnt raise a grunt from it this is one of the seerkind shadwell announced its just a child said marguerite pierce her voice betraying some tenderness a poor child nimrod stared at the woman a fine bigbreasted creature he thought hes no child said immacolata she had slipped into the room unseen now all eyes turned to her all except marguerites which still rested on nimrod some of the seerkind are shapechangers this said van niekerk certainly what crap are you trying to feed us shadwell morris said im not taking shut up said shadwell shock closed norris mouth a lot of beef had been minced since hed last been talked to that way immacolata can undo this rapture he said floating the word on the air like a valentine nimrod saw the incantatrix make a configuration of thumb and third finger through which with a sharp intake of breath she nonchalantly drew the shapechanging rapture it was not an unwelcome shudder that convulsed him now he was weary of this hairless skin he felt his knees begin to tremble and he fell forward onto the carpet around him he could hear awed whispers becoming louder with every step of the undeceiving and more astonished inmacolata was not delicate in her undoing of his anatomy he winced as his flesh was transformed there was one delicious moment in this hasty unveiling when he felt his balls drop once more then his manhood reestablished a second sequence of growth began his skin tingling as the hair sprouted on his belly and back finally his face appeared from the facade of innocence and he was balls and all himself again shadwell looked down at the creature lying on the carpet its skin faintly blue its eyes golden then at the buyers this spectacle had probably doubled the price theyd bid for the carpet here was magic in the panting flesh more real and more oddly bewitching than even hed anticipated you made your point said norris his voice flat lets get down to numbers shadwell concurred perhaps youd remove our guest he said to immacolata but before she could make a move nimrod was up and kneeling at the feet of marguerite pierce covering her ankles with kisses this excited but mute entreaty did not go unnoticed the woman stretched her hand down to touch the thick hair of nimrods head leave him with me she said to immacolata why not said shadwell let him watch the incantatrix made a muttered protest no harm in it said shadwell i can handle him immacolata withdrew now said the salesman shall we reopen the bidding half way between the kitchen and the bottom of the stairs cal remembered he was unarmed he rapidly retraced his steps and dug around in the kitchen drawers until he located a wide knife although he doubted if the sisters ethereal bodies would prove susceptible to a mere blade its weight in his hand offered some comfort his heel slid in blood as he began to climb the stairs it was a sheer fluke that his outflung hand found the bannister and kept him from falling downstairs he silently cursed his clumsiness and took the rest of the ascent more slowly though there was no sign of the sisters luminescence from above he knew they were close but frightened as he was one conviction attended his every step whatever horrors were ahead he would find a way to kill shadwell even if he had to open the bastards throat with his own hands hed do it the salesman had broken his fathers heart and that was a hanging offence at the top of the stairs a sound or rather several human voices raised in argument he listened more closely it wasnt argument at all they were bidding and shadwells voice was clearly distinguishable fielding the contesting bids under the cover of the racket cal slipped across the landing to the first of several doors that presented themselves cautiously he opened it and entered the small room was unoccupied but the connecting door was ajar and a light burned beyond leaving the door to the landing open in case he needed to beat a fast retreat he padded across to the second and peered through on the floor lay freddy and apolline there was no sign of nimrod he studied the shadows to be certain they concealed no byblow then he pushed the door open the bids and counterbids were still flying and their commotion drowned out any sound he made crossing to where the prisoners lay they were very still their mouths stifled with clots of ethereal matter their eyes closed it was clearly freddy whod spilled the blood on the stairs his body was much worse for the sisters attentions his face raked with their fingers but the profoundest wound was between his ribs where hed been stabbed with his own scissors they protruded from him still cal pulled away freddys gag which crawled on his hands as if maggoty and was rewarded with a breath from the wounded man but there was no sign of consciousness he then performed the same service for apolline she showed more sign of life moaning as if about to wake the clamour of bids was heating up in the adjacent room it was clear from the din that there were a good number of wouldbe purchasers involved how could he hope to bring the process to a halt with so many in shadwells faction and he singlehanded at his side freddy moved his lids flickered open but there was little in the way of life behind them cal he tried to say the word was a shape not a sound cal bent closer to him putting his arms around his chilly trembling body im here freddy he said freddy tried to speak again almost he said cal tightened his embrace as though he could keep the life from seeping out but a hundred hands couldnt have kept it from going it had better places to be still cal couldnt help but say dont go the man made a tiny shake of his head almost he said again almost the syllables seemed too much for him his trembling stopped freddy cal put his fingers to the mans lips but there was no trace of breath as he stared at the empty features apolline snatched hold of his hand she too was cold her eyes turned skyward he followed her gaze immacolata was lying on the ceiling staring down at him shed been hovering there all along basking in his sorrow and helplessness a shout of horror had reached his lips before he could prevent it and in that instant she swooped her darkness reaching for him for once however his clumsiness did him a kindness and he fell backwards before her claws could connect the door at his back gave inwards and he pitched himself through it his terror of her touch lending him speed what is this the speaker was shadwell cal had thrown himself into the midst of the auction the salesman was at one end of the room while half a dozen others dressed as if for a night at the ritz were standing around the room immacolata would surely hesitate to murder him in such company he had a moments grace at least then he looked down and the sight before him made him sick with joy he was sprawled across the carpet its warp and weft were tingling beneath his palms was that why he so suddenly and absurdly felt safeas though all that had gone before had been a test the prize for which this was sweet reunion get him out of here said one of the buyers shadwell took a step towards him remove yourself mr mooney the salesman said weve got business here so have i thought cal and as shadwell approached he drew the knife from his pocket and sprang at the man behind him he heard immacolata cry out he had seconds only in which to act he thrust the blade at shadwell but despite his bulk the salesman neatly sidestepped it there was a commotion from the buyers which cal took to be an expression of horror but no he glanced towards them to see that theyd taken the sale into their own hands and were shouting bids in each others faces it was laughable to see but cal had little time to applaud them for shadwell had torn open his jacket the lining blazed anything you want he said as he spoke he stepped towards cal blinding him with the glamour of the garment and knocked the knife from his hand with cal disarmed he resorted to less subtle tactics delivering a knee to cals groin that dropped him groaning to the floor there he lay for several seconds unable to move until the nausea subsided through the daze of light and sickness he could see immacolata still waiting for him at the door behind her the sisters so much for his attack he was weaponless now and alone but no not alone never alone he was lying on a world wasnt he on a sleeping world miracles beyond counting were in the weave beneath him if he could just liberate them but how there were raptures no doubt to stir the fugue from its slumber but he knew none of them all he could do was lay his palms on the carpet and whisper wake up was he deluding himself or was there already a restlessness in the knots as though the creatures there struggled against their condition like sleepers desperate to wake themselves knowing the day had broken but powerless to stir now from the corner of his eye he caught sight of a naked figure crouching at the feet of a buyer it was undoubtedly one of the seerkind but noone he recognized or at least not the body but the eyes nimrod he murmured the creature had seen him and crawled from its place of safety to the edge of the carpet he wasnt noticed shadwell was already back amongst the buyers trying to prevent the auction from becoming a bloodbath hed forgotten cals existence is it you cal said nimrod nodded pointing to his throat you cant speak shit cal glanced towards the door immacolata was still in wait she had the patience of a carrionbird the carpet said cal we have to wake it nimrod looked at him blankly dont you understand what im saying before nimrod could signal any reply shadwell had settled the buyers and announced well begin again then to immacolata remove the assassin cal had at best seconds before the incantatrix stopped his life he desperately scanned the room for an exit route there were several windows all heavily draped perhaps if he could reach one he might fling himself out even if the fall killed him it could not be worse than death at immacolatas touch but before she reached him she halted her gaze which had been fixed upon him now drifted away she turned to shadwell and the word she said was menstruum as she spoke the room beyond the door where apolline and freddy had been left was washed with a radiance which splashed through onto the carpet at its touch the colours seemed to become more vivid and then a shriek of wrath the voice of the hag rose from the room followed by a further spillage of light these new sights and sounds were enough to set the buyers into a fresh spin one went to the door either as spectator or escapee and fell back his hands over his eyes yelling that he was blinded nobody went to his aid the rest of the party retreated to the far end of the room while the fury at the other escalated a figure had appeared at the door threads of brilliance describing spirals all about her cal knew her at once despite her transformation it was suzanna fluid fireworks ran like veins over her arms and showered from her fingertips they danced on her belly and breasts and ran out from between her legs to ignite the air seeing her thus it took several seconds for cal to voice his welcome and by that time the sisters were through the door in pursuit of her the battle had done grievous harm on both sides the display of the menstruum could not hide the bleeding wounds on suzannas neck and body and though pain was most likely beyond the experience of the wraithsisters they too were torn whether weakened or not they fell back when immacolata raised her hand leaving suzanna to their living sister youre late she said we were waiting kill her said shadwell cal studied the look on suzannas face try as she might she could not entirely disguise her exhaustion now perhaps feeling his eyes on her she looked his way her gaze locking with his then moving to his hands which were still palm down upon the weave did she read his thoughts he wondered did she comprehend that the only hope remaining to them lay asleep at her feet again their eyes met and in them cal saw that she understood beneath his fingers the weave tingled as though a mild electric shock was passing through it he didnt remove his hand but let the energy use him as it so desired he was just part of a process now a circle of power that ran through the carpet from suzannas feet to his hands and up through his eyes and back along the line of their glance to her stop them said shadwell dimly comprehending this mischief but as immacolata moved towards cal again one of the buyers said the knife cal didnt break the look he shared with suzanna but the knife now floated into view between them as if raised on the heat of their thoughts suzanna had no more idea of why or how this was happening than cal but she too grasped albeit vaguely the notion of the circuit that ran through her the menstruum the carpet him the gaze and back to her again whatever was occurring here it had seconds only to work its miracle before immacolata reached cal and broke the circle the knife had begun to spin now catching fresh speed with each turn cal felt a fullness in his testicles which was almost painful and more alarmingly the feeling that he was no longer quite fixed in his body but being teased out out through his eyes to meet suzannas gaze on the knife between them which was moving at such a speed it resembled a silver ball and then quite suddenly it dropped out of the air like a felled bird cal followed its descent as with a thud it buried its point in the centre of the carpet instantly a shockwave ran through every inch of warp and weft as if the knifepoint had severed a strand upon which the integrity of the whole depended and with that strand cut the weave was loosed it was the end of the world and the beginning of worlds first a column of dervish cloud rose from the middle of the gyre flying up towards the ceiling as it struck wide cracks opened bringing an avalanche of plaster onto the heads of all beneath it momentarily occurred to cal that what suzanna and he had unleashed was now beyond their jurisdiction then the wonders began and all such concerns were forgotten there was lightning in the cloud throwing arcs out to the walls and across the floor as they sprang forth knots from one border of the carpet to the other slipped their configurations and the strands grew like grain in midsummer spilling colour as they rose it was much as cal and suzanna had dreamt several nights before only multiplied a hundredfold ambitious threads climbing and proliferating across the room the pressure of growth beneath cal was enough to throw him off the carpet as the strands sprang from their bondage spreading the seeds of a thousand forms to right and left some were swifter to rise than others reaching the ceiling in seconds others chose instead to make for the windows trailing streamers of colour as they broke the glass and raced out to meet the night everywhere the eye went there were new and extraordinary displays at first the explosion of forms was too chaotic to be made sense of but no sooner was the air awash with colour than the strands began to shape finer details distinguishing plant from stone and stone from wood and wood from flesh one surging thread exploded against the roof in a shower of motes each of which upon contact with the humus of the decaying weave threw out tiny shoots another was laying zigzag paths of bluegrey mist across the room a third and a fourth were intertwining and fireflies were leaping from their marriage sketching in their motion bird and beast which their companions clothed with light in seconds the fugue had filled the room its growth so fast that shearmans house could not contain it boards were uprooted as the strands sought new territories the rafters were thrown aside nor were bricks and mortar any better defence against the threads what they couldnt coax they bullied what they couldnt bully they simply overturned cal had no intention of being buried bewitching as these birthpangs were it could not be long before the house collapsed he peered through the fireworks towards the place where suzanna had been standing but shed already gone the buyers were also making their escape fighting like street dogs in their panic scrambling to his feet cal started to make his way to the door but hed got no more than two steps when he saw shadwell moving towards him bastard the salesman was screeching interfering bastard he reached into his jacket pocket drew out a gun and took aim at cal nobody crosses me mooney he screamed then fired but even as he pulled the trigger somebody leapt at him he fell sideways the bullet flew wide of its target cals saviour was nimrod he raced towards cal now his expression all urgency he had reason the entire house had begun to shake there were roars of capitulation from above and below the fugue had reached the foundations and its enthusiasm was about to pitch the house over nimrod seized hold of cals arm and pulled him not towards the door but towards the window or rather the wall that had once contained the window for the burgeoning weave had torn them all out beyond the wreckage the fugue was telling its longsilenced story hither and thither filling the darkness with further magic nimrod glanced behind him are we going to jump said cal nimrod grinned and held on even tighter to cals arm one backward glance told cal that shadwell had found his gun and was aiming it at their backs look out he yelled nimrods face brightened and he pressed his hand on the nape of cals neck to make him tuck his head down an instant later cal understood why as a wave of colour sprang from the weave and nimrod threw them both before it the force carried them out through the window and for a panicky moment they trod thin air then the brightness seemed to solidify and spread beneath them and they were riding down it like surfers on a tide of light the ride was over all too soon mere seconds later they were rudely deposited in a field some distance from the house and the wave was off into the night parenting all manner of flora and fauna as it went dizzied but exhilarated cal got to his feet and was delighted to hear nimrod exclaim ha you can speak it appears so said nimrod his grin wider than ever im out of her reach here immacolata of course she undid my rapture to tempt the cuckoos and tempting i was did you see the woman in the blue dress briefly she fell for me on sight said nimrod perhaps i should find her shes going to need some tenderness things being what they are and without another word he turned back towards the house which was well on its way to rubble only as he disappeared in the confusion of light and dust did cal notice that in his true shape nimrod possessed a tail doubtless he could look after himself but there were others cal was still concerned for suzanna for one and apolline whom hed last seen lying beside freddy in the antechamber to the auction room all was din and destruction but he started back towards the house nevertheless to see if he could find them it was like swimming against a technicolour tide strands lateborn flew and burst about him some breaking against his body they were kinder by far to living tissue than they were to brick their touch didnt wound him but lent him fresh energy his body tingled as though hed stepped from an icewater shower his head sang there was no sign of the enemy he hoped shadwell had been buried in the house but he knew too much of the luck of the wicked to believe this likely he did however glimpse several of the buyers wandering in the brightness they didnt aid each other but made their way as solitaries either gazing at the ground for fear it open beneath their feet or stumbling hands masking their tears as he came within thirty yards of the house there was a further burst of activity from within as the great cloud of the gyre spitting lightning shrugged off the walls that had confined it and blossomed in all directions he had time enough to see the figure of one of the buyers consumed by the cloud then he turned and ran a wave of dust threw him on his way filaments of brightness flew to left and right of him like ribbons in a hurricane a second wave followed this time of brickshards and furniture his breath was snatched from his lips and his legs from beneath him then he was performing acrobatics head over heels no longer knowing heaven from earth he didnt try to resist even if resistance had been possible but let the fast train take him wherever it chose to go book two the fugue part five revels flee into some forgotten night and be of all dark long my moonbright company beyond the rumour even of paradise come there out of all remembrance make our home walter de la mare the tryst i cal amongst miracles true joy is a profound remembering and true grief the same thus it was when the dust storm that had snatched cal up finally died and he opened his eyes to see the fugue spread before him he felt as though the few fragile moments of epiphany hed tasted in his twentysix years tasted but always lost were here redeemed and wed hed grasped fragments of this delight before heard rumour of it in the wombdream and the dream of love known it in lullabies but never until now the whole the thing entire it would be he idly thought a fine time to die and a finer time still to live with so much laid out before him he was on a hill not high but high enough to offer a vantage point he got to his feet and surveyed this newfound land the unknotting of the carpet had by no means finished the raptures of the loom were far too complex to be so readily reversed but the groundwork was laid hills fields forest and much else besides last time hed set eyes on this place it had been from a birds eye view and the landscape had seemed various enough but from the human perspective its profusion verged on the riotous it was as if a vast suitcase packed in great haste had been upturned its contents scattered in hopeless disarray there appeared to be no system to the geography just a random assembling of spots the seerkind had loved enough to snatch from destruction butterfly copses and placid watermeadows lairs and walled sanctuaries keeps rivers and standing stones few of these locations were complete most were slivers and snatches fragments of the kingdom ceded to the fugue behind humanitys back the haunted corners of familiar rooms that would neither be missed nor mourned where children had perhaps seen ghosts or saints where the fugitive might be comforted and not know why and the suicide find reason for another breath amid this disorder the most curious juxtapositions abounded here a bridge parted from the chasm it had crossed sat in a field spanning poppies there an obelisk stood in the middle of a pool gazing at its reflection one sight in particular caught cals eye it was a hill which rose almost straightsided to a treecrowned summit lights moved over its face and danced amongst the branches having no sense of direction here he decided to make his way down towards it there was music playing somewhere in the night it came to him by fits and starts at the behest of the breeze drums and violins a mingling of strauss and sioux and occasionally evidence of people too whispers in the trees shadowed figures beneath a canopy which stood in the middle of a waisthigh field of grain but the creatures were fugitive they came and went too quickly for him to gain more than a fleeting impression whether this was because they knew him for the cuckoo he was or simply out of shyness only time would tell certainly he felt no threat here despite the fact that he was in a sense trespassing on the contrary he felt utterly at peace with the world and himself so much so that his concern for the others here suzanna apolline jerichau nimrod was quite remote when his thoughts did touch upon them it was only to imagine them wandering as he was wandering lost among miracles no harm could come to them not here here was an end to harm and malice and envy too having this living rapture wrapping him round what was left to envy or desire he was within a hundred yards of the hill and stood before it in amazement the lights hed seen from a distance were in fact human fireflies wingless but describing effortless arabesques around the hill there was no communication between them that he could hear yet they had the precision of daredevils their manoeuvres repeatedly bringing them within a hairs breadth of each other you must be mooney the speakers voice was soft but it broke the hold the lights had on him cal looked off to his right two figures were standing in the shade of an archway their faces still immersed in darkness all he could see were the two bluegrey ovals of their faces hanging beneath the arch like lanterns yes im mooney he said show yourselves he thought how do you know my name news travels fast here came the reply the voice seemed slightly softer and more fluting than the first but he couldnt be certain it wasnt the same speaker its the air said his informant it gossips now one of the pair stepped into the nightlight the soft illumination from the hill moved on his face lending it strangeness but even had cal seen it by daylight this was a face to be haunted by he was young yet completely bald his features powdered to remove any modulation in skintone his mouth and eyes almost too wet too vulnerable in the mask of his features im boaz he said youre welcome mooney he took cals hand and shook it and as he did so his companion broke her covenant with shadow you can see the amadou she said it took cal several seconds to conclude that the second speaker was indeed a woman the processes of his doubt in turn throwing doubt on the sex of boaz for the two were very close to being identical twins im ganza said the second speaker she was dressed in the same plain black trousers and loose tunic as her brother or lover or whatever he was and she too was bald that and their powdered faces seemed to confuse all the cliches of gender their faces were vulnerable yet implacable delicate yet severe boaz looked towards the hill where the fireflies were still cavorting this is the rock of the first fatality he told cal the amadou always gather here this is where the first victims of the scourge died cal looked back towards the rock but only for a moment boaz and ganza fascinated him more their ambiguities multiplied the more he watched them where are you going tonight said ganza cal shrugged no idea he said i dont know a yard of this place yes you do she said you know it very well while she spoke she was idly locking and unlocking her fingers or so it seemed until cals eyes lingered on the exercise for two or three seconds then it became apparent that she was passing her fingers through the palms of the other hand left through right right through left defying their solidity the motion was so casual the illusion if illusion it was so quick that cal was by no means certain he was interpreting it correctly how do they look to you she enquired he looked back at her face was the fingertrick some kind of test of his perception it wasnt her hands she was talking about however the amadou she said how do they appear he glanced towards the rock again like human beings he replied she gave him a tiny smile why do you ask he wanted to know but she didnt have time to reply before boaz spoke theres a council been called he said at capras house i think theyre going to reweave that cant be right said cal theyre going to put the fugue back thats what i hear said boaz it seemed to be fresh news to him had he just lifted it off the gossiping air the times are too dangerous theyre saying he told cal is that true i dont know any other cal said so ive got nothing to compare them with do we have the night ganza asked some of it said boaz then well go to see lo yes its as good a place as any boaz replied will you come he asked the cuckoo cal looked back towards the amadou the thought of staying and watching their performance a while longer was tempting but he might not find another guide to show him the sights and if time here was short then hed best make the most of it yes ill come the woman had stopped lacing her fingers youll like lo she said turning away and starting off into the night he followed already full to brimming with questions but knowing that if indeed he only had hours to taste wonderland he should not waste time and breath asking ii at the lake and later there had been a moment back in the auction house when suzanna had thought her life was at an end shed been helping apolline down the stairs when the walls had creaked and it seemed the house had come down around their ears even now as she stood watching the lake she was not certain how theyd escaped alive presumably the menstruum had intervened on her behalf though she had not consciously willed it to do so there was much she had to learn about the power shed inherited not least how much it belonged to her and how much she to it when she found apolline whom shed lost in the furore she would find out all the woman knew in the meantime she had the islands their backs crowned with cypress trees to wonder about and the lisp of the waves on the stones to soothe her we should go jerichau broke her reverie as softly as he could touching the back of her neck with his hand she had left him at the house that stood along the shore talking with friends hed not seen in a human lifetime they had reminiscences to exchange in which she had no place and which she sensed the others had no desire to share criminal talk shed uncharitably concluded as she left them to it jerichau was a thief after all why did we come here she asked him i was born here i know every one of these stones by name his hand still rested on her shoulder or at least i did it seemed a good place to show you she looked away from the lake towards him his brow was furrowed but we cant stay he said why not theyll want to see you at capras house me you unmade the weave i had no choice she said cal was going to be killed the furrow deepened forget cal he said his tone toughening mooneys a cuckoo youre not yes i am she insisted or least thats what i feel i am and thats the important thing his hand dropped from her shoulder he was suddenly sullen are you coming or not he said of course im coming he sighed it wasnt meant to be this way he said his voice recapturing some of its former gentility she wasnt sure what he was speaking of the unweaving his reunion with the lake or the exchange between them perhaps a little of each maybe it was a mistake to unmake the weave she said somewhat defensively but it wasnt just me it was the menstruum he raised his eyebrows its your power he said not without rancour control it she gave him a frosty look how far is capras house nothings far in the fugue he replied the scourge destroyed most of our territories only these few remain are there more in the kingdom a few maybe but all we really care for is here thats why we have to hide it again before morning morning shed almost forgotten that the sun would soon be rising and with it humankind the thought of her fellow cuckoos with their taste for zoos freakshows and carnivals invading this territory did not much amuse her youre right she said we have to be quick and together they went up from the lake towards capras house as they walked suzanna had answered several questions that had been vexing her since the unweaving chief amongst them what had happened to the portion of the kingdom that the fugue had invaded it was not well populated certainly there was the considerable acreage of thurstaston common behind the auction house and fields to either side but the area was not entirely deserted there were a number of houses in the locality and up towards irby heath the population grew denser still what had happened to those residences and indeed to their occupants the answer was quite simple the fugue had sprung up around them accommodating their existence with a kind of wit thus a line of lampposts their fluorescence extinguished had been decorated with blossoming vines like antique columns a car had been almost buried in the side of a hill another two had been tipped on their tails and leaned nose to nose the houses had been less recklessly treated most were still complete although the flowerage of the fugue reached to their very doorsteps as if awaiting an invitation inside as to the cuckoos she and jerichau encountered a few all of whom seemed more puzzled than fearful one man dressed only in trousers and braces was complaining loudly that hed lost his dog damn fool mutt he said you seen him and seemed indifferent to the fact that the world had changed around him it was only after hed headed off still calling after the runaway that suzanna wondered if the fellow was seeing what she saw or whether the same selective blindness that kept the haloes from human eyes was at work here was the dogowner wandering familiar streets unable to see beyond the cell of his assumptions or perhaps just glimpsing the fugue from the corner of his eye a glory hed remember in his dotage and weep over jerichau had no answers to these questions he didnt know he said and he didnt care and still the visions unfurled with every step she took her astonishment grew at the variety of places and objects the seerkind had saved from the conflagration the fugue was not as shed anticipated simply a collection of haunted groves and thickets holiness was a far more democratic condition it informed fragments of every kind intimate and momentous natural and artificial each corner and niche had its own peculiar mode of rapture the circumstances of their preservation meant that most of these fragments had been torn from their context like pages from a book their edges were still raw with the violence of that removal and the haphazard way theyd been thrown together only made their disunity seem more acute but there were compensations the very disparity of the pieces the way the domestic abutted the public the commonplace the fabulous created fresh conundrums hints of new stories that these hitherto unconnected pages might tell sometimes the journey showed them collisions of elements so unlikely they defied any attempt to synthesize them dogs grazing beside a tomb from the fractured lid of which rose a fountain of fire that ran like water a window set in the ground its curtains billowing skyward on a breeze that carried the sound of the sea these riddles defying her powers of explanation marked her profoundly there was nothing here that she hadnt seen before dogs tombs windows fire but in this flux she found them reinvented their magic made again before her eyes only once having been told by jerichau that he had no answers to her questions did she press him for knowledge and that was regarding the gyre whose covering of cloud was perpetually visible its brightest lightning bursts throwing hill and tree into relief thats where the temple of the loom is he said the closer you get to it the more dangerous it becomes she remembered something of this from that first night when theyd talked of the carpet but she wanted to know more why dangerous she asked the raptures required to make the weave were without parallel it required great sacrifice great purity to control them and knit them more than most of us would ever be capable of now the power protects itself with lightning and storms and wisely if the gyres broken into the weave rapture wont hold all weve gathered here will come apart be destroyed destroyed so they say i dont know if its true or not ive got no grasp of the theoretical stuff but you can perform raptures the remark seemed to baffle him that doesnt mean i can tell you how he said i just do em like what she said she felt like a child asking for tricks from a magician but she was curious to know the powers residing in him he made an odd face one full of contradictions there was a shyness there something quizzical something fond maybe ill show you he said one of these times i cant sing or dance but ive got ways with me he stopped speaking and walking too she didnt need any sign from him to hear the bells that were in the air around them they were not the bells of a steeple these were light and melodic but they summoned nevertheless capras house he said striding ahead the bells knowing they were heard rang them on their way iii delusions the bulletin that had gone out from hobarts division announcing the escape of the anarchists had not gone unheard but the alarm had come a little before eleven and the patrols were dealing with the nightly round of fistfights drunken driving and theft which climaxed about that time in addition thered been a fatal stabbing on seel street and a transvestite had been the cause of a nearriot in a pub on the dock road thus by the time any serious attention had been paid to the alarmcall the escapees were long gone slipped through the mersey tunnel on their way to shearmans house but on the opposite side of the river just outside birkenhead a vigilant patrolman by the name of downey caught sight of them leaving his partner in a chinese restaurant ordering chop suey and peking fried duck downey gave chase the radio alert warned that these miscreants were extremely dangerous and that no attempt should be made to apprehend them singlehanded patrolman downey therefore kept a discreet distance aided in this by a thorough knowledge of the area when the villains finally reached their destination however it became apparent that this was no ordinary pursuit for one when he reported his location to division he was told that things there were in considerable disarray could he hear a man sobbing in the background and that this matter would be dealt with by inspector hobart in person he was to wait and watch it was while he was waiting and watching that he had his second proof that something untoward was in the air it began with lights flickering in the secondstorey windows of the house then exploding into the outside world taking wall and window with it he got out of his car and began to walk towards the house his mind used to filing reports was already scrabbling for adjectives to describe what he was seeing but he kept coming up emptyhanded the brilliance that spilled from the house did not resemble anything he had witnessed or dreamt of before he was not a superstitious man he immediately sought a secular explanation for the things he saw or almost saw all around him and seeking found he was viewing ufo activity that was surely it hed read reports of similar events happening to perfectly ordinary joes like himself it was not god or lunacy he was facing but a visitation from a neighbouring galaxy content that he had some grasp on the situation he hurried back to the car to put his report through to headquarters he was stymied however there was white noise on all frequencies no matter hed informed them of his location on first arriving theyd come to his aid presently in the meanwhile his task was to watch this landing like a hawk that task rapidly became more difficult as the invaders began to bombard him with extraordinary illusions designed no doubt to conceal their operations from human sight the waves of force that had burst from the house threw the car on its side then vague forms began to roil about him the tarmac beneath his feet seemed to sprout flowers bestial forms were performing acrobatics above his head he saw several members of the public similarly ensnared by these projections some stared up at the sky others were on their knees praying for sanity and it came by and by knowing that these images were merely phantoms gave him strength to resist them over and over he told himself that what he was seeing was not real and by degrees the visions bowed to his certainty grew faint and finally faded almost entirely he scrambled into the overturned car and tried the radio again though he had no idea if anybody was hearing it or not oddly he wasnt that concerned hed beaten the delusions and that conviction sweetened his vigil even if they came for him now the monsters that had landed here tonight he would not fear them he would put out his own eyes rather than let them bewitch him afresh any further word theres nothing sir said richardson only din forget it then said hobart just drive well sniff them out if it takes us all fucking night as they travelled hobarts thoughts returned to the scene hed left behind him his men reduced to babbling idiots his cells defiled with shit and prayers he had a score to settle with these forces of darkness once upon a time he would not have cast himself so readily in the role of avenger hed been squeamish in admitting to any degree of personal involvement but experience had made an honest man of him now at least in the company of his men he didnt pretend to be removed from the issues at hand but confessed freely the heat in his belly after all the business of pursuit and punishment was just a way to spit in the eye of one who had already spat on you the law just another word for revenge iv allegiances it was eighty years give or take half a decade since the three sisters had trodden the earth of the fugue eighty years of exile in the kingdom of the cuckoo worshipped and reviled by turns almost losing their sanity amongst the adamaticals but driven to endure countless mortifications by their hunger one day to have the weaveworld in their avenging grasp now they hung in the air above that rapturous earth its touch so antithetical that walking upon it was a trial and surveyed the fugue from end to end it smells too much alive said the magdalene lifting her head to the wind give us time immacolata told her what about shadwell the hag wanted to know where is he out looking for his clients probably the incantatrix replied we should find him i dont like the thought of his wandering here unaccompanied hes unpredictable then what we let the inevitable happen said immacolata gently swinging round to take in every sacred yard of the place we let the cuckoos tear it apart what about the sale therell be no sale its too late shadwells going to know you used him no more than he used me or would have liked to a tremor passed through the magdalenes uncertain substance wouldnt you like to give yourself to him once she enquired softly just once no never then let me have him i can use him imagine his children immacolata reached out and grasped her sisters fragile neck you will never lay a hand on him she said not a finger the wraiths face grew absurdly long in a parody of remorse i know she said hes yours body and soul the hag laughed the mans got no soul she said immacolata released the magdalene filaments of her sisters matter decaying into sewer air between them oh he has a soul she said letting gravity claim her for the earth beneath but i want no part of it her feet touched the ground when all this is over when the seerkind are in the cuckoos hands ill let him go his way unharmed and us said the hag what happens to us then will we be free thats what we agreed we can go into extinction if thats what you want more than anything said the hag more than anything there are worse things than existence said immacolata oh the hag replied can you name one immacolata thought for a short while no she conceded with a soft sigh of distress you may be right sister shadwell had fled from the disintegrating house moments after cal and nimrod had escaped through the window and had barely avoided being caught by the cloud that had swallowed devereaux hed ended up face down his mouth filled with dust and with the sour taste of defeat after so many years of anticipation to have the auction end in ruin and humiliation it was enough to make him weep but he didnt for one thing he was an optimist by nature in todays rejection the seeds of tomorrows sale for another the spectacle of the fugue solidifying about him was a fine distraction from his sorrows and for a third he had found one worse off than he what the fuck is happening it was norris the hamburger king blood and plaster dust vied for the right to paint his face and somewhere in the maelstrom hed lost both the back of his jacket and most of his trousers also one of his fine italian shoes the other he carried ill sue the ass off you he screeched at shadwell you fucking asshole look at me fucking asshole he began to beat shadwell with the shoe but the salesman was in no mood to be bruised he slapped the man back hard within seconds they were brawling like drunkards indifferent to the extraordinary scenes coming to life all around them the tussle left them more breathless and bloody than theyd started out and did nothing to resolve their differences you should have taken precautions norris spat its too late for accusations shadwell replied the fugues woken whether we like it or not i would have woken it myself said norris if id got to own it but i would have been ready and waiting had some forces to go in and take control but this its chaos i dont even know which way is out any wayll do its not that big if you want out just walk in any direction this simple solution seemed to pacify norris somewhat he turned his gaze on the burgeoning landscape i dont know though he said maybe its better this way at least i get to see what i would have bought and what do you make of it its not the way id thought itd be id expected something tamer frankly im not sure now id want to own the place as his voice faltered an animal that could surely be found in no menagerie jumped from the flux of threads and snarled a welcome at the world before bounding off see said norris what was that shadwell shrugged i dont know he said theres things here that probably died out before we were born that said norris staring after the hybrid beast i never saw the like of that before even in books i tell you i want none of this fucking place i want you to get me out youll have to find your own way said shadwell ive got business here oh no you dont said norris pointing his shoe at shadwell i need a bodyguard and youre it the sight of the hamburger king reduced to this nervous wreckage amused shadwell more than that it made him feel perhaps perversely secure look he said his manner softening were both in the same shit here damn right we are ive got something that might help he said opening his jacket something to sweeten the pill norris looked suspicious oh yeah have a peep said shadwell showing the man the jacket lining norris wiped off the blood that was running into his left eye and stared into the folds what do you see there was a moment of hesitation when shadwell wondered if the jacket was still functioning then a slow smile broke over norris face and a look familiar from countless other such seductions crept into his eyes see something you like shadwell asked him indeed i do take it then its yours free gratis and for nothing norris smiled almost coyly wherever did you find him he asked as he extended a trembling hand towards the jacket after all these years tenderly he drew his temptation from the folds of the lining it was a windup toy a soldier with a drum so fondly and so accurately remembered by its owner that the illusion he now held in his hand had been recreated with every dent and scratch in place my drummer said norris weeping for joy as if hed taken possession of the worlds eighth wonder oh my drummer he turned it over but theres no key he said do you have it i may find it for you by and by shadwell replied one of his arms is broken said norris stroking the drummers head but he still plays youre happy oh yes yes thank you then put it in your pocket so that you can carry me awhile said shadwell carry you im weary i need a horse norris showed no trace of resistance to this notion though shadwell was a bigger and heavier man and would constitute quite a burden the gift had won him over utterly and while it held him in thrall he would allow his spine to crack before disobeying the giftgiver laughing to himself shadwell climbed onto the mans back his plans might have gone awry tonight but as long as people had dreams to mourn he could possess their little souls awhile where do you want me to take you the horse asked him somewhere high he directed take me somewhere high v the orchard of lemuel lo neither boaz nor ganza were voluble guides they led the way through the fugue in almost complete silence only breaking that silence to warn cal that a stretch of ground was treacherous or to keep close to them as they moved down a colonnade in which he heard dogs panting in a sense he was glad of their quietness he didnt want a guided tour of the terrain at least not tonight hed known when hed first looked down at the fugue from the wall in mimis yard that it couldnt be mapped nor its contents listed and committed to memory like his beloved timetables he would have to understand the weaveworld in a different fashion not as hard fact but as feeling the schism between his mind and the world it was attempting to grasp was dissolving in its place was a relationship of echo and counter echo they were thoughts inside each others heads he and this world and that knowledge which he could never have found the words to articulate turned the journey into a tour of his own history hed known from mad mooney that poetry was heard differently from ear to ear poetry was like that the same he began to see was also true of geography they climbed a long slope he thought maybe a tide of crickets leapt before their feet the earth seemed alive at the top of the slope they looked across a field at the far side of the field was an orchard almost there said ganza and they began towards it the orchard was the biggest single feature hed seen in the fugue so far a plot of maybe thirty or forty trees planted in rows and carefully pruned so that their branches almost touched beneath this canopy were passages of neatly clipped grass dappled by velvet light this is the orchard of lemuel lo boaz said as they stood on the perimeter his gentle voice was softer than ever even amongst the fabled its fabled ganza led the way beneath the trees the air was still and warm and sweet the branches were laden with a fruit that cal did not recognize theyre jude pears boaz told him one of the species weve never shared with the cuckoos why not there are reasons said boaz he looked around for ganza but shed disappeared down one of the avenues help yourself to the fruit he said moving away from cal in search of his companion lem wont mind though cal thought he could see all the way down the corridor of trees his eyes deceived him boaz took three steps from him and was gone cal reached towards one of the lowslung branches and put his hand on one of the fruits as he did so there was a great commotion in the tree and something ran down the branch towards him not that one the voice was bass profundo the speaker was a monkey theyre sweeter upstairs the beast said throwing its brown eyes skyward then it ran back the way it had come its passage bringing leaves down around cal he tried to follow its progress but the animal moved too fast it was back in half a dozen seconds with not one but two fruits perched in the branches it threw them down to cal peel them it said one each despite their name they didnt resemble pears they were the size of a plum but with a leathery skin it was tough but it couldnt disguise the fragrance of the meat inside what are you waiting for the monkey demanded to know theyre tasty these giddys peel it and see the fact of the talking monkey which might have stopped cal dead in his tracks a week before was just part of the local colour now you call them giddys he said jude pears giddy fruit its all the same meat the monkeys eyes were on cals hands willing him to peel the fruit he proceeded to do just that they were more difficult to skin than any fruit hed encountered hence the monkeys bargain with him presumably viscous juice ran from the broken skin and over his hands the smell was ever more appetizing before hed quite finished peeling the first of them the monkey snatched it from his grasp and wolfed it down good it said between mouthfuls its pleasure was echoed from beneath the tree somebody made a sound of appreciation and cal glanced away from his labours to see that there was a man squatting against the trunk rolling a cigarette he looked back up to the monkey then down at the man and the voice from the beast made new sense good trick he said the man looked up at cal his features were distressingly close to mongoloid the smile he offered huge and seemingly uncomprehending what is said the voice from the branches confounded as he was by the face below him cal pursued his assumption and addressed his reply not to the puppet but the puppeteer throwing your voice like that the man still grinned but showed no sign that hed understood the monkey however laughed loudly eat the fruit it said cals fingers had worked at the peeling without his direction the giddy was skinned but some lingering superstition about stolen fruit kept him from putting it to his lips try it said the monkey theyre not poisonous the smell was too tantalizing to resist he bit at least not to us the monkey added laughing again the fruit tasted even better than its scent had promised the meat was succulent the juice strong as a liqueur he licked it off his fingers and the palms of his hand like it superb food and drink all in one the monkey looked at the man beneath the tree want one smith it asked the man put a flame to his cigarette and drew on it dyou hear me getting no response the monkey scampered back up into the higher reaches of the tree cal still eating the pear had found the pips at its centre he chewed them up their slight bitterness only complemented the sweetness of the rest there was music playing somewhere between the trees he now noticed one moment lilting the next manic another said the monkey reappearing with not two but several fruit cal swallowed the last of his first same deal the monkey said suddenly greedy cal took three and started to peel theres other people here he said to the puppeteer of course said the monkey this has always been a gathering place why do you speak through the animal cal asked as the monkeys fingers claimed a peeled fruit from his hands the names novello said the monkey and who says hes speaking at all cal laughed as much at himself as at the performance fact is said the monkey neither of us is quite sure who does what any longer but then loves like that dont you find it threw back its head and squeezed the fruit in its hand so that the liquor ran down its throat the music had found a fresh intoxication cal was intrigued to find out what instruments it was being played upon violins certainly and whistles and drums but there were sounds amongst these that he couldnt place any excuse for a party said novello must be the biggest breakfast in history i daresay want to go see yes the monkey ran along the branch and scurried down the trunk to where smith was sitting cal chewing the seeds of his second giddy reached up and claimed a further handful of fruit from amongst the foliage pocketing half a dozen against future hunger and skinning another to be consumed on the spot the sound of monkeychatter drew his gaze down to novello and smith the beast was perched on the mans chest and they were talking to each other a babble of words and grunts cal looked from man to beast and back to man again he could not tell who was saying what to whom the debate ended abruptly and smith stood up the monkey now sitting on his shoulder without inviting cal to follow they threaded their way between the trees cal pursued peeling and eating as he went some of the visitors here were doing as hed done standing beneath the trees consuming jude pears one or two had even climbed up and were draped amongst the branches bathing in the perfumed air others either indifferent to the fruit or sated upon it lay sprawled in the grass and talked together in low voices the atmosphere was all tranquillity heaven is an orchard cal thought as he walked and god is plenty thats the fruit talking said novello cal wasnt even aware that hed spoken aloud he looked round at the monkey feeling slightly disoriented you should watch yourself the animal said an excess of judes isnt good for you ive got a strong stomach cal replied who said anything about your stomach the monkey replied theyre not called giddy fruit for nothing cal ignored him the animals condescending tone irritated him he picked up his pace overtaking man and beast have it your way said the monkey somebody darted between the trees a little way ahead of cal trailing laughter to cals eyes the sound was momentarily visible he saw the rise and fall of notes as splashes of light which flew apart like dandelion heads in a high wind enchantment upon enchantment plucking and peeling yet another of los remarkable fruits as he went he hurried on towards the music and ahead of him the scene came clear a blue and ochre rug had been laid on the ground between the trees with wicks in oil flickering along its borders and at its edge the musicians hed heard there were five of them three women and two men dressed formally in suits and dresses in the dark threads of which brilliant designs were somehow concealed so that the subtlest motion of the folds in the flamelight revealed a glamour that brought to gals mind the iridescence of tropical butterflies more startling however was the fact that this quintet had not a single instrument between them they were singing these violins pipes and drums and offering in addition sounds no instrument could hope to produce here was a music which did not imitate natural sound it was not bird or whale song nor tree nor stream but instead expressed experiences which lay between words the offbeat of the heart where intellect could not go hearing it shudders of pleasure ran down gals spine the show had drawn an audience of perhaps thirty seerkind and cal joined them his presence was noted by a few who threw mildly curious glances in his direction surveying the crowd he attempted to allot these people to one or other of the four families but it was near enough impossible the choral orchestra were presumably aia hadnt apolline said that it was aia blood that had given her a good singing voice but amongst the rest who was who which of these people were of jerichaus family for instance the babu which of the yeme or the lo there were negro and caucasian faces and one or two with an oriental cast there were some who boasted traits not quite human one with nimrods golden eyes another pair whose features carried symmetrical marking that crept down from the scalp yet others who bore either at the dictates of fashion or theology elaborate tattoos and hairstyles there was the same startling variety in the clothes they wore the formal designs of their late nineteenthcentury garb refashioned to suit the wearer and in the fabrics of skirts suits and waistcoats the same barely concealed iridescence threads of carnival brilliance in wait behind the monochrome gals admiring gaze went from one face to another and he felt he wanted each of these people as a friend wanted to know them and walk with them and share his pittance of secrets with them he was vaguely aware that this was probably the fruit talking but if so then it was wise fruit though his hunger was assuaged he took another of the pears from his pocket and was about to peel it when the music came to an end there was applause and whistling the quintet took their bows as they did so a bearded man with a face as lined as a walnut who had been sitting on a stool close to the edge of the rug stood up he looked directly at cal and said my friends my friends we have a stranger amongst us the applause was dying down faces turned in cals direction he could feel himself blush come out mr mooney mr calhoun mooneyl ganza told the truth the air did gossip the man was beckoning cal made a murmur of protest come on entertain us a while came the reply at this cals heart started to thump furiously i cant he said of course you can the man grinned of course you can there was more applause the shining faces smiled around him somebody touched his shoulder he glanced round it was novello thats mr lo said the monkey you mustnt refuse him but i cant do anything everybody can do something said the monkey if its only fart come on come on lemuel lo was saying dont be shy much against his will cal edged through the crowd towards the rectangle of wicks really he said to lo i dont think youve eaten freely of my fruit said lo without rancour the least you can do is entertain us cal looked about him for some support but all he saw were expectant faces i cant sing and ive two left feet he pointed out still hoping selfdepreciation might earn him an escaperoute your greatgrandfather was a poet wasnt he said lemuel his tone almost rebuking cal for not making mention of the fact he was said cal and can you not quote your own greatgrandfather said lemuel cal thought about this for a moment it was clear he was not going to be released from this circle without at least making some stab at recompense for his greed and lemuels suggestion was not a bad one many years ago brendan had taught cal one or two fragments of mad mooneys verse theyd meant little enough to cal at the time hed been about six years old but their rhymes had been intriguing the rug is yours said lemuel and stood aside to let cal have access to the performing area before hed had an opportunity to run any of the lines through his head it was two decades since hed learnt them how much would he remember he was standing on the rug staring across the flickering footlights at his audience what mr lo says is true he said all hesitation my greatgrandfather speak up somebody said my greatgrandfather was a poet ill try and recite one of his verses i dont know if i can remember them but ill do my best there was scattered applause at this which made cal more uneasy than ever whats it called this poem said lemuel cal wracked his brain the title had meant even less than the lines when hed first been taught it but hed learned it anyway parrotfashion its called six commonplaces he said his tongue quicker to shape the words than his brain was to dust them off tell it my friend said the orchardkeeper the audience stood with bated breath the only movement now was that of the flames around the rug cal began one part of love for a terrible instant his mind went totally blank if somebody had asked him his name at that juncture he would not have been able to reply four words and he was suddenly speechless in that moment of panic he realized that he wanted more than anything in the world to please this gracious gathering to show them how glad he was to be amongst them but his damn tongue at the back of his head the poet said go on boy tell them what you know dont try and remember just speak he began again not falteringly this time but strongly as though he knew these lines perfectly well and damn it he did they flowed from him easily and he heard himself speaking them in a voice hed never have thought himself capable of a bards voice declaiming one part of love is innocence one part of love is guilt one part the milk that in a sense is soured as soon as spilt one part of love is sentiment one part of love is lust one part is the presentiment of our return to dust eight lines and it was all over over and he was standing the lines buzzing in his head both pleased that hed got through the verse without fumbling and wishing it could have gone on a while longer he looked at the audience they were not smiling any longer but staring at him with an odd puzzlement in their eyes for an instant he thought maybe hed offended them then came the applause hands raised above their heads there were shouts and whistles its a fine poem lo said applauding heartily as he spoke and finely delivered so saying he stepped out of the audience again and embraced cal with fervour do you hear cal said to the poet in his skull they like you and back came another fragment as if fresh from mad mooneys lips he didnt speak it this time but he heard it clearly forgive my art on bended knees i do confess i seek to please and it was a fine thing this pleasing business he returned lemuels hug help yourself mr mooney the orchardkeeper said to all the fruit you can eat thank you said cal did you ever know the poet he asked no said cal he was dead before i was born who can call a man dead whose words still hush us and whose sentiments move mr lo replied thats true said cal of course its true would i tell a lie on a night like this having spoken lemuel called somebody else out of the crowd another performer brought to the rug cal felt a pang of envy as he stepped over the footlights he wanted that breathless moment again wanted to feel the audience held by his words moved and marked by them he made a mental note to learn some more of mad mooneys verses if and when he saw his fathers house again so that next time he was here he had new lines to enchant with his hand was shaken and his face kissed half a dozen times as he made his way back through the crowd when he turned round to face the rug once more he was surprised to find that the next performers were boaz and ganza doubly surprised they were both naked there was nothing overtly sexual in their nakedness indeed it was as formal in its way as the clothes theyd shrugged off nor was there any trace of discomfort amongst the audience they watched the pair with the same grave and expectant looks as theyd watched him boaz and ganza had gone to opposite sides of the carpet halted there a beat then turned and begun to walk towards each other they advanced slowly until they were nose to nose lip to lip it crossed cals mind that maybe some erotic display was in the offing and in a way that confounded his every definition of erotic that was true for they continued to walk towards each other or so his eyes testified pressing into each other their faces disappearing their torsos congealing their limbs too until they were one body the head an almost featureless ball the illusion was absolute but there was more to come for the partners were still moving forward their faces appearing now to press through the back of each others craniums as though the bone was soft as marshmallow and still they advanced until they were like siamese twins born back to back their single skull now teased out and boasting two faces as if this werent enough there was a further twist to the trick for somehow in the flux theyd exchanged genders to stand finally quite separate once more in their partners place loves like that the monkey had said here was the point proved in flesh and blood as the performers bowed and fresh applause broke out cal detached himself from the crowd and began to wander back through the trees several vague thoughts were in his head one that he couldnt linger here all night and should soon go in search of suzanna another that it might be wise to seek a guide the monkey perhaps but first the laden branches drew his eye again he reached took another handful of fruit and began to peel los ad hoc vaudeville was still going on behind him he heard laughter then more applause and the music began again he felt his limbs growing heavier his fingers were barely the equal of the peeling his eyelids drooped deciding hed better sit down before he fell down he settled beneath one of the trees drowsiness was claiming him and he had no power to resist it there was no harm in dozing for a while he was safe here in the wash of starlight and applause his eyes flickered closed it seemed he could see his dreams approaching their light growing brighter their voices louder he smiled to greet them it was his old life he dreamt he stood in the shuttered room that lay between his ears and let the lost days appear on the wall like a lantern show moments retrieved from some stockpile he hadnt even known hed owned but the scenes that were paraded before him now these passages from the unfinished book of his life no longer seemed quite real it was fiction that book or at best momentarily real when some part of him had leapt from that stale story and glimpsed the fugue in waiting the sound of applause called him to the surface of sleep and his eyes flickered open the stars were still set amongst the branches of the giddy trees there was still laughter and flamelight near at hand all was well with his newfound land i wasnt born til now he thought as the lantern show returned i wasnt even born content with that thought his minds eye peeled another of los sweet fruits and put it to his lips somewhere somebody was applauding him hearing it he took a bow but this time he did not wake vi capras house in its way capras house was as great a surprise as anything suzanna had seen in the fugue it was a low building in a state of considerable disrepair the offwhite plaster that clad its walls falling away to reveal large handmade red bricks beneath the tiles of the porch were much weatherbeaten the door itself barely hanging on its hinges myrtle trees grew all around it and in their branches the myriad bells theyd heard were hanging responsive to the merest breath of wind their sound however was all but cancelled by the raised voices from within it sounded more like a riot than civilized debate there was a guard at the threshold squatting on his haunches making a ziggurat of rocks in front of him at their approach he stood up he was fully seven feet tall what business have you got here he demanded of jerichau we have to see the council from within suzanna could hear a womans voice raised clear and strong i will not lie down and sleep she said the remark was followed by a roar of approval from her supporters its vital we talk to the council said jerichau impossible the guard pronounced this is suzanna parrish said jerichau she he had no need to go on i know who she is the guard said if you know who i am then you know i woke the weave said suzanna and ive opinions the council should hear yes said the guard i can see that he glanced behind him the din had if anything worsened its bedlam in there he warned youll be lucky if youre heard i can shout with the best said suzanna the guard nodded no doubt he said its straight ahead he stood aside pointing down a short hallway to a halfclosed door suzanna took a deep breath looking round at jerichau to see that he was still in tow then she walked down the passage and pushed the door the room was large but filled with people some sitting some on their feet some even standing on chairs to get a better view of the debates chief protagonists there were five individuals in the heat of it one a woman with wild hair and an even wilder look whom jerichau identified as yolande dor her faction were in a knot around her egging her on she was facing two men one longnosed individual whose face was beetroot with yelling and his older companion who had a restraining hand upon the first mans arm they were clearly the opposition in between was a negress who was haranguing both parties and an oriental immaculately dressed who looked to be the moderator if so he was failing in this function it could only be moments before the fists replaced opinions the presence of the interlopers had been noted by a few of the assembly but the lead players raged on deaf to each others arguments whats the name of the man in the middle suzanna asked jerichau thats tung said jerichau thank you without another word suzanna stepped towards the debaters mr tung she said the man looked towards her and the fretfulness on his face turned to panic who are you he demanded to know suzanna parrish the name was enough to hush the argument instantly those faces which were not already turned in suzannas direction were now a cuckoo the old man said in capras house shut up said tung youre the one said the negress you yes do you know what you ve done the remark ignited a fresh outburst but this time it wasnt confined to those at the centre of the room everybody was yelling tung whose calls for control went unheard pulled a chair up stood on it and yelled silence the ploy worked the din died down tung was touchingly pleased with himself ha he said with a little pout of selfsatisfaction i think thats a little better now he turned to the old man you have an objection messimeris indeed i do came the reply he jabbed an arthritic finger in suzannas direction shes trespassing i demand she be removed from this chamber tung was about to reply but yolande was there before him this is no time for constitutional niceties she said whether we like it or not were awake she looked at suzanna and shes responsible well im not staying in the same room as a cuckoo said messimeris contempt for suzanna oozing from his every word not after all theyve done to us he looked at his redfaced companion are you coming delphi i am indeed he replied wait said suzanna i dont want to break any rules you already have said yolande and the walls are still standing for how long said the negress capras house is a sacred place messimeris murmured it was clear that this was no sham he was genuinely offended by suzannas presence i understand that said suzanna and i respect it but i feel responsible and so you are said delphi working himself up into a fresh lather but thats little comfort now is it were awake damn you and were lost i know said suzanna what you says right this rather deflated him hed been expecting argument you agree he said of course i agree were all vulnerable at the moment at least we can fend for ourselves now were awake yolande argued instead of just lying there we had the custodians said delphi what happened to them theyre dead suzanna replied all of them what does she know messimeris commented dont listen to her my grandmother was mimi laschenski said suzanna for the first time since shed entered the fray messimeris looked her straight in the eye he was no stranger to unhappiness she thought it was there in abundance now so he said and she was murdered suzanna went on returning his stare by one of your people never said messimeris without a trace of doubt who said yolande immacolata not ours messimeris protested not one of ours well shes certainly no cuckoo suzanna retorted her patience beginning to wear thin she took a step towards messimeris who took a firmer grip of delphis arm as if he might use his colleague as a shield should push come to shove every one of us is in danger she said and if you dont see that then all your sacred places not just capras house all of them theyll be wiped away all right youve got reason not to trust me but at least give me a hearing the room had fallen pindrop quiet tell us what you know said tung not all that much suzanna admitted but i know youve got enemies here in the fugue and god knows how many more outside what do you suggest we do about it said a new voice from somewhere in delphis faction we fight said yolande youll lose suzanna replied the other womans fine features grew tight defeatism from you too she said its the truth youve got no defences against the kingdom we have the raptures said yolande do you want to make weapons of your magic suzanna replied like immacolata if you do that you may as well call yourself cuckoos this argument won some murmurs of assent from the assembly and sour stares from yolande so we have to reweave said messimeris with some satisfaction which is what ive been saying from the outset i agree said suzanna at this the room erupted afresh yolandes voice rising above the din no more sleep she said i will not sleep then youll all be wiped out suzanna yelled back the din subsided a little this is a cruel century said suzanna so was the last somebody commented and the one before that we cant hide forever said yolande appealing to the room her call received considerable support despite suzannas intervention and indeed it was difficult not to sympathize with her case after so much sleep the idea of consigning themselves to the dreamless bed of the weave could not be attractive im not saying you should stay in the carpet for long said suzanna just until a safe place can be ive heard all of this before yolande broke in well wait we said well keep our heads low til the storm blows over there are storms and storms said a man somewhere at the back of the crowd his voice penetrated the clamour with ease though it was scarcely more than a whisper this in itself was enough to make the argument die down suzanna looked in the direction of the sound though she could not yet see the speaker it came again if the kingdom destroys you the voice said then all my mimis pain was for nothing the councillors were stepping aside as the speaker moved through them towards the centre of the room he came into view it took suzanna several seconds to realize that shed seen this face before and another beat to remember where in the portrait on mimis bedroom wall but the faded photograph had failed to convey more than a hint of the mans presence or indeed of his physical beauty it wasnt difficult seeing the way his eyes flickered and his closecropped hair flattered the curve of his skull to understand why mimi had slept beneath his gaze all her lonely life this was the man shed loved this was romo he said addressing suzanna your grandmothers first husband how had he known sleeping in the weave that mimi had taken a human husband had the air told him that tonight what do you want here said tung this isnt a public thoroughfare i want to speak on behalf of my wife i knew her heart better than any of you that was years ago romo another life romo nodded yes he said its gone i know sos she all the more reason i speak for her nobody made any attempt to silence him she died in the kingdom he said to keep us from harm she died without trying to wake us why was that she had ev ry reason to want the unweaving to be relieved of her duties and be back with me not necessarily messimeris said romo smiled because she married he said i would have expected no less or because shed forgotten no never he spoke with such authority yet so gently everyone in the room attended to him she didnt forget us she simply knew what her granddaughter knows that it isnt safe yolande went to interrupt but romo raised his hand a moment please he said then im going ive got business elsewhere yolande closed her mouth i knew mimi better than any of you as far as im concerned we parted only yesterday i know she guarded the weave as long as she had breath and wit to do so dont waste her agonies by throwing us into the hands of our enemies just because you get a whiff of freedom in your nostrils easy for you to say yolande replied i want to live again as much as you do romo told her i stayed here because of my children thinking the way we all thought that wed be awake in a year or two now look we open our eyes and the world has changed my mimi died an old woman and its the child of her child who stands in her place to tell us that we are as close to extinction as ever i believe she speaks with mimis blessing we should listen to her what do you advise said tung advise yolande said hes a liontamer why should we listen to his advice i suggest we reweave said romo ignoring her outburst reweave before the cuckoos come amongst us then we find somewhere safe somewhere we can unweave again in our own time where the cuckoos wont be waiting at the border yolandes right he said looking at her we cant hide forever but facing tomorrow morning in this chaotic state isnt courage its suicide the speech was neatly argued and it clearly impressed a good number of the assembly and if we do said one of yolandes clan who guards the carpet she does said romo looking at suzanna she knows the kingdom better than anyone and its rumoured shes got access to the menstruum is that true said tung suzanna nodded the man took a half step away from her a swell of comments and questions now rose in the room many of them directed at romo he was having none of them however ive said all i have to say on the subject he announced i cant leave my children waiting any longer with that he turned and started back the way hed come suzanna pursued him as the controversy escalated afresh romo she called after him he stopped and turned back help me she said stay with me theres no time he said ive got an appointment to keep on your grandmothers behalf but theres so much i dont understand didnt mimi leave you instructions he said i was too late by the time i reached her she couldnt she stopped her throat was tight she felt the sorrow of losing mimi rising up in her couldnt speak all she left me was a book then consult that romo said she knew best it was taken from me suzanna said then you have to get it back and what answers you dont find there put in for yourself this last remark lost suzanna entirely but before she could question it romo spoke again look between he said thats the best advice i can offer between what romo frowned simply between he said as though the sense of this was selfevident i know youre the equal of it youre mimis child he leaned towards her and kissed her you have her look he said his hand trembling against her cheek she suddenly sensed that his touch was more than friendly and that she felt something undeniable towards him something inappropriate between her and her grandmothers husband they both stepped back from the touch startled by their feelings he began to walk towards the door his goodnight delivered with his back to her she went after him a pace or two but didnt try to delay him any longer he had business hed said as he pushed open the door there was a roar from the darkness and her heart jumped as beasts appeared around him he was not under attack however hed spoken of children and here they were lions half a dozen or more welcoming him with growls their golden eyes turned up towards him as they jockeyed for the place closest to his side the door slammed eclipsing them they want us to take our leave jerichau was standing in the passageway behind her she stared at the closed door for a moment longer as the sound of the lions faded then turned to him are we being thrown out she asked no they just want to debate the problem awhile he said without us she nodded i suggest we walk a little way by the time they opened the door romo and the animals had gone about mimis business so they walked he had his silence she hers so many feelings to try and comprehend her thoughts went back to mimi and the sacrifice shed made knowing romo her beautiful liontamer was sleeping in a place she could not trespass had she touched the knots where he was concealed she wondered had she knelt and whispered her love for him to the weave the very thought of it was beyond bearing no wonder shed been so severe so stoical shed stood guard at the paradise gates alone unable to breathe a word of what she knew fearful of dementia fearful of death dont be afraid jerichau said at last im not afraid she lied then remembering that the colours from her would be contradicting her every word said well maybe a little i cant be a custodian jerichau im not the equal of it theyd emerged from the myrtle copse and walked out into a field several huge marble beasts stood in the kneehigh grass their species either mythical or extinct but either way chiselled in loving detail tusk and fur and tiny eye she leaned against the flank of one and stared at the ground they could hear neither the debate behind them nor the bells in the branches only nightinsects going about their business in the shadow of the beasts his gaze was upon her she felt it but she couldnt raise her head to meet it i think maybe he began then stopped the insects chattered on mocking his struggle for words again he tried i just wanted to say i know youre the equal of anything she was going to smile at this courtesy but no thats not what i wanted to say he took a fresh breath and with it said i want to go with you with me when you go back to the kingdom whether its with the carpet or without it i want to be with you now she looked up and his dark face was that of an accused man awaiting verdict hanging on every flicker of her lash she smiled searching for a response finally she said of course of course id like that yes he gasped you would the anxiety fled from his face replaced by a luminous grin thank you he said i want so much that we should be friends then friends well be she replied the stone was chilly against her back he in front of her exuded warmth and there was she where romo had advised her to be between vii shadwell on high let me down said the salesman to his brokenbacked mount theyd climbed a steepsided hill the highest shadwell could find the view from the top was impressive norris however wasnt much interested in the view he sat down labouring for breath and clutched his onehanded drummer to his chest leaving shadwell to stand on the promontory and admire the moonlit vista spread beneath him the journey here had offered a host of extraordinary sights the occupants of this province though plainly related to species outside the fugue had somehow been coaxed by magic into new forms how else to explain moths five times the size of his hand which yowled like mating cats from the tops of the trees or the shimmering snakes hed seen posing as flames in the niche of a rock or the bush the thorns of which bled onto its own blossoms such novelties were everywhere the pitch hed offered to his clients when tempting them to the auction had been colourful enough but it had scarcely begun to evoke the reality the fugue was stranger by far than any words of his had suggested stranger and more distressing that was what he felt looking down from the hilltop distress it had come over him slowly as theyd journeyed here beginning like dyspepsia and escalating to the point where he felt a kind of terror at first hed tried not to admit its origins to himself but such was its force the feeling could now no longer be denied it was covetousness that had come to birth in his belly the one sensation that no true salesman could ever indulge he tried to get the better of the ache by viewing the landscape and its contents in strictly commercial terms how much could he ask for that orchard or the islands in that lake or the moths but for once the technique failed him he looked down over the fugue and all thought of commerce was swept away it was no use to struggle he had to admit the bitter fact hed made a terrible error trying to sell this place no price could ever be put on such mindwracking profusion no bidder however wealthy had the wherewithal to purchase it here he was looking down on the greatest collection of miracles the world had ever seen with all ambition to lord it over princes fled a new ambition had taken its place he would be a prince himself more than a prince here was a country laid before him why should he not be king viii the virgin blooded happiness was not a condition immacolata was much familiar with but there were places in which she and her sisters felt something close to it battlefields at evening when every breath she drew was somebody elses last mortuaries and sepulchres anywhere death was they took their ease played amongst cadavers and picknicked there that was why when theyd got bored with searching for shadwell they came to the requiem steps it was the only place in the fugue sacred to death as a child immacolata had come here day after day to bathe in the sorrow of others now her sisters had taken themselves off in search of some unwilling father and she was here alone with thoughts so black the night sky was blindingly bright beside them she slipped off her shoes and went down the steps to the black mud at the edge of the river here it was the bodies were finally relinquished to the waters here the sobs had always been loudest and faith in the hereafter had trembled in the face of cold fact it was many many years since those rituals had been in vogue the practice of giving the dead to this or any other river had been stopped too many of the corpses were being found by the cuckoos cremation had taken over as the standard method of disposal much to immacolatas chagrin the steps had dramatized something true in the way that they descended into mud standing there now with the river moving fast before her she thought how easy it would be to pitch herself into the flood and go the way of the dead but she would leave too much unfinished business behind shed leave the fugue intact and her enemies alive there was no wisdom in that no she had to go on living to see the families humiliated their hopes like their territories in dust their miracles reduced to playthings destruction would be altogether too easy for them it hurt for an instant only then it was all over but to see the seerkind enslaved that was worth living for the roar of the waters soothed her she grew nostalgic remembering the bodies shed seen snatched beneath this tide but did she hear another roar beneath that of the river she looked up from the murky waters at the top of the steps was a ramshackle building little more than a roof supported by columns in which the lesser mourners had loitered while the final farewells were made at the riverside she could just see movement there now fugitives in the shadows was it her sisters she didnt sense their proximity her unspoken question was answered as she crossed the mud back to the bottom step i knew youd be here immacolata halted her foot on the step of all places here immacolata felt a twinge of trepidation not because of the man who emerged from the shelter of the column but because of the company he kept they moved in the shadows behind him their panting flanks silken lions hed come with lions oh yes romo said seeing the incantatrix flinch im not alone like she was this time youre the vulnerable one it was true the lions were unreflective creatures her illusions would not mislead them nor would her assaults easily touch the tamer who shared that bestial indifference sisters she breathed come to me the lions were moving into the moonlight six in all three male three female their eyes were glued to their owner awaiting his instructions she took a step backwards the mud was slick beneath her heel she almost lost her balance where was the magdalene and the hag she sent another thought in hectic pursuit of them but fear made it sluggish the lions were at the top of the steps now she didnt dare take her eyes off them though she loathed the sight they were so effortlessly magnificent much as the thought appalled her she knew she would have to flee before them she would have the menstruum carry her up above the river before they reached her but it was taking its time to flow through her distracted as she was she made an attempt to delay their approach you shouldnt trust them she said the lions said romo halfsmiling the seerkind they cheated mimi as they cheated me they left her in the kingdom while they took refuge theyre cowards and deceivers and you what are you immacolata felt the menstruum begin to suffuse her shadowself with her escape certain she could afford to tell the truth im nothing she said her voice now so soft it was almost lost in the din of the river im alive as long as my hatred for them keeps me alive it was almost as if the lions understood this last remark for they came at her suddenly leaping down the steps to where she stood the menstruum rippled about her she started to rise even as she did so the magdalene appeared from along the river and let out a cry the call diverted immacolatas attention her feet inches from the mud it was all that the first of the lions required he launched himself from the steps towards her and before she could avoid the attack he clawed her from the air she fell backwards into the mud romo pushed his way through the rest of the pride calling the animal back before immacolata mustered her powers the summons came too late the menstruum was spiralling around the beast tearing at its face and flanks the animal could not have disengaged itself now if it had wanted to but the menstruums attack left little in reserve for defence and the lion landed blow after blow each gouging a brutal wound immacolata shrieked and squirmed in the bloodstreaked mud but the lion would not let her alone as its claws opened her face it let out a throttled roar and its assault ceased it stood over immacolata for an instant as steam rose from between them then it staggered sideways its abdomen had been opened from throat to testicles it was not the menstruums doing but that of the knife now dropping from immacolatas hand the beast trailing its innards stumbled a little way then keeled over in the mud the rest of the animals growled their distress but held their positions at romos command as for immacolata the sisters were coming to her aid but she spat some contemptuous words at them and dragged herself to her knees the wounds shed sustained would have left a human being or indeed most seerkind dead in the dirt her flesh and upper chest had been traumatically mauled the flesh hung in sickening ribbons still she hauled herself to her feet and turned her agonized eyes which were now set in a single wound on romo i will destroy everything you ever loved she said her voice throbbing her hand clutching her face while the blood gushed between her fingers the fugue the seerkind all of it wiped away you have my promise you will weep if it had been in romos power he would have had no compunction about dispatching the incantatrix on the spot but delivering immacolata to pastures new was beyond the power of lion or liontamer weakened as the enemy was she and her sisters would undoubtedly kill the rest of the animals before they reached her he would have to be content with what their surprise attack had achieved and hope that mimi knew in her resting place that her torment had been avenged he moved towards the felled lion speaking soft words immacolata made no attempt to harm him but started up towards the steps her sisters flanking her the lions stood their ground waiting for the order that would unleash them but romo was too busy grieving he had laid his cheek on the cheek of the dying animal still murmuring to it then the words of comfort stopped and a look scarcely less than tragic came over his face the lions heard his silence and knew what it signified they turned their heads to him and as they did so immacolata rose into the air a saint of mud and wounds the wraithsisters trailing her like corrupted seraphim he looked up as they ascended into darkness a patter of blood falling almost as the night erased them he saw immacolatas head loll and the sisters rise to her aid this time the incantatrix did not despise their support but let them bear her away ix never and again the ziggurat builder whod stood guard outside capras house was shouting at them from the edge of the field courtesy preventing him from coming any closer they want you back at the house he called as they walked back towards the myrtle trees it became apparent that events of some moment were afoot members of the council were already leaving capras house urgency in their step and on their faces the bells in the trees were all ringing though there was no breeze moving and there were lights above the house like vast fireflies the amadou said jerichau the lights swooped and rose in elaborate configurations what are they doing suzanna asked signalling jerichau replied signalling what as he went to reply yolande dor appeared between the trees and stood in front of suzanna theyre fools to trust you she stated flatly but i tell you now im not sleeping you hear me we have a right to live you damn cuckoos dont own the earth then she was away cursing suzanna as she went that means theyre taking romes advice said suzanna thats what the amadou are saying jerachau confirmed still watching the sky im not sure im ready for this tung was at the door calling her in hurry will you we have precious little time she hesitated the menstruum offered her no courage now her stomach felt like a cold furnace ash and emptiness im with you jerichau reminded her reading her anxiety his presence was some comfort together they went inside when she stepped into the chamber she was greeted by an almost reverential hush all eyes were turned on her there was desperation in every face last time shed been here mere minutes ago shed been an invader now she was the one upon whom their fragile hopes for survival depended she tried not to let her fear show but her hands trembled as she stood before them were decided said tung yes she replied yolande told me we dont like it much said one of the number whom suzanna recognized as a defector from yolandes faction but weve got no choice there are already disturbances at the border said tung the cuckoos know were here and itll soon be morning said messimeris so it would dawn could be no more than ninety minutes away an hour after that and every curious cuckoo in the vicinity would be wandering in the fugue not quite seeing it perhaps but knowing there was something to stare at something to fear how long after that before there was a reprise of the scene on lord street steps have been taken to begin the reweaving said delphi is that difficult no said messimeris the gyre has great power how long will it take we have perhaps an hour said tung to teach you about the weave an hour what would she learn in an hour tell me only as much as i need to know for your safety she said and no more than that what i dont know i cant let slip point taken said tung no time for formalities then lets begin x the summons cal woke suddenly there was a slight chill in the air though that wasnt what had woken him it was lemuel lo calling his name calhoun calhoun he sat up lemuel was at his side smiling through the thicket of his beard theres someone here asking for you he said oh we havent much time my poet he said as cal struggled to his feet the carpets being rewoven in little more than minutes all thisll be sleeping again and me with it that cant be right said cal it is friend but i have no fear youll be watching over us wont you he clasped cals hand in a fierce grip i dreamt something cal said what was that i dreamt that this was real and the other wasnt lemuels smile faded i wish what you dreamt were true he said but the kingdoms all too real its just that a thing that grows too certain of itself becomes a kind of lie thats what you dreamt that the other place is a place of lies cal nodded the grip on his hand tightened as though there was a pact in the making dont be lost to it calhoun remember lo eh and the orchard will you then well see each other again lemuel embraced him remember he said his mouth next to cals ear cal returned the bearhug as best he could given los girth then the orchardkeeper broke from him best go quickly he said your visitor has important business she says and he strode away to where the rug was being rolled up and some last melancholy songs sung cal watched him thread his way between the trees his fingers brushing against the bark of each as he passed commanding them to sweet sleep no doubt mr mooney cal looked round there was a small woman with distinctly oriental features standing two trees breadth from him in her hand she held a lamp which she raised as she approached him her scrutiny both lengthy and unapologetic well she said her voice musical he told me you were handsome and so you are in a quirky kind of way she cocked her head slightly as if trying to make better sense of cals physiognomy how old are you twentysix why twentysix she said his mathematics is terrible sos mine cal was about to say but there were other more pressing questions the first of which was who are you im chloe came the womans reply ive come to fetch you we should hurry he gets impatient who does even if we had time to talk im forbidden to tell you chloe replied but hes eager to see you that i can say very eager she turned and started to walk away from the corridor of trees she was still speaking but cal couldnt catch the words he set off in pursuit of her the end of a sentence drifting back to him not time by foot what did you say he asked coming abreast of her we have to travel quickly she said they had reached the perimeter of the orchard and there stood of all things a rickshaw leaning on the handles smoking a thin black cigarette was a wiry middleaged man dressed in bright blue pantaloons and a shabby vest on his head a bowler hat this is floris chloe told cal please get in cal did as he was told settling himself amongst a litter of cushions he could not have refused this adventure if his life had depended upon it chloe got in beside him hurry she said to the driver and they took off like the wind xi at the gazebo hed promised himself he wouldnt look back at the orchard and he was as good as his promise until the very last when before the surrounding night claimed the sight entirely he weakened and glanced round he could just see the ring of light where hed stood and recited mad mooneys verse then the rickshaw turned a corner and the sight was gone floris was responsive to chloes imperative hurry they did the vehicle rocked and rolled hauled over stone and pasture with equal gusto and threatening all the while to pitch its passengers out cal held onto the side of the vehicle and watched the fugue pass by he cursed himself for sleeping as he had and missing a night of exploration when hed first glimpsed the weaveworld it had seemed so very familiar but travelling these roads he felt like a tourist ogling the sights of an alien country its a strange place he said as they passed beneath a rock which had been carved in the form of a vast teetering wave what did you expect said chloe your own back yard not exactly but i thought i knew it in a way at least in dreams paradise always has to be stranger than you expect doesnt it or it loses its power to enchant and you are enchanted yes he said and afraid of course you are said chloe it keeps the blood fresh he didnt really comprehend the remark but there were other claims upon his attention at every turn and brow a fresh vista and ahead the most impressive sight of all the roiling cloudwall of the gyre is that where were headed he asked close to it said chloe they plunged suddenly into a copse of birchtrees the silver bark bright by the lightning flashes from the cloud then headed up a small incline which floris took at an impressive rate beyond the copse the land abruptly changed character the earth was now dark almost black and the vegetation seemed more appropriate to a hothouse than the open air more than that as they reached the top of the rise and began to make their way along its spine cal found himself subject to odd hallucinations at either side of the road he kept glimpsing scenes that werent quite there like images on a mistuned television slipping out of focus and back in again he saw a house built like an observatory with horses grazing around it saw several women in dresses of watered silk laughing together there was much else he saw but none of it for more than a few seconds you find it unsettling said chloe whats going on this is paradoxical ground strictly speaking you shouldnt be here at all there are always dangers what dangers if she offered a reply it was drowned out by a thunderclap from the belly of the gyre which followed upon lilac lightning they were within a quarter of a mile of the cloud now the hairs on cals arms and nape stood up his testicles ached but chloe wasnt interested in the mantle she was gazing at the amadou moving in the sky behind them the reweavings under way she said thats why the gyres so restless we have less time than i thought on this cue floris picked up his pace to a run which threw loose earth up from his heels into the rickshaw its for the best said chloe this way he wont have time to get maudlin three minutes more of bruising travel and they came to a small stone bridge at which floris brought the vehicle to a dusty halt here we disembark said chloe and led cal up a short flight of welltrodden steps to the bridge it spanned a narrow but deep gorge the sides of which were mossy and plumed with ferns water rushed beneath feeding a pool where fishes jumped come come said chloe and hurried cal over the bridge ahead was a house its doors and shutters flung wide there were copious birddroppings on the tiled roof and several large black pigs slumbering against the wall one raised itself as cal and chloe approached the threshold snuffling at cals legs before returning to its porcine slumbers there were no burning lights inside the only illumination came from the lightning which this close to the gyre was practically constant by it cal surveyed the room chloe had ushered him into it was sparsely furnished but there were papers and books on every available surface on the floor lay a collection of threadbare rugs and on one of these a vast and probably vastly ancient tortoise at the far end of the room was a large window which looked onto the mantle in front of it a man was seated in a large plain chair here he is said chloe cal wasnt sure who was being introduced to whom either the chair or its occupant creaked as the man stood up he was old though not as old as the tortoise about brendans age cal guessed the face though clearly acquainted with laughter had known pain too a mark like a smoke stain ran from his hairline to the bridge of his nose where it veered off down his right cheek it didnt disfigure his face rather lent it an authority his features wouldnt otherwise have possessed the lightning came and went burning the mans silhouette into cals mind but his host said nothing he just looked at cal and looked some more there was pleasure on his face though quite why cal didnt know nor did he feel ready to ask at least not until the other broke the silence between them that didnt seem to be on the cards however the man just stared it was difficult to be certain of much in the flare of the lightning but cal thought there was something familiar about the fellow suspecting theyd stand there for hours unless he initiated a conversation he voiced the question his mind had already asked do i know you from somewhere the old mans eyes narrowed as if he wanted to sharpen his sight to pinpoint and pierce cals heart but there was no verbal reply hes not allowed to converse with you chloe explained people who live this close to the gyre her words died what said cal theres not time to explain she said just believe me the man had not taken his gaze off cal for a second not even to blink the perusal was quite benign perhaps even loving cal was suddenly overcome by a fierce desire to stay to forget the kingdom and sleep in the weave here pigs lightning and all but already chloe had her hand on his arm we must go she said so soon he protested were taking chances bringing you here in the first place she said the old man was now moving towards them his step steady his gaze the same but chloe intervened now dont she said he frowned his mouth tight but he came no closer we have to be away she told him you know we must he nodded were there tears in his eyes cal thought so ill be back soon enough she told him til just take him to the border all right again a single nod cal raised his hand in a tentative wave well he said more mystified than ever its its been an honour a faint smile creased the mans face he knows said chloe believe me she took cal to the door the lightning blazed through the room the thunder made the air shake at the threshold cal gave his host one last look and to his astonishment indeed to his delight the mans smile became a grin that had a subtle mischief about it take care cal said grinning even as the tears ran down his cheeks the man waved him away and turned back towards the window the rickshaw was waiting on the far side of the bridge chloe bundled cal into his seat throwing the tasselled cushions out to lighten the load be swift she said to floris no sooner had she spoken than they were off it was a hairraising journey a great urgency had seized everything and everybody as the fugue prepared to lose its substance to pattern again overhead the night sky was a maze of birds the fields were rife with animals there was everywhere a great readying as if for some momentous dive do you dream cal asked chloe as they travelled the question had come out of the blue but was suddenly of great importance to him dream said chloe when youre in the weave perhaps she said she seemed preoccupied but i never remember my dreams i sleep too deeply she faltered then looked away from cal before saying like death youll wake again soon he said understanding the melancholy that had come upon her itll only be a few days he tried to sound confident but doubted that he was succeeding he knew all too little of what the night had brought was shadwell still alive and the sisters and if so where im going to help you he said that i do know im part of this place now oh yes she said with great gravity that you are but cal she looked at him her hand taking his and he felt a bond between them an intimacy even which seemed out of all proportion to the meagre time theyd known each other cal future history is full of tricks i dont follow things can be so easily erased she said and forever believe me forever entire lives gone as if theyd never been lived am i missing something he said just dont assume everythings guaranteed i dont he told her good good she seemed a little cheered by this youre a fine man calhoun but youll forget forget what all this the fugue he laughed never he said oh but you will indeed maybe you have to have to or your heart would break he thought of lemuel again and his parting words remember hed said was it really so difficult if there were any further words to be said on the subject they went unvoiced for at this point floris brought the rickshaw to an abrupt halt whats the problem chloe wanted to know the rickshaw driver pointed dead ahead no more than a hundred yards from where the rickshaw stood the landscape and all it contained was losing itself to the weave solid matter becoming clouds of colour from which the threads of the carpet would be drawn so soon said chloe get out calhoun we can take you no further the line of the weave was approaching like a forest fire eating up everything in its path it was an awesome scene though he knew perfectly well what procedures were under way here and knew them to be benevolent the sight was almost chilling a world was dissolving before his very eyes youre on your own from here said chloe about turn floris andflyl the rickshaw was turned what happens to me said cal youre a cuckoo chloe shouted back at him as floris hauled the rickshaw away you can simply walk out the other side she shouted something else which he failed to catch he hoped to god it wasnt a prayer xii a vanishing breed despite chloes words the spectacle ahead offered little comfort the devouring line was approaching at considerable speed and it left nothing unchanged his gut feeling was to flee before it but he knew that would be a vain manoeuvre this same transfiguring tide would be eating in from all compass points sooner or later there would be nowhere left to run instead of standing still and letting it come to fetch him he elected to walk towards it and brave its touch the air began to itch around him as he took his first hesitant steps the ground squirmed and shook beneath his feet a few more yards and the region he was walking through actually began to shift loose pebbles were snatched into the flux leaves plucked from bush and tree this is going to hurt he thought the frontier was no more than ten yards from him now and he could see with astonishing clarity the processes at work the raptures of the loom dividing the matter of the fugue into strands then drawing these up into the air and knotting them those knots in their turn filling the air like countless insects until the final rapture called them into the carpet he could afford to wonder at this sight for seconds only before he and it met each other strands leaping up around him like rainbow fountains there was no time for farewells the fugue simply vanished from sight leaving him immersed in the working of the loom the rising threads gave him the sensation of falling as though the knots were destined for heaven and he a damned soul but it wasnt heaven above him it was pattern a kaleidoscope that defeated eye and mind its motifs configuring and reconfiguring as they found their place beside their fellows even now he was certain hed be similarly metamorphosed his flesh and bone become symbol and he be woven into the grand design but chloes prayer if that it had been afforded him protection the loom rejected his cuckoostuff and passed him by one minute he was in the midst of the weave the next the glories of the fugue were behind him and he was left standing in a bare field he wasnt alone there several dozen seerkind had chosen to step out into the kingdom some stood alone watching their home consumed by the weave others were in small groups debating feverishly yet others were already heading off into the gloom before the adamaticals came looking for them among them lit by the blaze of the weave a face he recognized that of apolline dubois he went to her she saw him coming but offered no welcome have you seen suzanna he asked her she shook her head ive been cremating frederick and setting my affairs to rights she said she got no further an elegant individual his cheeks rouged now appeared at her side he looked every inch a pimp we should go moth he said before the beasts are upon us i know apolline said to him then to cal were going to make our fortunes teaching you cuckoos the meaning of desire her companion offered a less than wholesome grin more than half his teeth were gold there are high times ahead she said and patted cals cheek so you come see me one of these days she said well treat you well she took the pimps arm bon chance she said and the pair hurried away the line of the weave was by now a good distance from where cal stood and the numbers of seerkind whod emerged was well into three figures he went amongst them still looking for suzanna his presence was largely ignored they had more pressing concerns these people delivered into the late twentieth century with only magic to keep them from harm he didnt envy them amongst the refugees he caught sight of three of the buyers standing dazed and dusty their faces blank what would they make of tonights experiences he wondered would they pour the whole story out to their friends and endure the disbelief and contempt heaped on their heads or would they let the tale fester untold the latter he suspected dawn was close the weaker stars had already disappeared and even the brightest were uncertain of themselves its over he heard somebody murmur he looked back towards the weave the brilliance of its making had almost flickered out but suddenly a shout in the night and a beat later cal saw three lights members of the amadou rising from the embers of the weave at enormous speed they drew together as they rose until high above the streets and fields they collided the blaze of their meeting illuminated the landscape as far as the eye could see by it cal glimpsed seerkind running in all directions averting their eyes from the brilliance then the light died and the predawn gloom that followed seemed so impenetrable by contrast that cal was effectively blind for a minute or more as by slow degrees the world reestablished itself about him he realized that there had been nothing arbitrary about the fireworks or their effect the seerkind had disappeared where ninety seconds ago there had been scraggling figures all around him there was now emptiness under the cover of light theyd made their escape xiii a proposal hobart had seen the blaze of the amadou too though he was still two and a half miles from the spot the night had brought disaster upon disaster richardson still jittery after events at headquarters had twice driven the car into the back of stationary vehicles and their route which had taken them all over the wirral had been a series of culdesacs but at last here it was a sign that their quarry was close what was that said richardson looked like something exploding god knows said hobart i wouldnt put anything past these people especially the woman should we call in some backup sir we dont know their numbers even if we could hobart said switching off the white noise which had swallowed downey hours ago want to keep this quiet until we know whats what kill the headlights the driver did so and they drove on in the murk that preceded daybreak hobart thought he could see figures moving in the mist beyond the grey foliage that lined the road there was no time to investigate however he would have to trust his instinct that the woman was somewhere up ahead suddenly there was somebody in the road ahead of them cursing richardson threw the wheel over but the figure seemed to leap up and over the car the vehicle mounted the pavement and ran a few yards before richardson brought it under control again shit did you see that hobart had and felt the same aching unease hed felt back at headquarters these people were holding weapons that worked on a mans sense of what was real and he loved reality more than his balls didyou see said richardson the fucker just flew no hobart said firmly there was no flying understood yes sir dont trust your eyes trust me yes sir and if anything else gets in your way run it down the light that had blinded cal blinded shadwell too he fell from the back of his human horse and scrabbled around in the dirt until the world began to come back into focus when it did two sights greeted him one that of norris lying on the ground sobbing like an infant the other suzanna accompanied by two of the kind emerging from the rubble of shearmans house they werent emptyhanded they were carrying the carpet god the carpet he looked about him for the incantatrix but there was noone near to aid him except the horse who was well past aiding anybody stay calm he told himself you ve still got the jacket he brushed off the worst of the dirt hed acquired centred the knot of his tie then walked over to intercept the thieves thank you so much he said as he approached them for preserving my property suzanna gave him a single glance then told the carpetbearers ignore him that said she led them towards the road shadwell went after them quickly and took firm hold of the womans arm he was determined to preserve his politeness as long as possible it always confused the enemy do we have a problem here he wondered no problem suzanna said the carpet belongs to me miss parrish i insist that it remain here suzanna looked around for jerichau theyd become separated in the last minutes of her briefing at capras house when messimeris had taken her aside to offer her some words of advice he had still been in full flow when the weave had reached the doorstep of capras house she had never heard his final remarks please said shadwell smiling we can surely come to some arrangement if you wish ill buy the item off you how much shall we say he opened his jacket no longer directing his spiel at suzanna but at the two who were carrying the carpet strong armed they might be but easy fodder already they were staring into the folds of the jacket maybe you see something you like he said its a trick said suzanna but look one of them said to her and damn it if she instinctively didnt do exactly that had the night not brought so many exhausting diversions she would have had the strength to avert her sight immediately but she wasnt fast enough something glimmered in the motherofpearl lining and she could not quite unhook her gaze you do see something shadwell said to her something pretty for a pretty woman she did the raptures of the jacket had seized her in two seconds flat and she couldnt resist its mischief at the back of her head a voice called her name but she ignored it again it called look away it said but she could see something taking shape in the lining and it tantalized her no damn you the same voice shouted and this time a blurred figure came between her and shadwell her reverie broke and she was thrown from the jackets soothing embrace to see cal in front of her throwing a barrage of punches at the enemy shadwell was much the bigger of the two men but the heat of cals fury had momentarily cowed him get the fuck out of here cal yelled by now shadwell had overcome his shock and launched himself upon cal who reeled before the retaliation knowing hed lose the bout in seconds he ducked beneath shadwells fists and took hold of the salesman in a bearhug they wrestled for several seconds precious time which suzanna seized to lead the carpetcarriers through the rubble and away their escape came not a moment too soon in the time shed been distracted by the jacket day had almost come upon them theyd soon be easy targets for immacolata or indeed anyone else who wanted to stop them hobart for instance she saw him now as they reached the edge of shearmans estate stepping out of a car parked in the street even in this dubious light and at some distance she knew it was he her hatred smelt him and she knew too with some prophetic sense the menstruum had undammed in her that even if they escaped him now the pursuit would not stop here shed made an enemy for the millennium she didnt watch him for long why bother she could perfectly recall every nick and pore upon his barren face and if the memory ever grew a little dim all she would have to do was look over her shoulder damn him hed be there though cal held onto shadwell with the tenacity of a terrier the salesmans superior weight rapidly gained the day cal was thrown down amongst the bricks and shadwell closed in no quarter was given shadwell began to kick him not once but a dozen times fucking bastard he yelled the kicks kept coming timed to prevent cal getting up im going to break every bone in your fucking body shadwell promised im going to fucking kill you he might have done it too but that somebody said you shadwells assault stopped momentarily and cal looked past the salesmans legs to the man in dark glasses who was approaching it was the policeman from chariot street shadwell turned on the man who the hell are you he said inspector hobart came the reply cal could imagine the wave of guilelessness that would now be breaking over shadwells face he could hear it in the mans voice inspector of course of course and you hobart returned who are you cal didnt hear the rest of the exchange he was occupied with the business of making his bruised body crawl away through the rubble hoping the same good fortune that had let him escape alive had speeded suzanna on her way where is she wheres who the woman who was here said hobart he took off his glasses the better to see this suspect in the halflight the man has dangerous eyes thought shadwell he has the eyes of a rabid fox and he wants suzanna too how interesting her name is suzanna parrish said hobart ah said shadwell you know her indeed i do shes a thief shes a good deal worse than that whats worse than a thief thought shadwell but said is that so shes wanted for questioning on charges of terrorism and youre here to arrest her i am good man said shadwell what better he thought an upstanding fineprincipled lawloving despot who could ask for a better ally in such troubled times i have some evidence he said that may be of value to you but strictly for your eyes only on hobarts instruction richardson retired a little way im in no mood for games hobart warned believe me said shadwell upon my mothers eyes this is no game he opened his jacket the inspectors fretful glance went immediately to the lining hes hungry thought shadwell hes so hungry but what for that would be interesting to see what would friend hobart desire most in all the wide world maybe you see something there that catches your eye hobart smiled nodded you do then take it please its yours the inspector reached towards the jacket go on shadwell encouraged him hed never seen such a look on any human face such a wilderness of innocent malice a light ignited within the jacket and hobarts eyes suddenly grew wilder still then he was drawing his hand out of the lining and shadwell almost let out a yelp of surprise as he shared the lunatics vision in the palm of the mans hand a livid fire was burning its flames yellow and white they leapt a foot high eager for something to consume their brilliance echoed in hobarts eyes oh yes said hobart give me fire its yours my friend and ill burn them away shadwell smiled you and i together he proposed thus began a marriage made in hell back among the blind men if a man could pass through paradise in a dream and have a flower presented to him as a pledge that his soul had really been there and if he found that flower in his hand when he awoke aye and what then s t coleridge anima poetae part six i times gone by the people of chariot street had witnessed some rare scenes in recent times but theyd reestablished the status quo with admirable zeal it was just before eight in the morning when cal got off the bus and began the short walk to the mooney residence and everywhere along the street the same domestic rituals that hed witnessed here since his childhood were being played out radios announced the mornings news through open windows and doors a parliamentarian had been found dead in his mistress arms bombs had been dropped in the middle east slaughter and scandal scandal and slaughter and was the tea too weak this morning my dear and did the children wash behind their ears he let himself into the house turning over yet again the problem of what to tell brendan anything less than the truth might beg more questions than it answered and yet to tell the whole story was that even possible did the words exist to evoke more than an echo of the sights hed seen the feelings hed felt the house was quiet which was worrying brendan had been a dawn riser since his days working on the docks even during the worst of recent times hed been up to greet his grief early cal called his fathers name there was no response he went through to the kitchen the garden looked like a battlefield he called again then went to search upstairs his fathers bedroom door was closed he tried the handle but the door was locked from the inside something hed never known happen before he knocked lightly dad he said are you there he waited several seconds listening closely then repeated his enquiry this time from within came a quiet sobbing thank god he breathed dad its cal the sobbing softened will you let me in dad there was a short interval then he heard his fathers footsteps as he crossed to the bedroom door the key was turned the door was opened a reluctant six inches the face on the other side was more shadow than man brendan looked neither to have washed nor shaved since the previous day oh god dad brendan peered at his son with naked suspicion is it really you the comment reminded cal of how he must look his face bloodied and bruised im all right dad he said offering a smile what about you are all the doors closed brendan wanted to know the doors yes and the windows yes brendan nodded youre absolutely sure i told you yes whats wrong dad the rats said brendan his eyes scanning the landing behind cal i heard them all night they came up the stairs they did sat at the top of the stairs i heard them size of cats they were they sat there waiting for me to come out well theyre not here any longer got in through the fence off the embankment dozens of them why dont we go downstairs cal suggested i can make you some breakfast no im not coming down not today then ill make something and bring it up shall i if you like said brendan as cal started down the stairs again he heard his father lock and bolt the door once more in the middle of the morning a knock on the door it was mrs vallance whose house was opposite the mooneys i was just passing she said this fact belied by the slippers on her feet i thought id see how your father was doing he was very odd with the police i heard what did you do to your face im all right i had a very polite officer interview mehe woman said he asked me she lowered her voice if your father was unbalanced cal bit back a retort they wanted to talk to you too of course she said well im here now said cal if they need me my boy raymond said he saw you on the railway running off he said goodbye mrs vallance and hes got good eyes has raymond i said goodbye said cal and slammed the door in the womans selfsatisfied face her visit was not the last of the day several people called to see that all was well there was clearly much gossip in the street about the mooney household perhaps some bright spark had realized that it had been the centre of the previous days drama every time there was a knock on the door cal expected to see shadwell on the step but apparently the salesman had more urgent concerns than finishing the job hed begun in the ruins of shearmans house or perhaps he was simply waiting for more propitious stars then just after noon while cal was out at the loft feeding the birds the telephone rang he raced inside and snatched it up even before she spoke cal knew it was suzanna where are you she was breathless and agitated we have to get out of the city cal theyre after us shadwell not just shadwell the police have you got the carpet yes well then tell me where you are ill come and i cant not on the phone its not tapped for gods sake any bets i have to see you he said somewhere between a request and a demand yes she replied her voice softening yes of course how there was a long silence then she said where you made your confession what you remember he thought about it what confession had he ever made to her oh yes i love you how could he have forgotten that yes she said yes when an hour ill be there we dont have much time cal he was going to tell her he knew that but the line was already dead the ache in his bruised bones improved miraculously after the conversation his step was light as he went upstairs to check on brendan i have to go out for a while dad have you locked all the doors his father asked yes the house is locked and bolted nothing can get in is there anything else you need brendan took a moment to consider the question id like some whisky he said finally do we have any in the bookcase said the old man behind the dickens til fetch it for you he was sliding the bottle from its hiding place when the doorbell rang again he was of half a mind not to answer it but the visitor insisted ill be with you in a minute he called upstairs then opened the door the man in the dark glasses said calhoun mooney yes my names inspector hobart this is officer richardson were here to ask you some questions right now said cal im just about to go out urgent business said hobart wiser to say no cal reasoned not exactly he said then you wont mind us taking up some time said hobart and the two of them were inside the house in seconds close the door hobart instructed his colleague you look flustered mooney have you got something to hide why should no were in possession of information to the contrary from above brendan called for his whisky whos that its my father said cal he wanted a drink richardson plucked the bottle from cals hand and crossed to the bottom of the stairs dont go up said cal youll frighten him nervous family richardson remarked hes not been well said cal my men are like lambs said hobart as long as youre within the law again brendans voice drifted down cal who is it just someone who wants a word with me dad cal said there was another answer in his throat though one which he swallowed unsaid a truer answer its the rats dad they got in after all the minutes ticked by the question came around and around as if on a carousel it was apparent from hobarts probing that hed spoken at length with shadwell so outright denials from cal were fruitless he was obliged to tell what little part of the truth he could yes he did know a woman called suzanna parrish no he knew nothing of her personal history nor had she spoken of her political affiliations yes he had seen her in the last twentyfour hours no he did not know where she was now as he answered the questions he tried not to think of her waiting for him at the river waiting and not finding him and going away but the more he tried to put the thought from his head the more it returned restless mooney im a little hot thats all got an appointment to keep have you no where is she mooney i dont know theres no sense in protecting her shes the worst filth mooney believe me ive seen what she can do things you wouldnt believe makes my stomach turn over to think of it he spoke with complete conviction cal didnt doubt that he meant all he said what are you mooney what do you mean are you my friend or my enemy theres no middle way you see no maybe friend or enemy which ive done nothing against the law til be the one to decide that said hobart i know the law i know it and love it and i wont have it spat on mooney not by you or anybody he took a breath then stated youre a liar mooney i dont know how deep youre in this or why but i do know youre a liar a pause then so well start over again shall we ive told you everything i know well start from the beginning how did you meet the terrorist suzanna parrish after two and three quarter hours on the carousel hobart finally bored of the ride and pronounced that he was finished with cal for now no charges would be pressed at least not immediately but cal should consider himself under suspicion you made yourself two enemies today mooney hobart said me and the law youll live to regret that then the rats left cal sat in the back room for five minutes trying to gather his thoughts then went up to see how brendan was faring the old man was asleep leaving his father to his dreams cal went in search of his own shed gone of course long ago he wandered around in the vicinity searching amongst the warehouses hoping shed left some message for him but there was none to be found exhausted by all the day had brought he headed home as he stepped through the gate back onto the dock road he caught sight of someone watching him from a parked car one of hobarts clan perhaps one of the lawlovers maybe suzanna had been nearby after all but unable to make her presence known for fear of being spotted the thought of her being so close frustrating as it was cushioned the blow of not seeing her at least a little when things were safe shed call him and arrange another rendezvous in the evening the wind got up and it gusted through the night and the following day bringing the first chill of autumn with it but it brought no news ii despair and so it went on for a week and a half no news no news he returned to work claiming his fathers illness as reason for his absence and took up where hed left off amid the claim forms at lunchtimes he came back to the house to heat up some food for brendan who though he could be coaxed from his room was painfully anxious to return to it and to feed the birds in the evenings he made some attempt to tidy the garden he even patched the fence but these tasks received only a fraction of his attention however many diversions he put between himself and his impatience nine out of every ten thoughts were of suzanna and her precious burden but the more days that went by without word from her the more he began to think the unthinkable that she wasnt going to ring either she feared the consequences of trying to make contact or worse she no longer could towards the end of the second week he decided to try and find the carpet by the only means available to him he set the pigeons free they rose up into the air in an aerial ovation and circled the house the sight reminded him of that first day in rue street and his spirits lifted go on he willed them go on round and round they flew as if orienting themselves his heart beat a little faster each time it seemed one of them was detaching itself from the flock to head off running shoes on he was ready to follow but after all too short a time they began to tire of their liberation one by one they fluttered down again even some landing in the garden others on the gutters of the house a few even flew straight back into the loft their perches were cramped and doubtless the night trains disturbed their sleep but for most of them it was the only habitat theyd ever known though there were surely winds up there to tempt them winds that smelt of places lusher than their loft beside the railway line they had no wish to chance their wings on such currents he cursed them for their lack of enterprise and fed them and watered them and finally returned despondently to the house where brendan was talking of rats again iii forgetfulness the third week of september brought rain not the torrents of august which had poured from operatic skies but drizzles and piddlings the days grew greyer and so it seemed did brendan though cal made daily attempts to persuade his father downstairs he would no longer come cal also made two or three valiant efforts to talk about what had happened a month before but the old man was simply not interested his eyes became glazed as soon as he sensed the drift of the conversation and if cal persisted he grew irritable the professionals judged that brendan was suffering from senile dementia an irreversible process which would finally make him impossible for cal to nurse it might be best for all concerned they advised if a place were found in a nursing home where brendan could be cared for twentyfour hours a day cal rejected the suggestion he was certain that brendans cleaving to a room he knew one hed shared with eileen for so many years was all that was keeping him from total breakdown he was not alone in his attempts to nurse his father two days after hed failed to set the pigeons flying geraldine had appeared at the house there was ten minutes of hesitant apologies and explanations then brendans condition entered the exchange and geraldines good sense came triumphantly to the fore forget our differences she said i want to help cal was not about to refuse the offer brendan responded to geraldines presence as a child to a longlost teat he was cosseted and indulged and with geraldine in the house in eileens place cal found himself falling back into the old domestic routines the affection he felt for geraldine was painless which was surely the most certain sign of how slight it was when she was there he was happy to be with her but he seldom if ever missed her as to the fugue he did his best to keep his memories of it sharp but it was by no means easy the kingdom had ways to induce forgetfulness so subtle and so numerous he was scarcely aware of how they dulled him it was only when in the middle of a dreary day something reminded him a scent a shout that he had once been in another place and breathed its air and met its creatures it was only then that he realized how tentative his recall was and the more he went in pursuit of what he was forgetting the more it eluded him the glories of the fugue were becoming mere words the reality of which he could no longer conjure when he thought of an orchard it was less and less that extraordinary place hed slept in and more a commonplace stand of apple trees the miracles were drifting from him and he seemed to be unable to hold onto them surely dying was like this he thought losing things dear and unable to prevent their passing yes this was a kind of dying brendan for his part continued to continue as the weeks passed geraldine managed to talk him into joining them downstairs but he was interested in little but tea and television and his conversation was now scarcely more than grunts sometimes cal would watch brendans face as he sat slumped in front of the television his expression unchanging whether the screen offered pundits or comedians and wondered what had happened to the man hed known was the old brendan still in hiding somewhere behind those addled eyes or had he been an illusion all along a sons dream of his fathers permanence which like the letter from eileen had simply evaporated perhaps it was for the best he thought that brendan was shielded from his pain then drew himself up short at such a thought wasnt that what they said as the coffin was marched past it was all for the best brendan wasnt dead yet as time went by geraldines presence began to prove as comforting to cal as to the old man her smiles were the brightest thing those dismal months could boast she came and went more indispensable by the day until in the first week of december she suggested it might be more convenient all round if she slept at the house it was a perfectly natural progression i dont want to marry you she told him quite plainly the sorry spectacle of theresas marriage five months old and already rocky had confirmed her worst suspicions of matrimony i did want to marry you once she said but now im happy just to be with you she proved easy company downtoearth unsentimental as much companion as lover she it was who made certain the bills were paid on time and saw that there was tea in the caddy she it was too who suggested that cal sell the pigeons your father doesnt show any interest in them any longer she said on more than one occasion he wouldnt even notice if they were gone that was certainly true but cal refused to contemplate the sale come spring and the fine weather his father might well show fresh interest in the birds you know thats not true shed tell him when he put this point why do you want to keep them so much theyre just a burden then shed let the subject drop for a few days only to raise it again when a cue was presented history was repeating itself often in the course of these exchanges which gradually became more heated cal could hear echoes of his mother and father the same routes were being trodden afresh and like his father cal though malleable on almost every other issue was immovable on this he would not sell the birds the real reason for his bullishness was not of course hope of brendans rehabilitation but the fact that the birds were his last concrete link with the events of the previous summer in the weeks after suzannas disappearance hed bought a dozen newspapers a day scanning each page for some report of her or the carpet or shadwell but there was nothing and eventually unable to bear the daily disappointment hed stopped looking nor was there any further visit from hobart or his men which was in its way bad news he cal had become an irrelevancy the story if it was still being written was running on without him he became so frightened hed forget the fugue that he took the risk of writing down all that he could remember of the night there which when he set himself to the task was depressingly little he wrote the names down too lemuel lo apolline dubois frederick cammell set them all down at the back of his diary in the section reserved for telephone numbers except that there were no numbers for these people nor addresses either just uncommon names to which he was less and less able to attach faces on some nights he had dreams from which he would wake with tears on his face geraldine consoled him as best she could given that he claimed not to recall these dreams when he woke that was in a sense true he brought nothing into consciousness that words could encapsulate only an aching sadness she would lie beside him then and stroke his hair and tell him that though these were difficult times things could be much worse she was right of course and by and by the dreams dwindled until they finally ceased altogether in the last week of january with christmas bills still outstanding and too little money to pay them with he sold the pigeons with the exception of and his mate this pair he kept though the reason why was harder and harder to remember and by the end of the following month had been forgotten entirely iv the nomads the passage of winter was certainly weary for cal but for suzanna it held perils far worse than boredom and bad dreams those perils had begun the day after the night of the fugue when she and the peverelli brothers had so narrowly escaped capture by shadwell her life and jerichaus with whom shed been reunited in the street beyond shearmans estate had scarcely been out of danger since she had been warned of this at capras house and a good deal else beside but of all shed learned the subject that had left the deepest impression was the scourge the councillors had grown pale talking of how close to extinction the families had come and though the enemies now snapping at her heels shadwell and hobart were of a different order entirely she could not help but believe they and the scourge sprang from the same poisonous earth they were all in their way enemies of life and they were equally relentless staying one step ahead of the salesman and his new ally was exhausting she and jerichau had been granted a few hours grace on that first day when a false trail laid by the brothers had successfully confused the hounds but hobart had picked up the scent again by noon shed had no choice but to leave the city that afternoon in a secondhand car shed bought to replace the police vehicle theyd stolen using her own car she knew would be like sending up smoke signals one fact surprised her there was no sign either on the day of reweaving or subsequently of immacolata was it possible that the incantatrix and her sisters had elected to stay in the carpet or even become trapped there against their will perhaps that was too much to hope for yet the menstruum which she was increasingly able to control and use never carried a tremor of immacolatas presence jerichau kept a respectful distance in those early weeks made uneasy perhaps by her preoccupation with the menstruum he could be of no use in her learning process the force she owned was a mystery to him his maleness feared it but by degrees she convinced him that neither it nor she bore him the slightest illwill and he grew a little easier with her powers she was even able to talk with him about how shed first gained access to the menstruum and how it had subsequently delved into cal she was grateful for the chance to talk about these events theyd remained locked up in her for too long fretted over he had few answers for her but the very telling seemed to heal her anxieties and the less anxious she became the more the menstruum showed its worth it gave her a power that proved invaluable in those weeks a premonitory skill that showed her ghostforms of the future shed see hobarts face on the stairs outside the room where they were hiding and know that hed be standing in that very spot before too long sometimes she saw shadwell too but mostly it was hobart his eyes desperate his thin mouth shaping her name that was the signal to move on of course whatever the time of day or night pack up their bags and the carpet and go she had other talents too all rooted in the menstruum she could see the lights jerichau had first shown her on lord street and after a surprisingly short space they became quite unremarkable to her merely another piece of information like the expression on a face or the tone of a voice that she used to read a strangers temperament and there was another visionary skill she now possessed somewhere between the premonitions and the haloes that is she could see the consequence of natural processes it wasnt just the bud she saw but the blossom it would become in spring and if she stretched her sight a little further the fruit that would come after it this grasp of potential had several consequences for one she gave up eating eggs for another she found herself fighting off a beguiling fatalism which if she hadnt resisted it might have left her adrift in a sea of inevitabilities going whatever way the future chose to take her it was jerichau who helped save her from this dangerous tide with his boundless enthusiasm for being and doing though the blossom and the withering of the blossom were inevitable human and seerkind had choices to make before death roads to travel roads to ignore one of those choices was whether to stay companions or become lovers they chose to be lovers though it happened so naturally suzanna could not pinpoint the moment of decision certainly they never talked explicitly about it though perhaps it had been in the air since the conversation in the field outside capras house it just seemed right that they take that comfort from each other he was a sophisticated bedpartner responsive to subtle changes in mood capable of raucous laughter one moment and great gravity the next he was also much to her delight a brilliant thief despite the vicissitudes of life on the run they ate like royalty simply because he was so lightfingered she wasnt certain how he managed to be so successful whether it was some subtle rapture he employed to divert a watchers eye or whether he was simply born a thief whatever his method he could steal anything large or small and scarcely a day went by without their tasting some expensive delicacy or indulging his newfound passion for champagne it made the chase easier in more practical ways too for they were able to change cars as often as they liked leaving a trail of abandoned vehicles along the route that route took them in no particular direction they simply drove where their instincts suggested intentionality jerichau had said was the easiest way to get caught i never intend to steal he explained to suzanna one day as they drove not until ive done it so nobody ever knows what im up to because i dont either she liked this philosophy it appealed to her sense of humour if she ever got back to london to her clay and her kiln she would see if the notion made aesthetic as well as criminal sense maybe letting go was the only true control what kind of pots would she make if she didnt try to think about it the trick however didnt dislodge their pursuers merely kept them at a distance and on more than one occasion that distance narrowed uncomfortably they had been two days in newcastle in a small hotel on rudyard street the rain had been falling steadily for a week now and theyd been talking over the possibility of leaving the country going somewhere sunnier serious problems attended such an option however for one jerichau had no passport and any attempt to get him one would put them both under scrutiny for another it was possible hobart had alerted ports and airports to their existence and third even if they could travel the carpet would be more difficult to transport theyd almost certainly be obliged to let it out of their sight and this suzanna was not willing to do the argument went back and forth while they ate their pizza and drank their champagne and the rain lashed against the window and then the fluttering began in her lower belly that shed come to recognize as an omen she looked towards the door and for a sickening moment she thought the menstruum had been too late with its warning for she saw the door open and there was hobart staring straight at her what is it jerichau said his words made her realize her error the ghost she saw was more solid than shed ever seen before which probably meant the event it foreshadowed was imminent hobart she said and i dont think weve got much time he made a pained face but didnt question her authority on the matter if she said hobart was near then near he was shed become the augurer the witch reading the air and always finding bad news moving was an elaborate business because of the carpet at each stoppingplace they had to convince either the proprietor or the manager that the carpet came with them to their room when they left it had to be manhandled back into whichever vehicle theyd commandeered that day all of which drew unwelcome attention there was no alternative however nobody had ever promised that heaven would be a light load to carry less than thirty minutes later hobart pushed the door of the hotel suite open the room was still warm with the womans breath but she and her nigger had gone again how many times in the last months had he stood in their litter and breathed the same air shed breathed and seen the shape of her body left on the bed but always too late always they were ahead of him and away and all he was left with was another haunted room there would be no restful nights for him no nor peaceful days until she was caught and under his thumb her capture had become his obsession and her punishment too he knew all too well that in this decadent age when every perversion had its apologist she would be eloquently defended once caught that was why he came in search of her personally he and his few so that he might show her the true face of the law before the liberals came pleading she would suffer for what shed done to his heroes she would cry out for mercy and he would be strong and deaf to her pleas he had an ally in this of course shadwell there was not one amongst his superiors in the force whom he trusted as he trusted that man they were like twin souls he took strength from that and oddly from the book too the book of codes that hed taken from her hed had the volume studied minutely the paper and the binding all analysed for some hidden significance none had been found which left the words and the pictures these too had been studied by experts the stories were apparently quite straightforward faerytales the illustrations like the text also pretended innocence but he wasnt fooled the book meant something more than once upon a time he didnt doubt that for an instant when he finally had the woman to himself hed burn its meaning from her and no faintheart would stop him theyd been more cautious after the nearmiss in newcastle instead of visiting major cities where the police presence was substantial they started to find smaller communities that had its own disadvantages of course the arrival of two strangers and a carpet aroused curiosity and questions but the change of tactics worked never staying in any place more than thirtysix hours and moving irrationally from town to town village to village the trail grew colder behind them days free of the hounds turned to weeks and weeks became months and it was almost as if their pursuers had given up the chase in that time suzannas thoughts turned often to cal so much had happened since that day beside the mersey when hed professed love to her shed often wondered how much of what hed felt had been some unconscious knowledge of how the menstruum had touched him entered him and how much had been love as it was conventionally understood sometimes she longed to pick up the phone and speak to him indeed on several occasions shed tried to do just that was it paranoia that prevented her from speaking or was there as her instinct intimated another presence on the line monitoring the call on the fourth and fifth occasions it wasnt even cal who answered but a woman who demanded to know who this was and when suzanna remained silent threatened to report her she didnt call again it simply wasnt worth the risk jerichau had an opinion on the matter mooneys a cuckoo he said when cals name came up in conversation you should forget him if youre a cuckoo youre worth nothing is that it she said what about me you belong with us now he said youre seerkind theres so much you dont know about me she said years and years of just being an ordinary girl you were never ordinary oh yes she said believe me i was still am here she tapped her forehead sometimes i wake up and i cant believe whats happened happening to me when i think of the way i was its no use to look back said jerichau no use thinking of what could have been you dont do that any more do you ive noticed you dont even talk about the fugue jerichau smiled why should i he said im happy as i am with you maybe itll be different tomorrow maybe it was different yesterday i forget but today now im happy i even begin to like the kingdom she remembered him lost in the crowd on lord street how hed changed so what if you never saw the fugue again he pondered this a moment who knows better not to think about it it was an improbable romance she learning all the time from the power inside her a new vision he daily more seduced by the very world whose trivialities she was seeing with clearer and clearer eyes and with that comprehension so unlike the simplifications shed been ruled by hitherto she became even more certain that the carpet they carried was a last hope while he whose home the weave contained seemed increasingly indifferent to its fate living in the moment and for the moment touched scarcely at all by hope or regret he talked less and less of finding a safe place for the fugue to reside more and more of something tantalizing hed seen in the street or on the television often now though he stayed with her and told her she could always rely upon him she felt she was alone and somewhere behind her hobart was also alone even amongst his men or with shadwell alone dreaming of her and the scent she left to mock him and of the brutalities hed deliver upon her in these dreams his hands would be flaming as theyd been once before and as she fought him the flames would lick up the walls of the room and crawl across the ceiling until the chamber was an oven and hed wake with his hands in front of his face running not with fire but sweat glad of the law to keep him from panic and glad too that he was on the side of the angels v our lady of the bones these were dark days for shadwell he had emerged from the fugue in high spirits possessed of a new breadth of purpose only to have the world he wished so much to rule snatched from beneath his nose not only that but immacolata to whom he might have looked for assistance had apparently elected to remain in the weave she was after all one of the seerkind even though theyd spurned her perhaps he shouldnt be so surprised that once back on soil shed once pretended to shed been moved to remain there he was not completely bereft of company norris the hamburger king was still at his beck and call still content with servitude and of course there was hobart the inspector was probably insane but that was all to the good and he had one particular aspiration which shadwell knew he might one day need to turn to his own ends that was to lead as hobart put it a righteous crusade there was little use of a crusade however with nothing to mount it against five long months had passed and every day that went by with the carpet unfound his desperation grew unlike others whod stepped from the fugue that night he remembered the experience in the finest detail the jacket charged with the raptures of the realm kept the memories fresh all too fresh scarcely an hour passed without his craving to be there there was more to his hunger than simply the desire to possess the fugue in these long weeks of waiting hed come to a yet profounder ambition if and when that soil was once more his to tread hed do what none of the seerkind had ever dared hed go into the gyre this notion once conceived tormented his every waking moment penalties might have to be paid for such trespass but would they not be worth the risk hidden behind that mask of cloud the mantle was a concentration of magic unequalled in the history of the seerkind and therefore in the history of the world creation held court in the gyre to walk there and see its secrets for himself would that not be a kind of godhood and today he had the setting to match the tenor of these thoughts this small church dedicated to st philomena and st callixtus hidden away in the concrete wasteland of the city of london he had not come here for the good of his soul he had been invited here by the priest who was presently conducting the lunchtime mass for a handful of office workers a man hed never met who had written saying he had important news news shadwell could profit by the salesman had come without hesitation shadwell had been brought up a catholic and though hed long neglected his faith there was no forgetting the rituals hed learned as a child he listened to the sanctus his lips running with the rhythm of the words though it was twenty years since hed attended them then the eucharistic prayer something short and sweet so as not to keep the accountants from their calculations and on to the consecration take this all of you and eat it this is my body which will be given up for you old words old rituals but they still made sound commercial sense talk of power and might would always attract an audience lords never went out of fashion lost in thought he wasnt even aware that the mass had ended until the priest appeared at his side mr shadwell he looked up from his calfskin gloves the church was empty but for the two of them weve been waiting for you said the priest not waiting for confirmation that he had the right man youre most welcome shadwell got to his feet whats this about perhaps youll come with me came the response shadwell saw no reason not to comply the priest led him across the nave and into a woodpanelled room which smelt like a brothel sweat and perfume mingled at the far end of the room a curtain which he drew aside and another door before turning the key he said you must stay close by me mr shadwell and not approach the shrine the shrine for the first time since coming here shadwell had an inkling of what was going on i understand he said the priest opened the door there was a steep flight of stone steps before them lit only by the meagre light shed from the room they were leaving he lost count of the steps after thirty they were descending in almost total darkness after the first ten and he kept his hands stretched to the wall which was dry and chilly in order to maintain his balance but now below a light the priest glanced over his shoulder his face a pale ball in the murk stay by me he cautioned its dangerous at the bottom the priest took hold of his arm as though not trusting shadwell to obey his instructions they had arrived in the centre of a labyrinth it seemed galleries ran off in all directions twisting and turning unpredictably in some candles burned others were in darkness it was only as the guide led him down one of these corridors that shadwell realized they were not alone here the walls were lined with niches each of which contained a coffin he shuddered the dead were on every side it was their dust that he could taste on his tongue there was only one person he knew who would willingly keep such company even as he formed this thought the priests hand dropped from his arm and the man withdrew down the passageway at some speed murmuring a prayer as he went the reason a veiled figure dressed from head to foot in black approaching him down the tunnel like a mourner whod lost their way amongst the caskets she did not have to speak or raise her veil for shadwell to know that it was immacolata she stood a little way from him saying nothing her breath shook the folds of her veil then she said shadwell her voice was slurred even laboured i thought youd stayed in the weave he said i was almost detained there she replied detained behind him shadwell heard the priests feet on the stairs as he made his exit friend of yours he asked they worship me she told him call me goddess mother of the night they emasculate themselves in order to better show their adulation shadwell grimaced thats why youre not allowed in the vicinity of the shrine they consider it desecration if their goddess hadnt spoken they would not have let you this far whyd you put up with them they gave me a hidingplace when i needed one somewhere to heal heal what at this the veil slowly lifted untouched by immacolata the sight beneath was enough to make shadwells gorge rise her once exquisite features were wounded beyond recognition a mass of raw tissue and seeping scars how he managed to say the custodians husband she replied her mouth so twisted out of true it was difficult for her to form words properly he did that he came with lions she said and i was careless shadwell didnt want to hear any more it offends you she said youre a man of sensibility this last word was pronounced with the subtlest irony you can mask it cant you he said thinking of her skills with disguise if she could imitate others why not copy her perfect self would you have me a whore she said to him painting myself for vanity no shadwell ill wear my wounds theyre more myself than beauty ever was she made a terrible smile dont you think despite her defiance her voice trembled she was pliable he sensed despairing even fearing insanity might claim her again ive missed your company he said attempting to look steadily at her face we worked well together youve got new allies now she replied you heard my sisters have been with you now and then the thought did not comfort him do you trust hobart he serves his purpose which is to find the carpet which he hasnt done no not yet he tried to stare straight at her tried to give her a loving look i miss you he said i need your help her palate made a soft hissing sound but she didnt reply isnt that why you brought me here he said so that we could begin again no she replied im too weary for that hungry as he was to walk in the fugue once again the thought of picking up the chase where theyd left it moving from city to city whenever the wind carried a rumour of the weave did not enthrall him either besides she said youve changed no he protested i still want the weave but not to sell it she said to rule it where did you get that notion from he protested offering an ingenuous smile he could not read the ruin before him well enough to know whether his pretence worked we had a pact goddess he said we were going to bring them into the dust and you want that still he hesitated knowing that he risked everything with a lie she knew him well she could probably see into his skull if she chose to he might lose more than her company if she sensed deceit in him but then she was changed wasnt she she came before him as spoiled goods her beauty the one ungovernable power she had always had over him was gone she was the supplicant here though she was trying to pretend otherwise he risked the lie what i want is what ive always wanted he said your enemies are my enemies then well lay them low she said once and for all somewhere in the maze of her face a light ignited and the human dust on the shelves at his side began to dance vi the brittle machine on the morning of the second of february cal found brendan dead in bed he had died the doctor reported an hour before dawn simply given up and slipped away in his sleep his mental processes had begun to deteriorate rapidly about a week before christmas on some days hed call geraldine by his wifes name and take cal for his brother the prognosis had not been good but nobody had expected this sudden exit no opportunity for explanations or fond farewells one day he was here the next he could only be mourned much as cal had loved brendan he found grief difficult it was geraldine who wept geraldine who had all the proper sentiments to hand out when the neighbours came to offer their condolences cal could only play the part of the grieving child not feel it all he felt was ill at ease that feeling grew stronger as the cremation approached he was increasingly detached from himself viewing his absence of emotion with a disbelieving eye it seemed suddenly there were two cals one the public mourner dealing with the business of death as propriety demanded the other a coruscating critic of the first calling the bluff of every cliche and empty gesture it was mad mooneys voice this second the scourge of liars and hypocrites youre not real at all the poet would whisper look at you sham that you are this dislocation brought strange sideeffects most significantly the dreams that now returned to him he dreamt himself floating in air as clear as loves eyes dreamt trees heavy with golden fruit dreamt animals that spoke like people and people who roared he dreamt of the pigeons too several times a night and on more than one occasion he woke certain that and his mate had spoken to him in their bird way though he could make no sense of their advice the idea was still with him by day and though he knew the notion was laughable he found himself quizzing the birds as he fed them their daily bread asking them half in jest to give up what they knew they just winked their eyes and grew fat the funeral came and went eileens relatives came across from tyneside and brendans from belfast there was whisky and guinness for brendans brothers and ham sandwiches with the crusts cut off and when the glasses and the plates were empty they all went home we should have a holiday geraldine suggested a week after the funeral you havent been sleeping well he was sitting at the diningroom window watching the garden we need to do some work on the house he said its depressing me we can always sell it she replied it was a simple solution and one his torpid mind hadnt conceived of thats a bloody good idea he said find somewhere without a railway at the bottom of the garden they started searching for another house immediately before the better weather inflated prices geraldine was in her element leading him round the properties with a seamless outpouring of observations and ideas they found a modest terraced house in wavertree which they both liked and put an offer in for it which was accepted but the chariot street house proved more difficult to move two purchasers came to the brink of signing contracts then withdrew even geraldines high spirits lost buoyancy as the weeks drew on they lost the wavertree house at the beginning of march and were obliged to begin the search over again but their enthusiasm was much depleted and they found nothing they liked and still in dreams the birds spoke and still he couldnt interpret their wisdom vii tales of spook city five weeks after brendans remains had been scattered on the lawn of remembrance cal opened the door to a man with a wry ruddy face sparse hair brushed ear to ear to shelter his pate and the stub of a hefty cigar between his fingers mr mooney he said and without waiting for confirmation went on you dont know me my names gluck transferring his cigar from right to left he gripped cals hand and shook it vigorously anthony gluck he said the mans face was vaguely familiar from where cal wracked his brain to remember i wonder gluck said if i may have a word with you i vote labour said cal im not canvassing im interested in the house oh said cal beaming then come on in and he led gluck through into the diningroom the man was at the window in an instant peering into the garden ah he said so this is it its chaos at the moment said cal with faint apology you left it untouched said gluck untouched since the events in chariot street do you really want to buy the house said cal buy said gluck oh no im sorry i didnt even realize it was for sale you said you were interested so i am but not to buy no im interested in the place because it was the centre of the disturbances last august am i right cal had only a patchwork memory of the events of that day certainly he remembered the freak whirlwind that had done so much damage in chariot street he remembered the interview with hobart quite clearly too and how it had prevented his meeting with suzanna but there was much else the rake the death of lilia indeed everything that sprang from the matter of the fugue that his mind had eclipsed glucks enthusiasm intrigued him however that was no natural event he said not by a long chalk it was a perfect example of what we in the business call anomalous phenomena business you know what some people are calling liverpool these days no spook city spook city and with good reason believe me what did you mean when you said business in essence its very simple i document events that defy explanation events that fall outside the comprehension of the scientific community which people therefore choose not to see anomalous phenomena this has always been a windy city cal pointed out believe me said gluck there was more to what happened here last summer than a high wind there was a house on the other side of the river simply reduced to rubble overnight there were mass hallucinations that took place in broad daylight there were lights in the sky brilliant lights witnessed by hundreds of people all that and more happened in the vicinity of this city over a two or three day time period does that sound like coincidence to you no if youre sure it all all happened oh it happened mr mooney ive been collecting this kind of material for twenty years and more collecting and collating it and there are patterns in these phenomena they dont just happen here then good god no i get reports sent to me from all over europe after a while you begin to see some kind of picture emerge as gluck spoke cal remembered where hed seen the man before on a television programme talking if he remembered rightly about governmental silence on visits from alien ambassadors what happened in chariot street he was saying and all over this city is part of a pattern which is perfectly apparent to those of us who study these things what does it mean it means were watched mr mooney were scrutinized the livelong day who by creatures from another world with a technology which beggars our own ive only seen fragments of their artifacts left behind by careless voyagers but theyre enough to prove were less to them than household pets really i recognize that look mr mooney said gluck without irritation youre humouring me but ive seen the evidence with my own eyes especially in this past year either theyre getting more careless or they simply dont mind if were wise to them any longer which means what that their plans for us are entering some final phase that their installations on our planet are in place and well be defeated before we begin they mean to invade us you may scoff im not scoffing really im not i cant say its easy to believe but he thought for the first time in many months of mad mooney im interested to hear what you have to say well said gluck his fierce expression mellowing that makes a refreshing change im usually thought of as comic relief but let me tell you im scrupulous in my researches i believe it ive no need to massage the truth he said proudly its quite convincing enough as it is he talked on of his recent investigations and what theyd turned up britain it seemed was alive from end to end with events prodigious and bizarre had cal heard he enquired of the rain of deepsea fish that had fallen on halifax or the village in wiltshire that boasted its own borealis or of the threeyearold in blackpool whose grasp of hieroglyphics had been pictureperfect since birth all true stories he claimed all verifiable and they were the least of it the island seemed to be ankledeep in miracles to which most of its inhabitants turned a blind eye the truths in front of our noses said gluck if we could only see it the visitors are here in england it was an attractive notion an apocalypse of fishes and wise children to turn england inside out and nonsensical as the facts appeared glucks conviction was powerfully persuasive but there was something wrong with his thesis cal couldnt work out what and he certainly wasnt in any position to argue the point but his gut told him that somewhere along the road gluck had taken a wrong turning what was so unsettling was the process this fabulous litany had begun in his head a scrabbling for some fact hed once possessed and now forgotten just beyond his fingertips of course theres been an official coverup gluck was saying here in spook city coverup certainly it wasnt just houses that disappeared people went too lured here at least thats what my information suggests moneyed people people with important friends who came here and never left or at least not of their own accord extraordinary oh i could tell you tales that would make the disappearance of a plutocrat seem small beer gluck rekindled his cigar which had died each time hed taken off on some fresh tack he puffed on it until he was veiled in smoke but we know so little he said thats why i keep searching keep asking i would have been on your doorstep a lot earlier but that things have been so hectic i dont think theres much i can tell you said cal that whole periods sort of vague yes said gluck it would be ive had this happen repeatedly witnesses simply forgetting i believe its something our friends he pointed the wet end of his cigar skyward are able to induce this forgetfulness was there anybody else in the house that day my father i think he couldnt even be perfectly certain of that might i have a word with him hes dead he died last month oh my condolences was it sudden yes youre selling the house then leaving liverpool to its own devices cal shrugged i dont think so he said gluck peered at him out of the smoke i just cant seem to make up my mind about much these days cal confessed its like im living in a dream you never spoke a truer word said a voice at the back of his head i understand said gluck truly i do he unbuttoned his jacket and opened it cals heartbeat unaccountably quickened but all the man was doing was fishing in his inside pocket for his visiting card here he said please take it a v gluck the card announced and below the birmingham address a phrase in red ink what is now proved was once only imagined whos the quote from william blake said gluck the marriage of heaven and hell would you keep the card if anything should occur to you anything anomalous id like to hear from you til keep it in mind cal said he looked at the card again what does v stand for he asked virgil gluck confided well he said everybody should have some little secret dont you think cal kept the card more as a keepsake of the encounter than in the expectation of using it hed enjoyed the mans company in its offbeat way but it was probably a performance best enjoyed once only twice might stale its eccentric charm when geraldine got back he began to tell her about the visit then thought better of it and diverted the conversation to another subject entirely he knew shed laugh at his giving the fellow a minute of his attention and outlandish as gluck and his theories were he didnt want to hear the man mocked however gently maybe the man had taken the wrong turning but at least hed travelled some extraordinary roads though cal could no longer remember why he had the suspicion that they had that in common part seven the demagogue all rising to great place is by a winding stair sir francis bacon essays i the messenger spring was late that year the march days murky the nights frostbitten it sometimes seemed winter would never end that the world would go on like this grey upon grey until entropy claimed its little life entirely the weeks brought bad times for suzanna and jerichau it wasnt hobart that caused them indeed she even got to thinking that a reminder of their jeopardy might usefully shake them from their complacency but while she suffered from lethargy and ennui jerichaus response to these weeks was in its way far more alarming the pleasure he took in the inconsequentia of the kingdom which had been a source of amusement to them both now took on the quality of an obsession he lost entirely his capacity for stillness which had initially drawn her to him now he was full of spurious energy spouting advertising catchphrases and jingles which he soaked up babu that he was like a sponge his talk an imitation of the flipness of television detectives and gameshow hosts they argued often sometimes bitterly hed more often than not walk out in the middle of such exchanges as if anger were not worth his sweat only to return with some booty usually drink which hed consume in sullen solitude if he couldnt get suzanna to join him she tried to satisfy his restlessness by keeping them on the move but it only exacerbated the disease privately she began to despair as she pictured history repeating itself two generations on with her cast in mimis role and then not a moment too soon the weather began to improve and her spirits started to rise she even dared entertain the hope that the chase had actually stopped their pursuers given up and gone home in a month or so perhaps they could with some confidence go in search of a haven to begin the unweaving again but then came the glad tidings they were in a small town outside coventry rejoicing in the name of fatherless barn as good a reason as any to be there the day being bright and the sun almost warm theyd decided to risk leaving the carpet in storage at the boarding house theyd found and take the air together jerichau had just emerged from a confectioners his pockets full of white chocolate his current passion when somebody brushed past suzanna saying left and left then hurried on without looking back jerichau had heard the words too and he instantly followed both stranger and instructions she called after him but he wasnt about to be waylaid he turned left at the first intersection suzanna went in pursuit cursing his indiscretion which had already drawn some attention left and left again brought her into the narrowest of streets where the sun surely seldom came there jerichau was embracing the stranger like a long lost brother it was nimrod you were so difficult to find he said when they returned to the seclusion of the boarding house taking a dogs leg so that jerichau could steal a bottle of celebratory champagne i almost caught up with you in hull then lost you but somebody remembered you at your hotel said youd got drunk jerichau is that right and been helped to bed could be said jerichau anyhow here i am and with great news what said suzanna were going back home very soon how do you know capra says so capra said jerichau it was enough to make him neglect his glass how can that be the prophet says so its all planned capra speaks to him wait wait said suzanna what prophet he says we have to spread the word said nimrod his enthusiasm boundless find the ones who left the weave and tell them liberations at hand ive been all over doing just that it was by chance i got wind of you what luck eh nobody knew where you were and that was the way it was meant to stay said suzanna i was to make contact in my time when judged the trail had grown cold it is cold said nimrod stone cold surely you must have noticed that suzanna kept her silence our enemies have given up the chase he went on the prophet knows that he tells us what capra says and capra says our suppression is at an end who is this prophet said suzanna nimrods excited flow ceased he frowned as he stared at her the prophet is the prophet he said no further explanation was necessary it seemed you dont even know his name she said he lived near the gyre said nimrod that much i do know a hermit he was until the weaving that night last summer capra called him he left the weave to begin his teachings the tyranny of the cuckoos is nearly at an end ill believe that when i see it said suzanna you will said nimrod with the unshakeable fervour of a true convert this time the earth will rise with us thats what people are saying the cuckoos have made too much mischief their age is over sounds like wishfulfilment to me you may doubt said nimrod i do but ive seen the prophet ive heard his words and they come from capra his eyes glittered with evangelical glee i was in the gutter when the prophet found me broken in pieces prey to every cuckoo sickness then i heard the prophets voice and went to him now look at me suzanna had argued with zealots before her brother had been bom again at twentythree and given his life to christ she knew from experience there was no gainsaying the bigotry of faith indeed there was part of her wanted to join the happy throng of believers nimrod described throw off the burden of the carpet and let the fugue begin its life afresh she was weary of being afraid to meet anybodys eye of forever passing through any pleasure she might have taken in being an outsider possessed of a wonderful secret had long since soured now she wanted to have her fingers in clay again or sit flirting with friends but tempting as it was she couldnt accept this cant and be silent it stank how do you know he doesnt mean us all harm she said harm what harm is there in being free you have to give the weave back suzanna ill take you to him he snatched hold of her hand as he spoke as if he was prepared to do it now she pulled her fingers from his grip whats the problem he said im not just going to give the carpet up because you heard the word she said fiercely you must he said as much disbelief as anger in his tone when does this prophet speak again said jerichau the day after tomorrow nimrod replied his eyes still on suzanna the chase is over he said to her you must give the carpet back and if i dont hell come and get it she said is that the implication you cuckoos nimrod sighed always making things so damn difficult hes come to give us capras wisdom why cant you see that he halted a moment when he spoke again hed modulated his strident tone i respect your doubts he said but you must understand the situations changed i think we should see this prophet for ourselves said jerichau he cast a glance at suzanna yes she nodded yes nimrod grinned yes hell make everything clear to you she longed for that promise to be made true the day after tomorrow said nimrod therell be an end to chases ii seeing the light that night with nimrod gone and jerichau sleeping off his champagne she did something shed never done before she evoked the menstruum simply for company it had shown her many sights in recent weeks and it had saved her from hobart and his malice but she was still suspicious of its power she still couldnt quite work out whether she controlled it or vice versa tonight however she decided that that was a cuckoos way of thinking always making divisions the viewer from the viewed the peach from the taste it left on the tongue such compartments were useful only as tools at some point they had to be left behind for better or worse she was the menstruum and the menstruum was her she and it indivisible bathing in its silver light her thoughts turned again to mimi whod lived a life of waiting her years growing dusty while she hoped for a miracle that was too late in coming thinking of that she began to cry quietly not quietly enough for she woke jerichau she heard his footsteps outside then his tapping on the bathroom door lady he said it was the name he only used when there was an apology in the air im all right she said she had neglected to lock the door and he pushed it open he was dressed only in the long vest he always slept in seeing her misery his face dropped why so sad he asked its all wrong were the only words she could find to express her confusion jerichaus eyes had found the dregs of the menstruum which moved across the floor between them their brightness flickering out as they left her immediate vicinity he kept a respectful distance til go to the meeting place with nimrod he said you stay with the weave yes suppose they demand it then well have to decide he said but we shall see this prophet first he could be a charlatan he paused not looking at her but at the empty floor between them a lot of us are he said after a moment me for instance she stared at him as he loitered in the doorway it wasnt the dying glamour of the menstruum that kept him at bay she now realized she spoke his name very quietly not you she said oh yes he replied there was another aching silence then he said im sorry lady theres nothing to be sorry for i failed you he said i wanted to be so much to you and look how i failed she stood up and went to him his misery was so heavy he could not raise his head beneath its weight she took hold of his hand and held it tight i couldnt have survived these months without you she said youve been my dearest friend friend he said his voice small i never wanted to be your friend she felt his hand tremble in hers and the sensation brought back their adventure on lord street when shed held him in the crowd and shared his visions his terrors since then theyd shared a bed as well and it had been pleasurable but little more shed been too obsessed with the beasts on their heels to think of much else both too close and too distant from him to see how he suffered she saw it now and it frightened her i love you lady he murmured his throat almost swallowing the words before they were said then he extricated his hand from hers and retreated from her she went after him the room was dark but there was sufficient illumination to etch his anxious face his jittering limbs i didnt understand she said and reached out to touch his face not since the first night theyd met had she thought of him as unhuman his hunger to soak up the trivialities of the kingdom had further obscured that fact now she remembered it saw before her another species another history the thought made her heart pound he sensed or saw the arousal in her and his earlier hesitancy evaporated he took a half step towards her until his tongue could run along her lips she opened her mouth to taste him embracing him as she did so the mystery embraced her in return their previous coupling had been comforting but unremarkable now as though released by the statement of his love he took a new lead undressing her almost ritualistically kissing her over and over and between the kisses whispering words in a language he must have known she couldnt understand but which he spoke in a voice of infinite dexterity so that uncomprehending she understood it was his love he spoke erotic rhymes and promises words that were the shape of his desire his phallus a word his semen a word her cunt which he poured his poems into a dozen words or more she closed her eyes and felt his recital consuming her she answered him in her way sighs and nonsenses that found their place in the swell of his magic when her eyes flickered open again she found the exchange had ignited the very air about them their words and the feelings they conveyed writing a lexicon of light which flattered their nakedness it was as if the room was suddenly filled with lanterns made of smoke and paper they drifted up on the heat of their makers bodies their lights bringing every part of the room to exquisite life she saw the tightly curled hairs hed shed on the pillow describing their own alphabet saw the simple weave of the sheet extolled saw everywhere a subtle intercourse of form with form the walls congress with the space they contained the curtains passion for the window the chair for the coat that lay upon it and the shoes beneath but mostly she saw him and he was a wonder she caught the minute fluctuations of his iris when his gaze moved from the darkness of her hair to the pillow upon which it was spread saw the pulse of his heart in the corrugation of his lips and at his throat the skin of his chest had an almost eerie smoothness to it but was deeply muscled his arms were sinewy and would not countenance unbinding her a moment but held her as tight as she held him there was no show of machismo in this possessiveness only an urgency which she more than equalled outside darkness was upon the hemisphere but they were bright and though he had no breath for words now their tenderness fuelled the lights that cradled them and they didnt dim but echoed the lovers marrying colour to colour light to light until the room blazed they loved and slept and loved again and the words kept vigil around them mellowing their show to a soothing flicker as sleep came a second time when she woke the next morning and opened the curtains on another anxious day she remembered the previous night as a vision of pure spirit i was beginning to forget lady he said that day you kept what you were doing clear in your head but i was letting it slip the kingdom is so strong it can take your mind away you wouldnt have forgotten she said he touched her face ran his fingertip down the rim of her ear not you later he said i wish you could come with me to see the prophet i do too but its not wise i know ill be here jerichau thatll make me quick ill charisma nimrod was waiting for him at the rendezvous theyd arranged two days before it seemed to jerichau his fervour had intensified in the intervening time its going to be the biggest meeting so far he said our numbers are growing all the time the days at hand jerichau our people are ready and waiting ill believe it when i see it see it he did as evening fell nimrod took him by an elaborate route to a vast ruin of a building far from any sign of human habitation the place had been a foundry in its prime but its heroic scale had doomed it when times got leaner now its walls would supposedly see the kindling of another heat entirely as they drew closer it became apparent that there were lights burning in the interior but there was no sound or sign of the immense gathering nimrod had promised a few solitary figures lurked amongst the rubble of service buildings otherwise the place seemed to be deserted once through the door however jerichau faced the first shock of a night that would bring many the vast building was filled to capacity with hundreds of the kind he saw members of every root babu and yeme lo and aia he saw old men and women he saw babes in arms some he knew had been in the weave at the beginning and had apparently elected the previous summer to try their luck in the kingdom others he guessed were descendants of those whod rejected the weave at the outset they had a look about them which marked them out as strangers to their homeland many of them stood quite separately from their fellow devotees as if nervous of rejection it was disorienting to see physiognomies that carried the subtle signature of his fellow seerkind primped and painted a la mode seerkind dressed in jeans and leather jackets in print dresses and high heels to judge by their condition many of them had survived well enough in the kingdom perhaps even prospered yet they were here a whisper of liberation had found them in their hiding places amongst the cuckoos and theyd come bringing their children and their prayers kind who could only know of the fugue from rumour and hearsay drawn by the hope of seeing a place their hearts had never forgotten despite his initial cynicism he could not help but be moved by this silent and expectant multitude i told you nimrod whispered as he led jerichau through the throng well get as close as we can eh at the end of the vast hall a rostrum had been set up littered with flowers lights hovered in the air babu raptures throwing a flickering luminescence on the stage beneath hell come soon said nimrod jerichau didnt doubt it even now there was some movement at the far end of the hall several figures dressed in the same dark blue were ordering the crowd a few yards back from the vicinity of the rostrum the devotees obeyed the instruction without question who are they said jerichau nodding towards the uniformed figures the prophets elite nimrod returned theyre with him night and day to keep him from harm jerichau had no time to ask any further questions a door was opening in the bare brick wall at the back of the platform a tremor of excitement passing through the hall the congre gation started to surge towards the platform the swell of emotion was contagious try as he might to keep his critical faculties sharp jerichau found his heart pounding with excitement one of the elite had appeared through the open door carrying a plain wooden chair this he set at the front of the platform the crowd was pressing at jerichaus back he was hemmed in to right and left every face but his was turned towards the stage some had tears on their cheeks the tension of waiting had been too much others were speaking silent prayers and now two more elite stepped through the door parting to reveal a figure in pale yellow the sight of whom brought a tide of sound from the crowd it was not the jubilant shout of welcome jerichau had been anticipating but an intensification of the murmur that had begun a while earlier a soft yearning sound which stirred the gut above the platform the floating flames became brighter the murmur grew in depth and resonance jerichau had to make a fierce effort not to join in the lights had reached a white heat but the prophet did not step forward and bathe in this blaze of glory he hung back at the edge of the pool teasing the crowd which begged him with their moans to show himself still he resisted still they summoned him their wordless prayers growing feverish only after three or four minutes of this holding back did he consent to answer their appeal and step into the light he was a sizeable man a fellow babu jerichau guessed but some infirmity slowed his footsteps his features were benign even slightly effeminate his hair fine as a babys was a white mane reaching the chair he sat down apparently with some pain and surveyed the gathering little by little the murmuring grew softer he did not speak however until it had ceased entirely and when he did speak it was not with the voice jerichau had expected from a prophet strident possessed it was a small musical voice its tone gentle even hesitant my friends he said were assembled here in the name of capra capra the name was whispered from wall to wall ive heard capras words they say the time is very very close he spoke jerichau thought almost reluctantly as though he were the vessel of this knowledge but far from comfortable with it if there are many doubters amongst you the prophet said prepare to shed your doubts nimrod cast jerichau a glance as if to say he means you we are greater by the day the prophet said capras word is everywhere finding its way to the forgotten and the forgetful it stirs the sleeping into wakefulness it makes the dying dance he spoke very quietly letting the rhetoric substitute for volume his congregation attended like children very soon well be home he said well be back amongst our loved ones walking where our mothers and fathers walked we wont have to hide any longer this capra tells us we will rise my friends rise and be bright there were barely stifled sobs from around the hall he heard them and hushed them with an indulgent smile no need to weep he said i see an end to weeping an end to waiting yes said the crowd as one yes yes jerichau felt the swell of affirmation picking him up he had no desire to resist he was a part of these people wasnt he their tragedy was his tragedy and their longing his too yes he found himself saying yes yes at his side nimrod said now do you believe then joined the chant himself the prophet raised his gloved hands to subdue the voices it took longer for the crowd to be hushed this time but when the prophet spoke again his voice was stronger as though nourished by this display of fellowfeeling my friends capra loves peace as we all love it but let us not deceive ourselves we have enemies enemies amongst humankind and yes amongst our own kind too there are many who have cheated us conspired with the cuckoos to keep our lands in sleep this capra has seen with his own eyes treachery and lies my friends everywhere he bowed his head a moment as if the effort of those words was close to defeating him what shall we do he said his voice despairing lead us somebody shouted the prophet raised his head at this his face troubled i can only show you the way he protested but the cry had been taken up by others around the hall and was growing lead us they called to him lead us slowly the prophet got to his feet again he raised his hands to silence the congregation but this time they would not be subdued so readily please he said obliged for the first time to raise his voice please listen to me well follow you nimrod was shouting well follow was it jerichaus imagination or had the lights above the platform begun to burn with fresh brilliance the prophets hair a halo above his benevolent features to judge by his expression the call to arms that rose from the floor distressed him the vox populi wanted more than his vague promises listen to me he appealed if you want me to lead you yes roared five hundred throats if thats what you want i have to warn you it will not be easy we would have to put away tenderness we would have to be hard as stone blood will flow his warning didnt chasten the crowd a jot if anything it spurred their enthusiasm to new heights we must be cunning said the prophet as those whove conspired against us have been cunning the crowd was raising the roof now jerichau along with them the fugue calls us home home home and its voice will not be denied we must march the door at the back of the platform had been opened a little presumably so that the prophets entourage could hear the speech now a movement there caught jerichaus eye there was somebody in the doorway whose shadowy face he seemed to know we will go into the fugue together the prophet was saying his voice finally losing its frailty its reluctance jerichau looked past the speaker trying to divide the watcher at the door from the darkness that concealed him we will take the fugue back from our enemies in the name of capra the man jerichau was watching moved a step and for an instant a fugitive beam of light caught him jerichaus stomach convulsed as he silently put a name to the face he saw it bore a smile but he knew there was no humour in it for its owner knew no humour or love either or mercy shout my kind shout it was hobart make them hear us in their sleep hear us and fear our judgment there could be no doubt of it the time jerichau had spent in the inspectors company was burned into his memory forever hobart it was the voice of the prophet was finding new strength with every syllable even his face seemed to have altered in some subtle fashion any sham of kindliness had been dropped it was all righteous fury now spread the word he was saying the exiles are returning jerichau watched the performance with fresh eyes keeping up a pretence of enthusiasm while questions fretted his thumping head chief amongst them who was this man stirring the kind with promises of deliverance a hermit as nimrod had described him an innocent being used by hobart for his own ends that was the best hope the worst that he and hobart were in cahoots a conspiracy of kind and humankind created with what could only be one intention possessing and perhaps destroying the fugue the voices around him were deafening but jerichau was no longer buoyed up by this tide he was drowning in it they were fodder these people hobarts dupes it made him sick to think of it be ready the prophet was telling the assembly be ready the hour is near with that promise the lights above the platform went out when they came on again moments later the voice of capra had gone leaving an empty chair and a congregation ready to follow him wherever he chose to lead them there were cries from around the hall for him to speak to them again but the door at the back of the stage was closed and not reopened gradually realizing they wouldnt persuade their leader to appear again the crowd began to disperse didnt i tell you said nimrod he stank of sweat as did they all didnt i say yes you did nimrod seized hold of jerichaus arm come with me now he said eyes gleaming well go to the prophet well tell him where the carpet is now why not why give our enemies any more time to prepare themselves jerichau had vaguely anticipated this exchange he had his excuses prepared suzanna must be persuaded of the wisdom of this he said i can best do that she trusts me then ill come with you no ill do it alone nimrod looked wary perhaps even suspicious i watched over you once jerichau reminded him when you were a babe in arms this was his ace card remember that nimrod couldnt keep a smile from his face such times he said youre going to have to trust me the way you trusted me then jerichau said he didnt much like the deception but this was no time for ethical niceties let me go to suzanna and together well bring the carpet here then we can all go to the prophet the three of us yes said nimrod i suppose theres sense in that they walked to the door together the throng of devotees was already dispersing into the night jerichau made his farewells and his promises to nimrod and headed away when hed gained sufficient cover of distance and darkness he made a long arc around the building and headed back towards it iv as good men go it began to rain while he kept watch at the rear of the foundry but after twenty minutes his waiting was rewarded a door opened and two of the prophets elite guard emerged so eager were they for the shelter of their car there were several parked behind the building that they left the door behind them ajar jerichau lingered in the shelter of the dripping undergrowth until theyd driven away then crossed at speed to the door and stepped inside he was in a dirty bricklined corridor off which several small passageways ran a lamp burned at the end of the corridor where he stood the rest of the place was in darkness once away from the outside door and the sound of the rain he could hear voices he followed them the passageway becoming darker as he left the vicinity of the bulb words came and went the smell of them somebody said there was laughter using it as cover jerichau moved more swiftly towards the sound now another light albeit dim reached his straining eyes theyre making a fool of you a second voice said it was hobart who replied were close i tell you he said ill have her never mind the woman came the response the voice was perhaps that of the prophet though it had changed timbre i want the carpet all the armies in the world are worth fuckall if weve got nothing to conquer the vocabulary was less circumspect than his words from the platform had been there was no reluctance to lead the army here no false modesty jerichau pressed close to the door from beyond which the voices came get this filth off me will you said the prophet it smothers me no sooner had he spoken than all conversation on the other side of the door abruptly ceased jerichau held his breath fearful he was missing some whispered exchange but he could hear nothing then the prophet again we shouldnt have secrets he said apparently apropos of nothing seeing is believing dont they say at this the door was flung wide jerichau had no chance to retreat but stumbled forward into the room he was instantly seized by hobart who wrenched his captives arm behind his back until the bones threatened to snap at the same time seizing jerichaus head so hard he could not move it you were right said the prophet he was standing stark naked in the middle of the room legs apart arms spread wide the sweat dripping from him a bare bulb threw its uncharitable light upon his pale flesh from which steam rose i can sniff them out said a voice jerichau recognized and the incantatrix immacolata stepped into his line of vision despite his situation the terrible maiming of her face gave him some satisfaction harm had been done to this creature that was cause for rejoicing how long were you listening the prophet asked jerichau did you hear anything interesting do tell jerichau looked back towards the man three members of the elite were working about his body wiping him down with towels it wasnt just his sweat they were removing parts of his flesh at the neck and shoulders on the arms and hands were coming away too this was the smothering filth jerichau had heard him complain of he was sloughing off the skin of the prophet the air was rank with the stench of venomous raptures the corrupt magic of the incantatrix answer the man said hobart twisting jerichaus arm to within a fraction of breaking i heard nothing jerichau gasped the steaming man snatched a towel from one of his attendants jesus he said as he rubbed at his face this stuff is a trial pieces of flesh fell from beneath the towel and hit the floor hissing he threw the dirtied towel down with them and looked back up at jerichau remnants of the illusion clung to his features here and there but the actor beneath was quite recognizable shadwell the salesman naked as the day he was born he tore off the white wig hed worn and tossed that down too then snapped his fingers a cigarette already lit was placed in his hand he drew on it deeply wiping a glob of ectoplasm from beneath his eye with the ball of his hand were you at the meeting he asked of course he was immacolata said but she was silenced with a sharp look from shadwell he pulled at his foreskin quite unselfconsciously was i good he said no no of course i was he peered at his pudenda over his shiny gut who the fuck are you he said jerichau kept his mouth shut i asked you a question said shadwell he put the cigarette between his lips and spread his arms so that his dressers could finish his toilet they proceeded to towel the remaining ectoplasm from his face and body then began to powder his bulk i know him said hobart do you indeed hes the womans partner hes with suzanna really said shadwell did you come to make a sale is that it see what wed pay you for her i havent seen her jerichau said oh yes you have said shadwell and youre going to tell us where to find her jerichau closed his eyes oh gods make this end he thought dont let me suffer im not strong im not strong it wont take long shadwell murmured tell him said hobart jerichau cried out as his bones creaked stop that shadwell said the grip relaxed a little keep your brutalities out of my sight said the salesman his voice rose understand me he said do you do you understand yes sir shadwell grunted then turned to immacolata his sudden fury just as suddenly dissipated i think your sisters might enjoy him he said get them here will you the incantatrix uttered a summons which came from her misshapen lips like breath on an icy morning shadwell returned his attention to jerichau speaking as he dressed theres more than pain to be suffered he said lightly if you dont tell me where i may find the carpet he hoisted up his trousers and buttoned up the fly throwing an occasional glance in jerichaus direction what are you waiting for he said to the prisoner some bargain or other he put on his tie while his attenders tied his shoelaces youll wait a long time my friend i dont barter these days i dont offer treats my days as a salesman are numbered he took the jacket from his attendant and slipped it on the lining shimmered its powers were familiar to jerichau from suzannas stories but it seemed shadwell had no desire to win a confession from him by that means tell me where the carpet can be found he said or the sisters and their children will undo you nerve by nerve not a difficult choice i would have thought jerichau made no reply there was a chill wind from the corridor ah the ladies said shadwell and death flew in at the door v the hours pass and still he didnt return it was threethirty in the morning she had stood by the window as the hour grew late watched drunkards brawl and two unlikely whores ply their desperate trade until a police vehicle cruised by and they were either arrested or hired now the street was deserted and all she had to watch were the lights changing at the crossroads green red amber green without a vehicle passing in either direction and still he didnt return she turned over a variety of explanations that the meeting was still going on and he couldnt slip away without arousing suspicion that hed found friends amongst the audience and was talking over old times with them that this that that but none of her excuses quite convinced her something was wrong she and the menstruum both knew it they had made no contingency plans which was stupid how could they have been so stupid she asked herself over and over now she was left pacing the narrow room not knowing what to do for the best not wanting to leave in case he returned the minute after and discovered her gone yet fearful of staying in case hed been captured and was even now being beaten into telling them where she could be found time was she would have believed the best contented herself that he would come back in a while and waited patiently for him but experience had changed her view of things life was not that kind at fourfifteen she started to pack the very fact that shed accepted that something was amiss that she and the weave were in jeopardy made the adrenalin flow at fourthirty she began to take the carpet downstairs it was a lengthy and cumbersome business but in recent months shed shed every ounce of fat and in the process discovered muscles shed never known she had and again the menstruum was with her a body of will and light that made possible in minutes what should have taken hours even so there was a hint of dawn in the sky by the time she threw their bags into the back of the car he would not come back now she told herself something had detained him and if she wasnt quick it would detain her too fighting tears she drove away leaving another unpaid bill behind her it might have given suzanna some small satisfaction if she could have seen the look on hobarts face when less than twenty minutes after her departure he arrived at the hotel the prisoner had named hed spilled a good deal while the beasts had their way with him blood and words in equal measure but the words were incoherent a babble from which hobart wrestled to extract any sense there was talk of the fugue of course amongst the sobs and the bleatings and of suzanna too oh my lady he kept saying oh my lady then fresh sobbing hobart let him weep and bleed and weep some more until the man was near to death then he asked the simple question where is your lady and the fool answered his mind past knowing who asked the question or indeed if hed answered it and here in the place the man had spoken of hobart now stood but where was the woman of his dreams where was suzanna gone again flitted away leaving the doorhandle warm and the threshold still mourning her shadow it had been very close this time though hed almost taken her how long before he had her mystery netted once and for all her silver light between his fingers hours days at the most nearly mine he said to himself he clutched the book of faerytales close to his chest so that none of its words could slip away then left his ladys chamber to go whip up the hunt vi hello stranger she hated leaving the city knowing she was also leaving jerichau behind somewhere but whatever she felt for him and that was a difficulty in itself she knew better than to linger she had to go and go quickly but alone how long would she could she survive like this a car a carpet and woman who sometimes was not even certain she was human she had friends around the country and relatives too but none she knew well enough to really trust besides theyd ask questions inevitably and there was no part of this story shed dare begin to explain she thought about going back to london to the flat in battersea where her old life finnegan and his out of season valentines the pots the damp in the bathroom would be waiting for her but again there would be questions and more questions she needed the company of someone who would simply accept her silence and all it had to be cal thinking of him her spirits lightened his eager grin came to mind his soft eyes his softer words there was probably more danger in seeking him out than in returning to london but she was tired of calculating risks she would do what her instincts told her to do and her instincts said cal there was a long silence at the other end of the telephone line when she thought contact had been broken cal are you there then he said suzanna yes its me suzanna she felt tears close hearing him speak her name i have to see you cal where are you in the middle of the city near some monument of queen victoria the end of castle street if you say so can i see you its very urgent yes of course im not far from there ill slip away now meet you on the steps in ten minutes he was there in seven dressed in a charcoalgrey work suit collar turned up against the drizzle one of a hundred similar young men accountants clerks and junior managers shed seen pass by as she waited under victorias imperious gaze he did not embrace her nor even touch her he simply came to a halt two yards from where she stood and looked at her with a mixture of pleasure and puzzlement and said hello hello the rain was coming on more heavily by the moment shall we talk in the car she said i dont like to leave the carpet on its own at the mention of the carpet the puzzled look on his face intensified but he said nothing in his head cal had a vague image of himself rummaging through a dirty warehouse for a carpet this carpet presumably but his grasp on the whole story was slippery the car was parked in water street a stones throw from the monument the rain beat a tattoo on the roof of the vehicle as they sat side by side her precious cargo which shed been so loath to leave was stored in the back of the car doubled up and roughly covered with a sheet try as he might he still couldnt get a fix on why the carpet was so important to her or indeed why this woman with whom he could only remember spending a few hours was so important to him why had the sound of her voice on the telephone brought him running why had his stomach begun churning at the sight of her it was absurd and frustrating to feel so much and know so little things would become clear he reassured himself once they began to talk but he was wrong in that assumption the more they talked the more bewildered he became i need your help she said to him i cant explain everything we havent got time now but apparently theres some kind of prophet appeared promising a returning to the fugue jerichau went to one of the meetings and he didnt come back wait said cal hands up to stem the rush of information hold on a moment im not following this jerichau you remember jerichau she said it was an unusual name not easily forgotten but he could put no face to it should i know him he said good god cal to be honest a lot of things are blurred you remember me well enough yes of course of course i do and nimrod and apolline the night in the fugue she could see even before he murmured no that he remembered nothing perhaps there was a natural process at work here a means by which the mind dealt with experiences that contradicted a lifetimes prejudices about the nature of reality people simply forgot i have strange dreams cal said his face full of confusion what sort of dreams he shook his head he knew his vocabulary would prove woefully inadequate its hard to describe he said like im a child you know except that im not walking somewhere ive never been not lost though oh shit he gave up angered by his fumblings i cant describe it we were there once she told him calmly you and i we were there what youre dreaming about exists cal he stared at her for long moments the confusion didnt leave his face but it was mellowed now by the smallest of smiles exists he said oh yes truly tell me he said softly please tell me i dont know where to begin either try he said please there was such a yearning in his eyes such a need to know the carpet she began he glanced back at it is it yours he asked she couldnt help but laugh no she said the place you dream of its here its in this carpet she could see incredulity sparring with his faith in her here he said sometimes she almost found it difficult to comprehend that fact herself and she had an advantage over cal or even poor jerichau she had the menstruum as a touchstone of the miraculous she didnt blame him for his doubt you have to trust me she said however impossible it sounds i know this he said his voice tight somewhere in me know this of course you do and youll remember ill help you remember but for now i need help from you yes whatever you want there are people chasing me why who ill tell you about them when we get the chance the point is they want to destroy the land you dream about cal the world hidden in that carpet the fugue you want to hide back at my place she shook her head i risked a call there to get your work number they could be waiting there already geraldine wouldnt tell them anything i cant risk that we could go to dekes place out in kirkby nobodyll find us there you trust him sure she switched on the engine ill drive she said you direct they turned into james street the fury of the rain monsoonal now they didnt get far a few yards down the road the traffic had come to a halt cal wound down his window and ducked his head out to see what the problem was it was difficult to be certain of anything through the curtain of rain but there seemed to have been a collision and the traffic was backing up behind it a few of the more impatient drivers in the queue were attempting to nose their way out into the citybound lane and failing thus adding to the confusion horns began to blare one or two drivers got out of their cars their coats as makeshift umbrellas to see what was up cal laughed quietly whats funny she asked him an hour ago i was sitting in the claims department up to my elbows in paperwork now youve got a fugitive for company the deals fine by me he grinned why the hell arent we moving ill go look he said and before she could prevent him he was out of the car and threading his way through the maze of vehicles pulling his jacket up in a vain attempt to keep the rain off his head she watched him go her fingers drumming on the wheel she didnt like this situation she was too visible and visible was vulnerable as cal reached the opposite side of the street her attention was claimed by a flash of blue lights in the wing mirror she glanced round to see several police motorcycles cruising along the queue towards the accident her heart jumped a beat she looked towards cal hoping he was on his way back but he was still studying the traffic come on out of the rain damn you she willed him i need you here there were more officers these on foot making their way up the street and they were speaking to the occupants of each car diversionary advice no doubt innocent enough all she had to do was keep smiling up ahead cars were beginning to move off the riders were directing the traffic around an accident site bringing a halt to the contrary flow to do so she looked over towards cal who was staring off down the street should she get out of the car call him back as she weighed the options an officer appeared at her side rapping on the window she wound it down wait for the signal he told her and take it slowly he stared at her rain dripping off his helmet and his nose she offered a smile fine she said ill be careful though hed delivered his instructions he didnt move from the window but stared at her i know your face he said really she said trying for light flirtatiousness and missing by a mile whats your name before she had time to lie one of the officers up ahead called to her interrogator he stood up giving her an opportunity to glance back in cals direction he was standing on the edge of the pavement staring across at the car she made a small shake of her head hoping hed read her signal through the rainblurred window the officer caught her warning something wrong he said no she told him not at all another of the officers was approaching the car shouting something over the din of rain and idling engines the longer i stay here she thought the worse this is going to get and she wrenched the wheel round the officer at the window yelled for her to stop but the die was cast as the car bolted forward she chanced the briefest of glances in cals direction she saw to her distress that he was engaged in trying to wind his way between the cars though she shouted his name he was oblivious to her she shouted again too late he looked up the officer in the front was running towards the car hed reached it before cal was half way across the road she had no choice but to make her escape while she still had a prayer she accelerated the officer in front of her throwing himself out of her path with inches to spare there was no time to look back for cal she skirted the collision site at speed hoping hed used the diversion to pick up his heels and run shed travelled no more than four hundred yards when she heard the sound of sirens rising behind her it took cal half a dozen seconds to work out what had happened and another two to curse his sloth there was a moment of confusion when none of the officers seemed certain whether to wait for instructions or give chase during which pause suzanna was away around the corner the officer whod been at the car window instantly made his way in cals direction his pace picking up with every step cal pretended he hadnt seen the man and began to walk speedily back up towards the monument there was a shouted summons and then the sound of pursuit he ran not looking behind him his pursuer was heavily dressed against the rain cal was much lighter footed he made a left into lower castle street and another onto brunswick street then a right onto drury lane the sirens had begun by now the bikes were in pursuit of suzanna on water street he chanced a backward glance his pursuer was not in sight he didnt slow his pace however until hed put half a mile between himself and the police then he hailed himself a taxi and headed back to the house his head full of questions and of suzannas face shed come and gone too quickly already he was mourning her absence in order to better hold onto her memory he fumbled for the names shed spoken but damn it they were gone already vii lost causes the blinding rain proved to be suzannas ally so perhaps did her ignorance of the city she took every turn she could only avoiding culdesacs and the lack of any rationale in her escape route seemed to flummox her pursuers her path brought her out into upper parliament street at which point she put on some speed the sirens faded behind her but it would not be for long she knew the noose was tightening once more there were breaks in the rainbellied clouds as she drove from the city and shafts of sun found their way between leaving a sheen of gold on roof and tarmac but for moments only then the clouds sealed their wound and the benediction ceased she drove and drove as the afternoon grew late and once more she was alone cal stood at the kitchen door geraldine who was peeling an onion looked up and said did you forget your umbrella and he thought she doesnt know who i am or what i am and how could she because god in heaven i dont know either i forget myself oh jesus why do i forget myself are you all right she was asking him putting down the onion and the knife now and crossing the kitchen towards him look at you youre soaked im in trouble he said flatly she stopped in her tracks what cal i think the police may come here looking for me why dont ask its too complicated her face tightened a little there was a woman on the phone this afternoon she said asking for your work number did she get through to you yes and is she something to do with this yes tell me cal i dont know where to begin are you having a fling with this woman no he said then thought at least not that i remember tell me then later not now later he left the kitchen to the smell of onions where are you going she called after him im soaked to the skin cal i have to get changed how bad is this trouble youre in he stopped half way up the stairs pulling off his tie i cant remember he replied but a voice at the back of his head a voice he hadnt heard in a long while said bad son bad and he knew it spoke the bitter truth she followed him as far as the bottom of the stairs he went into the bedroom and peeled off his wet clothes while she continued to ply him with questions for which he had no replies and with every unanswered question he could hear her voice get closer to tears he knew hed call himself a louse for this tomorrow but he had to be away from the house again quickly in case the police came looking for him he had nothing to tell them of course at least he could remember nothing but they had ways these people of making a man speak he rummaged through the wardrobe looking for a shirt jeans and a coat not giving a conscious thought to the choice as he slipped on the threadbare jacket he glanced out of the window the streetlights had just come on the rain was a silver torrent in their glare a chilly night for a jaunt but it couldnt be helped he dug in his work suit for his wallet which he transferred to his pocket and that was it geraldine was still at the bottom of the stairs looking up at him she had successfully fought off tears and what am i supposed to tell them she demanded if they come looking for you say i came and went tell them the truth maybe i wont be here she said then warming to the idea yes i dont think ill be here he had neither the time nor the words to offer any genuine solace please trust me was all he could find to say i dont know whats happening any more than you do maybe you should see a doctor cal she said as he came downstairs maybe her voice softened youre ill he stopped his descent brendan told me things she went on dont bring dad into this no listen to me she insisted he used to talk to me cal told me things in confidence things he thought hed seen i dont want to hear he said hed seen some woman killed in the back garden and some monster on the railway track she smiled gently at the lunacy of this cal stared down at her suddenly sick to his stomach again he thought know this maybe youre having hallucinations too he was telling stories to keep you amused said cal he used to like to make stuff up it was the irish in him is that what youre doing cal she said pleading for some reassurance tell me its a joke i wish to god i could oh cal he went to the bottom of the stairs and softly stroked her face if anyone comes asking til tell them the truth she said i dont know anything thank you as he crossed to the front door she said cal yes youre not in love with this woman are you only id prefer you to tell me if you are he opened the door the rain slapped the doorstep i cant remember he said and made a dash to the car after half an hour on the motorway the effects of a night without sleep and all that the subsequent day had brought began to catch up with suzanna the road in front of her blurred she knew it was only a matter of time before she fell asleep at the wheel she turned off the motorway at the first service stop parked the car and went in search of a caffeine fix the cafeteria and amenities were thronged with customers which she was thankful for amongst so many people she was insignificant anxious about leaving the weave a moment longer than she needed to she purchased coffee from the vending machine rather than wait in a serpentine queue then bought chocolate and biscuits from the shop and went back to the car switching on the radio she settled down to her stopgap meal as she unwrapped the chocolate her thoughts went again to jerichau the thiefmagician producing stolen goods from every pocket where was he now she toasted him with her coffee and told him to be safe at eight the news came on she waited for some mention of herself but there was none after the bulletin there was music she let it play coffee drunk chocolate and biscuits devoured she slid down in the seat and her eyes closed to a jazz lullaby she was woken mere seconds later by a knocking on the window there was a period of confusion while she worked out where she was then she was wide awake and staring with sinking heart at the uniform on the other side of the rainstreaked glass please open the door the policeman said he seemed to be alone should she just turn on the engine and drive away before she could reach any decision the door was wrenched open from the outside get out the man said she complied even as she stepped from the car she heard the sound of soles on gravel on all sides of her against the glare of the neon a man stood silhouetted yes was all he said and suddenly there were men coming at her from all sides she was about to dig for the menstruum but the silhouette was approaching her with something in its hand somebody tore the sleeve from her arm she felt the needle slide into her exposed skin the subtle body rose but not quickly enough her will grew sluggish her sight narrowed to a wellshaft at the end of it hobarts mouth she tumbled towards the man her fingers gouging the slime on the walls while the beast at the bottom roared its hosannas viii new eyes for old the mersey was high tonight and fast its waters a filthy brown its spume grey cal leaned on the promenade railing and stared across the churning river to the deserted shipyards on the far bank once this waterway had been busy with ships arriving weighed down with their cargo and riding high as they headed for faraway now it was empty the docks silted up the wharfs and warehouses idle spook city fit only for ghosts he felt like one himself an insubstantial wanderer and cold too the way the dead must be cold he put his hands in his jacket pocket to warm them and his fingers found there half a dozen soft objects which he took out and examined by the light of a nearby lamp they looked like withered plums except that the skin was much tougher like old shoeleather clearly they were fruit but no variety he could name where and how had he come by them he sniffed at one it smelt slightly fermented like a heady wine and appetizing tempting even its scent reminded him that hed not eaten since lunchtime he put the fruit to his lips his teeth breaking through the corrugated skin with ease the scent had not deceived the meat inside did indeed have an alcoholic flavour the juice burning his throat like cognac he chewed and had the fruit to his lips for a second bite before hed swallowed the first finishing it off seeds and all with a fierce appetite immediately he began to devour another of them he was suddenly ravenous he lingered beneath the windbuffeted lamp the pool of light he stood in dancing and fed his face as though hed not eaten in a week he was biting into the penultimate fruit when it dawned on him that the rocking of the lamp above couldnt entirely account for the motion of the light around him he looked down at the fruit in his hand but he couldnt quite focus on it god alive had he poisoned himself the remaining fruit dropped from his hand and he was about to put his fingers down his throat to make himself vomit up the rest when the most extraordinary sensation overtook him he rose up or at least some part of him did his feet were still on the concrete he could feel it solid beneath his soles but he was still floating up the lamp shining beneath him now the promenade stretching out to right and left of him the river surging against the banks wild and dark the rational fool in him said you re intoxicated the fruits have made you drunk but he felt neither sick nor out of control his sight were clear he could still see from the eyes in his head but also from a vantage point high above him nor was that all he could see part of him was with the litter too gusting along the promenade another part was out in the mersey gazing back towards the bank this proliferation of viewpoints didnt confuse him the sights mingled and married in his head a pattern of risings and fallings of looking out and back and far and near he was not one but many he cal he his fathers son he his mothers son he a child buried in a man and a man dreaming of being a bird a bird and all at once it all came back to him all the wonders hed forgotten surged back with exquisite particularity a thousand moments and glimpses and words a bird a chase a house a yard a carpet a flight then enemies and friends shadwell immacolata the monsters and suzanna his beautiful suzanna her place suddenly clear in the story his mind was telling itself he remembered it all the carpet unweaving the house coming apart then into the fugue and the glories that the night there had brought it took all his newfound senses to hold the memories but he was not overwhelmed it seemed he dreamed them all at once held them in a moment that was sweet beyond words a reunion of self and secret self which was an heroic remembering and after the recognition tears as for the first time he touched the buried grief he felt at losing the man whod taught him the poem hed recited in los orchard his father whod lived and died and never once known what cal knew now momentarily sorrow and salt drew him back into himself and he was singlesighted once more standing under the uncertain light bereft then his soul soared again higher now and higher and this time it reached escape velocity suddenly he was up up above england below him moonlight fell on bright continents of cloud whose vast shadows moved over hillside and suburb like silent ushers of sleep he went too carried on the same winds over tracts of land which pylons strode in humming lines and city streets the hour had emptied of all but felons and wild dogs and this flight gazing down like a lazy hawk stars at his back the isle beneath him this flight was companion to that other hed taken over the carpet over the fugue no sooner had his mind turned to the weaveworld than he seemed to sniff it seemed to know where it lay beneath him his eye was not sharp enough to pick out its place but he knew he could find it if he could only keep this new sense intact when he finally returned to the body beneath him the carpet was northnortheast of the city that he was certain of many miles away and still moving was it in suzannas hands was she fleeing to some remote place where she prayed their enemies wouldnt come no the news was worse than that he sensed the weaveworld and the woman who carried it were in terrible jeopardy somewhere below him at that thought his body grew possessive of him once more he felt it around him its heat its weight and he exalted in its solidity flying thoughts were all very well but what were they worth without muscle and bone to act upon them a moment later he was standing beneath the light once more and the river was still churning and the clouds hed just seen from above moved in mute flotillas before a wind that smelt of the sea the salt he tasted was not seasalt it was the tears hed shed for the death of his father and for his forgetting and for his mother too perhaps for it seemed all loss was one loss all forgetting one forgetting but hed brought new wisdom from the high places he knew now that things forgotten might be recalled things lost found again that was all that mattered in the world to search and find he looked northnortheast though the many sights hed had were once more narrowed to one he knew he could still find the carpet he saw it with his heart and seeing it started in pursuit ix a secret place suzanna stirred from her drugged sleep only slowly at first the effort to keep her lids open for more than a few seconds was too much for her and her consciousness struggled in darkness but by degrees her body was cleansing itself of whatever hobart had put into her veins she just had to let it do that job in its own good time she was in the back of hobarts car that much was clear her enemy was in the front seat beside the driver at one point he looked round and saw that she was waking but said nothing he just stared at her for a little time then returned his attentions to the road there was something uncomfortably lazy about the look in his eyes as if he was certain now of what the future would bring and had no need to hurry towards it in her drowsy state it was difficult to calculate time but surely hours passed as they drove once she opened her eyes to find them passing through a sleeping city she did not know which then the remnants of the drug won her over again and when next she woke they were travelling a winding country road lightless hills rising to either side only now did she realize that hobarts car was leading a convoy there were headlamps shining through the back window from the vehicles behind she summoned up strength enough to turn round there was a black maria following and several vehicles behind that again drowsiness overtook her for a timeless while it was cold air that woke her again the driver had opened the window and the air had brought goosepimples to her arms she sat up and breathed deeply letting the chill slap her to wakefulness the region they were driving through was mountainous the scottish highlands she presumed where else would there still be snowy peaks in the middle of spring they took a route now that led them off the road onto a rocky track which slowed their pace considerably the track rose winding the engine of the van behind laboured but the road got rougher and steeper still before it delivered them to the top of the hill there said hobart to the driver we found it there suzanna peered from the window there was neither moon nor stars to illuminate the scene but she could see the black bulk of the mountains all around and far below lights burning the convoy followed the hill top for half a mile then began a steady descent into the valley the lights shed seen were car headlamps the vehicles parked in a large circle so that the lights created an arena the arrival of hobarts convoy was clearly expected as they came within fifty yards of the circle she saw figures coming to greet them the car came to a halt where are we she slurred journeys end was all hobart would say then to the driver bring her the legs beneath her were rubberjointed she had to hold onto the car for a while before she could persuade them to behave with the driver keeping firm hold of her she was then taken towards the arena only now did she realize the scale of the gathering there were dozens of cars in the ring and many more in the darkness beyond the drivers and passengers who amounted to hundreds were not human but seerkind amongst them were anatomies and colorations that must have made them outcasts in the kingdom she scanned the faces looking for any that she knew and one in particular but jerichau was not amongst them hobart now stepped into the ring of light and as he did so from the shadows on the opposite side of the arena stepped a figure suzanna assumed was that of the prophet his appearance was greeted with a soft swell of murmuring from the seerkind some pushed their way forward to get a better look at their saviour others fell to their knees he was impressive suzanna conceded to herself his deepset eyes were fixed on hobart and a small smile of approval found his lips as the inspector bowed his head before his master so that was the way of it hobart was in the prophets employ which fact scarcely covered the latter with glory words were exchanged between them the breath of the speakers visible on the cold air then the prophet put his gloved hand on hobarts shoulder and turned to announce to the assembly the return of the weaveworld suddenly the air was full of shouts hobart turned towards the black maria and beckoned from its recesses came two of the inspectors cohorts carrying the carpet they entered the ring of light and at hobarts instruction laid the carpet at the prophets feet the crowd was hushed utterly in the presence of their sleeping homeland and the prophet when he spoke did not need to raise his voice here he said almost casually did i not promise and so saying he put his heel to the carpet it unrolled in front of him the silence held all eyes were on the design two hundred minds and more sharing the same thought open sesame the call of all eager visitors set before closed doors and desiring access open show yourself whether it was that collective act of will that began the unweaving or whether the prophet had previously plotted the mechanism suzanna could not know sufficient that it began not at the centre of the carpet as at shearmans house but from the borders the last unweaving had been more accident than design a wild eruption of threads and pigment the fugue breaking into sudden and chaotic life this time there was clearly system at work in the process the knots decoding their motifs in a prearranged sequence the dance of threads was no less complex than before but there was a consummate grace about the spectacle the strands describing the most elegant manoeuvres as they filled the air trailing life as they went forms were clothing themselves in flesh and feather rock was flowing trees taking flight towards their rooting place suzanna had seen this glory before of course and was to some extent prepared for it but to the seerkind and even more to hobart and his bullyboys the sight awoke fear and awe in equal measure her guard utterly forgot his duty and stood like a child before his first firework display unsure of whether to run or stay she took her chance while it was offered and slipped from his custody away from the light that would reveal her glancing back long enough to see the prophet his hair rising like white fire from his scalp standing in the midst of the unweaving while the fugue burst into life all around him it was difficult to draw her gaze away but she ran as best her legs would allow towards the darkness of the slopes she moved twenty thirty forty yards from the circle nobody came after her a particularly bright blossoming at her back momentarily lit the terrain before her like a falling star it was rough uncultivated ground interrupted only by the occasional outcrop of rock a valley chosen for its remoteness most likely where the fugue could be stirred from sleep uninterrupted by humankind how long this miracle would remain hidden with summer on its way was a moot point but perhaps they had plans for a rapture to divert the inquisitive again the land ahead of her was lit and momentarily she glimpsed a figure up ahead it was there and gone so quickly she could not trust her eyes another yard however and she felt a chill on her cheek that was no natural wind she guessed its source the instant it touched her but she had no time to retreat or prepare herself before the darkness unfolded and its mistress stepped into her path x fatalities the face was mutilated beyond recognition but the voice colder than the chill the body gave off was indisputably that of immacolata nor was she alone her sisters were with her darker than the dark why are you running said the incantatrix theres nowhere to escape to suzanna halted there was no ready way past the three turn around said immacolata another splendour from the weave uncharitably lighting the wound of her face see where shadwell stands thatll be the fugue in moments shadwell said suzanna their beloved prophet came the reply beneath that show of holiness i lent him there beats a salesmans heart so shadwell was the prophet what a perfect irony that the seller of encyclopaedias should end up peddling hope it was his idea said the incantatrix to give them a messiah now theyve got a righteous crusade as hobart calls it theyre going to claim their promised land and destroy it in the process they wont fall for this they already have sister holy wars are easier to start than rumours amongst your kind or mine they believe every sacred word he tells them as though their lives depended upon it which in a sense they do theyve been conspired against and cheated and theyre ready to tear the fugue apart to get their hands on those responsible isnt that perfect the fuguell die at the very hands of those whove come to save it and thats what shadwell wants hes a man he wants adoration she gazed over suzannas shoulder towards the unweaving and the salesman still in its midst and thats what hes got so hes happy hes pitiful said suzanna you know that as well as i do yet you give him power your power our power for my own ends sister you gave him the jacket it was of my making yes though thereve been times ive regretted the gift the ragged muscle of immacolatas face was incapable of its former deceptions as she spoke she couldnt mask the sorrow in her you should have taken it back said suzanna a gift of rapture cant be lent said immacolata only given and given in perpetuity did your grandmother teach you nothing its time you learned sister ill give you those lessons and what do you get in return a distraction from romes gift to me she touched her face and from the stench of men she paused her maimed face darkening theyll destroy you for your strength men like hobart i wanted to kill him once suzanna said remembering the hatred shed felt he knows that thats why he dreams of you death the maiden a laugh broke from her theyre all mad sister not all said suzanna what must i do to persuade you the incantatrix said make you understand how youll be betrayed have already been betrayed without seeming to take a step she moved away from suzanna flickering strands of light were moving past them now as the fugue spread from its hiding place but suzanna scarcely noticed her eyes were fixed on the sight revealed when immacolata stood aside the magdalene was there sumptuously clothed in folds of lacy ectoplasm a wraith bride and from beneath the creatures skirts a pitiful figure was emerging and turning its face up towards suzanna jerichau the mans eyes were clouded though they settled on suzanna there was no recognition in them see said immacolata betrayed what have you done to him suzanna demanded there was nothing left of the jerichau shed known he looked like something already dead his clothes were in tatters his skin mottled and seeping from dozens of vicious wounds he doesnt know you said the incantatrix he has a new wife now the magdalene stretched her hand out and touched jerichaus head stroking it as if he were a lapdog he went to my sisters arms willingly immacolata said leave him be suzanna yelled at the magdalene enfeebled by the drugs her selfcontrol was perilously thin but this is love immacolata goaded therell be children in time many children his lust knows no bounds the thought of jerichau coupling with the magdalene made suzanna shudder again she called his name this time his mouth opened and it seemed his tongue was seeking to form a word but no all his palate could produce was a dribble of saliva you see how quickly they turn to fresh pleasures said immacolata as soon as your back is turned hes ploughing another furrow rage leapt up in suzanna bettering her disgust nor did it come alone though the remnants of the drug still made any focus difficult she felt the menstruum ambitious in her belly immacolata knew it dont be perverse she said her voice seeming to whisper at suzannas ear though they stood yards apart we are more alike than not as she spoke jerichau raised his hands from the ground towards suzanna and now she realized why there was no recognition in his eyes he could not see her the magdalene had blinded her consort to keep him close but he knew she was there he heard her he reached for her sister immacolata said to the magdalene bring your husband to heel the magdalene was quick to obey the hand she had on jerichaus head grew longer the ringers pouring down over his face entering his mouth and nostrils jerichau attempted to resist but the magdalene pulled on him and he tumbled backwards amongst her pestilential petticoats without warning suzanna felt the menstruum spill from her and fly towards jerichaus tormentor it happened in the time it took to see it she caught a glimpse of the magdalenes features stretched into a shriek then the stream of silver light struck her the wraiths cry broke into pieces fragments of sound spiralling off a sobbing complaint a howl of anger as the assault lifted her into the air as usual suzannas thoughts were a beat behind the menstruum before she was fully aware of what she was doing the light was tearing at the wraith gaping holes opening in its matter the magdalene retaliated the stream of the menstruum carrying the attack back into suzannas face she felt blood splash down her neck but the barbs only spurred her fury she was tearing her enemy as though the wraith were a sheet of tissue paper immacolata had not been a passive spectator in this but had flung her own attack against suzanna the ground at suzannas feet shuddered then rose around her as if to bury her alive but the subtle body pitched the earth wall back then went at the magdalene with redoubled fury though the menstruum seemed to have a life of its own that was an illusion she owned this power she knew now more than ever it was her anger that fuelled it that deafened it to mercy or apology it was she who would not be satisfied until the magdalene was undone and all at once it was over the magdalenes cries stopped dead enough suzanna instructed the menstruum let the few fragments of rotted ectoplasm drop to the spattered ground and withdrew its light into its mistress from attack to counterattack to coup de grace had taken maybe a dozen seconds suzanna looked towards immacolata whose wretched features were all disbelief she was trembling from head to foot as if she might fall to the ground in a fit suzanna took her chance shed no way of knowing if she could survive a sustained attack from the incantatrix and now was certainly no time to put the problem to the test as the third sister threw herself amongst the magdalenes litter and began to wail suzanna took to her heels the tide of the fugue was lapping all around them now and the brilliant air camouflaged her flight only after shed covered ten yards or more did she come to her senses and remember jerichau there had been no sign of him in the vicinity of the dead magdalene praying that he had found his way off the battlefield she ran on the hags harrowing din loud in her ears she ran and ran believing over and over that she felt the chill of the virgin on her neck but it seemed she imagined the pursuit for she ran unhindered for a mile or more up the slope of the valley and over the crest of a hill until the light of the weaves forthcoming was dim behind her it would only be a short time before the fugue reached her and when it did she would need to have some strategy but first she had to catch her breath the gloom nursed her awhile she stood trying not to think too hard of what shed just done but a certain ungovernable elation filled her she had killed the magdalene destroyed one of the three it was no minor feat had the power in her always been so dangerous ripening behind her ignorance growing wise growing lethal for some reason she remembered mimis book which pre sumably hobart still had in his possession now more than ever she hoped it could teach her something of what she was and how to profit by it she would have to get the volume back even if it meant confronting hobart once more as she formulated this thought she heard her name uttered or an approximation of it she looked in the direction of the voice and there standing a few yards from her was jerichau he had indeed escaped the magdalenes grasp though his face was scored by the sisters ethereal fingers his wracked frame was on the verge of collapse and even as he called suzannas name a second time and threw his withered arms out towards her his legs gave way beneath him and he fell face down on the ground she was kneeling by his side in moments and turning him over he was featherlight the sisters had drained him of all but the spark of purpose that had sent him stumbling after her blood they could take and seed and muscle love hed kept she drew him up towards her his head lolled against her breasts his breathing was fast and shallow his cold body full of tremors she stroked his head the diminishing light around it playing about her fingers he was not content simply to be cradled however but pushed himself away from her body a few inches in order to reach up and touch her face the veins in his throat throbbed as he tried to speak she hushed him saying there would be time to talk later but he made a tiny shake of his head and she could feel as she held him how close the end was she did him no kindness to pretend otherwise it was time to die and he had sought out her arms as a place to perform that duty oh my sweet she said her chest aching sweet man again he strove for words but his tongue cheated him only soft sounds came which she could make no sense of she leaned closer to him he no longer resisted her comforting but took hold of her shoulder and drew himself closer still to speak to her this time she made a sense of the words though they were scarcely more than sighs im not afraid he said expelling the last word on a breath that had no brother but came against her cheek like a kiss then his hand lost its strength and slipped from her shoulder his eyes closed and he was gone from her a bitter thought came visiting that his last words were as much a plea as a statement jerichau had been the only one shed ever told about how at the warehouse the menstruum had stirred cal from unconsciousness was that im not afraid his way of saying leave me to death i wouldnt thank you for resurrection whatever hed meant shed never find out now she laid him gently on the earth once hed spoken words of love that had defied their condition and become light were there others he knew that defied death or was he already on his way to that region mimi had left for all contact with the world suzanna still occupied broken it seemed so though she watched the body til her eyes ached it made no murmur he had left it to the earth and her with it xi cal travelling north cals journey north dragged on through the night but he didnt weary perhaps it was the fruit that kept his senses so preternaturally clear either that or a newfound sense of purpose that pressed him forward he kept his analytic faculties on hold making decisions as to his route instinctively was it the same sense the pigeons had possessed that he now navigated by a dreamsense beyond the reach of intellect or reason a homing that was how it felt that hed become a bird orienting himself not by the stars nor by the magnetic pole but by the simple urge to go home back to the orchard where hed stood in a ring of loving faces and spoken mad mooneys verse as he drove he ransacked his head for other such fragments so that hed have something fresh to perform next time little rhymes came back from childhood odd lines that hed learned more for their music than their meaning naked heaven comes and goes spits out seas and dyes the rose puts on coats of wind and rain and simply takes them off again he was no more certain of what some were about now than hed been as a child but they came to his lips as if freshminted secure in their rhythms and rhymes xii resolution suzanna sat beside jerichaus body for a long while thinking while trying all the time not to think down the hill the unweaving was still going on the tide of the fugue approaching her but she couldnt face the beauty of it not at the moment when the threads started to come within fifty yards of her she retreated leaving jerichaus body where it lay dawn was paling the clouds overhead she decided to climb to higher ground so as to have an overview when day came the higher she went the windier it became a bitter wind from the north but it was worth the shivering for the promontory she stood upon offered her a fine panorama and as the day strengthened she realized just how cannily shadwell had selected this valley it was bounded on all sides by steep hills whose slopes were bereft of any building however humble indeed the only sign of human presence was the primitive track the convoy had followed to get here which had most likely been used more in the last twentyfour hours than it had in its entire span hitherto it was on that road as dawn brought colour to the hills that she saw the car it crept along the ridge of the hill a little way then came to a halt its driver minuscule from suzannas vantage point got out and surveyed the valley it seemed the fugue below was not visible to such a casual witness for the driver got back into the car almost immediately as if realizing that hed taken a wrong turning he didnt drive away how some had a bitter sting the pestilence of families is not congenital disease but feet that follow where the foot that has proceeeded them was put others were fragments from poems which hed either forgotten or never been taught in their entirety one in particular kept coming back to him how i love the piebald horses best of all the piebald horses that was the closing lines of something he presumed but of what he couldnt remember there were plenty of other fragments he recited the lines over and over as he drove polishing his delivery finding a new emphasis here a fresh rhythm there there was no prompting from the back of his head the poet was quite silent or was it that he and mad mooney were finally speaking with a single voice he crossed the border into scotland about twothirty in the morning and continued to drive north the landscape becoming hillier and less populated as he drove he was getting hungry and his muscles were beginning to ache after so many hours of uninterrupted driving but nothing short of armageddon would have coaxed him to slow down or stop with every mile he came nearer to wonderland in which a life too long delayed was waiting to be lived part eight the return you were about to tell me something childbut you left off before you began william congreve the old bachelor strategy shadwells army of deliverance consisted of three main battalions the first and by far the largest was the mass of the prophets followers the converts whose fervour he had whipped to fanatical proportions and whose devotion to him and to his promise of a new age knew no bounds he had warned them that there would be bloodshed and bloodshed they would have much of it their own but they were prepared for such sacrifice indeed the wilder faction amongst them chiefly yeme the most hotheaded of the families were fairly itching to break some bones it was an enthusiasm shadwell had already used albeit discreetly when occasional members of his congregation had called his preaching into question and he was ready to use it again if there was any sign of softening in the ranks he would of course do what he could to subdue the fugue by rhetoric but he didnt much fancy his chances his followers had been easily duped their lives in the kingdom had so immersed them in halftruths that they were ready to believe any fiction if it was properly advertised but the seerkind who had remained in the fugue would not be so easily misled that was when the truncheons and the pistols would be called into play the second part of his army was made up of hobarts confederates choice members of the squad hobart had diligently prepared for a day of revolution that had never come shadwell had introduced them to the pleasures of his jacket and they had all found something in the folds worth selling their souls for now they were his elite ready to defend his person to the death should circumstance demand the third and final battalion was less visible than the other two but no less powerful for that its soldiers were the byblows the sons and daughters of the magdalene an unnumbered and unordered rabble whose resemblance to their fathers was usually remote and whose natures ranged from the subtly lunatic to the beserk shadwell had made sure the sisters had kept their charges well hidden as they were evidence of a corruption the prophet could scarcely be associated with but they were waiting scrabbling at the veils immacolata had flung around them ready for release should the campaign demand such terrors he had planned his invasion with the precision of a napoleon the first phase which he undertook within an hour of dawn was to go to capras house there to confront the council of the families before it had time to debate the situation the approach was made as a triumphal march with the prophets car its smoked glass windows concealing the passengers from the eyes of the inquisitive leading a convoy of a dozen vehicles in the back of the car shadwell sat with immacolata at his side as they drove he offered his condolences on the death of the magdalene im most distressed he said quietly weve lost a valued ally immacolata said nothing shadwell took a crumpled pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket and lit up the cigarette and the covetous way he had of smoking it as if any moment it would be snatched from his lips was utterly out of synch with the mask he wore i think were both aware of how this changes things he said his tone colourless what does it change she said how he liked the unease that was plain on her face youre vulnerable he reminded her now more than ever that concerns me nothings going to happen to me she insisted oh but it might he said softly we dont know how much resistance were going to meet it might be wise if you withdrew from the fugue entirely no i want to see them burn understandable shadwell said but youre going to be a target and if we lose you we lose access to the magdalenes children as well immacolata looked across at shadwell is that what this is about you want the byblows well i think theres some tactical have them she interrupted take them theyre yours my gift to you i dont want to be reminded of them i despised her appetites shadwell offered a thin smile my thanks he said youre welcome to them just let me watch the fires thats all i ask oh certainly absolutely and i want the woman found suzanna i want her found and given to me shes yours said shadwell as though nothing were simpler one thing though the children is there some particular word i use to bring them to me there is he drew on his cigarette id best have it he said as theyre mine just call them by the names she gave them thatll unleash them and what are their names he said reaching into his pocket for a pen he scribbled them on the back of the cigarette pack as he recited them so as not to forget them then the business concluded they continued their drive in silence ii the burial party suzanna and cals first duty was to locate jerichaus body which took fully half an hour the landscape of the fugue had long since invaded the place where shed left him and it was more by luck than system that they found him luck and the sound of children for jerichau had not remained unaccompanied two women and a half dozen of their offspring from two years to seven or so were standing around the corpse who is he one of the women wanted to know when they approached his name is jerichau said suzanna was one of the children corrected her was cal posed the inevitable and delicate question what happens to bodies here i mean where do we take him the woman grinned displaying an impressive absence of teeth leave him here she said hes not going to mind is he bury him she looked down lovingly on her smallest boy who was naked and filthy his hair full of leaves what do you think she asked him he took his thumb from his mouth and shouted bury him a chant which was immediately taken up by the other children bury him bury him they yelled and instantly one of them fell to her knees and began to dig at the earth like a mongrel in search of a bone surely there must be some formalities cal said are you a cuckoo then one of the mothers enquired yes and him she pointed to jerichau no said suzanna he was a babu and a great friend the children had all taken to digging now laughing and throwing handfuls of earth at each other as they laboured seems to me he was about ready to die said the woman to suzanna judging by the look of him she murmured he was then you should put him in the ground and be done with it came the response theyre just bones cal winced at this but suzanna seemed moved by the womans words i know she said i do know the childrenll help you dig a hole they like to dig is this right said cal yes said suzanna with a sudden certainty yes it is and she and cal went down on their knees alongside the children and dug it was not easy work the earth was heavy and damp they were both quickly muddied but the sheer sweat of it and the fact of getting to grips with the dirt they were going to put jerichaus body beneath made for healthy and strangely rewarding labour it took a long time during which the women watched supervising the children and sharing a pipe of pungent tobacco as they did so as they worked cal mused on how often the fugue and its peoples had confounded his expectations here they were on their knees digging a grave with a gaggle of children it was not what his dreams of being here had prepared him for but in its way it was more real than hed ever dared hope dirt under the fingernails and a snottynosed child at his side blithely eating a worm not a dream at all but an awakening when the hole was deep enough for jerichau to be decently concealed they set about moving him at this point cal could no longer countenance the childrens involvement he told them to stand away as they went to assist in lifting the corpse let them help one of the women chided him theyre enjoying themselves cal looked up at the row of children who were mudpeople by now they were clearly itching to be pallbearers all except for the wormeater who was still sitting on the lip of the grave his feet dangling into the hole this isnt any business for kids cal said he was faintly repulsed by the mothers indifference to their offsprings morbidity is it not said one of the women refilling the pipe for the umpteenth time you know something more about it than they do then he looked at her hard go on she challenged him tell them what you know nothing he conceded reluctantly then whats to fear she enquired gently if theres nothing to fear why not let them play maybe shes right cal said suzanna laying her hand on his and i think hed like it she said he was never one for solemnity cal wasnt convinced but this was no time to argue he shrugged and the children lent their small hands to the task of lifting jerichaus body and laying it in the grave as it was they showed a sweet tenderness in the act untainted by formality or custom one of the girls brushed some dirt from the dead mans face her touch featherlight while her siblings straightened his limbs in the bed of earth then they withdrew without a word leaving suzanna to lay a kiss on jerichaus lips it was only then at the very last that she let go a small sob cal picked up a handful of soil and threw it down into the grave at this the children took their cue and began to cover the body up it was quickly done even the mothers came to the graveside and pitched a handful of earth in as a gesture of farewell to this fellow theyd only known as a subject of debate cal thought of brendans funeral of the coffin shunted off through faded curtains while a pallid young priest led a threadbare hymn this was a better end no doubt of it and the childrens smiles had been in their way more appropriate than prayers and platitudes when it was all done suzanna found her voice thanking both the gravediggers and their mothers after all that digging said the eldest of the girls i just hope he grows he will said her mother with no trace of indulgence they always do on that unlikely remark cal and suzanna went on their way with directions to capras house where had they but known it the flies were soon to be feasting ill the horse unharnessed norris the hamburger billionaire had long ago forgotten what it was like to be treated as a man shadwell had other uses for him first of course during the weaves first waking as his horse then when man and mount returned to the kingdom and shadwell took on the mantle of prophet as footstool foodtaster and fool the butt of the salesmans every humiliating whim to this norris put up no resistance as long as he was in thrall to the raptures of shadwells jacket he was utterly dead to himself but tonight shadwell had tired of his creature he had new vassals on every side and mistreating the sometime plutocrat had become a tired joke before the unweaving hed left norris to the untender mercies of his elite to be their lackey that unkindness was nothing however to his other the withdrawal of the illusion that had won norris compliance norris was not a stupid man when the shock of waking to find himself bruised from head to foot had worn off he soon put the pieces of his recent history together he couldnt know how much time had passed since hed fallen for shadwells trick nor could he recall more than vaguely the discomforts and abuse that had been heaped upon him in his period of servitude but he was quite certain of two things one that it was shadwell who had reduced him to his present abjection and two that shadwell would pay for the privilege his first task was to escape his new masters which during the spectacle of the unweaving was easily done they didnt even notice that hed slipped away the second objective was to find the salesman and this he reasoned was best done with the aid of whatever police force this peculiar country boasted to that end he approached the first group of seerkind he came across and demanded to be taken to somebody in authority they were apparently unimpressed by his demands but suspicious nevertheless they called him a cuckoo which he took some exception to and then accused him of trespassing one of the women even suggested he might be a spy and should be taken post haste to somebody in authority at which point morris reminded her that hed been requesting that all along so they took him which is how a short while later shadwells discarded horse was brought to capras house which was at the time the centre of considerable commotion the prophet had arrived at the house half an hour before at the end of his triumphal march but the councillors had refused him access to the sacred ground until theyd first debated the ethics of it the prophet declared himself willing to accede to their metaphysical caution and so stayed behind the black windows of his car until the councillors had sorted the matter out crowds had gathered eager to see the prophet in the flesh and fascinated by the cars there was an air of innocent excitement envoys ferried messages back and forth between the occupants of the house and the leader of the convoy that waited on its threshold until it was at last announced that the prophet would indeed be given access to capras house on the understanding that he went barefoot and alone this the prophet apparently agreed to because mere minutes after this announcement the car door was opened and the great man indeed stepped forth his feet naked and approached the doorstep the throng pressed forward to see him better this saviour whod brought them to safety norris who was towards the back of the crowd caught only a glimpse of the figure he saw nothing of the mans face but he saw the jacket well enough and he recognized it on the instant it was the same garment with which the salesman had tricked him how could he ever forget the iridescent fabric it was shadwells jacket it followed therefore that the wearer was shadwell the sight of the jacket brought back an echo of the humiliations hed endured at shadwells hands he remembered the kicks and curses he remembered the contempt filled with just fury he shrugged off the hold of the man at his side and squirmed his way through the pack of spectators towards the door of capras house at the front of the crowd he glimpsed the jacket and the man who wore it stepping inside he made to follow but a guard at the doorway blocked his path he was pitched backwards the throng laughing and applauding his antics idiots that they were i know him he yelled as shadwell disappeared from view i know him he got to his feet and ran at the door a second time veering away at the last moment the guard took the bait and gave chase pursuing him into the crowd norris life as a lackey had taught him something of strategy he avoided the guards grasp and made a dive for the unprotected doorway flinging himself over the threshold before his pursuer could bring him down shadwell he yelled in the chamber of capras house the prophet froze in midplatitude the words hed been speaking were all conciliation all understanding but even the blindest of the assembly could not have failed to read the flicker of anger in the peacebringers eyes as that name was called shadwell he turned towards the door behind him he heard the councillors exchange whispered remarks then there was a commotion in the passageway outside the door was flung open and norris was standing there yelling his name the horse faltered as it set eyes on the prophet shadwell could see doubt registering this wasnt the face norris had expected to see he might yet escape with his masquerade unchallenged shadwell he said to norris im afraid i dont know anybody by that name he turned to the councillors do you know the gentleman he enquired they regarded him with open suspicion especially an old man at the heart of the gaggle who hadnt taken his baleful eyes off the prophet since shadwell had entered this hovel now the canker of doubt had spread damn it the jacket said norris who is this man the prophet demanded will somebody please have him taken out he tried to make a joke of it i think hes a little mad nobody moved nobody except the horse norris stepped towards the prophet yelling as he came i know what you did to me he said dont think i dont well im going to sue your ass off shadwell or whoever the hell you are there was a further disturbance at the front door and shadwell glanced up to see two of hobarts finest knocking the guard aside and coming to his aid he opened his mouth to instruct them he could handle the situation but before the words were off his lips norris his face all fury flung himself at his enemy the prophets elite had strict orders in such circumstances nobody but nobody was to lay hands on their beloved leader without a seconds hesitation the two men had their pistols from their holsters and they shot norris dead in his tracks he fell forward at shadwells feet blood coming from his wounds in bright spurts jesus god said shadwell through gritted teeth the echoes of the executioners shots took longer to die than norris had it was as if the walls disbelieved the sound and were playing it back and forth back and forth until theyd verified the transgression outside the crowd had fallen absolutely silent silent too the assembly behind him he could feel their accusing eyes that was stupid he murmured to the killers then his arms outspread he turned to the councillors i do apologize for this unfortunate youre not welcome here one of the number said youve brought death into capras house it was a misunderstanding he replied softly no i insist you hear me out again no shadwell offered a tiny smile you call yourselves wise he said believe me if thats true then youll listen to what ive got to say i didnt come here alone ive got peopleyour people seerkind with me they love me because i want to see the fugue prosper as they do now im prepared to let you share my vision and the triumph thatll come with it if you want to but believe me im going to liberate the fugue with or without your support do i make myself clear get out of here said the old man whod been watching him be careful messimeris one of the others whispered you dont seem to understand shadwell said im bringing you freedom youre not seerkind messimeris replied youre a cuckoo what if i am you cheated your way in here you dont hear capras voice oh i hear voices said shadwell i hear them loud and clear they tell me that the fugues defenceless that its leaders have spent too much time in hiding that theyre weak and frightened he surveyed the faces in front of him and saw it had to be admitted little of the weakness or the fear he spoke of only a stoicism that would take longer to erode than he had time to waste he glanced round at the men whod shot norris it seems we have no choice he said the men perfectly understood the signal they withdrew shadwell turned back to the councillors we want you to leave messimeris restated is that your final word it is said the other shadwell nodded seconds ticked by during which neither side moved a muscle then the front door opened again and the gunmen returned they had brought four more of the elite with them which made up a firing squad of six i request you one final time said shadwell as the squad formed a line to either side of him dont resist me the councillors looked more incredulous than afraid they had lived their lives in this world of wonders but here before them was an arrogance that finally brought disbelief to their faces even when the gunmen raised their weapons they made no move spoke no protest only messimeris asked who is shadwell a salesman i once knew said the man in the fine jacket but hes dead and gone no said messimeris youre shadwell call me what you like said the prophet only bow your heads to me bow your heads and alls forgiven still there was no movement shadwell turned to the gunman at his left and claimed the pistol from his hand he pointed it at messimeris heart the two were standing no more than four yards apart a blind man could not have failed to kill at that range i say again bow your heads at last a few of the assembly seemed to comprehend the seriousness of their situation and did as he requested most just stared however pride stupidity or plain disbelief keeping them from acquiescence shadwell knew the crisis point was upon him he either pulled the trigger now and in so doing bought himself a world or else he left the salesroom and never looked back in that instant he remembered standing on a hilltop the fugue laid before him the memory tipped the balance he shot the man the bullet entered messimeris chest but there was no flow of blood nor did he fall shadwell fired again and a third time for good measure each shot hit home but the man still failed to fall the salesman felt a tremor of panic run through the six gunmen that stood around him the same question was on their lips as on his why wouldnt the old man die he fired his pistol a fourth time as the bullet struck him the victim took a step towards his wouldbe executioner raising his arm as he did so as if he intended to snatch the smoking weapon from shadwells hand the motion was enough to push one of the six beyond the limits of his selfcontrol with a highpitched cry he started to fire into the crowd his hysteria instantly ignited the rest suddenly they were all firing emptying their guns in their hunger to close the accusing eyes in front of them in moments the chamber was filled with smoke and din through it all shadwell saw the man hed first fired upon complete the motion hed begun with his salute then messimeris fell forward dead his collapse didnt silence the guns they blazed on there were a few councillors whod fallen to their knees heads bowed as shadwell had demanded and there were others who were taking refuge in the corners of the room but most were simply gunned down where they stood then just as suddenly as it had begun it was over shadwell threw down his gun and though he had no taste for abattoirs forced himself to survey the carnage before him it was he knew the responsibility of one aspiring to godhood never to look away wilful ignorance was the last refuge of humanity and that was a condition he would soon have transcended and when he studied the scene it wasnt so unbearable he could look at the tumble of corpses and see them for the empty sacks they were but as he turned to the door something did make him flinch not a sight but a memory of messimeris last act that stepping forward that raised hand he hadnt realized what it had signified until now the man had been seeking payment try as he might to find some other explanation shadwell could not he the sometime salesman had finally become a purchaser and messimeris dying gesture had been to remind him of that he would have to start the campaign moving subdue the opposition and get access to the gyre as speedily as possible once hed drawn back the veil of cloud hed be a god and gods were beyond the claims of creditors alive or dead iv the ropedancers cal and suzanna walked as swiftly as curiosity would allow there was much despite the urgency of their mission that slowed their steps such fecundity in the world around them and a razorsharp wit in its shaping that they found themselves remarking on the remarkable so frequently they had to give it up and simply look amid the spectacle of flora and fauna surrounding them they saw no species entirely without precedent in the kingdom of the cuckoo but nothing here from pebble to bird nor anything the eye could admire between was untouched by some transforming magic creatures crossed their path that belonged distantly to the family of fox hare cat and snake but only distantly and amongst the changes wrought in them was a total lack of timidity none fled before the newcomers only glanced cal and suzannas way in casual acknowledgement of their existence then went about their business it might have been eden or an opium dream of same until the sound of a radio being ineptly tuned broke the illusion fragments of music and voices interspersed with piercing whines and white noise all punctuated by whoops of pleasure drifted from beyond a small stand of silver birches the whoops were rapidly replaced however by shouting and threats which escalated as cal and suzanna made their way through the trees on the other side was a field of tall sere grass in it three youths one was balanced on a rope slung loosely between posts watching the other two as they fought the source of the acrimony was selfevident the radio the shorter of the pair whose hair was so blond it was almost white was defending his possession from his bulkier opponent with little success the aggressor snatched it from the youths grip and threw it across the field it struck one of several weatherworn statues that stood half lost in the grass and the song it had been playing abruptly ceased its owner threw himself at the destroyer yelling his fury you bastard your broke it you damn well broke it it was cuckooshite de bono the other youth replied easily fending off the blows you shouldnt mess with shite didnt your mam tell you that it was minev de bono shouted back giving up on his attack and going in search of his possession i dont want your scummy hands on it god youre pathetic you know that shut up dickhead de bono spat back he couldnt locate the radio in the shinhigh grass which merely fuelled his fury galins right the ropepercher piped up de bono had fished a pair of wirerimmed spectacles from the breast pocket of his shirt and had crouched down to scrabble around for his prize its corruption said the youth on the rope who had now taken to performing a series of elaborate steps along its length hops skips and jumps starbrook would have your balls if he knew starbrook wont know de bono growled oh yes he will said galin casting a look up at the ropedancer because youre going to tell him arent you toller maybe came the reply and with it a smug smile de bono had found the radio he picked it up and shook it there was no music forthcoming you shithead he said turning to galin look what you did he might have renewed his assault at this juncture if toller from his perch on the rope hadnt set eyes on their audience who the hell are you he said all three stared at suzanna and cal this is starbrooks field said galin his tone threatening you shouldnt be here he doesnt like women here mind you hes a damn fool said de bono putting his fingers through his hair and grinning at suzanna and you can tell him that too if he ever comes back i will said toller grimly depend on it who is this starbrook said cal whos starbrook galin said everybody knows his voice trailed away comprehension dawned youre cuckoos he said thats right cuckoos said toller so aghast he almost lost his balance in the field de bonos grin merely became more luminous at this revelation cuckoos he said then you can mend the machine he crossed towards cal and suzanna proffering the radio ill give it a try said cal dont you dare said galin either to cal or de bono or both its just a radio for gods sake cal protested its cuckooshite said galin corruption toller announced once more where did you get it cal asked de bono none of your business said galin he took a step towards the trespassers now i told you once youre not welcome here i think hes made his point cal suzanna said leave it be sorry cal said to de bono youll have to mend it yourself i dont know how the youth replied crestfallen weve got work to do suzanna said one eye on galin we have to go she pulled on cals arm come on she said thats it said galin damn cuckoos i want to break his nose cal said were not here to spill blood were here to stop it being spilled i know i know with an apologetic shrug to de bono cal turned his back on the field and they started away through the birches as they reached the other side they heard footsteps behind them both turned de bono was following them still nursing his radio ill come with you he said without invitation you can mend the machine as we go what about starbrook cal said starbrooks not coming back de bono replied theyll wait til the grass grows up their backsides and he still wont come back ive got better things to do he grinned i heard what the machine said he told them its going to be a fine day de bono proved an instructive fellowtraveller there wasnt a subject he wasnt prepared to speculate upon and his enthusiasm for talk did something to coax suzanna from the melancholy that had come in the wake of jerichaus death cal let them talk he had his hands full trying to walk and repair the radio at the same time he did however manage a repeat of his earlier question as to where de bono had got the item in the first place one of the prophets men de bono explained gave it to me this morning he had boxes of them did he indeed said cal its a bribe said suzanna you think i dont know that said de bono i know you get nothing for nothing but i dont believe everything a cuckoo gives me is corruption thats starbrooks talk weve lived with cuckoos before and survived he broke off and turned his attention to cal any luck not yet im not very good with wires maybe ill find somebody in nonesuch he said who can do it for me its only spitting distance now were going to capras house said suzanna and ill go with you only via the town suzanna began to argue a mans got to eat said de bono my stomach thinks my throats cut no detours said suzanna its not a detour de bono replied beaming its on our way he cast her a sideways glance dont be so suspicious he said youre worse than galin im not going to lead you astray trust me we havent got time for sightseeing weve got urgent business with the prophet yes theres a piece of cuckooshite cal commented who the prophet said de bono a cuckoo im afraid so said suzanna see galin wasnt entirely wrong cal said the radios a little piece of corruption im safe said de bono it cant touch me oh no said suzanna not here de bono replied tapping his chest im sealed is that how it has to be said suzanna sighing you sealed up in your assumptions and us in ours why not said de bono we dont need you you want the radio she pointed out he snorted not that much if i lose it i wont weep its worthless all cuckoo stuff is is that what starbrook says suzanna remarked oh very clever he replied somewhat sourly i dreamt of this place cal said breaking into the debate i think a lot of cuckoos do you may dream of us de bono replied ungraciously we dont of you thats not true suzanna said my grandmother loved one of your people and he loved her back if you can love us you can dream of us too the way we dream of you given the chance shes thinking of jerichau cal realized shes talking in the abstract but thats who shes thinking of is that so said de bono yes thats so suzanna replied with sudden fierceness its all the same story what story cal said we live it and they live it she said looking at de bono its about being born and being afraid of dying and how love saves us this she said with great certainty as though it had taken her a good time to reach this conclusion and she was unshakeable on it it silenced the opposition awhile all three walked on without further word for two minutes or more until de bono said i agree she looked up at him you do she said plainly surprised he nodded one story he said yes that makes sense to me finally its the same for you as it is for us raptures or no raptures like you say being born dying and love between he made a small murmur of appreciation then added youd know more about the last part of course he said unable to suppress a giggle being the older woman she laughed and as if in celebration the radio leapt into life once more much to its owners delight and cals astonishment good man de bono whooped good man he claimed it from cals hands and began to tune it so that it was with musical accompaniment that they entered the extraordinary township of nonesuch v nonesuch as they stepped into the streets de bono warned them that the township had been put together in considerable haste and that they shouldnt expect a paradigm of civil planning but the warning went little way to preparing them for the experience ahead there seemed to be no sign whatsoever of order in the place the houses had been laid cheek by jowl in hapless confusion the tunnels between the terms streets flattered them so narrow and so thick with citizens that wherever the eye went it found faces and facades ranging from the primitive to the baroque yet it wasnt dark here there was a shimmering in the stone and in the paving at their feet that lit the passages and turned the humblest wall into an accidental masterpiece of bright mortar and brighter brick any glamour the town could lay claim to was more than matched by its inhabitants their clothes had in them that same amalgam of the severe and the dazzling which the visitors had come to recognize as quintessentially seerkindish but here in the fugues closest approximation to an urban environment the style had been taken to new extremes everywhere there were remarkable garments and accoutrements on view a formal waistcoat that rang with countless tiny bells a woman whose clothes though buttoned up to the throat so matched the colour of her skin she was dressed as if naked on a window sill a young girl sat crosslegged ribbons of every colour lifting around her face on no discernible breeze further down the same alley a man whose fedora seemed to have been woven from his hair was talking with his daughters while in an adjacent doorway a man in a rope suit sang to his dog and style of course bred antistyle like that of the negress and the white woman who whistled past naked but for pantaloons held up with string though all took pleasure in how they appeared it was not an end in itself they had business to do this new morning there was no time for posturing the only sights that seemed to be drawing any significant attention were the few items of late twentiethcentury bricabrac that a few of the citizens were playing with more gifts from the prophets elite no doubt toys that would tarnish in days the way all shadwells promises would there was no time to try and persuade the owners of these glittering nonsenses to discard them they would find out soon enough how frail any gift from that source truly was ill take you to the liars said de bono leading the way through the crowd well eat there then get on our way from every direction sights and sounds claimed the attention of the cuckoos snatches of conversation came at them from doorstep and window and songs and laughter a baby bawled in its mothers arms something barked above them and cal looked up to see a peacock parading on a high balcony wheres he gone for gods sake said suzanna as de bono disappeared into the crowd for the third or fourth time hes too damn quick we have to trust him we need a guide said cal he caught sight of de bonos blond head there they turned a corner as they did so a cry went up from somewhere in the packed alleyway ahead so piercing and so griefstricken it seemed murder must have been committed the sound didnt silence the crowd but hushed it enough for cal and suzanna to catch the words that followed as the echo of the howl died they burned capras house that cant be somebody said a denial taken up on every side as the word spread but the newscarrier was not about to be shouted down they burned it he insisted and killed the council cal had pressed forward through the throng to within sight of the man who indeed looked as if hed witnessed some catastrophe he was dirtied with smoke and mud through which tears coursed as he repeated his story or what few bones of it there were the denials were quietening now there could be no doubting that he spoke the truth it was suzanna who asked the simple question who did it the man looked her way the prophet he breathed it was the prophet at this the crowd erupted curses and imprecations filling the air suzanna turned back to cal we werent quick enough she said tears in her eyes jesus cal we should have been there we wouldnt have made it said a voice at their side de bono had reappeared dont blame yourselves he said then added or me what now said cal we find the bastard and we kill him suzanna said she took hold of de bonos shoulder will you show us the way out of course he aboutturned and led them away from the knot of citizens surrounding the weeping man it was apparent as they went that the news had reached every ear and alleyway the songs and the laughter had entirely vanished a few people were staring up at the slice of sky between the roofs as if waiting for lightning the looks on their faces reminded cal of how the people of chariot street had looked the day of the whirlwind full of unspoken questions to judge by the snatches of conversation they caught as they went there was some argument as to what had precisely happened some were saying that all those in capras house had been murdered others that there were survivors but whatever the discrepancies the broader points were undisputed the prophet had declared war on any who challenged his primacy and to that end his followers were already sweeping the fugue in search of unbelievers we have to get out into open country said suzanna before they reach here its a small world de bono observed it wont take them long to purge it if theyre efficient they will be said cal there was no sign of panic amongst the residents no attempt to pack their bags and escape this persecution or events like it had happened before or so their furrowed faces seemed to say and most likely it would all happen again should they be so surprised it took the trio a handful of minutes to wind their way out of the township and into the open air im sorry we have to part so quickly suzanna said to de bono when they stood at the perimeter why should we have to part because we came here to stop the prophet suzanna said and were going to do that then ill take you where hell be where said cal the firmament de bono replied with confidence the old palace thats what they were saying in the street didnt you hear them and it stands to reason hed be bound to take the firmament if he wants to be king theyd not got far from nonesuch when de bono halted and pointed across the valley to a pall of smoke something burning he said lets hope its shadwell said cal i think i ought to know something about this bastard said de bono if were going to slaughter him in his boots they told him what they knew which was when they came to summarize it a piffling amount its odd said cal it seems like ive known him all my life but you know its less than a year since i first set eyes on him shadows can be cast in any direction said de bono thats my belief starbrook used to say there were even places close to the gyre where the past and the future overlap i think maybe i visited one of them said cal last time i was here what was it like cal shook his head ask me tomorrow he said their route had taken them into marshy territory they picked their way across the mud from stone to stone any hope of conversation cancelled by the clamour of frogs which rose from the reeds half way across the sound of car engines met their ears putting caution aside they crossed to firmer ground by the most direct route sinking up to their ankles in the watersodden ground while the frogs thumbnail small and poppy red leapt before them in their many hundreds on the other side cal shinned up a tree to get a better view the vantage point offered him sight of a convoy of cars heading towards the township it had no need of roads it was forging its way by dint of wheel and horsepower flights of birds rose before it animals those that were fast enough scattered suzanna called up to him what can you see its hobarts mob at a guess hobart she was up the tree and beside him in seconds edging out along the branch to be clear of the foliage its him he heard her say almost to herself my god its him she turned back to cal and there was a wildness in her eyes he didnt much like youre going to have to go on without me she said they climbed down again and picked up the argument at ground level ive got business with hobart you go on ill find you when im done cant he wait cal said no she told him firmly no he cant hes got the book mimi gave me and i want it back she saw the perplexed look on his face and could hear before he delivered them every argument hed make against their parting shadwell was their true objective hed say this was no time to be diverted from facing him besides a book was just a book wasnt it itd still be there tomorrow all of which was true of course but somewhere in her belly she sensed that hobarts cleaving to the book had some perverse logic about it perhaps the pages contained some knowledge she could put to good use in the conflict ahead encoded in those once upon a times that was certainly hobarts conviction and what the enemy believed of you was probably true or else why were you enemies in the first place i have to go back she said and thats all there is to it then ill come with you i can deal with him myself cal she said you two have to go on to the firmament ill find my way to you once ive got the book she spoke with unshakeable conviction he sensed it would be fruitless to argue with her then take care he said wrapping his arms around her be safe and you cal for me with that she was away de bono whod been out of this conversation while he toyed with his radio now said arent we going with her no said cal she wants to go alone he pulled a quizzical face loveaffair is it he asked something like that suzanna retraced their steps to the township with an urgency an enthusiasm even she didnt entirely comprehend was it just that she wanted the confrontation over and done with or could it be that she was actually eager to see hobart again that he had become a kind of mirror in which she might know herself better as she stepped back into the streets which the citizens retreating behind their doors had now left more or less deserted she hoped he knew she was near hoped his heart beat a little faster at her proximity and his palms sweated if not shed teach him how vi the flesh is weak though shadwell had set his sights on occupying the firmament the only building in the fugue worthy of one teetering on godhood once ensconced there he found it an unsettling residence each of the monarchs and matriarchs whod occupied the place over the centuries had brought their own vision to its halls and antechambers their one purpose to expand upon the previous occupants mysteries the result was part labyrinth part mystical ghosttrain ride he was not the first cuckoo to explore the firmaments miraculous corridors several members of humankind had found their way into the palace down the years and wandered there unchallenged by its makers who had no desire to sour its tranquillity with hard words lost in its depths these lucky few had seen sights that they would take to their graves a chamber in which the tiles on the walls had twice as many sides as a dice and flipped forever over and over each facet having its place in a fresco that never came to rest long enough for the eye to entirely comprehend it another room in which rain constantly fell a warm spring night rain and the floor gave off the smell of cooling pavements and another which seemed at first quite plain but was built with such sensebeguiling geometries a man might think his head swelled to fill it one moment and the next be shrunk to the size of a beetle and after an hour or a day of trespassing amongst these wonders some invisible guide would lead them to the door and theyd emerge as if from a dream later theyd try to speak of what theyd seen but a failure of memory and tongue usually conspired to reduce their attempts to babble in desperation many went back in search of that delirium but the firmament was a movable feast and it had always flitted away shadwell was the first cuckoo therefore who walked those rapturous corridors and called them his own it gave him no pleasure however that was perhaps its most elegant revenge on its unwelcome occupant in the late afternoon before the light dwindled too much the prophet made his way up to the top of the firmaments watchtower to survey his territories despite the demands of recent weeks the masquerading the rallies the constant politicking he didnt feel weary all hed promised his followers and himself had come true it was as if his performance as a prophet had lent him prophetic powers hed found the weave as hed said he would and claimed it from its guardians hed led his crusaders into the very heart of the fugue silencing with almost supernatural speed any and all whod defied him from his present elevated status there was no route to rise but towards godhood and the means to that advancement was visible from where he now stood the gyre its mantle roiled and thundered veiling its secrets from all eyes even his no matter tomorrow when hobarts battalion had finished its suppression of the natives they would escort the prophet to the doorway of the gyre the place the kind called the narrow bright and he would step inside then ah then a chill on his nape stirred him from speculation immacolata was standing at the viewingroom door the light did not indulge her it showed her wounds in all their suppurating glory showed her frailty too and her rancour it repulsed him to look at her what do you want he demanded i came to join you she said i dont like this place it stinks of the old science he shrugged and turned his back on her i know what youre thinking shadwell she said and believe me it wouldnt be wise he hadnt heard his name uttered in a long while and he didnt like the way it sounded it was a throwback to a biography hed almost ceased to believe was his what wouldnt be wise he said trying to breach the gyre he made no reply that is what you intend isnt it she could read him still all too easily maybe he said thatd be a cataclysmic mistake oh indeed he said not taking his eyes off the mantle and whys that even the families dont understand what they created when they set the loom to work she said its unknowable nothings unknowable he growled not to me not any more youre still a man shadwell she reminded him youre vulnerable shut up he said shadwell shut up he repeated and turned on her i dont want to hear your defeatism any longer im here arent i i won the fugue we won it all right we what do you want for that little service you know what i want she said what ive always wanted slow genocide he smiled his reply was a long time coming and when it came was spoken slowly no he said no i dont think so why did we follow them all those years she asked it was so you could have profit and i could be avenged things have changed he said you must see that you want to rule them thats it isnt it i want more than that he said i want to know what creation tastes like i want whats in the gyre itll tear you apart i doubt that he said ive never been stronger at the shrine she replied you said wed destroy them together i lied shadwell said lightly i told you what you wanted to hear because i needed you now you disgust me ill have new women when im a god a god now is it she seemed genuinely amused by the thought youre a salesman shadwell youre a shabby little salesman im the one they worship oh yes shadwell replied ive seen your cult a boneyard and a handful of eunuchs i wont be cheated shadwell she said moving towards him not by you of all men hed known for many months that this time would come when she finally understood how hed manipulated her hed prepared himself for the consequences quietly and systematically divesting her of her allies and increasing his own store of defences but she still had the menstruum of that she could never be dispossessed and it was formidable he saw it burgeoning in her eyes even now and couldnt help but want to flinch before it he governed the instinct however and instead walked across to her and putting his hand to her face stroked the lesions and the scabs there surely he murmured you wouldnt kill me i wont be cheated she said again but dead is dead he said his tone soothing im just a cuckoo you know how weak we are no resurrections for us his touch had become more rhythmic she hated it he knew she the perfect virgin she all ice and regret in earlier times she might have burned the skin from his fingertips for visiting this indignity upon her but mama pus was dead the hag her useless lunatic self the once mighty incantatrix was weak and weary and they both knew it all these years sweetheart he said all these years you gave me just enough leash just enough temptation we agreed she said together no said shadwell as though correcting a child you used me to go amongst the cuckoos because if the truth be known they frighten you she made to contradict but he put his hand across her throat dont interrupt he told her she obeyed him youve always held me in contempt he went on i know that but i was useful and did as i was told as long as i wanted to touch you is that what you want now she said once he said almost mourning the loss once i would have killed to feel the pulse in your throat like this his hand tightened a little or to have stroked your flesh he worked the palm of his other hand against her breast dont do that she said the magdalenes dead he reminded her so whos going to produce children now it cant be the old bitch shes sterile no lover no i think it has to be you youll finally have to offer up that precious cunt of yours at this she threw him off her and might have struck him dead but that revulsion at his mauling distracted her from the act she soon recovered her selfcontrol the killing power was mustering behind her eyes he couldnt with safety delay his revenge any longer shed taken him for a fool but he had ways to make her regret her arrogance as she raised her head to spit the menstruum at him he called out the names hed written mere hours before on his pack of cigarettes sousa vessel fairchild divine loss hannah the byblows came at his call scrabbling up the stairs they were no longer the wretched lovelorn things that the magdalene had suckled shadwell had treated them tenderly in the short time hed owned them fed them made them mighty the light died in immacolatas face as she heard them behind her she turned as they spilled through the door you bequeathed them to me he said she let out a cry at the sight of them grown gross and meaty they stank of the slaughterhouse i gave them blood instead of milk said shadwell it makes them love me he made a clucking sound with his tongue and the creatures sidled over to him trailing organs they had yet to find a purpose for i warn you he said try to harm me and theyll take it badly as he spoke he realized that in these last moments immacolata had summoned the hag from the cooler regions of the firmament she was at the incantatrixs shoulder now a restive shadow leave him he heard her sigh in immacolatas ear he didnt for an instant think shed take that advice but she did first spitting on the floor at shadwells feet then turning to go he could scarcely believe the battle had been so easily won shed been more demoralized by grief and mutilation than hed dared hope the showdown was over before it had even begun one of the byblows at his side uttered a soulful wail of frustration he took his eyes off the sisters and told it to hush itself his doing so proved all but fatal for in the instant his gaze dropped the wraithsister came flying at him her jaws wide her teeth suddenly vast ready to tear out his cheating heart at the door immacolata was turning back the menstruum breaking from her he yelled for the beasts to come to his aid but even as he did so the hag was upon him his breath burst from him as he was thrown back against the wall claws raking at his chest the byblows werent about to see their bloodbringer laid low they were upon the hag before her nails could rip through shadwells jacket and she was dragged from him shrieking shed been midwife to these creatures shed delivered them into a world of lunacy and darkness perhaps for that very reason they showed her no mercy they tore at her without pause or apology stop them immacolata yelled the salesman was examining the lacerations the hag had made in his jacket another moment and her fingers would have clutched his heart call them off shadwell please shes dead already he said let them play immacolata moved to aid her sister but as she did so the largest of the byblows with the tiny white eyes of a deepsea fish and a mouth like a wound came between her and rescue she spat an arrow of the menstruum into its pulsing chest but it took the hurt in its stride and came at her unchecked shadwell had seen these monstrosities murder amongst themselves for the sport of it he knew they could sustain horrendous injury without slowing this one for instance called vessel could take a hundred such wounds and still make merry nor was it stupid it had learned the lessons hed taught it well enough even now it leapt upon the incantatrix wrapping its arms around her neck and its legs about her hips such intimacy would he knew drive immacolata to distraction indeed as it put its face to hers kissing her as best its malformations would allow she started to scream all control and calculation finally lost the menstruum flew from her in all directions wasting its potency on the ceiling and the walls those few barbs that found her attacker did nothing but arouse it further though it had no sexual anatomy to speak of shadwell had trained it in the basic moves it worked itself against her like a dog in heat howling into her face opening its mouth was a mistake on its part for a fragment of the menstruum found its way down into its throat and blew it wide its neck erupted and its head no longer supported fell backwards on greasy strings of matter even so it clung to her its body moving in ragged spasms against hers but its grip had loosened sufficiently for her to tear its body from her the struggle leaving her bloodied from head to foot shadwell called the remaining byblows from their vengeful play they withdrew to his side all that was left of the hag was a litter that resembled the leavings on a fishgutters tiles seeing the remains immacolata her face slack to the point of imbecility let out a low moan of loss get her out of here said shadwell i dont want to see her filthy face take her into the hills dump her two of the byblows approached the incantatrix and took hold of her there was not so much as a flicker in her eye nor a finger raised in protest she seemed no longer even to see them either the slaughter of her one remaining sister or her own violation by the beast or perhaps both had undone something inside her she was suddenly bereft of any power to enchant or terrify a sack which they hauled away through the door and carried off down the stairs not once did she even raise her eyes in shadwells direction he listened to the slouching gait of the byblows fade down the stairs still half expecting her to come back for him to mount one final attack but no it was over he crossed to the muck of the hag it smelt of something rotten have it he said to the remaining beasts who fell upon the scraps and fought over them revolted by their appetite he turned his gaze back towards the gyre very soon now night would be upon the fugue a last curtain on the events of a busy day with tomorrow a new act would begin somewhere beyond the cloud he was watching lay a knowledge that would transform him after that no night would fall except at his word nor day dawn vii an open book the law had come to nonesuch it had come to root out dissension it had found none it had come with truncheons riot shields and bullets prepared for armed rebellion it had found no whisper of that either all it had found was a warren of shadowy streets most of them deserted and a few pedestrians who bowed their heads at the first sign of a uniform hobart had immediately ordered a house to house search it had been greeted with a few sour looks but little more than that he was disappointed it would have been gratifying to have found something to sharpen his authority upon all too easy he knew to be lulled into a false sense of security especially when an anticipated confrontation had failed to materialize vigilance was the key word now unending vigilance that was why hed occupied a house with a good view of the township from its upper storeys where he could take up residence for the night tomorrow would bring the big push on the gyre which could surely not go unopposed and yet who could be certain with these people they were so docile like animals rolling over at the first sign of a greater power the house hed commandeered had little to recommend it beyond its view a maze of rooms a collection of faded murals which he didnt care to study too closely spare and creaking furniture the discomfort of the place didnt bother him he liked spartan living but the atmosphere did the sense he had that the ousted tenants were still here just out of sight if hed been a man who believed in ghosts hed have said the house was haunted he wasnt so he kept his fears to himself where they multiplied evening had fallen and the streets below were dark he could see little from his high window now but he could hear laughter drifting up from below hed given his men the evening to enjoy themselves warning them never to forget that the township was enemy territory the laughter grew more riotous then faded down the street let them indulge themselves he thought tomorrow the crusade would take them onto ground the people here thought of as sacred if they were going to show any resistance it would be then hed seen the same happen in the world outside a man who wouldnt lift a finger if his house were burned down throwing a fit if someone touched a trinket he called holy tomorrow promised to be a busy day and a bloody one too richardson had declined the opportunity to take the night off preferring to stay in the house and make a report of the days events for his personal records he kept a ledger of his every move set down in a tiny meticulous hand he worked on it now as hobart listened to the laughter disappearing below finally he put down his pen sir what is it these people sir it seems to me richardson halted unsure of how best to voice a question that had been vexing him since theyd arrived it seems to me they dont look quite human hobart studied the man his hair was immaculately cut his cheeks immaculately shaved his uniform immaculately pressed you may be right he said a flicker of distress crossed richardsons face i dont understand sir while youre here you should believe nothing you see nothing sir nothing at all hobart said he put his fingers to the glass it was cold his body heat lent the tips misty haloes the whole place is a mass of illusions tricks and traps none of its to be trusted its not real richardson said hobart stared across the roofs of this little nowhere and turned the question over real was a word hed once had no problem using real was what made the world go round what was solid and true and its flip side unreal that was what some lunatic in a cell shouted at four in the morning unreal was dreams of power without the flesh to give them weight but his view of these matters had subtly changed since his first encounter with suzanna he had wanted her capture as hed wanted no other and his pursuit of her had led from one strangeness to another until he was so fatigued he scarcely knew right from left real what was real perhaps real was merely what he said was real he was the general and the soldier needed an answer for his sanitys sake a plain answer that would let him sleep soundly he gave it only the laws real here he said we have to hang onto that all of us do you understand richardson nodded yes sir there was a long pause during which somebody outside began whooping like a drunken cherokee richardson closed his ledger and went to the second window i wonder he said yes perhaps i should go out just for a while to see these illusions face to face maybe now that i know its all a lie he said im safe arent i as safe as youre ever going to be said hobart then if you dont mind go on see for yourself richardson was away in seconds and down the stairs a few moments later hobart caught sight of his shadowy form moving away down the street the inspector stretched he was tired to the marrow there was a mattress in the next room but he was determined not to avail himself of it laying his head on a pillow would offer the rumours of occupancy here an easy victim instead he sat down in one of the plain chairs and took the book of faerytales from his pocket it had not left his presence since its confiscation hed lost count of the times hed scanned its pages now he did the same again but the lines of prose grew steadily hazier in front of him and though he tried to check himself his lids became heavier and heavier long before richardson had found himself an illusion to call his own the law that had come to nonesuch had fallen asleep suzanna didnt find it so difficult to avoid hobarts men when she stepped back into the township though they swarmed through the alleyways the shadows had become unnaturally dense there and she was always able to stay a few steps ahead of the enemy getting access to hobart was another matter however though she wanted to be finished with her work here as quickly as possible there was no use in risking arrest shed escaped custody twice three times might be pressing her luck though impatience gnawed at her she decided to wait until the light faded the days were still short this early in the year it would only be a few hours she found herself an empty house availing herself of some plain food that the owners had left there and wandered around the echoing rooms until the light outside began to dwindle her thoughts turned back and back again to jerichau and the circumstances of his death she tried to remember the way he looked and had some success with his eyes and hands but couldnt create anything like a complete portrait her failure depressed her he was so soon gone she had just about decided that it was dark enough to risk venturing out when she heard voices she went to the bottom of the stairs and peered through to the front of the house there were two silhouetted figures on the threshold not here she heard a girls voice whisper why not said her male companion his words slurred one of hobarts company no doubt why not its as good as any theres somebody here already said the girl staring into the mystery of the house the man laughed dirty fuckers he called then he took the woman roughly by the arm lets find somewhere else he said they moved away into the street suzanna wondered if hobart had sanctioned such fraternization she couldnt believe he had it was time she put an end to stalking him in her imagination time to find him and get her business with him done she slipped through the house scanned the street then stepped out into the night the air was balmy and with so few lights burning in the houses and those that did burn mere candleflames the sky was bright above the stars like dewdrops on velvet she walked a little way with her face turned skyward entranced by the sight but not so entranced she didnt sense hobarts proximity he was somewhere near but where she could still waste precious hours going from house to house trying to find him when in doubt ask a policeman it had been one of her mothers favourite saws and never more apt a few yards from where she stood one of hobarts horde was pissing against a wall singing a ragged rendition of land of hope and glory to accompany the flood trusting that his inebriation would keep him from recognizing her she asked hobarts whereabouts you dont need him the man said come on in weve got a party going maybe later ive got to see the inspector if you must the man said hes in the big house with the white walls he pointed back the way shed come splashing his feet as he did so somewhere off to the right he said the instructions despite the providers condition were good off to the right was a street of silent dwellings and at the corner of the next intersection a sizeable house its walls pale in the starlight there was nobody standing sentry at the door the guards had presumably succumbed to whatever pleasures nonesuch could offer she pushed the door open and stepped inside unchallenged there were riotshields propped against the wall of the room shed entered but she needed no confirmation that this was indeed the house her gut already knew that hobart was in one of the upper rooms she started up the stairs not certain what she would do when she confronted him his pursuit of her had made her life a nightmare and she wanted to make him regret it but she couldnt kill him despatching the magdalene had been terrible enough killing a human being was more than her conscience would allow best just to claim her book and go at the top of the stairs was a corridor at the end of which a door stood ajar she went to it and pushed it open he was there her enemy alone slumped in a chair his eyes closed in his lap lay the book of faerytales the very sight of it made her nerves flutter she didnt hesitate in the doorway but crossed the bare boards to where he slumbered in his sleep hobart was floating in a misty place moths flew around his head and beat their dusty wings against his eyes but he couldnt raise his arms to brush them away somewhere near he sensed danger but from which direction would it come the mist moved to his left then to his right who he murmured the word he spoke froze suzanna in her tracks she was a yard from the chair no more he muttered something else words she couldnt comprehend but he didnt wake behind his eyelids hobart glimpsed an unfixable form in the mist he struggled to be free of the lethargy that weighed him down fought to waken and defend himself suzanna took another step towards the sleeper he moaned again she reached for the book her fingers trembling as they closed around it his eyes sprang wide open before she could snatch the book away from him his grip on it tightened he stood up no he shouted the shock of his waking almost made her lose her hold but she wasnt going to give her prize up now the book was her property there was a moment of struggle between them as they fought for possession of the volume then without warning a veil of darkness rose from their hands or more correctly from the book they held between them she looked up into hobarts eyes he was sharing her shock at the power that was suddenly released from between their woven fingers the darkness rose between them like smoke and blossomed against the ceiling immediately tumbling down again enclosing them both in a night within a night she heard hobart loose a yell of fear the next moment words seemed to rise from the book white forms against the smoke and as they rose they became what they meant either that or she and hobart were falling and becoming symbols as the book opened to receive them whichever or both it was all one in the end rising or falling as language or life they were delivered into storyland viii the essential dragon it was dark in the state theyd entered dark and full of rumour suzanna could see nothing in front of her not even her fingertips but she could hear soft whispers carried to her on a warm pinescented wind both touched her face whispers and wind both excited her they knew she was here the people that inhabited the stories in mimis book for it was there in the book that she and hobart now existed somehow in the act of struggling theyd been transformed or at least their thoughts had theyd entered the common life of words standing in the darkness and listening to the whispers all around her she didnt find the notion so difficult to comprehend after all hadnt the author of this book turned his thoughts into words in the act of writing it knowing his readers would decode them as they read making thoughts of them again more making an imagined life so here was she now living that life lost in geschichten der geheimen one or found there there were hints of light moving to either side of her she now realized or was it she that was moving running perhaps or flying anything was possible here this was faery land she concentrated to get a better grasp of what these flashes of light and darkness meant and realized all at once that she was travelling at speed through avenues of trees vast primeval trees and the light between them was growing brighter somewhere up ahead hobart was waiting for her or for the thing shed become as she flew through the pages for she was not suzanna here or rather not simply suzanna she could not simply be herself here any more than he could be simply hobart they were grown mythical in this absolute forest they had drawn to themselves the dreams that this state celebrated the desires and faiths that rilled the nursery stories and so shaped all subsequent desires and faiths there were countless characters to choose from wandering in the wild woods sooner or later every story had a scene played here this was the place orphaned children were left to find either their deaths or their destinies where virgins went in fear of wolves and lovers in fear of their hearts here birds talked and frogs aspired to the throne and every grove had its pool and well and every tree a door to the netherworld what amongst these was she the maiden of course since childhood shed been the maiden she felt the wild woods grow more luminous at this thought as though shed ignited the air with it im the maiden she murmured and hes the dragon oh yes that was it of course that was it the speed of her flight increased the pages flipped over and over and now ahead she saw a metallic brightness between the trees and there the great worm was its gleaming coils wrapped around the roots of a noahic tree its vast flatsnouted head laid on a bed of bloodred poppies as it bided its terrible time yet perfect as it was in every scaly detail she saw hobart there too he was woven with the pattern of light and shade and so most oddly was the word dragon all three occupied the same space in her head a living text of man word and monster the great worm hobart opened its one good eye a broken arrow protruded from its twin the work of some hero or other no doubt whod gone his tasselled and shining way in the belief that hed dispatched the beast it was not so easily destroyed it lived still its coils no less tremendous for the scars they bore its glamour untarnished and the living eye it held enough malice for a tribe of dragons it saw her and raised its head a little molten stone seethed between its lips and murdered the poppies her flight towards it faltered she felt its glance pierce her her body began to tremble in response she tumbled towards the dark earth like a swatted moth the ground beneath her was strewn with words or were they bones whichever she fell amongst them shards of nonsense thrown up in all directions by her flailing arms she got to her feet and looked about her the colonnades were empty in every direction there was no hero to call upon nor mother to take comfort with she was alone with the worm it raised its head a few feet higher this minor motion causing a slow avalanche of coils it was a beautiful worm there was no denying that its iridescent scales glittering the elegance of its malice enchanting she felt looking at it that same combination of yearning and anxiety which she remembered so well from childhood its presence aroused her there was no other word for it as if in response to that confession the dragon roared the sound it made was hot and low seeming to begin in its bowels and winding down its length to break from between the countless needles of its teeth a promise of greater heat to come all light had gone from between the trees no birds sang or spoke no animal if any lived so close to the dragon dared move a whisker in the undergrowth even the bonewords and the poppies had disappeared leaving these two elements maiden and monster to play out their legend it finishes here hobart said with the dragons laval tongue each syllable he shaped was a little fire which cremated the specks of dust around her head she was not afraid of all this rather exhilarated she had only ever been an observer of these rites at last she was a performer have you nothing more to tell me the dragon demanded spitting the words from between its serried teeth no blessings no explanations nothing she said defiantly what was the purpose of talk when they were so perfectly transparent to each other they knew who they were didnt they knew what they meant to one another in the final confrontation of any great tale dialogue was redundant with nothing left to say only action remained a murder or a marriage very well said the dragon and it moved towards her drawing its length over the wasteland between them with vestigial forelegs he means to kill me she thought i have to act quickly what did the maiden do to protect herself in such circumstances as this did she flee or try to sing the beast to sleep the dragon was towering over her now but it didnt attack instead it threw back its head exposing the pale tender flesh of its throat please be quick it growled she was bewildered by this be quick she said kill me and be done it instructed her though her mind didnt fully comprehend this volte face the body she occupied did she felt it changing in response to the invitation felt a new ripeness in it shed thought to live in this world as an innocent but that she couldnt be she was a grown woman a woman whod changed in the last several months sloughed off years of dead assumptions found magic inside herself suffered loss the role of maiden all milk and soft sighs didnt fit hobart knew that better than she he hadnt come into these pages as a child but as the man he was and hed found a role here that suited his most secret and forbidden dreams this was no place for pretence she was not the virgin he was not the devouring worm he in his private imaginings was power besieged and seduced and finally painfully martyred that was why the dragon before her raised its milky throat kill me and be done he said lowering his head a little to look at her in his surviving eye she saw for the first time how wounded he was by his obsession with her how hed come to be in thrall to her sniffing after her like a lost dog hating her more with every day that passed for the power she had over him in the other reality in the room from which theyd stepped which was in turn hidden in a larger kingdom he would be brutal with her given the chance hed kill her for fear of the truth he could only admit in the sacred grove of his dreams but here there was no story to tell except the true one that was why he raised his palpitating throat and fluttered his heavily lidded eye he was the virgin frightened and alone ready to die rather than sacrifice his tattered virtue and what did that make her the beast of course she was the beast no sooner thought than felt she sensed her body growing larger and larger and larger still her bloodstream ran colder than a sharks a furnace flared up in her belly in front of her hobart was shrinking the dragonskin fell away from him in silky folds and he was revealed naked and white a human male covered in wounds a chaste knight at the end of a weary road bereft of strength or certitude she had claimed the skin hed lost she felt it solidify around her its armour glittering the size of her body was a joy to her she exulted in the way it felt to be so dangerous and so impossible this was how she truly dreamt of herself this was the real suzanna she was a dragon with that lesson learned what was she to do finish the story as the man before her wished burn him swallow him looking down at his insipidity from her rearing height smelling the dirt off him the sweat off him she could easily find it in her heart to do her dragons duty and devour it would be easy she moved towards him her shadow engulfing him he was weeping and smiling up at her with gratitude she opened her vast jaws her breath singed his hair she would cook him and swallow him in one swift motion but she was not quick enough as she was about to devour him she was distracted by a voice nearby was there somebody else in the grove the sounds certainly belonged in these pages they were far from human though there were words attempting to surface through the barking and grunting pig dog man a combination of all three and all panicking the knight hobart opened his eyes and there was something new in them something besides tears and fatigue he too had heard the voices and hearing them he was reminded of the place that lay beyond these wild woods the dragons moment of triumph was already sliding away she roared her frustration but there was nothing to be done she felt herself shedding her scales dwindling from the mythical to the particular while hobarts scarred body fluttered like a flame in a breeze and went out her instant of questioning would surely cost her dearly in failing to finish the story to satisfy her victims desire for death shed given him fresh motive for hatred what change might it have wrought in hobart to have dreamed himself devoured to have made a second womb in the worms belly until he was born back into the world too late damn it far too late the pages could contain them no longer leaving their confrontation unfinished they broke from the words in a burst of punctuation they didnt leave the din of the animals behind them it grew louder as the darkness of the wild woods lifted her only thought was for the book she felt it in her hands once more and took fiercer hold of it but hobart had the same idea as the room appeared around them in all its solidity she found his fingers clawing at hers tearing at her skin in his eagerness to claim the prize back you should have killed me she heard him murmur she glanced up at his face he looked even sicklier than the knight hed been sweat running down his sallow cheeks gaze desperate then he seemed to realize himself and the eyes grew arctic somebody was beating on the other side of the door from which the pained cacophony of animals still came wait hobart yelled to his visitors whoever they were as he shouted he took one hand from the book and drew a gun from the inside of his jacket digging the muzzle into suzannas abdomen let the book go or ill kill you she had no choice but to comply the menstruum would not be swift enough to incapacitate him before he pulled the trigger as her hands slipped from the volume however the door was thrown open and all thought of books was eclipsed by what stood on the threshold once this quartet had been amongst the pride of hobarts squad the smartest the hardest but their night of drinking and seduction had unbuttoned more than their trousers it had undone their minds as well it was as if the splendours suzanna had first seen on lord street the haloes that sainted human and seerkind alike had somehow been drawn inside them for the skin of their limbs and faces was swollen and raw bubbles of darkness scurrying around their anatomies like rats under sheets in their panic at this disease theyd clawed their clothes to tatters their torsos shone with sweat and blood and from their throats came the cacophony that had called the dragon and the knight out of the book a bestiality that was echoed in a dozen horrid details the way this ones face had swollen to lend him a snout the way anothers hands were fat as paws this she presumed was how the seerkind had opposed the occupation of their homeland theyd feigned passivity to seduce the invading army into their raptures and this nightmare menagerie was the result apt as it was she was appalled one of the pack now staggered into the room his lips and forehead swollen to the brink of bursting he was clearly trying to address hobart but all his spellbound palate could produce was the complaint of a cat having its neck wrung hobart had no intention of deciphering the mewls but instead levelled his gun at the wreckage shambling towards him come no closer he warned the man spittle running from his open mouth made a incoherent appeal get out was hobarts response he took a step towards the quartet the leader retreated as did those in the doorway not for the guns sake suzanna thought but because hobart was their master these new anatomies only confirmed what their training had long ago taught them that they were unthinking animals in thrall to the law out said hobart again they were backing off along the corridor now their din subdued by their fear of hobart in a matter of moments his attention would no longer be diverted suzanna knew hed turn on her again and the slim advantage gained by this interruption would have been squandered she had to let her instinct lead she might have no other opportunity seizing the moment she ran at hobart and snatched the book from his hand he shouted out and glanced her way his gun still keeping the howling quartet at bay with his eye off them the creatures set up their racket afresh theres no way out hobart said to her except by this door maybe youd like to go that way the creatures clearly sensed that something was in the air and redoubled their din it was like feeding time at the zoo shed not get two steps down the passage before they were upon her hobart had her trapped at that realization she felt the menstruum rise in her coming with breathsnatching suddenness hobart knew instantly she was gathering strength he crossed quickly to the door and slammed it on the howling breed outside then turned on her again we saw some things didnt we he said but its a story you wont live to tell he aimed the gun at her face it wasnt possible to analyse what happened next perhaps he fired and the shot miraculously went wide shattering the window behind her whatever she felt the night air invade the room and the next moment the menstruum was bathing her from head to foot turning her on her heel and she was running towards the window with no time to consider the sense of this escape route until she was up on the sill and hurling herself out the window was three storeys up but it was too late for such practicalities she was committed to the leap or fall orflight the menstruum scooped her up throwing its strength against the wall of the house opposite and letting her slide from window to roof on its cool back it wasnt true flight but it felt like the real thing the street reeled beneath her as she tumbled on solid air to meet the eaves of the other house only to be scooped up a second time and carried over the roof hobarts shouts diminishing behind her she could not be held aloft for long of course but it was an exhilarating ride while it lasted she slid helter skelter down another roof catching sight in that moment of a streak of dawn light between the hills then over gables and chimney stacks and down swooping into a square where the birds were already tuning up for the day as she flew down they scattered startled by the twist evolution had taken to produce such a bird as this her landing must have reassured them that there was much design work still to do she skidded across the paving stones the menstruum cushioning the worst of the impact and came to a halt inches from a mosaiced wall shaking and faintly nauseous she stood up the entire flight had probably lasted no more than twenty seconds but already she heard voices raising the alarm in an adjacent street clutching mimis gift she slipped from the square and out of the township by a route that took her once in a circle and twice almost threw her into the arms of her pursuers every step of the way she discovered a new bruise but she was at least alive and wiser for the nights adventures life and wisdom what more could anybody ask ix the fire the day and night that suzanna spent in nonesuch and in the wild woods stalking hobart took cal and de bono to no less remarkable places they too had their griefs and revelations they too came closer to death than either wanted to come again upon parting from her theyd resumed their journey to the firmament in silence until out of nowhere de bono had said do you love her oddly enough that very thought had been on cals mind but he hadnt replied to the question it had frankly embarrassed him you damn fool de bono said why are you cuckoos so afraid of your feelings shes worth loving even i can see that so why dont you say it cal grunted de bono was right but it rankled to be lectured on the matter by someone younger youre afraid of her is that it de bono said the remark added insult to injury christ no cal said why the fuck should i be afraid of her shes got powers said de bono taking off his spectacles and surveying the terrain ahead most women have of course thats why starbrook wouldnt have them in the field it threw him off balance and what have we got cal asked kicking a stone ahead of him weve got our pricks starbrook again de bono came the reply and the boy laughed i tell you what he said i know this place where we could go no detours said cal whats an hour or two said de bono have you ever heard of venus mountain i said no detours de bono if you want to go then go jesus youre boring de bono sighed i just might leave you to it im not much enjoying your damn fool questions either cal said so if you want to go pick flowers do it just point me to the firmament de bono fell silent they walked on when they did start talking again de bono began to parade his knowledge of the fugue more for the pleasure of belittling his fellow traveller than out of any genuine desire to inform twice in the middle of a diatribe cal dragged them into hiding as one of hobarts patrols came within sighting distance of them on the second occasion they were pinned down for two hours while the squad got progressively drunker within yards of their hiding place when they finally moved on they progressed much more slowly their crampridden limbs felt leaden they were hungry thirsty and irritated by each others company worst of all dusk was creeping on just how far is it from here cal wanted to know once looking down on the fugue from mimis wall the confusion of its landscape had promised unending adventure now immersed in that confusion he would have given his eyeteeth for a good map its quite a distance yet de bono replied do you know where the hell we are de bonos lip curled of course name it huh name it ill be damned if i will you just have to trust me cuckoo the wind had got up in the last half hour and now it brought with it the sound of cries which halted the escalating war of words between them i smell a bonfire burning de bono said it was true besides its burden of pain the wind brought the scent of burning wood de bono was already bounding off in search of its source nothing would have given cal more satisfaction at that moment than leaving the ropedancer to his own devices but much as he doubted de bonos value as a guide he was better than nothing cal followed him through the gathering darkness up a small ridge from there across a space of fields littered with arches they had a fine view of the fire what looked to be a small copse was burning lustily the flames fanned by the wind on the outskirts of this sizeable blaze a number of cars were parked their owners more of shadwells army of deliverance running riot bastards said de bono as several of them hounded down a victim and laid into him with cudgels and boots cuckoo bastards its not just my people cal began but before he could finish the defence of his tribe the words died on his tongue as he recognized the place that was being destroyed in front of his eyes this was no wood the trees werent arbitrarily scattered but planted in ordered avenues once beneath the awning of those trees hed spoken mad mooneys verses now the orchard of lemuel lo was ablaze from end to end he started down the slope towards the conflagration where are you going de bono asked him calhoun what do you think youre doing de bono came after him and took hold of his arm calhoun listen to me let me alone cal said attempting to throw de bono off in the violence of that attempt the soil of the incline gave way beneath his heel and he lost balance taking de bono with him they slid down the hill dirt and stones showering them and came to a halt in a waistdeep ditch of stagnant water at the bottom cal began to haul himself out the other side but de bono had hold of his shirt you cant do anything mooney he said get the fuck off me look im sorry about the cuckoo remark right we breed vandals too forget it said cal his eyes still on the fire he detached de bonos hand i know this place he said i cant just let it burn he pulled himself up out of the ditch and started towards the blaze hed kill the bastards whod done this whoever they were kill them and call it justice its too late de bono called after him you cant help there was truth in what the youth said tomorrow thered be nothing left of the orchard but ashes still he couldnt bring himself to turn his back on the spot where hed first tasted the fugues raptures vaguely aware that de bono was padding after him and completely indifferent to the fact he headed on as the scene before him became clearer he realized that the prophets troops were not going unresisted in several places around the fire figures were locked in handtohand combat but the orchards defenders were easy meat for the fireraisers for whom these barbarities were little more than sport theyd come into the fugue armed with weapons that could decimate the seerkind in hours even as cal watched he saw one of the kind felled with a pistol shot somebody went to the wounded mans aid but was in her turn brought down the soldiers went from body to body to see that the job was done the first of the victims was not dead he raised his hand towards his executioner who pointed his gun at the mans head and fired a spasm of nausea convulsed cals system as the smell of cooking flesh mingled with the smoke he couldnt control his revulsion his knees buckled and he fell to the ground retching on his empty stomach at that moment his misery seemed complete the wet clothes icy on his spine the taste of his stomach in his throat the paradise orchard burning nearby the horrors the fugue was showing him were as profound as its visions had been elevated he could fall no further come away cal de bonos hand was on his shoulder he put a handful of freshly torn grass in front of cal wipe your face he said softly theres nothing to be done here cal pressed the grass beneath his nose inhaling its cool sweetness the nausea was passing he chanced one more look up at the burning orchard his eyes were watering and at first glance he couldnt trust what they now told him he wiped them with the back of his hand sniffing then he looked again and there moving through the smoke in front of the fire he saw lem he spoke the mans name who said de bono cal was already getting up though his legs were jittery there cal said pointing towards lo the orchardkeeper was crouching beside one of the bodies his hand extended to the face of the corpse was he closing the dead mans eyes offering a blessing as he did so cal had to make his presence known had to speak to the man even if it was just to say that he too had witnessed the horrors here and that they wouldnt go unrevenged he turned to de bono the blaze reflected in the ropedancers spectacles hid his eyes but it was clear from the way his face was set that what hed seen had not left him untouched stay here cal said i have to speak to lem youre insane mooney de bono said probably he began back towards the fire calling lems name the rabble seemed to have tired of their hunt several had returned to their cars another was pissing into the fire yet others were simply watching the blaze stupefied by drink and destruction lem had done with his blessings and was walking away from the remains of his orchard cal called his name again but the sound of the fire drowned it out he began to pick up his pace and as he did so lem caught sight of him from thecorner of his eye he seemed not to recognize cal however instead alarmed by the approaching figure he turned and started to run again cal yelled his name and this time drew the mans attention he stopped running and glanced back squinting through the smoke and smuts lem its me cal yelled its mooney los grimy face was not capable of a smile but he opened his arms in welcome to cal who crossed the last yards between them fearful that at any moment the curtain of smoke would part them again it didnt they embraced like brothers oh my poet said lo his eyes reddened with tears and smoke what a place to find you i told you i wouldnt forget said cal didnt i say that you did by god why did they do it lem why did they burn it down they didnt lem replied i did you you think id give those bastards the pleasure of my fruit but lem the trees all those trees lo was digging in his pockets and brought out handfuls of the jude pears many were bruised and broken sap glistening as it ran over los fingers their perfume pierced the filthy air bringing back memories of lost times theres seeds in every one of them poet lem said and in every seed theres a tree ill find another place to plant they were brave words but he sobbed even as he spoke them they wont defeat us calhoun he said whatever gods name they come in we wont kneel to them you mustnt said cal or everythings lost as he spoke he saw los gaze move off his face towards the rabble at the cars we should be going he said stuffing the fruit back into his pocket will you come with me i cant lem well i taught your verses to my daughters he said i remembered them as you remembered me theyre not mine cal said theyre my grandfathers they belong to us all now lo said planted in good ground suddenly a shot cal turned the three firewatchers had seen them and were coming their way all were armed lo snatched hold of cals hand for an instant and squeezed it by way of farewell then contact was broken as more shots followed on the first lo was heading off into the darkness away from the light of the fire but the ground was uneven and he fell after only a few steps cal went after him as the gunmen began a further round of shots get away from me lo shouted for gods sake run lo was scrabbling to pick up the fruit that hed dropped from his pocket as cal reached him one of the gunman got lucky a shot found lo he cried out and clutched his side the gunmen were almost upon their targets now theyd given up firing to have better sport at close range as they came within a half a dozen yards however the leader was felled by a missile hurled from the smoke it struck his head opening a substantial wound he toppled blinded by blood cal had time to see the weapon that had brought the man down and recognize it as a radio then de bono was weaving through the murky air towards the gunmen they heard him coming he was yelling like a wild man a shot was fired in his direction but went well wide he threw himself past the hunters and ran off in the direction of the fire the leader his hand clamped to his head was staggering to his feet ready to give chase de bonos tactics though theyd distracted the executioners were as good as suicidal the gunmen had him trapped against the wall of burning trees cal caught sight of him pelting through the smoke towards the fire the killers in howling pursuit a volley of shots was fired he dodged them like the dancer he was but there was no dodging the inferno ahead cal saw him glance round once to take in the sight of his pursuers then idiot that he was he plunged into the fire most of the trees were now no more than burning pillars but the ground itself was a fire walkers heaven hot ash and charcoal the air shimmered with the heat corrupting de bonos figure until it was lost between the trees there was no time to mourn him his bravery had earned them a reprieve but it would not last long cal turned back to aid lemuel the man had gone however leaving a splash of blood and a few fallen fruit to mark the place hed been back at the fire the gunmen were still waiting to mow de bono down should he reemerge cal had time to get to his feet and study the conflagration for any sign of the ropedancer there was none then he backed away from the pyre and took off towards the slope on which he and de bono had fought as he did so a vague hope rose in him he decided to change his route and made a run that took him around to the other side of the orchard the air was clearer here the wind was carrying the smoke in the opposite direction he ran along the edge of the orchard hoping against hope that maybe de bono had outpaced the heat half way along the flank of the fire his horrified eyes found a pair of burning shoes he kicked them over then searched for their owner it was only when he turned his back on the flames that he saw the figure standing in a field of high grass two hundred yards from the orchard even at that distance the blond head was recognizable so as he drew closer was the smug smile hed lost his eyebrows and his lashes and his hair was badly singed but he was alive and well how did you do that cal asked him when he got within speaking distance of the fellow de bono shrugged id rather firewalk than ropedance any day of the week he said id be dead without you cal said thank you de bono was clearly uncomfortable with cals gratitude he shooed it away with a wave of his hand then turned his back on the fire and waded off through the grass leaving cal to follow do you know where were going cal called after him it seemed they were striking off in another direction to the one theyd been following when theyd first come upon the fire but he couldnt have sworn to it de bono offered a reply but the wind blew it away and cal was too weary to ask a second time x unearthly delights the journey became a torment thereafter events at the orchard had drained cal of what few reserves of strength he could still lay claim to the muscles in his legs twitched as if they were about to go into spasm the vertebrae in his lower back seemed to have lost their cartilage and were grinding against each other he tried not to think of what would happen if and when they finally reached the firmament in the best of conditions he and de bono would scarcely be shadwells equal like this theyd be fodder the occasional wonders the starlight had uncovered a ring of stones linked by bands of whispering fog what appeared to be a family of dolls their identical faces pale smiling beatifically from behind a silent waterfall to these he gave no more than a cursory glance the only sight that could have brought joy to his lips at that moment was a feather mattress but even the mysteries dwindled after a time as de bono led him up a dark hillside with a soft wind moving in the grass around their feet the moon was rising through a bank of cumulus making a ghost of de bono as he forged on up the steep slope cal followed like a lamb too weary to question their route but by degrees he became aware that the sighs he heard were not entirely the voice of the wind there was an oblique music in them a tune which came and fled again it was de bono who finally came to a halt and said dyou hear them cal yes i hear them they know theyve got visitors is this the firmament no said de bono softly the firmaments for tomorrow were too tired for that tonight we stay here wheres here cant you guess dont you smell the air it was lightly perfumed honeysuckle and nightblooming jasmine and feel the earth the ground was warm beneath his feet this my friend is venus mountain he should have known better than to trust de bono for all his heroics the fellow was wholly unreliable and now theyd lost precious time cal glanced behind him to see if the route theyd come was discernible but no the moon had slipped into the cloudbank for a little while and the mountainside was in darkness when he looked back de bono had vanished hearing laughter a little way off cal called his guides name the laughter came again it sounded too light to be de bono but he couldnt be certain where are you he asked but there was no reply so he went in the direction of the laughter as he advanced he stepped into a passage of warm air startled he retreated but the tropical warmth came with him the honey scent now strong in his nostrils it made him feel lightheaded his aching legs threatened to fold beneath him from the sheer swooning pleasure of it a little further up the incline he saw another figure surely that of de bono moving in the gloom again he called the mans name and this time he was granted a reply de bono turned and said dont fret cuckoo his voice had taken on a dreamy quality weve got no time cal protested cant do cant do anything de bonos voice came and went like a weak radio signal cant do anything tonight except love the last word faded and so did de bono melting into the darkness cal aboutturned he was certain that de bono had been speaking from further up the mountain which meant that if he turned his back on the spot and walked hed be returning the way theyd come the warmth went with him as he aboutturned ill get a new guide he vaguely thought get a guide and find the firmament he had an appointment to keep with somebody who was it his thoughts were going the way of de bonos voice oh yes suzanna at the mental formulation of her name the warmth somehow conspired with his limbs to draw him down to the ground he wasnt sure how it happened he didnt trip he wasnt pushed but in an instant he had his head on the ground and oh the comfort of it it was like returning to a lovers bed on a morning of a frost he stretched out indulging his weary limbs telling himself hed just lie here long enough to gain some strength for the trials ahead he might well have fallen asleep but that he heard his name called not cal nor even calhoun but mooney it was not de bonos voice but a womans suzanna he tried to sit up but he was so heavy so laden with the dirt of his journey he couldnt move he wanted to slough the weight off like a snake its tired skin but he lay there unable to move a finger joint while the voice called him and called him fading as it went searching for him in higher regions he so wanted to follow it and without warning he felt that yearning realized as his clothes fell away from him and he began to travel over the grass his belly to the earths belly how he was transported he wasnt certain for he felt no movement in his limbs and his breath was not quickened by the effort indeed he felt so removed from sensation it was as if hed left body and breath behind him with his clothes one thing he had brought with him light a pale cool light that illuminated the grass and the small mountain flowers nestling there a light that travelled so close to him it might have been of him a few yards from where he journeyed he saw de bono lying asleep on the grass his mouth open like a fishs mouth he moved towards the sleeper to question him but before he reached the man something else drew his attention mere yards from where de bono lay there were shafts of light springing up from the dark ground he moved over his companions body his light almost stirring de bono then on towards this new mystery it was easily solved there were several holes in the earth he went to the lip of the nearest and peered down the entire mountain he now saw was hollow below him was a vast cavern with brightnesses moving in it these were presumably the presences of which de bono had spoken now the suspicion that hed left his body behind him somewhere along the way was confirmed for he slipped down the hole which would not have been wide enough to allow access to his head never mind his shoulders and fell into the upper air of the cavern there he hovered and gazed on the ritual being performed below at first sight the performers seemed to be spheres of luminous gas perhaps forty of them some large some minute their colours ranging from cool pastels through to livid yellows and reds but as he drifted down from the dome of the cavern claimed not by gravity but by the simple desire to know he realized that the globes were far from blank within their confines forms were appearing like ghosts in their perfect geometries they were ephemeral these visions lasting seconds at most before pale clouds veiled them and new configurations took their place but they lingered long enough for him to make sense of them in several of the spheres he saw shapes that resembled human foetuses their heads vast their threadlike limbs wrapped about their bodies no sooner seen than gone and in their place perhaps a splash of bright blue that made the globe into a vast eyeball in another the gases were dividing and dividing like a cell in love with itself in a third the clouds had become a blizzard in the depths of which he saw a forest and a hill he was certain these entities were aware of his being in the cavern though none broke the regime of their motion to welcome him he was not offended by this their dance was elaborate and it would cause no little confusion if one of them were to move off its course there was an exquisite inevitability about their motion some of the spheres repeatedly moving within a hairs breadth of collision then swinging wide an instant before disaster struck others proceeding in families which described complex paths around each other while simultaneously moving in the great circle that was pivoted at the centre of the cavern there was more to fascinate him here than the tranquil majesty of the dance however for twice in the flux of one of the larger spheres he glimpsed an image which carried an extraordinary erotic charge a naked woman her limbs defying all the laws of anatomy was floating on a pillow of cloud her position one of pure sexual display as cal witnessed her she was gone leaving him with the image of her invitation her lips her cunt her buttocks there was nothing whorish in her exhibition the crime would have been in shame which had no place in this charmed circle the presences were too in love with being for such nonsenses they loved death too and as unequivocally one sphere had a corpse in its midst rotted and crawling with flies disclosed with the same delight as its companion glories but death did not interest cal the woman did cant do anything tonight de bono had said except love and cal knew it now to be true but love as hed known it above ground was not appropriate here the woman in the sphere needed no sweettalk her company was offered freely the question was how did he express his desire hed left his erection behind on venus mountain he neednt have concerned himself she already knew his thoughts as his eyes found her a third time her glance seemed to draw him down into the midst of the dance he found himself executing a slow slow somersault and settling into place beside his mistress as he attained this spot he realized just what function he had here the voice on the mountain had called him mooney and that name had not been chosen in vain he had come from above as light as moonlight and here he had found his orbit in a dance of planets and satellites perhaps of course this was simply his interpretation perhaps the imperatives of this system pertained as much to love and snowstorms as to astronomy in the face of such miracles conjecture was fruitless tonight being was all the presences made another circuit and he lost in the sheer delight of this preordained journey tumbling over and over was momentarily distracted from the woman hed seen but as his orbit took him out in a wide arc he once more set eyes on the planet she haunted she emerged even as he watched only to be lost in cloud again did he perform the same rites for her turning from humanity to abstraction and back again at the blossoming of a milky cloud he knew so little of himself this mooney in his singular orbit all he could hope to comprehend of what he was he had to discover from the spheres upon whose faces he shed his borrowed light that was perhaps the condition of moons it was enough he knew in that moment how moons made love by bewitching the nights of planets by stirring their oceans by blessing the hunter and the harvester a hundred ways that needed only the unbound anatomies of light and space as he thought this thought the woman opened to bathe in him to spread her cunt and let his light pleasure her entering he felt the same heat the same possessiveness the same vanity as had ever marked the animal hed been but in place of labour there was ease in place of ever imminent loss sustenance in place of urgency the sense that this could last forever or rather that a hundred human lifetimes were a moment in the span of moons and his ride on this empyrean carousel had made a nonsense of time at that thought a terrible sense of poignancy swept over him had all hed left above on the mountain withered and died while these constellations moved steadily about their business he looked towards the centre of the system the hub about which they all described their paths eccentric or regular distant or intimate and there in the place from which he drew his light he saw himself sleeping on a hillside im dreaming he thought and suddenly rose like a bubble in a bottle less moon than mooney the dome of the cavern which he vaguely realized resembled the inside of a skull was dark above him and for an instant he thought hed be dashed to death against it but at the last moment the air grew bright around him and he woke staring up at a sky streaked with light it was dawn on venus mountain of the dream hed had one part was true he had sloughed off two skins like a snake one his clothes lay scattered around him in the grass the other the accrued grime of his adventures had been bathed away in the night either by dew or a fall of rain whichever he was quite dry now the warmth of the ground he lay upon had dried him off and left him sweetsmelling he felt nourished too and strong he sat up balm de bono was already on his feet scratching his balls and staring up at the sky a blissful combination the grass had left an imprint on his back and buttocks did they please you he said cocking an eye at cal please me the presences did they give you sweet dreams yes they did de bono grinned lewdly want to tell me about it he said i dont know how to oh spare me the modesty no its just i i dreamt i was the moon you did what i dreamt i bring you to the nearest thing weve got to a whorehouse and you dream about being the moon youre a strange man calhoun he picked up his vest and put it on shaking his head at cals bizarrity what did you dream of cal enquired ill tell you one of these times said de bono when youre old enough they dressed in silence then set off down the gentle slope of the mountain xi a witness though the day had dawned well for suzanna with her miraculous escape from hobart it had rapidly deteriorated shed felt oddly cocooned by night with the dawn came nameless anxieties and some she could name first off the fact that shed lost her guide she had only the roughest idea of the direction in which the firmament lay so elected to make her way towards the gyre which was plainly visible at all times and make what enquiries she could along the route her second source of concern the many signs that events in the fugue were rapidly taking a turn for the worse a great pall of smoke hung over the valley and though thered been rain in the night fires still burned in many places she came upon several battle sites as she went in one place a firegutted car was perched in a tree like a steel bird blown there presumably or levitated she couldnt know what forces had clashed the previous night nor what weapons had been used but the struggle had dearly been horrendous shadwell had divided the people of this once tranquil land with his prophetic talk setting brother against brother those conflicts were traditionally the bloodiest it should have come as no surprise then to see bodies left where theyd fallen for foxes and birds to pick at denied the simple courtesy of burial if there was any sliver of comfort to be drawn from these scenes it was that shadwells invasion had not gone undefied the destruction of capras house had been a massive miscalculation on his part what chance hed had of taking the fugue with words alone had been squandered in that one tyrannical gesture he could not now hope to win these territories by stealth and seduction it was armed suppression or nothing having seen for herself what damage the seerkinds raptures were capable of she nurtured some faint hope that any such suppression might be subverted but what damage perhaps irreversible would be done to the fugue while its inhabitants freedom was being won these woods and meadows werent meant to host atrocities their innocence of such horrors was a part of their power to enchant it was at such a spot once untainted now all too familiar with death that she encountered the first living person in her travels that day it was one of those mysterious snatches of architecture of which the fugue could boast several in this case a dozen pillars ranged around a shallow pool on top of one of the pillars sat a stringy middleaged man in a shabby coat a large pair of binoculars around his neck who looked up from the notebook in which he was scribbling as she approached looking for someone he enquired no theyre all dead anyway he said dispassionately see the pavement around the pool was splashed with blood those that had shed it lay face up at the bottom of the water their wounds white your handiwork she asked him me good god no im just a witness and what army are you with im with nobody she said im on my own this he wrote down i dont necessarily believe you he said as he wrote but a good witness sets down what he sees and hears even if he doubts it what have you seen she asked him confusion he said people everywhere and nobody sure who was who and bloodletting the like of which i never thought to see here he peered at her youre not seerkind he said no just wandered in by chance did you something like that well id wander back out again if i were you nobodys safe a lot of folks have packed their bags and gone into the kingdom rather than be slaughtered so whos left fighting wild men i know i shouldnt venture an opinion but thats the way it looks to me barbarians raging around even as he spoke she heard shouting a little way off with their breakfast done the wild men were at work already what can you see from up there she asked him a lot of ruins he said and occasional glimpses of the factions he put his binoculars to his eyes and made a sweep of the terrain pausing here and there as he caught sight of some interesting detail theres been a battalion out of nonesuch in the last hour he said looking much the worse for wear theres rebels over towards the steps and another band to the northwest of here the prophet left the firmament a little while ago i cant say exactly when my watch was stolen and theres several squads of his evangelists preceding him to clear the way the way where to the gyre of course the gyre my guess is that was the prophets target from the outset hes not a prophet said suzanna hes called shadwell shadwell go on write that down hes a cuckoo and a salesman you know this for certain the man said tell me all no time suzanna replied much to his aggravation ive got to get to him oh so hes a friend far from it she said her eyes straying back to the bodies in the pool youll never get near his throat if thats what youre hoping the man told her hes guarded day and night ill find a way she said you dont know what hes capable of if hes a cuckoo and he tries stepping into the gyre thatll be the end of us that i do know still itll give me a last chapter eh and wholl be left to read it she left him up on his pillar like some lonely penitent pondering the remark her thoughts were grimmer for the conversation despite the presence of the menstruum in her system she knew very little of how the forces that had made the weaveworld worked but it didnt take genius to see that for shadwell to trespass on the rapturous ground of the gyre would prove cataclysmic he was all that rarefied region and its makers despised he was corruption perhaps the gyre could destroy itself rather than give him access to its secrets and if it ceased to exist wouldnt the fugue the unity of which was preserved by the power there be lost to the maelstrom that she feared was what the witness had meant with his pronouncements if shadwell entered the gyre the world would end thered been no sign of animal or bird life since shed left the vicinity of the pool the trees and bushes were deserted the undergrowth was hushed she summoned the menstruum up until it brimmed in her ready to be used in her defence should the occasion arise there was no time left for niceties now she would kill anyone who tried to prevent her from getting to shadwell a noise from behind a partially demolished wall drew her attention she stood her ground and challenged the observer to make himself known there was no reply forthcoming i wont ask you again she said whos there at this there was a fall of brick shards and a boy of four or five naked but for socks and dust stood up and clambered over the rubble towards her oh my god she said her heart going out to the child in the instant her defences fell there was movement to right and left of her and she found herself surrounded by a ragged selection of armed men the childs forlorn expression dropped as one of the soldiers summoned him to his side the man put a grimy hand through the boys hair and gave him a grim smile of approval name yourself someone demanded of her she had no idea of which side these men were on if they were of shadwells army admitting her name would be an instant death sentence but desperate as things were she couldnt bring herself to unleash the menstruum against men and a child whose allegiance she didnt even know shoot her the boy said shes with them dont you dare said a voice at the back i know her she turned as her saviour spoke her name and there of all people was nimrod the last time theyd met hed been a convert to shadwells unholy crusade all talk of glorious tomorrows time and circumstance had humbled him he was a picture of wretchedness his clothes tattered his face full of hurt dont blame me he said before she could even speak i dont she said thered been times shed cursed him but they were history now truly i dont help me he said suddenly and came to her she hugged him he concealed his tears behind their embrace until the others left off watching the reunion and slipped back into hiding only then did he ask have you seen jerichau hes dead she said the sisters killed him he drew away from her and covered his face with his hands it wasnt your fault she told him i knew he said quietly as soon as things went sour i knew something terrible had happened to him you cant be blamed for not seeing the truth shadwells a brilliant performer and he was selling what people wanted to hear wait said nimrod looking up at her are you telling me shadwells the prophet yes i am he made a small shake of the head a cuckoo he said his tone still half disbelieving a cuckoo it doesnt mean he isnt strong suzanna cautioned hes got raptures all his own youve got to come back to the camp nimrod said with fresh urgency talk to our commander before we leave for the gyre make it quick she said he was already away leading her into the rockier terrain that concealed the rebels theres only me and apolline left alive he said as they went from the first wakened the rest are gone my lilia then freddy cammell now jerichau wheres apolline now she went out into the kingdom the last i heard what about cal is he with you we were going to meet up at the firmament but shadwells already on his way to the gyre which is as far as hell get nimrod said whatever raptures hes stolen hes still just a man and men bleed so do we all she thought but left the thought unspoken xii one fell swoop nimrods brave talk was undercut by what she found at the camp it was more like a hospital than a military establishment well over three quarters of the fifty or so soldiers men and women who were gathered in the shelter of the rocks had sustained some wound or other some were still capable of fighting but many were clearly at deaths door tended with soft words in their failing minutes in one corner of the camp out of sight of the dying a dozen bodies were laid beneath makeshift shrouds in another a cache of captured armaments was being sorted through it made a chilling display machineguns flamethrowers grenades on this evidence shadwells followers had come prepared to destroy their homeland if it resisted their deliverance against these horrors and the zeal with which they were wielded the profoundest raptures were a frail defence if nimrod shared her doubts he chose not to show them but talked ceaselessly of the previous nights victories as if to keep a telling silence at bay we even took prisoners he boasted leading suzanna to a muddy pit amongst the boulders where maybe a dozen captives sat bound at ankles and wrists guarded by a girl with a machinegun they were a forlorn mob some were wounded all were distressed weeping and muttering to themselves as though shadwells lies no longer blinded them and they were waking up to the iniquity of what theyd done she pitied them in their selfcontempt she knew all too well the powers of beguilement shadwell possessed in her time shed almost succumbed to them herself these were his victims not his allies theyd been sold a lie theyd had no power to refuse now disabused of his teachings they were left to brood on the blood theyd spilt and despair has anybody talked with them she asked nimrod maybe theyve got some grasp of shadwells weaknesses the commander forbade it said nimrod theyre diseased dont talk nonsense suzanna replied and climbed down into the pit with the prisoners several turned their troubled faces towards her one at the sight of a face that bore some sign of lenience started to sob loudly im not here to accuse you she told them i just want to talk with you at her side a man with bloodcaked features said are they going to kill us no she told him not if i can help it what happened another enquired his voice slurred and dreamy is the prophet coming someone tried to shush him but he rambled on he must come soon mustnt he he must come and take us into capras hands he isnt coming said suzanna we know that said the first prisoner at least most of us do weve been cheated he told us i know what he told you suzanna said and i know how he cheated you now youve got to make good the damage by helping me you cant overthrow him the man said hes got powers shut your mouth said one nearby who was clutching a rosary so tightly his knuckles looked ready to pop you mustnt say anything against him he hears let him hear the other spat back let him kill me if he chooses i dont care he turned back to suzanna hes got demons with him ive seen them he feeds the dead to them nimrod who was standing behind suzanna listening to this evidence now spoke up demons he said youve seen them no said the whitefaced man i have said another describe them nimrod demanded it was surely the byblows the man spoke of suzanna thought grown to monstrous proportions but as the man began to tell what he knew she was distracted by the sight of a prisoner she hadnt previously noticed squatting in the filthiest part of the compound face turned to the rock it was a woman to judge by the hair that fell to the middle of her back and shed not been bound like the rest simply left to grieve in the dirt suzanna made her way through the captives towards her as she approached she heard mutterings and saw that the woman had her lips pressed to the stone and was talking to it as if seeking comfort there her supplication faltered as suzannas shadow fell on the rock and she turned it took a heartbeat only for suzanna to see beyond the dried blood and excrement on the face that now looked up towards her it was immacolata on her maimed face was the look of a tragedian her eyes were swollen with tears and brimming now with a fresh flood her hair was unbraided and thick with mud her breasts were bared for all to see and in every sinew there was a terrible bewilderment nothing of her former authority remained she was a madwoman squatting in her own shit contrary feelings fought in suzanna here trembling before her was the woman whod murdered mimi in her own bed part architect of the calamities which had overtaken the fugue the power behind shadwells throne the source of countless deceits and sorrows the devils inspiration yet she could not feel for immacolata the hatred shed felt for shadwell or hobart was it because the incantatrix had first given her access to the menstruum albeit unwillingly or was it that they were as immacolata had always claimed somehow sisters might this under other skies have been her fate to be lost and mad dont look at me the woman said softly there was no sign of recognition in her bloodshot eyes do you know who you are suzanna asked her the womans expression didnt change after a few moments her answer came the rock knows she said the rock itll be sand soon i told it so because its true itll be sand immacolata took her gaze off her questioner and began to stroke the rock with her open palm shed been doing this for some while suzanna now saw there were streaks of blood on the stone where shed rubbed the skin from her palm as if attempting to erase the lines why will it be sand suzanna asked it must come said immacolata ive seen it the scourge it must come and then we will all be sand she stroked more furiously i told the rock will you tell me immacolata glanced round and then back to the rock for a little while suzanna thought the woman had forgotten the questioner until the words came again haltingly the scourge must come she said even in its sleep it knows she stopped wounding her hand sometimes it almost wakes she said and when it does well all be sand she laid her cheek against the bloodied rock and made a low sobbing sound wheres your sister suzanna said at this the sobbing faltered is she here i have no sisters immacolata said there was no trace of doubt in her voice what about shadwell do you remember shadwell my sisters are dead all gone to sand everything gone to sand the sobs began again more mournful than ever whats your interest in her nimrod whod been standing at suzannas shoulder for several seconds wanted to know shes just another lunatic we found her amongst the corpses she was eating their eyes do you know who she is suzanna said nimrod thats immacolata his face grew slack with shock shadwells mistress i swear it youre mistaken he said shes lost her mind but i swear thats who it is i was face to face with her less than two days ago so whats happened to her shadwell maybe the name was echoed softly by the woman at the rock whatever happened she shouldnt be here not like this youd better come speak to the commander you can tell it all to her it seemed it was to be a day of reunions first nimrod then the incantatrix and now leading this defeated troop yolande dor the woman whod so vehemently fought the reweaving back when capras house was still standing she too had changed gone the strutting confidence of the woman her face looked pale and clammy her voice and manner were subdued she wasted no time with courtesies if youve got something to tell me spit it out one of your prisoners suzanna began ive no time to hear appeals came the reply especially from you this isnt an appeal i still wont hear it you must and you will suzanna responded forget how you feel about me i dont feel anything was yolandes retort the council condemned themselves you were just there to carry their burden for them if it hadnt been you it would have been somebody else this outburst seemed to pain her she slipped her hand inside her unbuttoned jacket clearly nursing a wound there her fingers came away bloody suzanna persevered but more softly one of your prisoners she said is immacolata yolande looked across at nimrod is that true its true suzanna said i know her better than any of you its her shes lost insane maybe but if we could get some sense from her we might use her to reach shadwell shadwell the prophet they were allies once him and immacolata i wont conspire with corruption like that yolande replied well hang her when the proper time comes well at least let me talk to her maybe i can coax something from her if shes lost her mind why should we trust a word she says no let her rot its a wasted chance dont tell me about wasted chances yolande said bitterly there was clearly no hope of persuading her we move towards the mantle in an hour she stated if you want to swell our ranks do so or else get about your business this said she turned her back on them both come on said nimrod and took his leave but suzanna lingered for what its worth she said i hope we have time to talk when all this is over yolande didnt turn back leave me alone she said suzanna did just that for several minutes after suzannas departure from the prisoners compound immacolata sat in the murk of her forgetfulness sometimes she wept sometimes she stared at the silent rock in front of her the violation shadwell had visited upon her at the firmament following as it had upon the destruction of her wraithsisters had driven her mind into a wilderness but shed not been alone there somewhere in those wastes shed been reacquainted with the spectre that had haunted her so often in the past the scourge she whod been happiest where the air was thickest with decay whod made necklaces of entrails and soulmates of the dead she had found in the presence of that abomination nightmares even shed prayed to wake from it still slept which was some small consolation in her terror but it would not sleep forever it had tasks unfinished ambitions unfulfilled very soon it would rise from its bed and come looking to finish its business and on that day all sand she told the stone this time it didnt answer her it was sulking because shed been indiscreet talking to the woman with the grey eyes immacolata rocked back and forth on her heels and as she rocked the womans words drifted back to her tantalizing her she only remembered a little of what the woman had said a phrase a name or rather one name in particular it echoed in her head now shadwell it was like an itch beneath her scalp an ache in her skull she wanted to dig through her ear drum and pull it out grind it underfoot she rocked faster to soothe the name away but it wouldnt leave her head shadwell shadwell and now there were other names rising to join the ranks of the remembered the magdalene the hag she saw them before her as clear as the rock dearer her sisters her poor twiceslaughtered sisters and beneath their dead heels she saw a land a somewhere shed conspired to spoil for such a long weary time its name came back to her and she spoke it softly the fugue thats what theyd called it her enemies how theyd loved it how theyd fought for its safety and in the process wounded her she put her hand out to the rock and felt it tremble at her touch then she hauled herself to her feet while the name that had begun this flood filled her head washing forgetfulness away shadwell how could she ever have forgotten her beloved shadwell shed given him raptures and what had he done in return betrayed and befouled her used her for as long as it had suited his purposes then pitched her away into the wilderness he hadnt thrown her far enough today shed found her way back and she came with killing news the screams began suddenly and mounted cries of disbelief then shouts of horror the like of which suzanna had never heard ahead of her nimrod was already running towards the source of the din she followed and stepped into a scene of the bloodiest chaos were attacked nimrod yelled at her as rebels ran in all directions many bearing fresh wounds the ground was already littered with bodies more were falling with every moment before nimrod could plunge into the fray however suzanna took hold of his jacket theyre fighting each other she shouted to him above the bedlam what look she said it took him only a few seconds to confirm what shed seen there was no sign of any outside attack the rebels were at each others throats no quarter was being given on any side men were murdering men theyd moments ago been sharing a cigarette with some had even risen from their deathbeds and were beating at the heads of those whod nursed them nimrod stepped on to the battlefield and dragged one of these sudden lunatics from the throat of another what in gods name are you doing he demanded the man was still struggling to reach his victim that bastard the man shrieked he raped my wife what are you talking about i saw him right there he jabbed his finger at the ground there your wifes not here nimrod yelled shaking the man violently shes not here suzanna scanned the battlefield the same delusion or something similar had seized hold of all of these people even as they fought they wept and howled their accusations at each other theyd seen their parents trampled underfoot their wives abused and their children slaughtered now they wanted to kill the culprits hearing this collective delusion voiced she looked for its maker and there standing on a high rock surveying the atrocities was immacolata her hair remained unbraided her breasts were still bare but she was obviously no longer a stranger to her history shed remembered herself suzanna began to move towards her trusting that the menstruum would keep this terrible rapture from curdling her brains it did so though she had to be nimble to avoid the brutalities on every side she reached the vicinity of the rock without harm immacolata seemed not to see her head back teeth bared in a grin of appalling ferocity her attention was entirely upon the mayhem shed given birth to forget them suzanna called up to her at these words the head dropped a fraction and suzanna felt the incantatrixs gaze come to rest on her why are you doing this she said theyve done you no harm you should have left me to my emptiness the incantatrix replied you made me remember then for my sake suzanna said leave them be behind her the shouts had begun to wane only to be replaced by the moans of the dying and the sobs of those whod woken from this delusion to find their knives buried in the hearts of their friends whether the rapture had faltered because immacolata had done her worst or because shed responded to suzannas appeal was neither here nor there at least the deathdealing had stopped there was a moments respite only however before a shot punctuated the sobs the bullet struck the rock between immacolatas bare feet suzanna turned to see yolande dor striding through the mortuary that had once been her little army taking fresh aim at the incantatrix as she did so immacolata was not prepared to play target as the second of the shots pealed against the rock the incantatrix rose into the air and floated towards yolande her shadow passing over the battlefield like that of a carrionbird was fatal at its touch the wounded unable to run before it turned their faces to the bloodsodden ground and breathed their last yolande didnt wait for the shadow to reach her but fired at the creature over and over again the same power that held immacolata aloft simply threw the bullets aside suzanna yelled for yolande to retreat but her warning went unheard or ignored the incantatrix swept down upon the woman and snatched her up the menstruum wrapping them both in light then threw her across the field her body hit the face of the rock upon which immacolata had been standing with a sickening thud and dropped broken to the ground none of the surviving rebels made a move to go to their commanders aid they stayed frozen in terror as the incantatrix floated a yard above the ground across the arena of bodies her shadow claiming those failing few whod not been silenced by it on its outward journey suzanna knew that what slim chance of mercy shed won from the incantatrix had been forfeited by yolandes attack she would now leave none living amongst her sometime captors without any time to formulate a defence she threw the menstruums living glance towards the woman its power was minuscule beside that of immacolata but shed dropped her guard after killing yolande and the blow found her vulnerable struck in the small of the back she was flung forward it took her seconds only to regain her equilibrium however and turn still hovering like some perverse saint towards her attacker there was no fury in her face only mild amusement do you want to die she asked no of course not didnt i warn you how it would be sister didnt i tell you all grief i said all loss is that how it is suzanna wasnt entirely humouring the woman when she nodded her head the incantatrix made a long soft sigh you made me remember she said i thank you for that and in return she opened her hand as if presenting some invisible gift your life the hand became a fist and now the debts paid as she spoke she began to descend once more until her feet were on solid ground there will come a time she said looking at the bodies in whose midst they stood when you will take comfort in the company of such as these as i have as i do then she turned her back on suzanna and started to walk away nobody made any move to challenge her as she climbed the rocks and disappeared from sight the survivors just watched and gave up a prayer to whichever deities they held dear that the woman from the wilderness had passed them by xiii a fleeting glimpse shadwell had not slept well but then he supposed aspirant deities seldom did with godhood came a great burden of responsibility should he be so surprised then that his slumbers were uneasy yet hed known from the time that hed stood in the watchtower and studied the mantle of the gyre that he had nothing to fear he could feel the power hidden behind that cloud calling him by name inviting him to step into its embrace and be transformed a little before dawn however as he was preparing to leave the firmament he was brought unsettling news hobarts forces in nonesuch had been decimated by raptures that had driven most of them to lunacy nor was hobart entirely free of the taint when he arrived an hour after the messenger the inspector had about him the air of a man who wasnt certain he could trust himself any longer from elsewhere the news was better wherever the prophets forces had faced the native population in natural warfare they had triumphed it was only when the soldiers had failed to strike swiftly that the seerkind had found a window through which to work their raptures and when they had the results were the same as theyd been in nonesuch men had either lost their minds or woken from their evangelical zeal and joined the enemy now that enemy was gathering at the narrow bright warned either by rumour or rapture that the prophet was intending to breach the gyre and prepared to defend its integrity to the death there were several hundreds of them but they scarcely constituted an army they were by all reports an unarmed unregimented collection of old men women and children the only problem they presented lay in the ethics of decimating them but hed decided as his entourage left the firmament for the gyre that such moral niceties were beneath him now the greater crime by far would be to ignore the call hed heard from beyond the mantle when the moment came as it soon would hed summon the byblows and let them devour the enemy children and all he would not shirk godhood called and he went fleetfooted to worship at his own altar the sense of physical and spiritual wellbeing cal had felt when he woke on venus mountain did not falter as he and de bono made their way down the slope towards the firmament but his fine mood was soon spoiled by the agitation in the landscape around them a distressing but unfixable anxiety in every leaf and blade of grass what shreds of birdsong there were sounded shrill more alarms than musicmaking even the air buzzed around his head as though for the first time he was alive to the news it carried bad news no doubt yet there was not much of consequence to be seen a few smouldering fires little more and even those signs of strife petered out as they approached the firmament itself this is it said cal as de bono led him through the trees towards a tall but in truth quite unexceptional building it is all the doors stood open there was neither sound nor movement from within they quickly scrutinized the exterior searching for some sign of shadwells occupancy but there was none visible after one circuit de bono spoke what cal had been thinking its no use us waiting out here we have to go in hearts hammering they climbed the steps and entered cal had been told to expect the miraculous and he wasnt disappointed each room he put his head into showed him some new glory in tile and brick and paint but that was all only miracles theres nobody here said de bono when theyd made a complete search of the lower floor shadwells gone im going to try upstairs cal said they climbed the flight and separated for speeds sake at the end of one corridor cal discovered a room whose walls were cunningly set with fragments of mirrors reflecting the visitor in such a fashion that he seemed to see himself behind the walls in some place of mist and shadow peering out from between the bricks that was strange enough but by some further device the method of which was beyond him he seemed not to be alone in that other world but sharing it with an assortment of animals cats monkeys and flying fish all of which his reflection had apparently fathered for they all had his face he laughed to see it and they all laughed with him fish included indeed it was not until his laughter died down that he heard de bono summoning him his shouts urgent he left the room reluctantly and went in search of the ropedancer the call was coming from up a further flight of stairs i hear you he yelled up to de bono and began to climb the ascent was lengthy and steep but delivered him into a room at the top of a watchtower light poured through windows on every side but the brightness couldnt dissuade him that the room had seen horrors and recently whatever it had witnessed de bono had worse to show him ive found shadwell he announced beckoning cal over where at the narrow bright cal peered through the window adjacent to de bono not that one he was told this one brings it nearer a telescopic window and through it a scene to make his pulse pick up its pace its backcloth the seething mantle cloud its subject massacre hes going to breach the gyre de bono said it clearly wasnt just the conflict that had paled the youth it was the thought of that act why would he want to do that hes a cuckoo isnt he came the reply what more reason does he need then we have to stop him cal said ungluing his gaze from the window and heading back towards the stairs the battles already lost de bono replied im not going to stand and watch him occupy every damn inch of the fugue ill go in after him if thats what it takes de bono looked at cal a mixture of anger and despair on his face you cant he said the gyres forbidden territory even to us there are mysteries in there even kind arent allowed to set eyes on shadwells going in exactly said de bono shadwells going in and you know whatll happen the gyre will revolt itll destroy itself my god and if it does the fugue comes apart at the seams then we stop him or we die why do cuckoos always reduce everything to such simple choices i dont know youve got me there but while youre thinking about it heres another one are you coming or staying damn you mooney youre coming then xiv the narrow bright there were less than a dozen individuals from amongst yolandes rebel band who were firm enough of limb to make their way towards the gyre suzanna went with them nimrod had requested that though she told him in plain terms that any dream of overwhelming the enemy by force of arms was misbegotten the enemy were many they were few the only hope remaining lay in her getting close to shadwell and dispatching him personally if nimrods people could clear her route to the prophet they might yet do service otherwise she advised them to preserve themselves in the hope that thered be a life worth living tomorrow they got within about two hundred yards of the battle the sound of shots and shouts and carengines deafeningly loud when she had her first sight of shadwell hed found himself a mount a vast vile monster that could only be one of the magdalenes children grown to a foul adulthood and he was sitting astride its shoulders surveying the battle hes protected said nimrod at her side there were beasts human and less than human circling the prophet well divert them as best we can thered been a moment as theyd approached the gyre when suzannas spirits had risen despite the circumstance or perhaps because of it because this confrontation promised to be the endgame the war that would end all wars after which shed have no more nights dreaming of loss but the moment had passed quickly now all she felt peering through the smoke at her enemy was despondency it grew with every yard they covered wherever she looked there were sights pitiful or nauseating the struggle it was clear was already lost the gyres defendants had been outnumbered and outarmed most had been laid low the corpses food for shadwells creatures the remnants brave as they were could not keep the salesman from his prize any longer i was a dragon once she found herself thinking as she fixed her eye on the prophet if she could only remember how it had felt she might be one again but this time thered be no hesitation no moment of doubt this time shed devour the route to the gyre took cal through territory he remembered from his rickshaw ride but its ambiguities had fled before the invading army or else hidden their subtle heads and he wondered what of the old man hed met at the end of that ride had he fallen prey to the marauders had his throat slit defending his little corner of wonderland most likely cal would never know a thousand tragedies had wracked the fugue in recent hours the old mans fate was just part of a greater horror a world was going to ash and dust around them and up ahead the architect of these outrages cal saw the salesman now at the heart of the carnage his face blazing with triumph the sight made him put aside any thought of safety with de bono at his heels he pitched into the thick of the battle there was scarcely a foot of clear ground between the bodies the closer he got to shadwell the thicker the smell of blood and burning flesh became he was soon separated from de bono in the confusion but it didnt matter any longer his priority had to be the salesman every other consideration fell away maybe it was this purposefulness which got him through the bloodletting alive though bullets filled the air like flies his very indifference was a kind of blessedness what he failed to notice failed in turn to notice him thus he went unscathed through the heart of the battle until he was within ten yards of shadwell he cast around amongst the slain at his feet in search of a weapon and laid his hands on a machinegun shadwell was dismounting from the beast hed been riding and turning his back on the conflict there were a mere handful of defenders left between him and the mantle and they were already falling he was seconds only from entering the gyre cal raised the gun and pointed it towards the prophet but before his finger could find the trigger something rose up from feasting at his side and came at him one of the magdalenes children flesh between its teeth he might have tried to kill it but recognition slurred his intent the creature that tore the gun from his hand was the selfsame that had almost murdered him at the warehouse his own child it had grown it now stood half as tall again as cal but for all its bulk it was no sloth its fingers reached for him swift as lightning and he only ducked them by the slimmest of margins flinging himself down amid the corpses where it doubtless intended to lay him permanently in desperation he sought the fallen gun but before he could locate it the child came in fresh pursuit its weight pulping the bodies it trod upon cal attempted to roll out from beneath it but the beast was too quick and snatched hold of his hair and throat he clutched at the corpses seeking purchase as the creature hauled him up but his fingers slid over their gaping faces and he was suddenly an infant in the embrace of his own monstrous offspring his wild eyes caught fleeting sight of the prophet the mantles last defenders were dead shadwell was yards from the wall of the cloud cal struggled against the beast until his bones were about ready to break but to no avail this time the child intended to complete its task of patricide cals last breath was steadily pressed from his lungs in extremis he clawed at the polluted mirror before him and through the dusky air saw gobs of the childs flesh come away there was a rush of bluish matter like its mothers stuff the chill of which slapped him back from dying and he drove his fingers deeper into the beasts face its size had been gained at the price of durability its skull was wafer thin he made a hook of his fingers and pulled the beast howled and dropped him the filth of its workings spilling out cal dragged himself to his feet in time to hear de bono calling his name he looked up towards the shout vaguely aware that the ground beneath him was trembling and that those who could were fleeing the battlefield de bono had an axe in his hand he threw it towards cal as the byblow its head cratered came for him again the weapon fell short but cal was over the bodies and to it in an instant turning to face the beast at his back with a sideways blow that opened a wound in its flank the carcass loosed a stinking froth of matter but the child didnt fall cal swung again opening the cut further and again this time the beasts hands went to the wound and its head was lowered as it peered at the damage cal didnt hesitate he raised the axe and brought it down on the childs skull the blade divided the head to the neck and the byblow toppled forward the axe still buried in its body cal looked about him for a sign of de bono but the ropedancer was nowhere to be seen nor was there any other living person kind or cuckoo visible through the smoke the battle had ended those whod survived it on either side had retreated and with reason the shuddering in the earth had intensified it seemed the ground was ready to gape and swallow the field he turned his gaze back towards the mantle there was a rawedged tear in the cloud beyond it darkness shadwell of course had gone without hesitating to compute the consequences cal stumbled through the devastation towards the cloud and entered its darkness suzanna had seen the conclusion of cals struggle with the byblow from a distance and might have reached him in time to prevent his going into the gyre alone but the tremors that rocked the narrow bright had shadwells army in sudden panic and she came closer to being killed in their haste to get to safe ground than shed been in the conflict itself she was running against the tide through smoke and confusion by the time the air had cleared and shed oriented herself shadwell had dismounted and disappeared into the gyre and cal was following she called to him but the earth was in further convulsions and her voice was lost beneath its roars she cast one final look round to see nimrod helping one of the wounded away from the bright then she began towards the wall of cloud into which cal had now vanished her scalp tingled the power of the place she stood before was immeasurable there was every chance that it had already annihilated those foolhardy enough to trespass inside but she couldnt be certain of that and as long as there was a sliver of doubt she had to act cal was there and whether he was dead or alive she had to go to him his name on her lips as a keepsake and a prayer she followed where hed gone into the living heart of wonderland part nine into the gyre upon our heels a fresh perfection treads john keats hyperion i trespassers always worlds within worlds in the kingdom of the cuckoo the weave in the weave the fugue in the fugue the world of mimis book and now this the gyre but nothing that shed seen in the pages or places shed visited could have prepared suzanna for what she found waiting behind the mantle for one thing though it had seemed as she stepped through the cloudcurtain that thered been only night awaiting her on the other side that darkness had been an illusion the landscape of the gyre was lit with an amber phosphorescence that rose from the very earth beneath her feet the reversal upset her equilibrium completely it was almost as if the world had turned over and she was treading the sky and the true heavens they were another wonder the clouds pressed low their innards in perpetual turmoil as if at the least provocation theyd rain lightning on her defenceless head when shed advanced a few yards she glanced behind her just to be certain that she knew the route back but the door and the battlefield of the narrow bright beyond had already disappeared the cloud was no longer a curtain but a wall a spasm of panic clutched her belly she soothed it with the thought that she wasnt alone here somewhere up ahead was cal but where though the light from the ground was bright enough for her to walk by it and the fact that the landscape was so barren conspired to make a nonsense of distance she couldnt be certain whether she was seeing twenty yards ahead of her or two hundred whichever there was no sign of human presence within range of her eyesight all she could do was follow her nose and hope to god she was heading in the right direction and then a fresh wonder at her feet a trail had appeared or rather two trails intermingled though the earth was impacted and dry so much so that neither shadwell nor cals footfalls had left an indentation where the invaders had trodden the ground seemed to be vibrating that was her first impression at least but as she followed their route the truth became apparent the soil along the path pursuer and pursued had taken was sprouting she stopped walking and went down on her haunches to confirm the phenomenon her eyes werent misleading her the earth was cracking and yellowgreen tendrils their strength out of all proportion to their size were corkscrewing up out of the cracks their growth so fast she could watch it happening was this some elaborate defence mechanism on the gyres part or had those ahead of her carried seeds into this sterile world which the raptures here had urged into immediate life she looked back her own route was similarly marked the shoots only just appearing while those in cal and shadwells path with a minute or mores headway were already six inches high one was uncurling like a fern another had pods a third was spiny at this rate of growth theyd be trees within an hour extraordinary as the spectacle was she had no time to study it following this trail of proliferating life she pressed on though shed picked up her pace to a trot there was still no sign of those she was following the flowering path was the only proof of their passing she was soon obliged to run well off the trail for the plants growing at exponential rate were spreading laterally as well as vertically as they swelled it became clear how little they had in common with the kingdoms flora if they had sprung from seeds brought in on human heels the enchantments here had wrought profound changes in them indeed the resemblance was less to a jungle than to some undersea reef not least because the plants prodigious growth made them sway as if moved by a tide their colours and their forms were utterly various not one was like its neighbour all they had in common was their enthusiasm for growth for fruitfulness clouds of scented pollen were being expelled like breaths pulsing blossoms were turning their heads to the clouds as if the lightning was a kind of sustenance roots were spreading underfoot with such violence the earth trembled yet there was nothing threatening in this surge of life the eagerness here was simply the eagerness of the new born they grew for the pleasure of growing then from off to her right she heard a cry or something like a cry was it cal no there was no sign of the trail dividing it came again somewhere between a sob and a sigh it was impossible to ignore despite her mission promising herself only the briefest of detours she followed the sound distance was so deceptive here shed advanced perhaps two dozen yards from the trail when the air unveiled the source of the sound it was a plant the first living thing shed seen here beyond the limits of the trail with which it shared the same multiplicity of forms and brilliance of colour it was the size of a small tree its heart a knot of boughs so complex she suspected it must be several plants growing together in one spot she heard rustling in the blossomladen thicket and amongst the serpentine roots but she couldnt see the creature whose call had brought her here something did become apparent however that the knot at the centre of the tree all but lost amongst the foliage was a human corpse if she needed further confirmation it was in plain sight fragments of a fine suit hanging from the boughs like the sloughed skins of executive snakes a shoe parcelled up in tendrils the clothes had been shredded so that the dead flesh could be claimed by flora green life springing up where red had failed the corpses legs had grown woody and sprouted knotted roots shoots were exploding from its innards there was no time to linger and look she had work to do she made one circuit of the tree and was about to return to the path when she saw a pair of living eyes staring out at her from the leaves she yelped they blinked tentatively she reached forward and parted the twigs the head of the man shed taken for dead was on almost back to front and his skull had been cracked wide open but everywhere the wounds had bred sumptuous life a beard lush as new grass grew around a mossy mouth which ran with sap floretladen twigs broke from the cheeks the eyes watched her intently and she felt moist tendrils reaching up to investigate her face and hair then its blossoms shaking as it drew breath the hybrid spoke one long soft word amialive was it naming itself when shed overcome her surprise she told it she didnt understand it seemed to frown there was a fall of petals from its crown of flowers the throat pulsed and then regurgitated the syllables this time better punctuated am ia live are you alive she said comprehending now of course of course youre alive i thought i was dreaming it said its eyes wandering from its perusal of her a while then returning dead or dreaming or both one moment bricks in the air breaking my head shearmans house she said ah you were there the auction you were at the auction it laughed to itself and its humour tingled against her cheek i always wanted to be inside he said inside and now she understood the how and why of this though it was odd to think odd it was incredible that this creature had been one of shadwells party that was what she construed injured or perhaps killed in the destruction of the house hed somehow been caught up in the gyre which had turned his broken body to this flowering purpose her face must have registered her distress at his state for the tendrils empathized and grew jittery so im not dreaming then the hybrid said no strange came the reply i thought i was its so like paradise she wasnt sure shed heard correctly paradise she said i never dared hope life would be such pleasure she smiled the tendrils were soothed this is wonderland the hybrid said really oh yes were near to where the weave began near to the temple of the loom here everything transforms everything becomes me i was lost look at me now how i am hearing his boast her mind went back to the adventures shed had in the book how in that nomansland between words and the world everything had been transforming and becoming and her mind married in hatred with hobarts had been the energy of that condition she the warp to his weft thoughts from different skulls crossing and making a material place from their conflict it was all part of the same procedure the knowledge was slippery she wanted an equation in which she could fix the lesson in case she could put it to use but there were more pressing issues now than the higher mathematics of the imagination i must go she said of course you must there are others here i saw said the hybrid passing overhead overhead towards the loom towards the loom she retraced her steps to the trail with fresh enthusiasm the fact of the buyers existence in the gyre apparently accepted by the forces here even welcomed gave her some hope that the mere presence of a trespasser was not sufficient to make the gyre turn itself inside out its sensitivity had apparently been overestimated it was strong enough to deal with an invading force in its own inimitable fashion her skin had begun to itch and there was a restlessness in her gut she tried not to think too hard of what this signified but the irritation increased as she again followed the trail the atmosphere was thickening now the world around her darkening it wasnt nights darkness coaxing sleep the murk buzzed with life she could taste it sweet and sour she could see it busy behind her eyes shed gone only a little way when something ran across her feet she looked down to see an animal an unlikely cross between squirrel and centipede eyes bright legs innumerable cavorting between the roots nor she now realized was the creature alone the forest was inhabited animals as numerous and as remarkable as the plantlife were spilling out from the undergrowth changing even as they hopped and squirmed more ambitious by the breath their origins the plants the flora had parented its own fauna its buds flowering into insects its fruits growing fur and scales a plant opened and butterflies rose in a flickering cloud in a thorn thicket birds were fluttering into life from a tree trunk white snakes poured like sentient sap the air was so thick now she could have sliced it new creatures crossing her path with every yard she advanced only to be eclipsed by the murk something that was a distant relation of the armadillo waddled in front of her three variations on the theme of ape came and went a golden dog cavorted amongst the flowers and so on and so forth she had no doubt now why her skin itched it longed to join this game of changes to throw itself back into the melting pot and find a new design her mind too was half seduced by the notion amongst such joyous invention it seemed churlish to cleave to a single anatomy indeed she might have succumbed in time to these temptations of the flesh but that ahead of her a building now emerged from the fog a plain brick building which she caught sight of for an instant before the air enclosed it again plain as it was this could only be the temple of the loom a huge parrot swooped in front of her speaking in tongues then flitted away she began to run the golden dog had elected to keep pace with her it panted at her heels then the shock wave it came from the direction of the building a force that convulsed the living membrane of the air and rocked the earth she was thrown off her feet amid sprawling roots which instantly attempted to incorporate her into their design she disengaged them from around about her and pulled herself to her feet either the contact with the earth or the wave of energy from the temple had sent her into paroxysms though she was standing quite still her whole body seemed to be dancing there was no other word for it every part of her from eyelash to marrow had caught the rhythm of power here its percussion ordered her heart to a different beat her blood sped then slowed her mind soared and plummeted by turns but that was only flesh her other anatomy the subtle body which the menstruum had quickened was beyond the control of the forces here or else was already in such accord with them it was left to its own work she occupied it now telling it to keep her feet from rooting and her head from sprouting wings and flying off it soothed her shed been a dragon and emerged again hadnt she this was no different yes it is said her fears this is flesh and bone business the dragon was all in my mind havent you learned yet came the reply there is no difference as the answer rang in her head the second shock wave struck and this time it was no petit mal but the full fit the ground beneath her began to roar she started to run towards the temple once more as the noise mounted but shed got five yards at best when the roar became the hard din of breaking stone and a zigzag crack appeared to the right of her and to the left another and another the gyre was tearing itself apart ii the temple though shadwell had a good lead on cal the thick air of the gyre did not conceal him the salesmans jacket stood out like a beacon and cal followed it as fast as his jittery limbs would carry him though his struggle with the byblow had left him weak he was still much the fitter man and steadily closed the gap between them more than once he caught shadwell glancing behind him his face a smear of anxiety after all the chases and crusades the beasts and the armies it had come down to the two of them racing towards a goal beyond the articulation of either they were equals at last or at least so cal had thought it was only when they came in sight of the temple that the salesman turned and stood his ground either his fingers or the air had clawed his disguise from his face he was the prophet no longer fragments of the illusion clung to his chin and around his hair line but this was recognizably the man cal had first confronted in that haunted room in rue street come no further mooney he instructed he was so breathless the words were barely audible and the light from the earth made him look sick i dont want to shed blood he told cal not here there are forces around us that wouldnt take kindly to that cal had stopped running now as he listened to shadwells speech he felt a twitching beneath the soles of his feet and looked down to see shoots springing up between his toes go back mooney said shadwell my destiny isnt with you cal was only halflistening to the salesman the sudden growth beneath his feet intrigued him and he saw now that it spread across the ground following shadwells footsteps to where he stood the barren soil had suddenly produced all manner of plant life which was growing at a phenomenal rate shadwell had seen it too and his voice was hushed as he said creation see that mooney pure creation we shouldnt be here said cal shadwells face carried a lunatic grin you have no place here he said i grant you that but ive waited all my life for this an ambitious plant burst the earth beneath cals foot and he stepped aside to let it grow shadwell read the movement as an attack he opened his jacket for an instant cal thought he was going to try the old trick but his solution was far simpler he pulled a gun from his inside pocket and pointed it at cal like i said i dont want to spill blood so go back mooney go on go on back the way you came or so help me ill blow your brains out he meant it of that cal had not the least doubt raising his hands to chest height he said i hear you im going before he could move however three things happened in quick succession first something flew overhead its passage almost hidden by the clouds that pressed upon the roof of the temple shadwell looked up and cal taking the chance ran at the man reaching to knock the gun from his grip the third event was the shot it seemed to cal he saw the bullet break from the barrel on a plume of smoke saw it cleave the space between the gun and his body it was slow as in a nightmare of execution but he was slower still the bullet hit his shoulder and he was thrown backwards landing amongst flowers that had not existed thirty seconds before he saw droplets of his blood rise over his head as if claimed for the sky he let the puzzle go there was only energy enough to hold onto one problem at a time and he had to make life his priority his hand went to the wound which had shattered his clavicle he put his palm against the hole to stop the blood coming as the pain spread down across his body above him the clouds roiled on thundering or was the clamour he heard only in his head groaning he rolled onto his side to see if he could get a glimpse of what shadwell was up to the pain almost blinded him but he fought to focus on the building up ahead shadwell was entering the temple there was no guard at the threshold just an archway in the brick through which he was disappearing cal inched himself up onto two knees and a hand the other still clamped to his shoulder and from there got to his feet and began to stagger towards the temple door to claim the salesman from his victory what shadwell had told mooney was true he had no wish to shed blood in the gyre the secrets of creation and destruction dwelled here if hed needed confirmation of that fact hed seen it spring up beneath their feet a fabulous fecundity which brought with it the promise of heroic decay that was the nature of any exchange a thing gained a thing lost he a salesman had learned that lesson as a stripling what he sought now was to stand beyond such commerce inviolate that was the condition of gods they had permanence and purpose everlasting they could not be spoiled in their prime nor shown wonders only to have them snatched away they were eternal unchanging and here inside this bald citadel he would join that pantheon it was dark over the threshold no sign here of the shining earth outside just a shadowy passageway its floor walls and ceiling built of the same bare brick without mortar between he advanced a few yards his fingertips running over the wall it was an illusion no doubt but he had a curious sensation walking here that the bricks were grinding upon each other as his first mistress had ground her teeth in her sleep he withdrew his fingers from the walls advancing to the first turn in the passage at the corner a welcome discovery there was a light source somewhere up ahead he would not have to stumble in darkness any further the passage ran for fortyfive yards or so before making another ninetydegree turn again it was the same featureless brick but half way down it he was presented with a second archway and stepping through found himself in an identical corridor but that it was shorter by twice the breadth of the first he followed it the light brightening around one corner and along another bare passage then around a second corridor which again had a door in it now he grasped the architects design the temple was not one building but several set within each other a box containing a slightly smaller box which then contained a third the realization unnerved him the place was like a maze a simple one perhaps but nevertheless designed to confound or delay once again he heard the walls grinding and pictured the whole construction closing in on him and he suddenly unable to find his way out before the walls pressed him to bloody dust but he couldnt turn back now not with the luminescence tempting him to turn one more corner besides there were noises reaching him from the world outside strange disfigured voices as if the inhabitants of some forgotten bestiary were prowling around the temple scraping at the brick padding across the roof he had no choice but to press on hed sold his life away for a glimpse of godhood he had nothing to return to now but the bitterest defeat forward then and to hell with the consequences as cal came within a yard of the temple door his strength gave out he could no longer command his legs to bear him up he stumbled throwing out his right arm to prevent his falling too heavily and hit the ground unconsciousness claimed him and he was grateful for it escape lasted seconds only however before the blackness lifted and he was delivered back into nausea and agony but now and not for the first time in the fugue his bloodstarved brain had lost its grasp on whether he was dreaming or being dreamt that ambiguity had first visited him in lemuel los orchard he remembered waking from a dream of the life hed lived to find himself in a paradise hed only ever expected to encounter in sleep and then later on venus mountain or beneath it living the life of planets and passing a millennium in that revolving state only to wake a mere six hours older now here was the paradox again at deaths door had he awoken to die or was dying true wakefulness round and round the thoughts went in a spiral with darkness at its centre and he fleeing into that darkness wearier by the moment his head on the earth which was trembling beneath him he opened his eyes and looked back towards the temple he saw it upside down the roof sitting in a foundation of clouds while the bright ground shone around it paradox upon paradox he thought as his eyes drifted closed again cal somebody called him cal irritated to be summoned this way he opened his eyes only reluctantly it was suzanna who was bending over him saying his name she had questions too but his lazy mind couldnt grasp them instead he said inside shadwell hold on she told him you understand me she put his hand on her face it was cool then she bent down and kissed him and somewhere at the back of his skull he remembered this happening before his lying on the ground and her giving him love ill be here he said she nodded youd better be she replied and crossed to the door of the temple this time he did not let his eyes close whatever dream waited beyond life he would postpone its pleasure til he saw her face again iii the miracle of the loom outside the temple the quake tremors were worsening inside however an uneasy peace reigned suzanna started to advance down the darkened corridors the itching in her body subdued now that she was out of the turbulence in this the eye of the hurricane there was light ahead she turned a corner and another and finding a door in the wall slipped through into a second passageway as spartan as the one shed left the light was still tantalizingly out of reach around the next corner it promised just a little further a little further the menstruum was quiet inside her as though it feared to show itself was that the natural respect one miracle paid to a greater if so the raptures here were hiding their faces with no little skill there was nothing about these corridors suggestive of revelation or power just bare brick except for the light that coaxed her still through another door and along further passageways the building she now realized was built on the principle of a russian doll one within another worlds within worlds they couldnt diminish infinitely she told herself or could they around the very next corner she had her answer or at least part of it as a shadow was thrown up against the wall and she heard somebody shouting what in gods name for the first time since setting foot here she felt the ground vibrate there was a fall of brick dust from the ceiling shadwell she said as she spoke it seemed she could see the two syllables shad well carried along the corridor towards the next door a fleeting memory came too of jerichau speaking his love to her word as reality the shadow on the wall shifted and suddenly the salesman was standing in front of her all trace of the prophet had gone the face revealed beneath was bloated and pale the face of a beached fish gone he said he was shaking from head to foot sweat droplets decorated his face like pearls its all gone any fear she might once have had of this man had disappeared he was here unmasked as ludicrous but his words made her wonder what had gone she began to walk towards the door hed stepped through it was you he said his shakes worsening you did this i did nothing oh yes as she came within a yard of him he reached for her his clammy hands suddenly about her neck theres nothing there he shrieked pulling her close his grip intended harm but the menstruum didnt rise to her aid she was left with only muscle power to disengage him and it was not enough you want to see he screamed into her face you want to see how ive been cheated ill show you he dragged her towards the door and pitched her through into the room at the heart of the temple the inner sanctum in which the miracles of the gyre had been generated the powerhouse which had held the many worlds of the fugue together for so long it was a room some fifteen feet square built of the same naked brick as the rest of the temple and high she looked up to see that the roof had a skylight of sorts open to the heavens the clouds that swirled around the temple roof shed a milky brightness down as if the lightning from the gyre was being kindled in the womb of troubled air above the clouds were not the only movement overhead however as she gazed up she caught sight of a form in the corner of the roof before her gaze could focus on it shadwell was approaching her where is it he demanded wheres the loom she looked around the sanctum and discovered now that it was not entirely bare in each of the four corners a figure was sitting gazing towards the centre of the room her spine twitched though they sat bolt upright on their highbacked chairs the quartet were long dead their flesh like stained paper on their bones their clothes hanging in rotted rags had these guardians been murdered where they sat so that thieves could remove the loom unchallenged so it seemed yet there was nothing in their posture that suggested a violent death nor could she believe that this charmed place would have sanctioned bloodshed no something else had happened here was happening still perhaps some essential point both she and shadwell could not yet grasp he was still muttering to himself his voice a decaying spiral of complaint she was only halflistening she was far more interested in the object she now saw lying in the middle of the floor there it lay the kitchen knife cal had brought into the auction room all those months ago the commonplace domestic tool which the look between them had somehow drawn into the weave to this very spot the absolute centre of the fugue seeing it pieces of the riddle began to slot together in her head here where the glances of the sentinels intersected lay the knife that another glance between herself and cal had empowered it had entered this chamber and somehow cut the last knot the loom had created and the weave had released its secrets all of which was well and good except that the sentinels were dead and the loom as shadwell kept repeating was gone you were the one he growled you knew all along she ignored his accusations a new thought forming if the magic had gone she reasoned why did the menstruum hide itself as she shaped the question shadwells fury drove him to attack til kill you he yelled his assault caught her unawares and she was flung back against the wall the breath went out of her in a rush and before she could defend herself his thumbs were at her throat his bulk trapping her thieving bitch he said you cheated me she raised her hands to beat him off but she was already growing weak she struggled to draw breath desperate for a mouthful of air even if it was the flatulent breath he was expelling but his grip on her throat prevented so much as a mouthful reaching her im going to die she thought im going to die looking into this curdled face and then her upturned eyes caught a glimpse of movement in the roof and a voice said the loom is here shadwells grip on suzanna relaxed he turned and looked up at the speaker immacolata her arms spread out like a parachutist in freefall was hovering above them do you remember me she asked shadwell jesus christ i missed you shadwell though you were unkind wheres the loom he said tell me there is no loom she replied but you just said the loom is here where then where there is no loom youre out of your mind he yelled up at her either there is or there isnt the incantatrix had a skulls smile as she gazed down on the man below youre the fool she said mildly you dont understand do you shadwell put on a gentler tone why dont you come down he said my neck aches she shook her head it cost her effort to hang in the air that way suzanna could see she was defying the sanctity of the temple by working her raptures here but she flew in the face of such edicts determined to remind shadwell of how earthbound he was afraid are you said shadwell immacolatas smile did not falter im not afraid she said and began to float down towards him keep out of his way suzanna willed her though the incantatrix had done terrible harm suzanna had no desire to see her felled by shadwells mischief but the salesman stood face to face with the woman and made no move he simply said you reached here before me i almost forgot you immacolata replied her voice had lost any trace of stridency it was full of sighs but she reminded me she glanced at suzanna it was a fine service you did me sister she said to remind me of my enemy her eyes went back to shadwell you drove me mad she said and i forgot you but i remember now suddenly the smile and the sighs had gone entirely there was only ruin and rage i remember very well wheres the loom shadwell demanded you were always so literal immacolata replied contemptuously did you really expect to find a thing another object to be possessed is that your godhood shadwell possession where the fuck is it she laughed then though the sound from her throat had nothing to do with pleasure her ridicule pressed shadwell to breaking point he flung himself at her but she was not about to let herself be touched by his hands as he snatched hold of her it seemed to suzanna that her whole ruined face cracked open spilling a force that might once have been the menstruum that cool bright river suzanna had first plunged into at immacolatas behest but was now a damned and polluted stream breaking from the wounds like pus it had force nevertheless shadwell was thrown to the ground overhead the clouds threw lightning across the roof freezing the scene below by its scalpel light the killing blow could only be a glance away surely but it didnt come the incantatrix hesitated the broken face leaking tainted power and in that instant shadwells hand closed on the kitchen knife at his side suzanna cried a warning but immacolata either failed to hear or chose not to then shadwell was on his feet his ungainly rise offering his victim a moment to strike him down which was missed and drove the blade up into her abdomen a butchers stroke which opened a traumatic wound at last she seemed to know he meant her death and responded her face began to blaze afresh but before the spark could become fire shadwells blade was dividing her to the breasts her innards slid from the wound she screamed and threw back her head the unleashed force wasted against the sanctum walls on the instant the room was filled with a roaring that seemed to come from both the bricks and the innards of immacolata shadwell dropped the bloodslicked knife and made to retreat from his crime but his victim reached out and pulled him close the fire had entirely gone from immacolatas face she was dying and quickly but even in her failing moments her grip was strong as the roaring grew louder she granted shadwell the embrace shed always denied him her wound besmirching his jacket he made a cry of repugnance but she wouldnt let him go he struggled and finally succeeded in breaking her hold throwing her off and staggering from her his chest and belly plastered with blood he cast one more look in her direction then started towards the door making small moans of horror as he reached the exit he looked up at suzanna i didnt he began his hands raised blood trickling between his fingers it wasnt me the words were as much appeal as denial it was magic he said tears starting to his eyes not of sorrow she knew but of a sudden righteous rage filthy magic he shrieked the ground rocked to hear its glory denied he didnt wait to have the roof fall on his head but fled from the chamber as the roars rose in intensity suzanna looked back at immacolata despite the grievous wounding shed sustained she was not yet dead she was standing against one of the walls clinging to the brick with one hand and keeping her innards from falling with the other bloods been spilt she said as another tremor more fierce than any that had preceded it unknitted the foundations of the building bloods been spilt in the temple of the loom she smiled that terrible twisted smile the fugues undone sister she said what do you mean i came here intending to spill his blood and bring the gyre down seems its me whos done the bleeding its no matter her voice grew weaker suzanna stepped close to hear her better its all the same in the end the fugue is finished itll be dust all dust she pushed herself off the wall suzanna reached and kept her from falling the contact made her palm tingle theyre exiles forever immacolata said and frail as it was there was triumph in her voice the fugue ends here wiped away as if it had never been at this her legs buckled beneath her pushing suzanna away she stumbled back against the wall her hand slipped from her belly her guts unspooled i used to dream she said terrible emptiness she stopped speaking as she slid down the wall strands of her hair catching on the brick sand and nothingness she said thats what i dreamt sand and nothingness and here it is as if to bear out her remark the din grew cataclysmic satisfied with her labours immacolata sank to the ground suzanna looked towards her escape route as the bricks of the temple began to grind upon each other with fresh ferocity what more could she do here the mysteries of the loom had defeated her if she stayed shed be buried in the ruins there was nothing left to do but get out while she still could as she moved to the door two pencil beams of light sliced through the grimy air and struck her arm their brightness shocked her more shocking still their source they were coming from the eye sockets of one of the sentinels she stepped out of the path of the light and as the beams struck the corpse opposite lights flared there too then in the third sentinels head and the fourth these events werent lost on immacolata the loom she whispered her breath failing the intersecting beams were brightening and the fraught air was soothed by the sound of voices softly murmuring words so unfixable they were almost music youre too late said the incantatrix her comment made not to suzanna but to the dead quartet you cant save it now her head began to slip forward too late she said again then a shudder went through her the body vacated by spirit keeled over she lay dead in her blood despite her dying words the power here was still building suzanna backed towards the door to clear the beams route completely with nothing to bar their way they immediately redoubled their brilliance and from the point of collision threw up new beams at every angle the whispering that filled the chamber suddenly found a fresh rhythm the words though still alien to her ran like a melodious poem somehow they and the light were part of one system the raptures of the four families aia lo yeme and babu working together word music accompanying a woven dance of light this was the loom of course this was the loom no wonder immacolata had poured scorn on shadwells literalism magic might be bestowed upon the physical but it didnt reside there it resided in the word which was mind spoken and in motion which was mind made manifest in the system of the weave and the evocations of the melody all mind yet damn it this recognition was not enough finally she was still only a cuckoo and all the puzzlesolving in the world wouldnt help her mellow the rage of this desecrated place all she could do was watch the looms wrath shake the fugue and all it contained apart in her frustration her thoughts went to mimi who had brought her into this adventure but had died too soon to entirely prepare her for it surely even she would not have predicted this the fugues failing and suzanna at its heart unable to keep it beating the lights were still colliding and multiplying the beams growing so solid now she might have walked upon them their performances transfixed her she felt she could watch them forever and never tire of their complexities and still they grew more elaborate more solid until she was certain they would not be bound within the walls of the sanctum but would burst out into the fugue where she had to go out to where cal was lying to comfort him as best she could in the imminent maelstrom with this thought came another that perhaps mimi had known or feared that in the end it would simply be suzanna and the magic and that maybe the old woman had after all left a signpost she reached into her pocket and brought out the book secrets of the hidden peoples she didnt need to open the book to remember the epigraph on the dedication page what can be imagined need never be lost shed tussled with its meaning repeatedly but her intellect had failed to make much sense of it now she forsook her analytical thinking and let subtler sensibilities take over the light of the loom was so bright it hurt her eyes and as she stepped out of the sanctum she discovered that the beams were exploiting chinks in the brick either that or eating at the wall and breaking through needlethin lines of light stratified the passageway her thoughts as much on the book in her hand as on her safety she made her way back via the route shed come door and passageway door and passageway even the outer layers of corridor were not immune to the looms glamour the beams had broken through three solid walls and were growing wider with every moment as she walked through them she felt the menstruum stir in her for the first time since shed entered the gyre it rose not to her face however but through her arms and into her hands which clasped the book as though charging it what can be imagined the chanting rose the lightbeams multiplied need never be lost the book grew heavier warmer like a living thing in her arms and yet so full of dreams a thing of ink and paper in which another world awaited release not one world perhaps but many for as she and hobarts time in the pages had proved each adventurer reimagined the stories for themselves there were as many wild woods as there were readers to wander there she was out into the third corridor now and the whole temple had become a hive of light and sound there was so much energy here waiting to be channelled if she could only be the catalyst that turned its strength to better ends than destruction her head was full of images or fragments thereof she and hobart in the forest of their story exchanging skins and fictions she and cal in the auction room their glance the engine that turned the knife above the weave and finally the sentinels sitting in the loom chamber eight eyes that had even in death the power to unmake the weave and make it again suddenly she wasnt walking any longer she was running not for fear that the roof would come down on her head but because the final pieces of the puzzle were coming clear and she had so little time redeeming the fugue could not be done alone of course not no rapture could be performed alone their essence was in exchange that was why the families sang and danced and wove their magic blossomed between people between performer and spectator maker and admirer and wasnt there rapture at work between her mind and the mind in the book she held her eyes scanning the page and soaking up another souls dreams it was like love or rather love was its highest form mind shaping mind visions pirouetting on the threads between lovers calshe was at the last door and flinging herself into the turmoil beyond the light in the earth had turned to the colour of bruises blueblack and purple the sky above writhed ripe to discharge its innards from the music and the exquisite geometry of light inside the temple she was suddenly in bedlam cal was propped against the wall of the temple his face was white but he was alive she went to him and knelt by his side whats happening he said his voice lazy with exhaustion ive no time to explain she said her hand stroking his face the menstruum played against his cheek you have to trust me yes he said good you have to think for me cal think of everything you remember remember as he puzzled at her a crack fully a foot wide opened in the earth running from the threshold of the temple like a messenger the news it carried was all grim seeing it doubts filled suzanna how could anything be claimed from this chaos the sky shed thunder dust and dirt were flung up from the crevasses that gaped on every side she endeavoured to hold onto the comprehension shed found in the corridors behind her tried to keep the images of the loom in her head the beams intersecting thought over and under thought minds filling the void with shared memories and shared dreams think of everything you remember about the fugue she said everything everything all the places youve seen why trust me she said please god cal trust me what do you remember just bits and pieces whatever you can find every little piece she pressed her palm to his face he was feverish but the book in her other hand was hotter in recent times shed shared intimacies with her greatest enemy hobart surely she could share knowledge with this man whose sweetness shed come to love please she said for you he replied seeming to know at last all she felt for him anything and the thoughts came she felt them flow into her and through her she was a conduit the menstruum the stream on which his memories were carried her minds eye saw glimpses only of what hed seen and felt here in the fugue but they were things fine and beautiful an orchard firelight fruit people dancing singing a road a field de bono and the ropedancers the firmament a rickshaw a house with a man standing on the step a mountain and planets most of it came too fast for her to focus upon but her comprehension of what hed seen wasnt the point she was just part of a cycle as shed been in the auction room behind her she felt the beams breaking through the last wall as though the loom was coming to meet her its genius for transfiguration momentarily at her disposal they hadnt got long if she missed this wave thered be no other go on she said to cal he had his eyes closed now and the images were still pouring out of him hed remembered more than shed dared hope and she in her turn was adding sights and sounds to the flow the lake capras house the forest the streets of nonesuch they came back razor sharp and she felt the beams pick them up and speed them on their way shed feared the loom would reject her interference but not at all it married its power to that of the menstruum transforming all that she and cal were remembering she had no control over these processes they were beyond her grasp all she could do was be a part of the exchange between meaning and magic and trust that the forces at work here comprehended her intentions better than she did but the power behind her was growing too strong for her she could not channel its energies much longer the book was getting too hot to hold and cal was shuddering beneath her hand enough she said cals eyes flew open i havent finished enough i said as she spoke the structure of the temple began to shudder cal said oh god time to go said suzanna can you walk of course i can walk she helped him to his feet there were roars from within as one after another the walls capitulated to the rage of the loom they didnt wait to watch the final cataclysm but started away from the temple brickshards whining past their heads cal was as good as his word he could indeed walk albeit slowly but running would have been impossible in the wasteland they were now obliged to cross as creation had been the touchstone of the outward journey wholesale destruction marked their return the flora and fauna that had sprung into being in the footsteps of the trespassers were now suffering a swift dissolution flowers and trees were withering the stench of their rot carried on the hooligan winds that scoured the gyre with the earthlight dimmed the scene was murky the gloom further thickened by dust and airborne matter from the darkness animal cries rose as the earth opened and consumed the very creatures it had produced mere minutes before those not devoured by the bed from which theyd sprung were subject to a fate still more terrible as the powers that had made them unknitted their children pale skeletal things that had once been bright and alive now littered the landscape breathing their last some turned their eyes up to cal and suzanna looking for hope or help but they had none to offer it was as much as they could do to keep the cracks in the earth from claiming them too they stumbled on arms about each other heads bowed beneath a barrage of hailstones which the mantle as though to perfect their misery had unleashed how far cal said they halted and suzanna stared ahead she could not be certain they were not simply walking in circles the light at their feet was now all but extinguished here and there it flared up but only to illuminate another pitiable scene the last wracking moments of the glory that their presence here had engendered then there she said pointing through the curtain of hail and dust i see a light they set off again as fast as the suppurating earth would allow with every step their feet sank deeper into a swamp of decaying matter in which the remnants of life still moved the inheritors of this eden worms and cockroaches but there was a distinct light at the end of the tunnel she glimpsed it again through the thick air look up cal she said he did just that though only with effort not far now a few more steps he was becoming heavier by the moment but the tear in the mantle was sufficient to spur them on over the last few yards of treacherous earth and finally they stepped out into the light almost spat from the entrails of the gyre as it went into its final convulsions they stumbled away from the mantle but not far before cal said i cant and fell to the ground she knelt beside him cradling his head then looked around for help only then did she see the consequences of events in the gyre wonderland had gone the glories of the fugue had been shredded and torn their tatters evaporating even as she watched water wood and stone living animal tissue and dead seerkind all gone as though it had never been a few remnants lingered but not for long as the gyre thundered and shook these last signs of the fugues terrain became smoke and threads then empty air it was horribly quick suzanna looked behind her the mantle was receding too now that it had nothing left to conceal its retreat uncovering a wasteland of dirt and fractured rock even its thunder was diminishing suzanna she looked back to see de bono coming towards her what happened in there later she said first we have to get help for cal hes been shot ill fetch a car cals eyes flickered open is it gone he murmured dont think about it now she said i want to know he demanded with surprising vehemence and struggled to sit up knowing he wouldnt be placated suzanna helped him he moaned seeing the desolation before them groups of seerkind with a few of hobarts people scattered amongst them stood in the valley and up the slopes of the surrounding hills neither speaking nor moving they were all that remained what about shadwell said cal suzanna shrugged i dont know she said he escaped the temple before me the din of a revved carengine cancelled further conversation as de bono drove one of the invaders vehicles across the dead grass bringing it to a halt a few feet from where cal lay ill drive said suzanna once cal had been laid on the back seat what do we tell the doctors cal said his voice getting fainter ive got a bullet in me well cross that bridge when we come to it said suzanna as she got into the drivers seat which de bono had only reluctantly vacated somebody called her name nimrod was running towards the car where are you going he said to her she directed his attention to the passenger my friend he said seeing cal you look the worse for wear he tried a smile of welcome but tears came instead its over he said sobbing destroyed our sweet land he wiped his eyes and nose with the back of his hand what do we do now he said to suzanna we get out of harms way she told him as quickly as we can we still have enemies it doesnt matter any more he said the fugues gone everything we ever possessed lost were alive arent we she said as long as were alive where will we go well find a place you have to lead us now said nimrod theres only you later first we have to help cal yes he said of course hed taken hold of her arm and was loath to let her go you will come back of course she said til take the rest of them north he told her two valleys from here well wait for you there then move she said times wasting you will remember he said she would have laughed his doubts off but that remembering was all instead she touched his wet face letting him feel the menstruum in her fingers it was only as she drove away that she realized shed probably blessed him iv shadwell the salesman had fled the gyre as the first dissolution began in the fugue outside his escape had therefore not only gone unchallenged but unseen with the fabric of their homeland corning apart on every side nobody paid the least attention to the shabby bloodstained figure that stumbled away through the mayhem once only was he obliged to stop and find a place in the chaos where he could give vent to his nausea the vomit splattered his oncefine shoes and he spent a further moment cleaning them with a handful of leaves which began to evaporate in his hands even as he put them to the task magic how it revolted him now the fugue had enticed him with its promises it had flaunted its socalled enchantments in front of him until he poor cuckoo that he was had been blinded to all sense then it had led him a merry dance made him dress in borrowed skin made him deceive and manipulate all for love of its lies and lies they were he saw that now even as hed reached to embrace his prize it had evaporated denying him ownership and leaving him to look like the guilty party the fact that it had taken him so long to see how hed been used however was proof positive of his innocence in all of this hed intended no harm to any living thing hed wanted only to bring truth and stability into a place sorely deficient in both for his pains hed been cheated and connived against what could history accuse him of then other than naivete a forgivable sin no the true villains in this tragedy were the seerkind the wielders of rapture and unreason they it was whod twisted his benign ambition out of true and so invited these horrors upon them all a grim spiral of destruction that had ended in the gyre with him a victim of circumstance driven to murder he made his way out through the decaying fugue and began to climb up from the valley the wind was cleaner on the slopes and it shamed him he stank of fear and frustration while it smelt of the sea inhaling it he knew that in such cleanliness lay his only hope for sanity disgusted by his condition he pulled off his bloodied jacket it was excrement corrupted and corrupting in accepting it from the incantatrix hed made his first error from that all subsequent misdirections had sprung in his repugnance he tried to tear at the lining but it resisted his strength so he simply bundled the jacket up and threw it high into the air it rose a little way then fell again tumbling down a rocky slope its passage starting a minor avalanche of pebbles and came to rest spreadeagled like a legless suicide at last it was where it had belonged from the start in the dirt the seerkind belonged with it he thought but they were survivors deception was in their blood though their territories had been destroyed he didnt put it past them to have another trick or two up their sleeves as long as they lived these defilers he would not rest easy in his bed theyd made a fool and a butcher of him and there was no health for him now until every last one of them was laid low standing on the hill looking down into the valley below he felt a breath of new purpose hed been tricked and humiliated but he was at least alive the battle was not yet over they had an enemy these monsters immacolata had dreamt of it often and spoken of the wilderness where it resided the scourge shed called it if he was to destroy the seerkind he would need an ally and what better than that nameless power from which theyd hidden an age ago they could never hide again they had no land to conceal themselves in if he could find this scourge and wake it from its wilderness it and he would cleanse them at a stroke the scourge he liked the sound of the word mightily but hed like better the silence that would come when his enemies were ash v a fragile peace cal was happy to sleep for a while happy to be at ease in the embrace of gentle hands and gentle words the nurses came and went a doctor too smiling down at him and telling him all would be well while de bono at the mans side nodded and smiled a night later he woke to find suzanna with him in the room mouthing words which he was too weary to hear he slept happy that she was near but when he woke again shed gone he asked after her and after de bono too and was told that theyd be back and that he wasnt to concern himself sleep the nurse told him sleep and when you wake all will be well he vaguely knew this advice had failed someone he knew and loved but his drugged mind couldnt quite remember who so he did as he was told it was a sleep rich with dreams in many of which he had a starring role though not always wearing his own skin sometimes he was a bird sometimes a tree his branches laden with fruits each of which were like little worlds sometimes he was the wind or like the wind and ran unseen but strong over landscapes made of upturned faces rock faces flower faces and streams in which he knew every silver fish by name and sometimes he dreamt he was dead was floating in an infinite ocean of black milk while presences invisible but mighty distressed the stars above him and threw them down in long arcs that sang as they fell comfortable as it was this death he knew he was only dreaming it indulging his fatigue the time would come soon when hed have to wake again when he did nimrod was by his bed you neednt worry he told cal they wont ask you any questions cals tongue was sluggish but he managed to say how did you do that a little rapture nimrod said unsmiling i can still manage the occasional deceiving how are things bad came the reply everyones grieving im not a public griever myself so im not very popular and suzanna he made an equivocal look i like the woman myself he said but shes having problems with the families when theyre not grieving theyre arguing amongst themselves i get sick of the din sometimes i think ill go find marguerite forget i was ever seerkind you cant you watch me its no use being sentimental cal the fugues gone once and for all we may as well make the best of it join the cuckoos let bygones be bygones good god we wont even be noticed theres stranger things than us in the kingdom these days he pointed to the television in the corner of the room every time i turn it on something new something different i might even go to america he slipped off his sunglasses cal had forgotten how extraordinary his eyes were hollywood could use a man with my attributes he said despite nimrods quiet despair cal couldnt help but smile at this and indeed perhaps the man was right perhaps the seerkind had no choice now but to enter the kingdom and make whatever peace they could with it i must go he was saying theres a big meeting tonight everyone has a right to have their say well be talking all night most likely he went to the door i wont go to california without saying goodbye he remarked and left the patient alone two days passed and nobody came cal was getting better quickly and it seemed that whatever rapture nimrod had worked on the staff had indeed diverted them from making any report of their patients wound to the police by the afternoon of the third day cal knew he was much improved because he was getting restless the television nimrods new love could provide only soap opera and a bad movie the latter the lesser of the two banalities was playing when the door opened and a woman dressed in black stepped into the room it took cal a moment before he recognized his visitor as apolline before he could offer a welcome she said no time to talk calhoun and approaching the bed thrust a parcel at cal take it she said he did so i have to be away quickly she went on her face softened as she gazed at him you look tired my boy she said take a holiday and with that advice retreated to the door wait he called after her no time no time she said and was away he took the string and brown paper from around his present and discovered inside the book of faerytales which suzanna had found in rue street with it there was a scrawled note cal it read keep hold of this for me will you never let it out of your sight our enemies are still with us when the time is safe ill find you do this for us all im kissing you suzanna he read the letter over and over moved beyond telling by the way shed signed off im kissing you but he was confounded by her instructions the book seemed an unremarkable volume its binding torn its pages yellowed the text was in german which he had no command of whatsoever even the illustrations were dark and full of shadows and hed had enough shadows to hurt him a lifetime but if she wanted him to keep it safe then hed do so she was wise and he knew better than to take her instructions lightly after the visit from apolline nobody else came he was not altogether surprised thered been an urgency in the womans manner and yet more in the letter from suzanna our enemies are still with us shed written if she wrote that then it was true they discharged him after a week and he made his way back to liverpool little had changed the grass still refused to grow in the churned earth where lilia pellicia had died the trains still ran north and south the china dogs on the diningroom sill still looked for their master their vigil rewarded only with dust there was dust too on the note that geraldine had left on the kitchen table a brief missive saying that until cal learned to behave like a reasonable human being he could expect none of her company there were several other letters awaiting him one from his section leader at the firm asking him where the hell he was and stating that if he wished to keep his job hed better make some explanation of his absence post haste the letter was dated the llth it was now the th cal presumed he was out of a job he couldnt find it in him to be much concerned by unemployment nor indeed by geraldines absence he wanted to be alone wanted the time to think through all that had happened more significantly he found feelings about anything hard to come by as the days passed and he made a stab at reassembling his life he rapidly came to see that his time in the gyre had left him wounded in more ways than one it was as though the forces unleashed at the temple had found their way into him and left a little wilderness where thered once been a capacity for tears and regret even the poet was silent though cal could still remember mad mooneys verses by heart they were just sounds to him now they failed to move there was one comfort in this that perhaps his newfound stoicism suited better the function of solitary librarian he would be vigilant but he would anticipate nothing neither disaster nor revelation that was not to say he would give up looking to the future true he was just a cuckoo scared and weary and alone but so in the end were most of his tribe it didnt mean all was lost as long as they could still be moved by a minor chord or brought to a crisis of tears by scenes of lovers reunited as long as there was room in their cautious hearts for games of chance and laughter in the face of god that must surely be enough to save them at the last if not there was no hope for any living thing book three out of the empty quarter part ten the search for the scourge if you gaze for long into an abyss the abyss gazes also into you friedrich nietzsche beyond good and evil i no rest for the wicked before the explorers the rub al khali had been a blank space on the map of the world after them it remained so its very name given to it by the bedu the desert nomads whod lived for unnumbered centuries in the deserts of the arab peninsula meant the empty quarter that they familiar with wildernesses that would drive most men insane should designate this place empty was the most profound testament to its nullity imaginable but amongst those europeans for whom names were not proof enough and who had from the beginning of the nineteenth century gone looking for places to test their mettle the rub al khali rapidly acquired legendary status it was perhaps the single greatest challenge the earth could offer to adventurers its barrenness unrivalled by any wasteland equatorial or arctic nothing lived there nor could it was simply a vast nowhere two hundred and fifty thousand square miles of desolation its dunes rising in places to the height of small mountains and elsewhere giving way to tracts of heatshattered stone large enough to lose a people in it was trackless waterless and changeless most who dared its wastes were swallowed by it its dust increased by the sum of their powdered bones but for that breed of man as much ascetic as explorer who was half in love with losing himself to such an end the number of expeditions that had retreated in the face of the quarters maddening absence or disappeared into it was simply a spur some challenged the wasteland in the name of cartology determined to map the place for those who might come after them only to discover that there was nothing to map but the chastening of their spirit others went looking for lost tombs and cities where fabled wealth awaited that man strong enough to reach into hell and snatch it out still others a patient secretive few went in the name of academe seeking verification of theories geological or historical still others looked for the ark there or eden all had this in common that if they returned from the empty quarter even though their journey might have taken them only a days ride into that place they came back changed men nobody could set his eyes on such a void and return to hearth and home without having lost a part of himself to the wilderness forever many having endured the void once went back and back again as if daring the desert to claim them not content until it did and those unhappy few who died at home died with their eyes not on the loving faces at their bedside nor on the cherry tree in blossom outside the window but on that waste that called them as only the abyss can call promising the soul the balm of nothingness for years shadwell had listened to immacolata speak of the emptiness where the scourge resided mostly shed talked of it in abstract terms a place of sand and terror though hed comforted her in her fear as best hed known how hed soon stopped listening to her babble but standing on the hill overlooking the valley which the fugue had once occupied blood on his hands and hatred in his heart her words had come back to him in subsequent months hed set himself the task of discovering that place for himself he had chanced on pictures of the rub al khali early in his investigations and had quickly come to believe that this was the wasteland shed seen in her prophetic dreams even now in the latter portion of the century it remained largely a mystery commercial aircraft routes still gave it wide berth and though a road now crossed it the desert swallowed the efforts of any who attempted to exploit its spaces shadwells problem was therefore this if indeed the scourge did live somewhere in the empty quarter how would he be able to find it in a void so vast he began by consulting the experts in particular an explorer called emerson who had twice crossed the quarter by camel he was now a withered and bedbound old man who was at first contemptuous of shadwells ignorance but after a few minutes talk he warmed to the obsessive in his visitor and offered much good advice when he spoke of the desert it was as of a lover whod left stripes upon his back yet whose cruelty he ached to have again as they parted he said i envy you shadwell god alive i envy you though emerson had told him that the desert was always a solitary experience shadwell did not go alone to the rub al khali he took hobart with him the law no longer called hobart as it had an investigation into the events that had all but destroyed his division had found him criminally negligent he might well have been imprisoned but that his masters concluded he was unbalanced indeed probably always had been and that exposing a system that would employ such a madman to the scrutiny of a court case would cover none of them in glory instead a complete story was fabricated which made heroes of those men whod gone into the fugue with hobart and died there and retired on full pay those whod emerged with their sanity in tatters there was a valiant attempt by several bereaved wives to discredit this fiction but when hints of the real explanation were uncovered it seemed infinitely more unlikely than the lie nor were the survivors able to give any coherent account of what theyd experienced those few details they did unburden themselves of merely served to confirm their lunacy hobart however did not have madness as a place of retreat having been in its hold for years the vision of fire that shadwell had given him and which had first claimed him for the salesmans faction obsessed him still despite the fact that the coat had been discarded knowing that in shadwells company his obsession would not be mocked hobart elected to remain there with shadwell his dreams had come closest to being realized and though their shared ambitions had been defeated the man still spoke a language hobarts dementia understood when the salesman talked of the scourge hobart knew it could only be the dragon of his dreams by another name once he halfremembered hed sought that monster in a forest but hed found only confusion there it had been a sham that dragon not the true beast he still longed to meet he knew where that legend waited now not in a forest but a desert where its breath had reduced all living matter to ash and sand they went together therefore to a village on the southern fringe of the quarter a place so inconsequential it couldnt even lay claim to a name here they were obliged to leave their jeep and with their driver as interpreter pick up guides and camels it was not simply the practical problems of crossing the quarter by vehicle that made shadwell forsake wheel for hooves it was a desire encouraged by emerson to be as much a part of the desert as was possible to go into that void not as conquerors but as penitents locating their two guides for the expedition was the business of an hour no more there being so few either willing or ablebodied enough to make the journey both men were of am murra tribe who alone of all the tribes claimed spiritual kinship with the quarter the first a fellow called mitrak ibn talaq shadwell chose because he boasted that hed guided white men into the rub al khali on four previous occasions but he would not go without the company of a younger man by the name of jabir whom he variously described as his cousin halfcousin and brotherinlaw this other looked to be little more than fifteen but had the scrawny strength and the worldlywise glance of a man three times that age hobart was left to haggle with them though the terms of the arrangements took some time to sort out as the arabic hed learned for this expedition was primitive and the arabs english was bad they seemed to know their profession however the purchase of camels was the business of half a day the purchasing of supplies another morning it was therefore the labour of a mere fortyeight hours to prepare for the crossing on the day of their departure however shadwell whose fastidiousness had not kept him from satisfying his belly fell foul of an intestinal plague that turned his innards to water with his gut in revolt he couldnt keep a morsel of food in his system long enough to profit by it and he quickly became weak wracked by fever and with access only to the most rudimentary medication all he could do was take refuge in the hovel theyd hired find the corner where the sun couldnt reach him and there sweat the sickness out two days passed without his improving he was not used to illness but on those few occasions he had fallen sick hed always hidden himself away and suffered in private here privacy was nearly impossible to find all day he could hear scrabblings outside the door and window as people fought for a chance to peer through the cracks at the infidel moaning on his filthy sheet and when the locals grew tired of the spectacle there were still the flies watching over him thirsty for the tainted waters at his lips and eyes hed long since learned the hopelessness of shooing them away he simply lay in his sweat and let them drink his fevered mind drifting off to cooler places on the third day hobart suggested they postpone the journey pay off ibn talaq and jabir and return to civilization there shadwell could regain his strength for another try shadwell protested at this but the same thought had crept into his own head more than once when the infection finally left his body hed be in no fit state to dare the quarter that night however things changed for one there was a wind it came not in gusts but as a steady assault the sand it carried creeping in beneath the door and through the cracks in the window shadwell had slept a little during the preceding day and had benefited from his rest but the wind prevented him from settling now the disturbance got into his gut too obliging him to spend half the night squatting over the bucket hed been provided with while his bowels gave vent that was where he was squatting in misery in a cloud of flatulence when he first heard the voice it came out of the desert rising and falling like the wail of some infernal widow hed never heard its like he stood up soiling his legs in doing so his body wracked with shudders it was the scourge he was hearing he had no doubt the sound was muted but indisputable a voice of grief and power and summoning it offered them a signpost they would not have to go blindly into the wilderness hoping luck would bring them to their destination theyd follow the route the wind had come sooner or later wouldnt it lead them to the creature whose voice it carried he hoisted up his trousers and opened the door the wind was running wild through the tiny town depositing sand wherever it went whining at the houses like a rabid dog he listened again for the voice of the scourge praying that it was not some hallucination brought on by his hunger it was not it came again the same anguished howl one of the villagers hurried past the spot where shadwell stood the salesman stepped out of the doorway and took the mans arm you hear he said the man turned his scarred face towards shadwell one of his eyes was missing hear said shadwell pointing to his head as the sound came again the man shook off shadwells grip alhiyal the man replied practically spitting the words out huh al hiyal he said again backing away from shadwell as from a dangerous idiot his hand at the knife in his belt shadwell had no argument with the man he raised his hands smiling and left him to his troubles a curious exhilaration had seized hold of him making his starved brain sing theyd go tomorrow into the quarter and damn his intestines to hell as long as he could stay upright on a saddle he could make the journey he stood in the middle of the squalid street his heart pounding like a jackhammer his legs trembling i hear you he said and the wind took the words from his lips as if by some perverse genius known only to desert winds it could return the way it had come and deliver shadwells words back to the power that awaited him in the void ii oblivion nothing neither in the books hed read nor the testimonies hed listened to nor even in the tormented voice hed heard on the wind the previous night had prepared shadwell for the utter desolation of the rub al khali the books had described its wastes as best words could but they couldnt evoke the terrible nullity of the place even emerson whose mixture of understatement and passion had been persuasive in the extreme hadnt come near to touching upon the blank truth the journey was hour upon relentless hour upon relentless hour of heat and bare horizons the same imbecile sky overhead the same dead ground beneath the camels feet shadwell had no energy to waste on conversation and hobart had always been a silent man as for ibn talaq and the boy they rode ahead of the infidels occasionally whispering but mostly keeping their counsel with nothing to divert the attention the mind turned to the body for its subject and rapidly became obsessed with sensation the rhythm of the thighs as they chafed against the saddle or the taste of the blood from the lips and gums these were thoughts only fodder even speculation about what might lie at this journeys end was lost in the dull blur of discomfort seventytwo hours passed without incident only the same curdling heat the same rhythm of hoof on sand hoof on sand as they followed the bearing of the wind on which the scourges voice had come neither of the arabs made any enquiry as to the infidels purpose nor was any explanation offered they simply marched the void pressing upon them from all sides it was worse by far when they stopped either to rest the camels or to offer their sandclogged throats a dribble of water then the sheer immensity of the silence came home to them existence here was an irrational act in defiance of all physical imperatives what kind of creature had chosen to make its home in such an absence shadwell wondered at such moments and what force of will must it possess to withstand the void unless and this thought came more and more it was of the void a part of the emptiness and silence that possibility made his belly churn that the power he sought belonged here chose dunes for its bed and rock for its pillow he finally began to understand why immacolatas visions of the scourge had brought sweat to her brow in those nightmares she had tasted a terrible purity one that had made her own pale by its light but he was not afraid except of failing until he stepped into the presence of that creature until he learned the source of its cleanliness he could not be cleansed himself that he longed for above all things and as the night fell on their fourth day in the quarter that desire came still closer to being realized jabir had just set the fire when the voice came again there was little wind tonight but it rose with the same solemn authority as before tainting the air with its tragedy ibn talaq whod been cleaning his rifle was the first to his feet his eyes wide and wild either an oath or a prayer on his lips hobart was on his feet seconds later while jabir went to soothe the camels who had panicked at the sound and were tearing at their tethers only shadwell stayed beside the fire gazing into the flames as the howl sustained as if on one monumental breath filled the night it seemed to go on for minutes before it finally died away when it did it left the animals muttering and the men silent ibn talaq was first back to the fire and the business of riflecleaning the boy followed finally hobart too were not alone said shadwell after a time his gaze still on the flames what was it said jabir al hiyal ibn talaq said the boy pulled a face what is al hiyal shadwell said they mean the noise the sand makes hobart said the sand said shadwell you think that was the sand the boy shook his head of course not said shadwell thats the voice of the one weve come to meet jabir threw a handful of bonewhite sticks onto the fire it devoured them immediately do you understand shadwell asked ibn talaq looked up from his work and stared at shadwell they understand said hobart i thought maybe theyd lose their nerve ibn talaq seemed to sense the implication of this remark rub al khali he said we know all of it we know shadwell grasped the point they were murra their tribe laid claim to this territory as its own to retreat before the mysteries of the empty quarter would be tantamount to disinheritance how close are we said hobart i dont know shadwell replied you heard it the same as me perhaps very near do you think it knows were here said hobart perhaps said shadwell does it matter i suppose not if it doesnt know tonight it will by tomorrow they set out at dawn the next day to cover as much distance as they could before the sun mounted too high following the same bearing as theyd followed on the previous four days for the first time in their journey the landscape they were crossing showed some subtle change as the rhythmical rise and fall of the dunes gave way to much larger irregular rises the sand of these hills was soft and collapsed in sibilant avalanches beneath the feet of animal and human alike nobody could ride the travellers coaxed the animals still jittery after the night before up the ever steeper slopes with curses and kindness in equal measure only to reach the top and find a yet larger dune ahead of them without any words being exchanged ibn talaq had relinquished his position at the head of the quartet and it was shadwell who now set the pace leading the party up the faces of the dunes and down into the troughs between there the subtlest of winds blew more distressing in its ingratiating way than any storm for it seemed to whisper as it ran over the sand its message just beyond the reach of comprehension shadwell knew what words it carried however climb it said climb if you dare one more hill and youll find all you ever wanted waiting and with its coaxing hed lead the way up the next slope out of the cool shadow and into the blinding sunlight they were close shadwell knew very close though in the early afternoon jabir began to complain demanding that they rest the animals shadwell would have none of it he forced the pace his mind divided from his bodys discomfort almost floating sweat was nothing pain was nothing all of it could be endured and then at the top of a dune it had taken the better part of an hour to climb the murmurs in the wind were confirmed they had left the dunes behind them ahead the terrain was absolutely flat as far as the eye could see though that wasnt many miles for the wind carried a cargo of sand that veiled the horizon like smoke even in the rub al khali this wasteland was a new refinement of desolation a connoisseurs nowhere god almighty said hobart as he climbed to where shadwell stood the salesman took hold of hobarts arm his breath was rapid and rasping his sunskinned face dripped sweat dont let me fall he murmured were close now why dont we wait awhile before going any farther said hobart maybe rest until tomorrow dont you want to meet your dragon shadwell asked hobart said nothing to this then ill go alone was shadwells response he dropped the camels reins and began to stagger down the slope to meet the plain hobart scanned the sterility before him what shadwell said was true they were close he felt it and that thought which days ago had excited him now put a terror into him hed seen enough of the quarter to know that the dragon that occupied it was not the glittering monster of his dreams it defied his imagination to conjure the terror that nested in such a place but one thing he knew it would care not at all for the law or its keepers he might turn from it still he thought if he were resolute persuade the guides that shadwell was leading them to extinction and that theyd all be wiser leaving the salesman to his insanity already shadwell was at the bottom of the slope and marching away from the dune not even bothering to glance behind him to see that the rest were following let him go a part of hobart said let him have his scourge if thats what he wants and death too but fearful as he was he couldnt quite bring himself to turn his back on the wasteland his mind which was narrowed now to a tunnel showed him again his hands alive with an unconsuming flame in that rare moment of vision hed tasted power hed never quite been able to put words to and nothing his subsequent experience had brought the defeats and humiliations could extinguish the memory somewhere far from here those whod defeated him whod perverted the laws of the real and the righteous still lived to go back amongst them with fire at his fingertips and lay their wretched heads low that was an ambition worth enduring the wasteland for dreaming of flame he took up the reins of shadwells camel and followed in the salesmans footsteps down onto the mirrorbright sand iii the wall distance was impossible to judge on the plain they now crossed the dunes at their backs were soon obscured by the sandthickened air and ahead the same veil shut the vista from sight though the wind was insistent it did nothing to alleviate the assault of the sun it merely added misery to misery dragging at the legs until every step was a torment but nothing slowed shadwell he marched like a man possessed until after an hour of this inferno he stopped dead and pointed through the blur of heat and wind there he said hobart whod come abreast of him narrowed his dazzled eyes and followed the direction of shadwells finger but the sand clouds defied his scrutiny nothing he said shadwell seized hold of his arm damn you look and this time hobart realized shadwell was not deceived some distance from where they stood the ground seemed to rise up again what is it hobart shouted against the wind a wall shadwell said it looked more like a range of hills than a wall hobart thought for it ran along the entire visible horizon yet though there were breaks in its length here and there its regularity suggested shadwells judgement was correct it was indeed a wall without further exchange they began the march towards it there was no sign of any structure rising on the far side but its builders must have valued whatever it had been made to enclose and protect for with every yard they drew closer its sheer scale became awesomely apparent it rose fifty feet or more above the desert floor yet such was the skill of the masons there was no visible sign of how it had been constructed twenty yards from the wall the party halted leaving shadwell to approach it unaccompanied he stretched his hand out to touch the stone which was hot beneath his fingertips its surface so smooth it was almost silken it was as if the wall had been raised out of molten rock shaped by intelligences that could mould lava like cold clay clearly there was no practical way of scaling a surface so innocent of niche or scar even if any of them had possessed the energy to do so there must be a gate said shadwell well walk til we find it the sun was well past its peak now the day beginning to cool but the wind was not about to give the travellers a moments respite it seemed to be keeping guard along the wall lashing at their legs as though eager to throw them to the ground but having got so far without being slaughtered the partys fears had been replaced by curiosity as to what lay on the other side the arabs had found their voices again and kept up a constant dialogue doubtless planning how theyd boast of their find once home they walked for fully half an hour the wall unbroken there were places where cracks had appeared in it though none low enough to offer handholds and others where the top edge showed signs of crumbling but there was neither window nor gate in its length however small who built this said hobart as they walked shadwell was watching their shadow on the wall as it kept pace with them ancients he said to keep the desert out or keep the scourge in the last few minutes had brought a subtle change in the wind it had given up nipping at their legs and gone about braver business it was ibn talaq who first spotted what there there he said and pointed along the wall a few hundred yards from where they stood a stream of sand was being carried out through the wall bellowing as it went as they approached it became apparent that this was not a gate but a breach in the wall the stone had been thrown down in heaps of rubble shadwell was first to reach the scattered pieces many the size of small houses and began to scramble up over them until at last he looked down into the place the walls had been raised to guard behind him hobart called what do you see shadwell didnt speak he simply surveyed the scene behind the wall with disbelieving eyes as the wind that roared through the breach threatened to throw him from his perch there were neither palaces nor tombs on the other side of the wall indeed there was no sign however vestigial of habitation no obelisks no colonnades there was only sand and more sand endless sand another desert rolling away from them as empty as the void at their backs nothing it wasnt shadwell who spoke but hobart he too had scaled the boulders and stood at shadwells side oh jesus nothing shadwell made no reply he simply clambered down the other side of the breach and stepped into the shadow of the wall what hobart said appeared to be true there was nothing here why then did he feel certain that this place was somehow sacred he walked through the mire of sand that the wind had heaped against the rubble of the breach and surveyed the dunes was it possible that the sand had simply covered the secret theyd come here to find was the scourge concealed here its howl that of something buried alive if so how could they ever hope to locate it he turned back and squinted up at the wall then on impulse he began to climb the open edge of the breach it was heavy going his limbs were weary and the wind had polished the stone in its many years of passage but he eventually gained the summit at first it seemed his efforts had been for nothing all hed won for his sweat was a view of the wall running off in both directions until distance claimed it but when he came to survey the scene below he realized that there was a pattern visible in the dunes not the natural wave patterns that the wind created but something more elaborate vast geometrical designs laid out in the sand with walkways or roads between them hed read in his research on wastelands of designs drawn by some ancient people on the plains of south america pictures of birds and gods that could have made no sense from the earth but had been drawn as if to enchant some heavenly spectator was that the case here had the sand been raised in these furrows and banks as a message to the sky if so what power had done it a small nation would be needed to move so much sand and the wind would undo tomorrow what had been done today whose work was this then perhaps night would tell he climbed back down the wall to where hobart and the others were waiting amid the boulders well camp here tonight he said inside the walls or out hobart wanted to know inside iv uriel night came down like a dropped curtain jabir made a fire in the shelter of the wall out of the remorseless assault of the wind and there they ate bread and drank coffee there was no conversation exhaustion had claimed their tongues they simply sat hunched up staring into the flames though his bones ached shadwell couldnt sleep as the fire burned low and one by one the others succumbed to fatigue he was left to keep watch the wind dropped a little as the night deepened its bellow becoming a moan it soothed him like a lullaby and at last his eyelids dropped closed behind them the busy patterns of his innereye then emptiness in sleep he heard the boy jabirs voice it called him from darkness but he didnt want to answer rest was too sweet it came again however a horrid shriek this time he opened his lids the wind had died completely overhead the stars were bright in a perfect sky trembling in their places the fire had gone out but their light was sufficient for him to see that both ibn talaq and jabir were missing from their places he got up crossed to hobart and shook him awake as he did so his eye caught sight of something on the ground a little way beyond hobarts head he stared doubting what he saw there were flowers underfoot or so he seemed to see clusters of blooms set in abundant foliage he looked up from the ground and his parched throat unleashed a cry of astonishment the dunes had gone in their place a jungle had risen up a riot of trees that challenged the walls height vast flowerladen species whose leaves were the size of a man beneath their canopy was a wilderness of vines and shrubs and grasses for a moment he doubted his sanity until he heard hobart say my god at his side you see it too said shadwell i see it hobart said a garden garden at first sight the word scarcely described this chaos but further scrutiny showed that there was order at work in what had initially seemed anarchy avenues had been laid under the vast blossomladen trees there were lawns and terraces this was indeed a garden of sorts though there would be little pleasure to be had walking in it for despite the surfeit of species plants and bushes of every size and shape there was not amongst them a single variety that had colour neither bloom nor branch nor leaf nor fruit all down to the humblest blade had been bled of pigment shadwell was puzzling at this when a further cry issued from the depths it was ibn talaqs voice this time and it rose in a steep curve to a shriek he followed it the ground was soft beneath his feet which slowed his progress but the shriek went on broken only by sobbing breaths shadwell ran calling the mans name there was no fear left in him only an overwhelming hunger to see the maker of this enigma face to face as he advanced down one of the shadowy boulevards its pathway strewn with the same colourless plantlife ibn talaqs cry stopped dead shadwell was momentarily disoriented he halted and scanned the foliage for some sign of movement there was none the breeze did not stir a single frond nor to further compound the mystery was there a hint of perfume however subtle from the mass of blossoms behind him hobart muttered a cautionary word shadwell turned and was about to condemn the mans lack of curiosity when he caught sight of the trail his own footsteps had made in the gyre his heels had brought forth life here theyd destroyed it wherever hed set foot the plants had simply crumbled away he stared at the blank ground where thered previously been grasses and flowers and the explanation for this extraordinary growth became apparent ignoring hobart now he walked towards the nearest of the bushes the blooms of which hung like censers from their branches tentatively he touched his fingers to one of the flowers upon this lightest of contacts the blossom fell apart dropping from the branch in a shower of sand he brushed its companion with his thumb it too fell away and with it the branch and the exquisite leaves it bore all returned to sand at a touch the dunes hadnt disappeared in the night to make way for this garden they had become the garden risen up at some unthinkable command to create this sterile illusion what had at first sight seemed a miracle of fecundity was a mockery it was sand scentless colourless lifeless a dead garden a sudden disgust gripped him this trick was all too like the work of the seerkind some deceitful rapture he flung himself into the midst of the shrubbery flailing to right and left of him in his fury destroying the bushes in stinging clouds a tree brushed by his hand collapsed like an extinguished fountain the most elaborate blossoms fell apart at his merest touch but he wasnt satisfied he flailed on until hed cleared a small grove amid the press of foliage raptures he kept yelling as the sand rained down on him raptures he might have gone on to more ambitious destruction but that the scourges howl the same hed first heard days before as hed squatted in shit began that voice had brought him through desolation and emptiness and to what more desolation more emptiness his anger unassuaged by the damage hed done he turned to hobart which ways it coming from i dont know said hobart stumbling back a few steps everywhere where are you shadwell demanded yelling into the depths of the illusion show yourself dont said hobart his voice full of dread this is your dragoni shadwell said we have to see it hobart shook his head the power that had made this place was not one he wanted sight of before he could retreat however shadwell had hold of him we meet it together he said its cheated us both hobart struggled to be free of shadwells grip but his violence ceased as his panicked eyes caught sight of the form that now appeared at the far end of the avenue it was as tall as the canopy twentyfive feet or more its long bonewhite head brushing the branches sandpetals spiralling down though it still howled it lacked a mouth or indeed any feature on its face but eyes which it had in terrifying numbers twin rows of lidless lashless slits which ran down each side of its head there were perhaps a hundred eyes in all but staring an age at it would not have revealed their true number for the thing despite its solidity defied fixing were those wheels that moved at its heart tied with lines of liquid fire to a hundred other geometries which informed the air it occupied did innumerable wings beat at its perimeters and light burn in its bowels as though it had swallowed stars nothing was certain in one breath it seemed to be enclosed in a matrix of darting light like scaffolding struck by lightning in the next the pattern became flame confetti which swarmed at its extremities before it was snatched away one moment ether the next juggernaut and then as suddenly as it had begun the wail it was unleashing died away the scourge stopped moving shadwell released hobart as the stench of shit rose from the mans trousers hobart fell to the ground making small sobbing sounds shadwell left him where he lay as the scourges head mazed in geometries located the creatures that had trespassed in its garden he didnt retreat what use was retreat in every direction from this place lay thousands of square miles of wasteland there was nowhere to run to all he could do was stand his ground and share with this terror the news he brought but before he could utter a word the sand at his feet began to move for an instant he thought the scourge intended to bury him alive as the ground liquified but instead the sand drew back like a sheet and sprawled on the bed below a few feet from where shadwell stood was the corpse of ibn talaq the man was naked and appalling torments had been visited upon him both his hands had been burned from his arms leaving blackened stumps from which cracked bone protruded his genitals had been similarly destroyed and the eyes seared from his head there was no use pretending the wounds had been delivered after death his mouth still shaped his dying scream shadwell was revolted and averted his eyes but the scourge had more to show him the sand moved again to his right and another body was uncovered this time jabir lying on his belly his buttocks burned down to the bone his neck broken and his head twisted round so that he stared up at the sky his mouth was burned out why was the word on shadwells lips the scourges gaze made his bowels ache to empty themselves but he still delivered the question why we mean no harm here the scourge made no sign that it had even heard the words had it perhaps lost the power of communication after an age here in the wilderness its only response to the pain of being that howl then somewhere amid the legion eyes a skittering light which was snatched by the burning wheels and spat towards shadwell in the breath before it struck him he had time to hope his death would be quick then the light was on him the agony of its touch was blinding at its caress his body folded up beneath him he struck the ground his skull ready to split but death didnt come instead the pain dropped away suddenly and the burning wheel appeared in his minds eye the scourge was in his head its power circling in his skull then the wheel went out and in its place a vision lent him by his possessor he was floating through the garden high up in the trees this is the scourges sight he realized he was sitting behind its eyes their shared gaze caught a motion on the ground below and moved towards it there on the sand was jabir naked and on all fours with ibn talaq impaling him grunting as he worked his flesh into the boy to shadwells eyes the act looked uncomfortable but harmless enough hed seen worse in his time done worse indeed but it wasnt just sight he was sharing with the scourge its thoughts came too and the creature saw a crime in this rutting and judged it punishable by death shadwell had seen the results of the scourges executions he had no desire to watch them reenacted but he had no choice the scourge owned his minds eye he was obliged to watch every terrible moment brightness reached down and tore the pair from each other then scoured out the offending parts mouth and eyes and groin and buttocks erasing them with fire it was not quick they had time to suffer he heard again the shrieks that had brought him into the garden and time to beg but the fire was unforgiving by the time it had done its work shadwell was sobbing for it to stop finally it did and a shroud of sand was drawn over the bodies only when that was done did the scourge grant him his own sight back the ground he lay on stinking of his vomit reappeared in front of him he lay where hed fallen trembling only when he was certain he wouldnt collapse did he raise his head and look up at the scourge it had changed shape no longer a giant it sat on a hill of sand it had raised beneath itself its many eyes turned up towards the stars it had gone from judge and executioner to contemplative in a matter of moments though the images that had filled his head had faded shadwell knew the creature still maintained its presence in his mind he could feel the barbs of its thought he was a human fish and hooked it looked away from the sky and down at him shadwell he heard his name called though in its new incarnation the scourge still lacked a mouth it needed none of course when it could dabble in a mans head this way i see you it said or rather that was the thought it placed in shadwells head to which he put words i see you and i know your name thats what i want shadwell said i want you to know me trust me believe me sentiments like these had been part of his salesmans spiel for more than half his life he drew confidence from speaking them youre not the first to come here the scourge said others have come and gone shadwell knew all too well where theyd gone he had a momentary glimpse whether it was at the scourges behest or of his own making he couldnt be sure of the bodies that were buried beneath the sand their rot wasted on this dead garden the thought should have made him afraid but hed felt all he was going to feel of fear seeing the executions now he would speak plainly and hope the truth kept him from death i came here for a reason he said what reason this was the moment the customer had asked a question and he had to reply to it no use to try and prevaricate or prettify in the hope of securing a better sale the plain truth was all he had to bargain with on that the sale was either won or lost best to simply state it the seerkind he said he felt the barbs in his brain twitch at the name but there was no further response the scourge was silent even its wheels seemed to dim as if at any moment the engine would flicker out then oh so quietly it shaped the word in his head seer kind and with the word came a spasm of energy like lightning that erupted in his skull it was in the substance of the scourge as well this lightning it flickered across the equation of its body it ran back and forth in its eyes seerkind you know who they are the sand hissed around shadwells feet i had forgotten its been a long time and you came here to tell me to remind you why the barbs twitched again it could kill me at any moment shadwell thought its nervous and that makes it dangerous i must be careful play it cunningly be a salesman they hid from you he said indeed all these years hid their heads so youd never find them and now now theyre awake again in the human world i had forgotten but im reminded now oh yes sweet shadwell the barbs relaxed and a wave of the purest pleasure broke over shadwell leaving him almost sick with the excess of it it was a joybringer too this scourge what power did not lie in its control may i ask a question he said ask who are you the scourge rose from its throne of sand and in an instant it grew blindingly bright shadwell covered his eyes but the light shone through flesh and bone and into his head where the scourge was pronouncing its eternal name i am called uriel it said uriel of the principalities he knew the name as hed known by heart the rituals hed heard at st philomenas and from the same source as a child hed learned the names of all the angels and archangels by heart and amongst the mighty uriel was of the mightiest the archangel of salvation called by some the flame of god the sight of the executions replayed in his head the bodies withering beneath that merciless fire an angels fire what had he done stepping into the presence of such power this was uriel of the principalities another of the angels attributes rose from memory now and with it a sudden shock of comprehension uriel had been the angel left to stand guard at the gates of eden eden at the word the creature blazed though the ages had driven it to grief and forgetfulness it was still an angel its fires unquenchable the wheels of its body rolled the visible mathematics of its essence turning on itself and preparing for new terrors there were others here the seraph said that called this place eden but i never knew it by that name what then shadwell asked paradise said the angel and at the word a new picture appeared in shadwells mind it was the garden in another age no trees of sand then but a lush jungle that brought to mind the flora that had sprung to life in the gyre the same profligate fecundity the same unnamable species that seemed on the verge of defying their condition blooms that might at any moment take breath fruit about to fly there was none of the urgency of the gyre here however the atmosphere was one of inevitable rising up things aspiring at their own pace to some higher state which was surely light for everywhere between the trees brightnesses floated like living spirits this was a place of making the angel said for ever and ever where things came to be to be to find a form and enter the world and adam and eve i dont remember them uriel replied the first parents of humanity humanity was raised from din in a thousand places but not here here were higher spirits the seerkind said shadwell higher spirits the angel made a sour sound the image of the paradisegarden convulsed and shadwell glimpsed furtive figures moving amongst the trees like thieves they began here said the angel and in shadwells mind he saw the earth break open and plants rise from it with human faces and mist congeal but they were accidents droppings from greater stuff that found life here we did not know them we spirits we were about sublimer business and they grew grew and grew curious now shadwell began to comprehend they smelt the world he prompted the angel shuddered and again shadwell was bombarded with images he saw the forefathers of the seerkind naked every one their bodies all colours and sizes a crowd of freakish forms tails golden eyes and coxcombs flesh on one with the sheen of a panther another with vestigial wings he saw them scaling the wall eager to be out of the garden they escaped nobody escapes me said uriel when the spirits left i remained here to keep watch until their return that much the book of genesis had been correct about a guardian set at the gate but little else it seemed the writers of that book had taken an image that mankind knew in its heart and folded it into their narrative for their own moral purposes what place god had here if any was perhaps as much a matter of definition as anything would the vatican know this creature as an angel if it presented itself before the gates of that state shadwell doubted it and the spirits he said the others who were here i waited said the angel and waited and waited thought shadwell until loneliness drove it mad alone in the wilderness with the garden withering and rotting and the sand breaking through the walls will you come with me now said shadwell i can lead you to the seerkind the angel turned its gaze on shadwell afresh i hate the world it said i was there before once but if i take you to them said shadwell you can do your duty and be finished with it uriels hatred of the kingdom was like a physical thing it chilled shadwells scalp yet the angel didnt reject the offer merely bided its time as it turned the possibility over it wanted an end to its waiting and soon but its majesty was repulsed at the thought of contact with the human world like all pure things it was vain and easily spoiled perhaps it said its gaze moved off shadwell towards the wall the salesman followed its look and there found hobart the man had taken the chance to creep away during the exchange with uriel but hed not got far enough this time the angel said the light flickering in the concourse of its eyes i will go the light was caught up by the wheels and thrown out towards hobart in a different skin with that the entire engine flew apart and not one but countless arrows of light fled towards hobart uriels gaze had bound him to the spot he could not avoid the invasion the arrows struck him from forehead to foot their light entering him without breaking his skin in the space of a heartbeat all trace of the angel had gone from the hill beside shadwell and with its disappearance into flesh came a new spectacle a shudder ran through the ground from the wall where hobart stood and through the garden at its passage the sand forms began to decay countless plants dropping into dust avenues of trees shuddering and collapsing like arches in an earthquake watching the escalating destruction shadwell thought again of his first sight of the patterns in the dunes perhaps his assumptions then had been correct perhaps this place was in some way a sign to the stars uriels pitiful way of recreating a lost glory in the hope that some passing spirit would come calling and remind it of itself then the cataclysm grew too great and he retreated before he was buried in a storm of sand hobart was no longer on the gardens side of the breach but had climbed the boulders and stood looking out across the blank wastes of the desert there was no outward sign of uriels occupancy to a casual eye this was the same hobart his gaunt features were as glacial as ever and it was the same colourless voice that emerged when he spoke but the question he posed told a different story am i the dragon now he asked shadwell looked at him there was he now saw a brilliance in the hollows of hobarts eyes that hed not seen since hed first seduced the man with promises of fire yes he said youre the dragon they didnt linger they began the trek back towards the border there and then leaving the empty quarter emptier than ever part eleven the dream season the sky is darkening like a stain something is going to fall like rain and it wont be flowers w h auden the two i portrait of the hero as a young lunatic thats happened to cal mooney the neighbours were saying what an odd fellow hes become full of halfsmiles and sly glances mind you werent they always a peculiar family the old man was related to a poet ive heard and you know what they say about poets a little mad all of them and now the sons gone the same way so sad funny the way people change isnt it the gossip rang true of course cal knew he had changed and yes he probably was a little mad when he looked at himself in the mirror some mornings there was a wildness in his eyes which was no doubt distressing to the cashier at the supermarket or the woman who tried to pry some potential scandal from him as they waited in line at the bank are you living alone then yes hed say its a big house for one you must find it difficult cleaning no not really hed get a quizzical look from the questioner then hed say i like dust knowing the remark would fuel the tittletattle but unable to lie for their benefit and he could see as he spoke the way they smiled inside filing the remark away for regurgitation over the laundry oh he was mad mooney all right this time there was no forgetting his mind was too much a part of his lost wonderland for it to slip away the fugue was with him all day every day and through the nights too but there was little joy in remembering only an all but unbearable ache of loss knowing that a world which hed longed for all his life was gone forever he would never again tread its rapturous earth the how and why of this loss were somewhat hazy particularly when it came to events in the gyre he recalled in some detail the battle at the narrow bright and his plunging through the mantle but what had happened subsequently was just a series of disconnected images things sprouting things dying his blood dancing down his arm in a little ecstasy the brick at his back trembling that was about all the rest was so vague he could scarcely conjure a moment of it he knew he needed some diversion from his grief or hed simply dwindle into a melancholy from which there would be no emerging so he looked around for a new job and in early july got one baking bread the pay was not good and the hours were antisocial but he enjoyed the work which was the antithesis of his labours at the insurance firm he didnt have to talk much or concern himself with office politics there was no rising in the ranks here just the plain business of dough and ovens he was happy with the job it gave him biceps like steel and warm bread for his breakfast but the diversion was only temporary his mind went back all too often to the source of his suffering and suffered again such masochism was perhaps the nature of his species indeed that belief was supported by the reappearance of geraldine in the middle of july she turned up on the doorstep one day and stepped into the house as if nothing had ever happened between them he was glad to see her this time however she didnt move in they agreed that returning to that domestic status quo could only be a retrograde step instead she came and went through the summer on an almost daily basis sometimes staying over at chariot street more often not for nigh on five weeks she didnt ask him a single question about events the previous spring and he in turn volunteered no information when she eventually did raise the subject however it was in a manner and context he hadnt expected dekes telling everyone youve been in trouble with the police she said but i told him not my cal he was sitting in brendans chair beside the window watching the late summer sky she was on the couch amid a litter of magazines i told them youre no criminal i know that whatever happened to you it wasnt that kind of trouble it was deeper than that wasnt it she glanced across at him did she want a reply it seemed not for before he could open his mouth she was saying i never understood what was going on cal and maybe its better i dont but she stared down at the magazine open on her lap then back up at him you never used to talk in your sleep she said and i do now all the time you talk to people you shout sometimes sometimes you just smile she was a little embarrassed confessing to this shed been watching him as he slept and listening too youve been somewhere havent you she said youve seen something nobody else has is that what i talk about in a sort of way but thats not what makes me think youve seen things its the way you are cal the way you look sometimes that said she seemed to reach an impasse and returned her attention to the pages of the magazine flipping the pages without really looking at them cal sighed shed been so good with him so protective he owed her an explanation however difficult it was you want me to tell you he said yes yes i do you wont believe it he warned tell me anyway he nodded and took up the story that hed come so near to spilling the previous year after his first visit to rue street i saw wonderland he began it took him three quarters of an hour to give her the outline of all that had happened since the bird had first flown from the loft and another hour to try and finetune his account once begun he found himself reluctant to leave anything out he wanted to tell it all as best he could as much for his own benefit as for geraldines she listened attentively looking up at him sometimes more often staring out of the window not once did she interrupt when he was finally finished the wounds of bereavement reopened by the telling she said nothing not for a long time finally he said you dont believe me i said you wouldnt again there was silence then she said does it matter to you if i do or i dont yes of course it matters why cal because then im not alone she smiled at him got up and crossed to where he sat youre not alone she said and said no more later as they slipped into sleep together she said do you love her suzanna i mean hed expected the question sooner or later yesi he said softly in a way i cant explain but yes im glad she murmured in the darkness cal wished he could read her features and know from them if she was telling the truth but he left any further questions unasked they didnt speak of it at all thereafter she was no different with him than shed been before he told her it was almost as if shed put the whole account out of her mind she came and went on the same ad hoc basis sometimes theyd make love sometimes not and sometimes theyd be happy or almost so the summer came and went without much disturbing the thermometer and before the freckles had a chance to bloom on geraldines cheeks it was september autumn suits england and that autumn preceding as it would the worst winter since the late forties came in glory the winds were high bringing passages of warm rain interspersed with stabs of liquid brightness the city found a lost glamour clouds the colour of slate piled up behind its sunstruck houses the wind brought the smell of the sea brought gulls too on its back dipping and weaving over the roofs that month cal felt his spirits rise again seeing the kingdom of the cuckoo shine while above it the skies seemed charged with secret signs he began to see faces in the shreds of clouds heard codes tapped out by raindrops on the sill something was surely imminent he remembered gluck too that month anthony virgil gluck collector of anomalous phenomena he even thought of contacting the man again and went so far as to dig glucks card out from the pocket of his old trousers he didnt make the call however perhaps because he knew he was ripe to believe any pretty superstition if it promised miracles and that wouldnt be wise instead he kept his eye on the sky day and night he even bought himself a small telescope and began to teach himself the whereabouts of the constellations he found the process reassuring it was good to look up during the day and know that the stars were still above his head even though he couldnt see them it was doubtless the same for countless other mysteries that they shone but the world shone more brightly and blinded him to them and then in the middle of october he had the first of the nightmares ii representations eight days after the destruction of the fugue and all it had contained the remnants of the four families in all maybe a hundred individuals assembled to debate their future though they were survivors they had little reason to celebrate the fact with the weaveworlds passing theyd lost their homes their possessions and in many cases their loved ones too all they had as reminders of their former happiness was a handful of raptures much weakened with the fugues defeat these were small comfort raptures could not wake the dead nor keep the corruptions of the kingdom at bay so what were they to do there was a voluble faction led by balm de bono that argued to make their story public to become in essence a cause there was merit in the idea perhaps the safest place to be was in plain sight of the human world but there was substantial opposition to the scheme fuelled by the one possession circumstance could not take from these people pride many of them stated bluntly that theyd rather die than throw themselves on the mercy of cuckoos suzanna had a further problem with the idea though her fellow humans might be persuaded to believe the kinds tale and sympathize how long would their compassion last months a year at most then theyd turn their attention to some new tragedy the seerkind would be yesterdays victims tainted by celebrity but scarcely saved by it the combination of her argument and the widespread horror at humbling themselves to the cuckoos was sufficient to outweigh the opposition determined to be civilized in defeat de bono conceded it was the last time the etiquette of debate shaped the nights proceedings as the meeting grew steadily more heated the escalation began with a call from a harried greyfaced man that they put aside all pretence to bettering their lot and concentrate on revenging themselves on shadwell weve lost everything he said the only satisfaction weve got left is seeing that bastard dead there were voices raised in protest against this defeatism but the man demanded the right to be heard were going to die out here he said his face knotted up all weve got left are a few moments to destroy the ones who did this to us seems to me this is no time for a vendetta nimrod said we have to think constructively plan for the future there was some ironic laughter amongst the gathering above which the voice of the wouldbe avenger rose what future he said almost triumphant in his despair look at us there were many downcast eyes at this they knew all too well what a forlorn sight they made were the last of the few there wont be any coming after us and we all know it he turned on nimrod i dont want to talk about the future he said thats just asking for more grief thats not true suzanna said easy for you to say he retorted shut your mouth hamel nimrod shouted i wont she came here to help us weve had enough help from her to kill us hamel yelled back his pessimism had found a good number of supporters shes a cuckoo one of them now piped up why doesnt she go back where she belongs part of suzanna was ready to do just that she had no desire to be the target for so much bitterness their words stung more than that they stirred another fear that somehow she could have done more than she had or at least done it differently but she had to stay for de bono and nimrod and all the others who looked to her for guidance in the kingdom the fact was that all hamel had argued made a sad sense to her she could see how easy it would be to take strength from hating shadwell and so be diverted from the losses theyd sustained they more than she of course and that thought she had to keep uppermost in her mind shed lost a dream shed had a few precious moments to indulge theyd lost their world a new voice now entered the controversy one she was surprised to hear that of apolline suzanna hadnt even been aware of the womans presence in the room until she rose from a cloud of tobacco smoke and addressed the company im not going to lie down and die for anyone she said especially not you hamel her defiance echoed that of yolande dor back in capras house it seemed always to be the women who argued most vehemently for life what about shadwell somebody said what about him said apolline you want to go kill him hamel ill buy you a bow and arrow the remark won overenthusiastic laughter from some quarters but only served to infuriate the opposition more were practically extinct sister hamel replied his scorn lavish and youre not too fertile these days apolline took the taunt in good humour want to try me she said hamels lips curled at the suggestion i had a wife he said apolline taking her usual pleasure in offending jiggled her hips at hamel who spat in her direction he should have known better she spat back only more accurately though the missile was harmless enough he responded as though hed been stabbed throwing himself towards apolline with a cry of rage somebody got between them before he could land a blow and he struck out instead at the peacemaker the assault ended any lingering pretence to civilized debate the whole assembly began shouting and arguing while hamel and the other man traded punches amongst the overturned chairs it was apollines pimp who parted them though the fight had lasted no more than a minute both had taken a beating and were bleeding at mouth and nose suzanna watched with a heavy heart as nimrod attempted to calm proceedings there was so much she wanted to talk with the kind about problems upon which she needed their advice secrets tender and difficult which she wanted to share but while things were so volatile she feared voicing these matters would simply be further fuel for dissension hamel took his leave cursing suzanna apolline and all who as he put it sided with the shit he didnt go unaccompanied two dozen left with him there was no serious attempt to return to the debate after this eruption the meeting had effectively been brought to a halt no one was in any mood to make balanced decisions nor were they likely to be so at least until a little time had passed it was concluded therefore that the survivors would disperse and lie low in any safe place they could find there were so few of them left that melting amongst the populous would not prove too difficult theyd wait out the winter until the reverberations had died down suzanna parted from nimrod after the meeting leaving instructions with him as to her whereabouts in london she was exhausted she needed to rest her head awhile after two weeks back at home however she discovered that attempting to restore her energies by doing nothing was a sure route to lunacy and instead returned to work at the studio it proved a wise move the problems of reestablishing a working rhythm distracted her from dwelling too much on the losses and failures of recent times and the very fact of making something even if it was only pots and plates answered the need she had to begin again shed never been so aware of days mythic associations as now of its reputation as the first stuff the base matter from which storybook nations had taken shape her skill could only manage pots not people but worlds had to begin somewhere she worked long hours with just the radio and the smell of the clay for company her thoughts never completely free of melancholy but lighter than shed dared hope hearing that she was back in town finnegan appeared on her doorstep one afternoon spruce as ever to invite her out to dinner it was strange to think of his waiting for her while shed been adventuring and touching too she accepted his invitation and was more thoroughly charmed by his company than she ever remembered being he forthright as ever said that they were made for each other and should marry immediately she told him she made a rule of never marrying bankers the next day he sent flowers and a note saying that hed relinquish his profession they saw each other regularly thereafter his warmth and easy manner were the perfect diversion from the darker thoughts that still threatened to intrude when she had time to think every now and then through the summer months and into the early autumn she had some brief contact with members of the kind though they were kept to the minimum for safetys sake the news seemed to be good many of the survivors had returned to the vicinity of their ancestors homes and found niches there better news still there was no sign of either shadwell or hobart there were rumours that hamel had instigated a search for the salesman and had given up after failing to uncover a single clue as to the enemys whereabouts as for the remnants of his army those seerkind whod embraced the prophets visions theyd been the authors of their own punishment waking from their evangelical nightmare to find it had destroyed all they held dear some had sought forgiveness from their fellows and had arrived shamefaced and despairing at that controversial meeting others the grapevine confirmed had been overcome by remorse and had spiralled into dereliction some had even taken their own lives there were yet others shed heard the born bloodletters amongst the kind whod left the battlefield regretting nothing and gone out into the kingdom in search of further violence they would not have to look far but rumour and supposition apart there was little to report she got on with trying to make sense of her old life while they made new lives for themselves as to cal she followed his rehabilitation through kind whod gone to ground in liverpool but made no direct contact this was in part a practical decision it was wiser that they kept their distance from each other until they were certain the enemy had disappeared but it was also an emotional consideration they had shared much in the fugue and out too much to be lovers the weaveworld occupied the space between them it had from the beginning that fact made a nonsense of any thought of a domestic or romantic arrangement theyd seen hell and heaven together after that surely everything else was bathos presumably cal felt the same because he made no attempt at contacting her not that it was necessary though they neither saw nor spoke to each other she felt his constant presence she had been the one to nip in the bud any possibility of physical love between them and she had sometimes regretted that but what they shared now was perhaps the highest aspiration of all lovers between them they held a world in the middle of october her work started to take a new and completely uncharacteristic turn for no particular reason she forsook her plates and bowls and began to work figuratively the results gained her few admirers but they satisfied some inner imperative which would not be gainsaid meanwhile finnegan pressed his suit with dinners and flowers his attentions redoubling each time she politely rejected him she began to think there was more than a streak of the masochist in his nature coming back as he did each time she sent him on his way of all the extraordinary times shed had since shed first become part of the fugues story these were in their way the strangest as her experience of the weaveworld and that of her present life did battle in her head for the right to be called real she knew this was cuckoo thinking that they were both real but her mind would not marry them nor her place in them what did the woman finnegan proclaimed his love for the smiling clay beneath the fingers suzanna have to do with the woman whod stood face to face with dragons she came to wish she couldnt evoke those mythic times as well as she could because afterwards shed feel sick with the triviality of being herself for that reason she kept a rein on the menstruum which was not difficult to do its once unpredictable nature was much tamed now a consequence of the fugues demise she assumed it hadnt foresaken her entirely sometimes it seemed to get restless and decided to stretch itself usually though it took her a little time to realize this in response to some environmental cue there were places in the kingdom that were charged up places where she sensed a spring beneath the earth aching to fountain the menstruum knew them so in some cases did the cuckoos sanctifying the spots as best their myopia knew how with steeples and monuments just as many of these territories remained unrecognized however and passing through some unremarkable street shed feel a surge in her belly and know power was buried there most of her life shed associated power with politics or money but her secret self had learned better imagination was true power it worked transformations wealth and influence never could she saw its processes even in finnegan on the few occasions she coaxed him to talk about his past particularly his childhood she saw the colours around his head strengthen and ripen as in the act of imagining he was reunited with himself made a continuum at those moments shed remember the line from mimis book that which is imagined need never be lost and on those days she was even happy then early in the third week of december any fragile hope of good times abruptly came to an end the weather turned icy that week not just bitter but arctic there was no snow as yet just a cold so profound the nerveendings couldnt tell it from fire she still worked on in the studio unwilling to give up her creating though her paraffin heater could barely raise the temperature above zero and she was obliged to wear two sweaters and three pairs of socks she scarcely noticed shed never been so preoccupied with making as she was now bullying the clay into the shapes in her minds eye then on the seventeenth completely without warning apolline came calling the eternal widow she was swathed in black from head to foot we have to speak she said as soon as the door was closed suzanna escorted her through to the studio and cleared a seat for her amid the chaos she didnt want to sit however but wandered around the room eventually ending up at the frostscoured windows peering out of them while suzanna rinsed the clay from her hands are you being followed suzanna asked her i dont know came the reply maybe do you want some coffee id prefer something stronger what have you got just brandy just brandy will do she sat suzanna located the bottle she kept for her occasional onewoman parties and put an ample measure in a cup apolline drained it filled it a second time then said have you had the dreams what dreams weve all been having them apolline said the way she looked face sallow despite the cold eyes ringed with darkness suzanna wondered that shed had any sleep at all of late terrible dreamsi the widow went on like the end of the world whos been having them who hasnt said apolline everyone the same thing the same appalling thing shed drained her cup a second time and now took the bottle from the bench for a further shot something bads going to happen we can all feel it thats why ive come suzanna watched her while she poured herself more brandy her mind posing two quite separate questions first were these nightmares simply the inevitable result of the horrors the seerkind had endured or something more and if the latter why hadnt she had them too apolline interrupted these thoughts her words slightly slurred by her intake of alcohol people are saying its the scourge that its coming for us again after all this time apparently this is the way it first made its presence known before in dreams and you think theyre right apolline winced as she swallowed another throatful of brandy whatever it is we have to protect ourselves are you suggesting some kind of offensive apolline shrugged dont know she said maybe most of them are so damn passive it sickens me how they lie back and take whatever comes their way worse than whores she stopped and sighed heavily then said some of the younger ones have got it into their heads that maybe we can raise the old science to what purpose to finish off the scourge of course she snapped before it finishes us how do you estimate our chances a little better than zero apolline grunted jesus i dont know at least were wise to it this time thats something some of us are going back to the places where there was some power to see if we can dredge up anything useful after all these years whos counting she said raptures dont age so what are we looking for signs prophecies god knows she put down her cup and traipsed back to the window rubbing at the frost with the ball of her gloved hand to clear a spyhole she peered out then made a ruminative grunt before once more turning her narrowed eyes on suzanna you know what i think she announced what i think youre keeping something from us suzanna said nothing which won a second grunt from apolline i thought so she said you think were our own worst enemies eh not to be trusted with secrets her gaze was black and bright you may be right she said we fell for shadwells performance didnt we at least some of us did you didnt i had distractions she answered business in the kingdom come to that i still do her voice trailed off i thought i could turn my back on the rest of them you see ignore them and be happy but i cant in the end i think i must belong with them god help me we came so close to losing everything said suzanna we did lose said apolline not quite the interrogating eyes grew sharper and suzanna teetered on the edge of pouring out all that had happened to cal and herself in the gyre but apollines appraisal was accurate she didn t trust them with their own miracles her instinct told her to keep her account of the loom to herself for a while longer so instead of spilling the story she said at least were still alive apolline undoubtedly sensing that shed come close to a revelation and been denied it spat on the floor small comfort she said were reduced to digging around in the kingdom for some sniff of rapture its pitiful so what can i do to help apollines expression was almost venomous nothing would have given her greater satisfaction suzanna guessed than walking out on this devious cuckoo were not enemies said suzanna are we not you know were not i want to do whatever i can for you so you say apolline replied without much conviction she looked away towards the window her tongue ferreting in her cheek for a polite word do you know this wretched city well she said finally pretty well so you could go looking could you around and about i could i will apolline dug a scrap of paper from her pocket torn from a notebook here are some addresses she said and where will you be salisbury there was a massacre there back before the weave one of the cruellest in fact a hundred children died i might sniff something out her attention had suddenly been claimed by the shelves on which suzanna had put some of her recent work she went to it her skirts trailing in the clay dust i thought you said you hadnt been dreaming she remarked suzanna scanned the row of pieces shed been immersed in their making for so long shed scarcely been conscious of their potency or indeed the consistency of the obsession behind them now she saw them with fresh eyes they were all human figures but twisted out of true as though they were at the heart of some devouring fire caught in the instant before it erased their faces like all of her current work they were unglazed and roughly rendered was that because their tragedy was as yet unwritten simply an idea in the fermenting mind of the future apolline took one of the figures down and ran her thumb over its contorted features youve been dreaming with your eyes open she commented and suzanna knew without a shadow of a doubt that it was true its a good likeness the widow said of whom apolline set the tragic mask back on the shelf of us all iii no lullabies cal had been sleeping alone when he had the first of the nightmares it began on venus mountain he was wandering there his legs ready to give out beneath him but with that horrid foreknowledge of disaster that dreams grant he knew it would not be wise to close his eyes and sleep instead he stood on the warm ground while forms that were lit as if by a sun that had already set behind the mountain moved around him a man was dancing nearby his skirts like living tissue a girl flew over trailing the scent of her sex there were lovers in the long grass coupling one of them cried out whether in pleasure or alarm he wasnt certain and the next moment he was running over the mountainside and there was something coming after him something vast and remorseless he shouted as he ran to alert the lovers and the birdgirl and the dancer to the horror that had come for them all but his voice was pitifully thin the voice of a mouse and the next moment the grass around him began to smoulder before his eyes the coupling bodies now burst into flames an instant later the girl fell out of the sky her body consumed by the same venomous fire again he shouted in terror this time trying to leap over the flames as they advanced across the ground in his direction but he wasnt agile enough his heels caught fire and he felt the heat creep up the back of his legs as he ran howling now he found an extra burst of speed and suddenly venus mountain was gone and he was running barefoot down streets hed known since childhood it was night but the lamps along the street had been smashed and the paving stones torn up beneath his feet made the going treacherous still the pursuer came after him sniffing his carbonized heels knowing it would outpace him given time he looked for some place of sanctuary as he ran but the doors of the houses even those of childhood friends were nailed shut the windows boarded up there was no help to be had here all he could do was keep running in the vain hope that the monster would be distracted by more tempting quarry an alleyway caught his eye he ducked down it made a turn made another turn ahead a brick wall and in it a door through which he hurled himself only then did he realize where this inevitable route had taken him he knew the yard at once though the wall had grown twice as high since hed last been here and the gate through which hed stepped a moment ago had sealed itself up it was the yard behind mimi laschenskis house once in another life hed stood on that wall and toppled and fallen finally into paradise but there was no carpet in the yard now nor any presence bird or man to offer their consolation just him and the four shadowy corners of the yard and the sound of his pursuer approaching the hiding place he took refuge in one of the corners and crouched down though the heels beneath his buttocks had been extinguished his panic had not he felt sick with fear the monster approached he smelt the heat off its hide it wasnt the heat of life not sweat or breath but a dry dead fire ancient merciless an oven in which all the good of the world might be cremated and it was close just beyond the wall he held his breath there was a crippling ache in his bladder he put his hands between his legs cupping his prick and balls shaking with terror make it go away he silently pleaded to the darkness make it leave me alone and ill be good as gold forever i swear i will though he could scarcely believe his luck his appeal was heard for the presence on the other side of the wall gave up its pursuit and retreated his spirits lifted a little but he kept his cramped position until his dreamsense told him that the enemy had withdrawn entirely only then did he dare stand up again his joints cracking the pressure in his bladder would no longer be denied turning to the wall he unzipped himself the brick was hot from the presence of the creature and his piss hissed against it in midflow the sun came out suddenly flooding the yard no it wasnt the sun it was his pursuer rising over the wall its head hotter than a hundred noons its ovenmaw open wide he could not help but look into its face though it would surely blind him he saw enough eyes for a nation pressed side by side set on great wheels their nerves drawn out like bright threads and knotted in the belly of the creature there was more much more but he only glimpsed it before the heat set him alight from head to toenail he shrieked and with the cry the yard disappeared and he was travelling again on venus mountain only this time the landscape beneath him was not earth and rock but flesh and bone it was his own body he was flying over his substance become a world and it was burning up burning to extinction his shriek was the lands shriek and it rose and rose as he and it were utterly consumed too much he woke suddenly to find himself curled up in the middle of the bed a knot of dreamt agony he was sweating so much surely the fire would have been extinguished but no it burned on in his minds eye for minutes afterwards still bright it was more than a nightmare he knew it had the potency of a vision alter that first visit there was a blank night then it came again and again the night after the particulars were altered somewhat but it was in essence the same warning or prophecy there was a gap of several days before the fourth dream and this time geraldine was with him though she made every attempt to wake him he was howling she said he could not be roused until the dream was over only then did he open his eyes to find her sobbing with panic i thought you were dying she said and he half believed she was right that his heart would not bear many more of these terrors before it burst it was not just his death the vision promised however it was that of the people on venus mountain who seemed to occupy his very substance a catastrophe was coming that would lay waste those few seerkind who had survived who were in their way as intimate to him as his own flesh that was what the dream told he lived through november in fear of sleep and what it would bring the nights were growing longer the portions of light shrinking it was as if the year itself was sliding into sleep and in the mind of the night that would follow the substance of his dream was taking shape a week into december with the nightmare coming almost as soon as he closed his eyes he knew he had to speak to suzanna find her and tell her what he was seeing but how her letter to him had been quite clear she would contact him when it was safe to do so he had no address for her nor a telephone number in desperation he turned to the only source of intelligence he had on the whereabouts of miracles he found virgil glucks card and rang the number on it there was no reply iv the shrine of the mortalities the day after apollines visit with polar conditions moving down across the country and the temperature dropping hourly suzanna went out to look at the sites on the list the first of them proved a disappointment the house shed come to see and those adjacent to it were in the process of being demolished as she studied her map to be certain shed come to the correct address one of the workmen left a fire of rooftimbers he was tending and sauntered across to her theres nothing to see he said there was a look of distaste on his face which she couldnt fathom is this where number seventytwo stood she asked you dont look the type he replied im sorry i dont to come looking she shook her head he seemed to see that hed made an error of some kind and his expression mellowed you didnt come to see the murder house he said murder house this is where that bastard did his three kiddies in thereve been people here all week picking up bricks i didnt know she vaguely remembered the grim headlines however an apparently sane man and loving father had murdered his children while they slept then killed himself my mistake said the firewatcher couldnt believe some of these people wanting souvenirs its unnatural he frowned at her then turned away and headed back to his duties unnatural that was the way violet pumphrey had condemned mimis house in rue street suzanna had never forgotten it some houses shed said theyre not quite natural shed been right perhaps the children whod died here had been victims of that same unfocused fear their killer moved either to preserve them forever from the forces he felt at work in his little sphere or else wash his own fear away in their blood whichever unless she could read auguries in smoke or rubble there was no sense in lingering the second site which was in the centre of the city was neither house nor rubble but a church its dedicatees saints philomena and callixtus two names she was not at all familiar with minor martyrs presumably it was a charmless building of red brick and stone dressing hedged in on every side by new office developments the small accompanying graveyard littered and forsaken in its way it looked as unpromising as the ruins that had been the murderers house but before she even stepped over the threshold the menstruum told her that this was one of the charged places inside that instinct was confirmed she was delivered from a cold bland street into a haven for mysteries she didnt need to be a believer to find the candlelight and smell of incense persuasive nor to be touched by the image of madonna and christchild whether their story was history or myth was academic the fugue had taught her that all that mattered was how loudly the image spoke and today she found in it a hope for birth and transcendence her heart needed there were half a dozen people sitting in the pews either praying or simply letting their pulses slow a little out of respect for their meditations she walked as quietly as the stone underfoot would allow down one of the sideaisles to the altar as she approached the chancel rail her sense that there was power here intensified she felt selfconscious as though somebody had their eyes on her she looked round none of the worshippers was looking her way but as she turned back towards the altar the floor beneath her feet grew insubstantial then vanished entirely and she was left standing on the air staring down into the labyrinthine bowels of st philomenas there were catacombs laid out below the power was sourced there the vision lasted two or three seconds only before it flickered out leaving her hanging onto the rail until the vertigo it had brought with it passed then she looked about her for a door that would offer her access to the crypt there was only one likely option that she could see off to the left of the altar she climbed the steps and was crossing to the door when it opened and a priest stepped through can i help you he wanted to know offering up a waferthin smile i want to see the crypt she said the smile snapped there isnt one he replied but ive seen it she told him pressed to bluntness by the fact that the menstruum had risen in her as shed crossed beneath christs gaze unnerving her with its eagerness well you cant go down the crypts sealed i have to she told him the heat of her insistence brought a stare of something like recognition from him when he spoke again his voice was an anxious whisper ive got no authority he said i have she answered the response coming not from her head but from her belly couldnt you wait he murmured the words were his last appeal for when she chose not to reply he stood aside and allowed her to walk past him into the room beyond you want me to show you he said his voice now barely audible yes he led her to a curtain which he drew aside the key was in the lock of the door he turned it and pushed the door open the air that rose from below was dry and stale the stairway before her steep but she was not afraid the call she felt from below coaxed her down whispering its encouragement this was no grave they were entering or if it was the dead had more than rot on their minds her glimpse of the maze beneath the church hadnt prepared her for how far below ground level it actually lay the light from the baptistery rapidly faded as the staircase wound its way down after two dozen steps she could not see her guide at all how much further she said at that moment he struck a match and set it to a candlewick the flame was reluctant in the feeble air but by its uncertain light she saw the priests fretful face turned towards her beyond him were the corridors shed first viewed from above lined with niches theres nothing here he said with some sadness not any longer show me anyway he nodded weakly as though hed lost entirely the strength to resist her and led her down one of the passageways carrying the candle before him the niches she now saw were all occupied caskets piled from floor to ceiling it was a pleasant enough way to decay she supposed cheek by jowl with your peers the very civility of the sight lent greater force to the scene that awaited her when at the end of the passageway he opened a door and ushering her before him said this is what you came to see isnt it she stepped inside he followed such was the size of the room theyd entered that the meagre candleflame was not equal to illuminating it but there were no caskets here that much was apparent there were only bones and those there were in their thousands covering every inch of the walls and ceiling the priest crossed the room and put the candle to a dozen wicks set in candelabra of femur and skull pan as the flames brightened the full ambition of the bonearrangers skills became apparent the mortal remains of hundreds of human beings had been used to create vast symmetrical designs baroque configurations of shin and rib with clusters of skulls as their centre pieces exquisite mosaics of foot and finger bones set off with teeth and nails it was all the more ghastly because it was so meticulously rendered the work of some morbid genius what is this place she asked he frowned at her perplexed you know what it is the shrine shrine he moved towards her you didnt know no rage and fear suddenly ignited his face you lied to me he said his voice setting the candles fluttering you said you knew he snatched hold of her arm get out of here he demanded dragging her back towards the door youre trespassing his grip hurt her it was all she could do to stop the menstruum retaliating as it was there was no need for the priests gaze suddenly left her and strayed to the candles the flames had grown brighter their jittering manic his hand dropped from her arm and he began to back away towards the door of the shrine as the flickering fires became incandescent his shortcropped hair was literally standing on end his tongue lolled in his open mouth robbed of exclamation she didnt share his terror whatever was happening in the chamber it felt good to her she bathed in the energies that were loose in the air around her head the priest had reached the door and now fled down the passageway towards the stairs as he did so the caskets began to rattle in their brick niches as if their contents wanted to be up to meet the day that was dawning in the shrine their drumming lent fervour to the spectacle before her in the centre of the chamber a form was beginning to appear drawing its substance from the dustfilled air and the boneshards that lay on the floor suzanna could feel it plucking flecks from her face and arms to add to its sum it was not one shape she now saw but three the central figure towering over her common sense might have counselled retreat but unlikely as it seemed given that death surrounded her on all sides shed seldom felt safer that sense of ease didnt falter the dust moved in front of her in a slow dance more soothing than distressing the two flanking shapes forsaking their creation before they became coherent and running into the central figure to lend it new solidity even then it was only a dustghost barely able to hold itself together but in the features that were taking shape before her suzanna could see traces of immacolata what more perfect place for the incantatrix to keep her shrine death had always been her passion the priest was scrabbling for a prayer in the passageway outside but the grey glittering smudge that hung in the air in front of suzanna was unmoved its features had elements of not one but all three sisters the hags senility the magdalenes sensuality the exquisite symmetry of immacolata unlikely as it seemed the synthesis worked the marriage of contradictions rendered both more tenuous and more pliant by the delicacy of its construction it seemed to suzanna that if she breathed too hard shed undo it and then the voice that at least was recognizably immacolatas but there was a softness in it now that it had previously lacked perhaps even a delicate humour were glad you came she said will you request the adamatical to leave we have business to do you and i what sort of business its not for his ears the mote ghost said please help him to his feet will you and tell him theres no harm done theyre so superstitious these men she did as immacolata asked went down the drumming corridor to where the man was cowering and drew him to his feet i think maybe you should leave she said the lady wants it the priest gave her a sickened look all this time he said i never really believed its all right she said theres no damage done are you coming too no i cant come back for you he warned her tears spilling down his cheeks i understand she said you go on im safe he needed no further urging but was off up the stairs like a jack rabbit she returned down the passageway the caskets still rattling to face the woman i thought you were dead she said whats dead immacolata replied a word the cuckoos use when the flesh fails its nothing suzanna you know that why are you here then ive come to pay a debt to you in the temple you kept me from falling or have you forgotten no nor i such kindnesses are not negligible i understand that now i understand many things you see how im reunited with my sisters together were as we could never be apart a single mind threeinone i am we and we see our malice and regret it suzanna might well have doubted this unlikely confession but that the menstruum brimming at her eyes and throat confirmed the truth of it the wraith before her and the power behind it had no hatred on its mind what did it have there was the question she didnt need to ask it knew her question im here with a warning it said about what shadwell hes only a part of what you now face sister a fragment is it the scourge the phantom shuddered at the name though surely its state put it beyond the reach of such dangers suzanna didnt wait for confirmation there was no use disbelieving the worst now is shadwell something to do with the scourge she asked he raised it why he thinks magic has tainted him the dust said corrupted his innocent salesmans soul now he wont be content until every rapturemakers dead and the scourge is his weapon so he believes the truth may be more complex suzanna ran her hand down over her face her mind seeking the best route of enquiry one simple question occurred what kind of creature is this scourge the answers perhaps just another question said the sisters it thinks that its called uriel uriel an angel suzanna almost laughed at the absurdity of this thats what it believes having read the bible i dont follow most of this is beyond even our comprehension but we offer you what we know its a spirit and it once stood guard over a place where magic was a garden some have said though that may be simply another fiction why should it want to wipe the seerkind out they were made there in that garden kept from the eyes of humankind because they had raptures but they fled from it and uriel was left alone guarding an empty place for centuries suzanna was by no means certain she believed any of this but she wanted to hear the story completed what happened it went mad as any prisoner of duty must left without fresh instructions it forgot itself and its purpose all it knew was sand and stars and emptiness you should understand said suzanna i find all this difficult to believe not being a christian neither are we said the threeinone but you still think the storys true we believe theres truth inside it yes the reply made her think again of mimis book and all it contained until shed entered its pages the realm of faery had seemed childs play but facing hobart in the forest of their shared dreams shed learned differently thered been truth inside that story why not this too the difference was that the scourge occupied the same physical world as she did not metaphor not dreamstuff real so it forgot itself she said to the phantom how then did it remember perhaps it never hasi said immacolata but its home was found a hundred years back by men whod gone looking for eden in their heads it read the story of the paradise garden and took it for its own whether it was or not it found a name too uriel flame of god the spirit who stood at the gates of lost eden and was it eden the place it guarded you dont believe that any more than i do but uriel does whatever its true name is if it even has one that names forgotten it believes itself an angel so for better or worse it is the notion made sense to suzanna in its way if in the dream of the book shed believed herself a dragon why shouldnt something lost in madness take an angels name it murdered its discoverers of course immacolata was saying then went looking for those whod escaped it the families or their descendants and it almost wiped them out but they were clever though they didnt understand the power that pursued them they knew how to hide the rest youre familiar with and uriel what did it do when the seerkind disappeared it returned to its fortress until shadwell until shadwell suzanna mused on this for a little time then asked the one question this whole account begged what about god she said the threeinone laughed her motes somersaulting we dont need god to make sense of this she said suzanna wasnt certain if she spoke only for themselves or for her too if there was a first cause a force of which this uriel is a fragment its forsaken its sentinel so what do we do said suzanna theres been talk of mustering the old science yes i heard would that defeat it i dont know certainly i made some miracles in my time that might have wounded it then help us now thats beyond us suzanna you can see our condition for yourself all thats left is dust and willpower haunting the shrine we were worshipped at until the scourge comes to destroy it youre certain itll do that this shrine is sacred to magic shadwell will bring the scourge here and destroy it the first chance he gets and were defenceless against it all we can do is warn youi thank you for that the wraith began to waver as its power to hold its form diminished there was a time you know immacolata said when we had such raptures the dust she was made of was blowing away the boneshards dropping to the ground when every breath was magic and we were afraid of nothingi it may come again within seconds the three had grown so tenuous they were barely recognizable but the voice lingered a little while to say its in your hands sister and then they were gone v the naked flame the house that mimi laschenski had occupied for over half a century had been sold two months after her death the new owners had been able to purchase it for a song given its dilapidated condition and put several weeks of hard labour into modernizing it before moving in but that investment of time and money was not enough to persuade them to stay a week later they left in a hurry claiming the place was haunted sensible folks too to look at them talking of empty rooms that growled of large invisible forms that brushed past them in darkened passageways and almost worse in its way the pungent smell of cats that hung over the place however hard they scrubbed the boards once left empty number eighteen rue street remained so the property market was slow up that end of the city and the rumours about the house were enough to deter the few who came to view it was eventually taken over by squatters who in the six days of their occupancy undid much of the work the previous owners had put in but the twentyfour hour a day orgy which the neighbours suspected was going on came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the sixth night and the tenants were gone by the following morning exiting in some haste to judge by the litter of belongings they left on the steps after that the house had no more occupants legal or otherwise and it didnt take long for gossip about number eighteen to be supplanted by talk of more lively scandals the house simply became an unsaleable eyesore its windows boarded up its paintwork deteriorating that was until that night in december what would happen that night would change the face of rue street entirely and guarantee that the house in which mimi laschenski had lived out her lonely old age was never occupied again had cal set eyes on the five figures that entered number eighteen that night it would have taken him some time to recognize their leader as balm de bono the ropedancers hair was cropped so short it was all but invisible his face was thin his features set even less recognizable perhaps was toller whom cal had last seen perched on a rope in starbrooks field tollers ambitions as a ropedancer had come to an abrupt end hours after that encounter when hed fallen foul of the prophets men theyd broken his legs and cracked his skull leaving him for dead he had at least survived starbrooks third pupil galin had perished that night in a vain attempt to protect his masters field from desecration it had been de bonos inspiration to visit the laschenski house where the weave had lain for so long in the hope of finding a pocket of the old science to arm themselves against the approaching cataclysm he had three other allies in this besides toller baptista delphi whose father had been shot down in capras house her lover otis beau and a girl whom hed first seen in nonesuch sitting on a windowledge wearing paper wings hed seen her again on venus mountain in the reverie the presences there had granted him and shed shown him a world of paper and light that had kept him from total despair in the hours that followed her name was leah of the five she was the most expert in the working of raptures and the most sensitive to their proximity it was she therefore who led the way through the laschenski house in search of the room where the weaveworld had lain her pathfinding took them up the stairs and into the secondstorey front room the house is full of echoes she said some of the custodian some of animals it takes time to sort them out she went down on her knees in the middle of the room and put her hands on the floor but the weave lay here im sure of it otis went across to where she knelt he too crouched and put his palms to the ground i dont feel a thing he said believe me said leah this is where it lay why dont we get down to the bare boards toller suggested we may get a clearer signal plush deeppile carpeting had been laid in the room only to be subsequently soiled by the squatters they removed what remnants of furniture the room could boast then tore the carpet up the labour left them shaky the training de bono had devised for this expedition refinement techniques culled from his old masters teachings had kept sleep and food in recent days to the minimum but it paid dividends when they laid their hands on the stripped boards their rarefied senses responded on the instant even otis could feel the echoes now i can practically see the weave baptista said it was a sensation they all shared what do we do now otis asked leah but she was too involved in the echoes to hear his question he turned to de bono well he said de bono had no answers though hed theorized at length with any whod debate on the subject the plain fact was this they were flying blind there was no sure way of getting to the raptures whose memory they were evoking his unspoken hope was that the ghosts of power here would come to them sensing the urgency of their mission if however the force beneath their fingertips was unmoved by the gravity of their cause then they had no way to persuade it theyd be obliged to face their nightmares unprotected which was he didnt doubt a sentence of death at twofifty in the morning cal woke from a dream which though it resembled the terrors of previous nights was in several significant ways different for one thing hed not been alone on venus mountain hed had the company of de bono together theyd fled the creature that came after them into the same maze of alleyways that would lead had the dream proceeded in its usual fashion to the yard behind the laschenski house but it didnt somewhere in the alley he and de bono were parted and cal completely disoriented took a route that led him into another street entirely there the sense of pursuit waned only to be replaced by a fresh anxiety he was no longer the quarry his dreamself knew because the creature had gone after de bono leaving him in the role of helpless observer the street seemed to be full of hiding places doorways and garden walls where it might wait stoking its fires but hed misunderstood once again it had no need to hide there it was now crossing the intersection at the end of the street not a single pursuer this time but two one was human a slouching shadowy form the other gigantic as tall as a house a cloud in which a furnace roared he started to edge back towards the alleyway from which hed stepped moving slowly so as not to attract the monster or its companions attention a foolish hope the refuge he sought had been sealed up and as his fingers scrabbled at the brick the creature looked his way it had already devoured de bono he saw his friends ashes in the cloud whose flame sight was on him i dont want to burn he yelled but the fire was coming at him please god before it struck him he flung himself up out of sleep geraldine was not with him tonight he lay in the middle of the bed trembling from gut to pores until he was certain movement wouldnt make him vomit then he got up went to the window and drew the curtains aside chariot street was perfectly quiet the same icy hush that would be citywide at this hour snow had begun to fall its idling descent hypnotic but the sight of neither street nor snow nor lamplight reassured him there was a reason why the terrors that came in sleep were different tonight because they werent just in dreams any longer he knew this without any trace of doubt that somewhere near in a street like this all lamplight and peace his nightmares were coming true there was mute but perceptible elation in the upper room of the laschenski house the call had been answered it had begun slowly with lights moving back and forth through the echoes of the weave as the old science rose from its hiding places in the carpet and came to meet those who longed for it the process was still slow and demanding they could not afford distraction from the task for fear of losing contact but they were prepared for such rigours and as the power beneath their hands intensified they couldnt help but express their pleasure in soft words of welcome the past was coming to fetch them a noise from the floor below drew de bonos attention taking care not to disturb the others as they worked he tiptoed to the door and stepped out onto the landing there was no encore to the sound that had brought him out here he crossed the darkened landing to the top of the stairs and studied the shadows below nothing moved there hed imagined it he decided his proteinstarved brain was playing tricks on him but just to be certain he went through to one of the back bedrooms and peered down into the yard snow was falling the flakes tapping lightly on the glass that was all he could see or hear he took his spectacles off and pressed his fingers to his eyes the burst of energy that had come with the first intimations of success had faded all he wanted now was sleep but they had a good deal of work to do yet calling the old science up was just beginning next came the problem of harnessing it he turned away from the window to make his way back to his companions as he did so he saw two figures moving towards the weave room had someone come out to search for him he put his spectacles back on to get a better look at them the sight before him brought a shouted warning to his lips but it was old news by the time he raised it falling on ears already deafened by their own screams it was all so quick one moment he was slipping the scene into focus the very next it erupted before he could reach the landing the killers had stepped into the carpet room and the door was flung off its hinges by the force unleashed inside a body was flung out on a stream of molten light and held as though spitted in the middle of the landing while darts of flame devoured it he saw the victim clearly it was toller poor toller his body closing into a blistered knot as the fire withered him the de bono whod been with cal at lemuel los orchard would now have flung himself into the holocaust and not considered the consequences but bad times had taught him caution there was no merit in suicide if he tried to challenge the force that was running riot in the carpet room hed die the way the rest were dying and thered be nobody left to testify to this atrocity he knew the power whose labours he was witnessing the worst predictions of his fellow kind were here proved this was the scourge there was another explosion in the carpet room and fresh fire blossomed onto the landing the ceiling and floor were alight now so were the bannisters and stairs very soon any escape route would be blocked and hed perish where he stood he had to risk crossing the landing and hope that the smoke would conceal him from the killing glance there was no time to plot his route through the fire shielding his face he made a straight run for the stairs he almost got there too but as he came within a pace of the top step he stumbled he threw out his arms to save his fall and his hands gripped hold of the burning bannister a cry escaped him as the fire caught him then he was up again and stumbling down the stairs towards the front door the scourge came after him immediately its first blow melting the brick where hed stood two beats before eyes on the door he pelted down the stairs and was within five steps of the hallway when he heard a sound like a titanic intake of breath behind him why did he turn he was a fool to turn but he wanted a sight of the scourge before it slaughtered him it was not the firebringer he saw at the top of the stairs however but its slave hed never seen the salesman dressed in his own skin so he couldnt name this man all he saw in that instant was a wasted sweating face regarding him with more desperation than malice the sight made him hesitate and as he did so this cuckoo stood aside and the scourge came into view it was made of innumerable eyes and bone that had never been clothed and emptiness he saw the fire in it too of course a fire from the bowels of a sun in love with extinction and he saw agony it would have been upon him both fire and agony had the ceiling above the stairs not given way at that moment falling between him and his tormentors in a curtain of flame he didnt escape its touch pieces of debris struck him he smelt his skin burn but while the deluge eclipsed him he was down the rest of the stairs and out in three or four panicked paces into the freezing air of the street there was a body burning in the gutter having been thrown from the upper window reduced by the scourges heat to the size of a child it was beyond all recognition with sudden fury he turned back on the house and yelled at the beasts within bastards bastards then he took to his heels before the fire came after him there were lights on all along the street and doors opening as cuckoos came out to see what it was that had disturbed their slumbers always the sightseers openmouthed disbelieving there was a force for desolation loose in their midst which could consume their lives at a glance surely they could see that but theyd watch anyway willing to embrace the void if it came with sufficient razzmatazz in his rage and his despair de bono found himself saying let it come let it come there were no safe places left nor powers to protect the vulnerable so let it do its worst if that at the last was inevitable let the void come and bring an end to the tyranny of hope vi death comes home as the dead hours between midnight and first light ticked by the snowfall became heavier cal sat in his fathers chair at the back window and watched the flakes as they spiralled down knowing from experience that trying to get back to sleep was a waste of effort he would sit here and watch the night until the first train of the new day rattled by the sky would begin to lighten an hour or so after that though with the clouds so snowladen the dawn would be subtler than usual about seventhirty hed pick up the telephone and try calling gluck something hed been doing regularly both from the house and from the bakery for several days and always with the same result gluck didnt answer gluck wasnt home cal had even asked for the line to be checked in case it was faulty there was no technical problem however there was simply nobody to pick up the receiver at the other end perhaps the visitors gluck had been spying on for so long had finally taken him to their bosom a knocking at the front door brought him to his feet he looked at the clock it was a little after threethirty who the hell would come calling at this hour he stepped out into the hallway there was a sliding sound from the far side of the door was somebody pushing against it whos there he said there was no reply he took a few more steps towards the door the sliding sound had stopped but the rapping much fainter this time was repeated he unbolted the door and took off the chain the noises had ceased entirely now curiosity bettering discretion he opened the door the weight of the body on the other side threw it wide snow and balm de bono fell on the welcome mat it wasnt until cal went down on his haunches to help the man that he recognized the paincontorted features de bono had cheated fire once but this time it had caught him and more than made up for its former defeat he put his hand to the mans cheek and at his touch the eyes flickered open cal ill get an ambulance no said de bono its not safe here the look on his face was enough to silence cals objections ill get the carkeys he said and went in search of them he was returning to the front door keys in hand when a spasm ran through him as though his gut was trying to tie a knot in itself hed felt this sensation all too often of late in dreams there it meant the beast was near he stared out into the spattered darkness the street was deserted as far as he could see and silent enough to hear the snowhooded lamps hum in the cold but his heart had caught his bellys trepidation it was thumping wildly when he knelt at de bonos side again the man had made a temporary peace with his pain his face was expressionless and his voice flat which gave all the more potency to his words its coming he said its followed me a dog had started to bark at the far end of the street not the whining complaint of an animal locked out in the cold but raw alarm what is it cal said looking out at the street again the scourge oh jesus the barking had been picked up from kennels and kitchens all along the row of houses as in sleep so waking the beast was near we have to get moving cal said i dont think i can cal put his arm beneath de bono and lifted him gently into a sitting position the wounds hed received were substantial but they werent bleeding the fire had sealed them up blackening the flesh of his arms and shoulder and side his face was the colour of the snow his heat running out of him in breath and sweat im going to take you to the car cal said and pulled de bono to his feet he wasnt quite dead weight there was enough strength left in his legs to aid cal in his efforts but his head lolled against cals shoulder as they crept up the path the fire touched me de bono whispered youll survive its eating me up stop talking and walk the car was parked only a few yards down the street cal leaned de bono against the passenger side while he unlocked the doors glancing up and down the street every few seconds while his inept fingers fumbled with the keys the snow was still getting heavier shrouding both ends of the street the door was open he went round to help de bono into the passenger seat then returned to the drivers side as he stooped to get into the car the dogs all stopped barking de bono made a small sound of distress theyd done their duty as watchdogs selfpreservation silenced them now cal got into the car and slammed the door there was snow on the windscreen but there wasnt time to start scraping it off the wipers would have to take care of it he turned on the ignition the engine laboured but failed to start at his side de bono said its near cal didnt need telling he tried the key again but still the engine resisted life come on he coaxed it please his plea bore fruit on the third attempt the engine caught his instinct was to accelerate and get out of chariot street as quickly as possible but the snow falling as it did on several days accumulation of ice made the going treacherous the wheels repeatedly threatened to lose their grip the car sliding back and forth across the road but yard by yard they crept through the pall of snow which was so heavy now it reduced visibility to a car length it was only as they approached the end of chariot street that the truth came clear it wasnt just snow that was smothering them there was a fog thickening the air so dense that the car headlights had difficulty penetrating it chariot street was suddenly no longer part of the kingdom though it had been cals stamping ground since childhood it was alien territory now its landmarks erased its urbanity turned over to wasteland it belonged to the scourge and they were lost in it unable to see any sign of a turning he trusted to instinct and made a right as he swung the wheel over de bono sat bolt upright go back he yelled what back jesus back he was gripping the dashboard with his wounded hands staring into the fog ahead its there there cal glanced up as something huge moved in the fog ahead crossing the path of the car it came and went too quickly for him to gain more than a fleeting impression but that was already too much hed underestimated it in his dreams it was vaster than hed imagined and darker and emptier he struggled to put the vehicle into reverse panic making his every motion a farce off to his right the fog was folding upon itself or unfolding which direction was the thing going to come from next or was it somehow everywhere around them the fog its hatred made matter calhoun he looked at de bono then through the windscreen at the sight that had de bono rigid in his seat the fog was dividing in front of them from its depths the scourge loomed what cal saw befuddled him there was not one form emerging from the murk but two locked in a grotesque union one was hobart albeit a hobart much transfigured by the horror that now possessed him his flesh was white and there was blood running from the dozen places around his body where lines of force connected by wheels and arcs of fire entered his body and broke out the other side revolving through him as they swung to meet the second form the monstrous geometry that towered above him what cal saw in that geometry was all paradox it was bleached yet black a void yet brimming perfect in its beauty yet more profoundly rotten than any living tissue could be a living citadel of eyes and light corrupt beyond words and stinking to high heaven de bono threw himself against the door and began to wrestle with the handle the door opened but cal snatched hold of him before he could pitch himself out at the same time putting his foot on the accelerator as he did so a sheet of white flame erupted in front of the car eclipsing the scourge it was the briefest of respites the car had backed up only five yards before the scourge came at it again as it came hobart opened his mouth to a dislocating width and a voice that was not his issued from his throat i see you it said the next moment it seemed the ground beneath the car erupted and the vehicle was flung over onto the drivers side there was total confusion within as a hail of bricabrac tumbled from dashboard and glove compartment then de bono was scrabbling at the passenger door once again pushing it open despite his wounds some of a ropedancers agility was still in evidence for he was out of the felled vehicle in two economical moves get going he yelled to cal who was still attempting to work out which way was up as he stood and levered himself out of the car two sights were there to greet him one that of de bono disappearing into the fog which now seemed charged on every side with an empire of eyes the other a figure standing in the midst looking at him it seemed it was a night for familiar faces changed by circumstance first de bono then hobart and now though for an instant cal refused to believe it shadwell hed seen the man play many roles avuncular salesman wreathed in smiles and promises tormentor and seducer prophet of deliverance but here was a shadwell stripped of pretences and the actor beneath was a vacant thing his features robbed of animation hung on his bones like soiled linen only his eyes which had always been small but now seemed vestigial still preserved a trace of fervour they watched cal now as he scrambled off the car and onto the iceslick street theres nowhere left to run he said his voice was slurred as though he needed sleep its going to find you wherever you try to hide its an angel mooney it has gods eyes an angel that the fog trembled to right and left of them like living tissue at any moment it might be back upon them but the sight of shadwell and the riddle of his words kept cal glued to the spot and another puzzle too something about shadwells changed appearance which he couldnt put his finger on its called uriel shadwell said the flame of god and its here to bring an end to magic thats its only purpose an end to rapture once and for all the fog trembled again but cal still stared at shadwell too intrigued to retreat it was perverse to be vexed by trivia when a power of an angels magnitude was within spitting distance but then the mooneys had always been perverse thats my gift to the world shadwell was declaring im going to destroy the magicians every one i dont sell any longer you see i do this for love at this mention of selling cal recognized the change in the man it was sartorial shadwells jacket the jacket of illusions which had broken brendans heart and doubtless the hearts of countless others had gone in its place shadwell wore a new coat immaculately tailored but bereft of raptures were bringing an end to illusions and deceptions an end to it all as he spoke the fog shuddered and from it there came a single shriek which was cut off abruptly de bono living and dying you fucker cal said i was deceivedi shadwell replied untouched by cals hostility so terribly deceived seduced by their duplicity willing to spill blood to have what they tantalized me with and what are you doing now cal spat back still spilling blood shadwell opened his arms i come emptyhanded calhoun he replied thats my gift emptiness i dont want your damn gifts oh you do in your bones you do theyve seduced you with their circus but heres an end to that sham there was such sanity in his voice a politicians sanity as he sold his flock the wisdom of the bomb this soulless certainty was more chilling than hysteria or malice cal realized now that his first impression had been mistaken shadwell the actor had not disappeared hed simply forsaken his patter and his hyperbole for a playing style so plain so minimal it scarcely seemed like a performance at all but it was this was his triumph shadwell the naked the fog had begun to chum with fresh enthusiasm uriel was coming back cal took one more look at shadwell to fix the mask in his mind once and for all then he turned and started to run he didnt see the scourge reappear but he heard the car explode behind him and felt the blast of heat which turned the snow to a warm drizzle around his head he heard shadwells voice too carried crisply on the cold air i see you he said that was a lie he didnt and he couldnt the fog was for the moment cals ally he fled through it not caring much in which direction he went as long as he outpaced the giftgivers brute a house loomed up out of the murk he didnt recognize it but he followed the pavement until he reached the first crossroads the intersection he knew and took off back towards chariot street by a labyrinthine route designed to confuse his pursuers shadwell would guess where he was headed no doubt the living fog that concealed the scourge was probably half way down chariot street already the thought gave speed to cals feet he had to get to the house before the fire suzannas book was there the book shed given into his hands for safekeeping twice the ice underfoot brought him down twice he hauled himself up again limbs and lungs aching and ran on at the railway bridge he clambered over the wire and up onto the embankment the fog had thinned out here there was just the snow falling on the silent tracks he could see the backs of the houses clearly enough to count them as he ran until he reached the fence at the back of his fathers house he clambered over realizing as he ran past the loft that he had another duty to perform here before he could make his escape but first the book stumbling through the ruins of the garden he reached the back door and let himself in his heart was a lunatic beating against his ribs any moment the scourge would be outside and this his home would go the way of the fugue there was no time to retrieve anything of sentimental value he had seconds only to gather the bare essentials maybe not even that he picked up the book then a coat and finally went in search of his wallet a glance at the window showed him that the street outside had vanished the fog was pressing its clammy face at the glass wallet secured he raced back through the house and left by the route hed come out of the door and through the tangle of bushes his mother had planted so many springs ago at the loft he halted he couldnt take and his mate with him but he could at least give them a chance to escape if they wanted to they did they were flying back and forth in the frostproofed cage hed built for them perfectly alive to their jeopardy as soon as he opened the door they were out and into the air rising through the snow until they found the safety of the clouds as he started along the embankment not back towards the bridge but in the opposite direction he realized that he might never again see the house he was leaving behind the ache that thought awoke made the cold seem benign he paused and turned to try and hold the sight in his memory the roof the windows of his parents bedroom the garden the empty loft this was the house in which hed grown to adulthood the house where hed learned to be the man he was for better or worse here all his memories of eileen and brendan were rooted but in the end it was just bricks and mortar evil could take it as it had taken the fugue as certain as he could be that he had the picture before him memorized he headed off into the snow twenty yards on down the track a roar of destruction announced that he was a refugee part twelve stalking paradise western wind when wilt thou blow the small ram down can rain christ if my love were in my arms and i in my bed ogam anon th century i a chapter of accidents if there was any pattern at all to the events of the day following it was of reunions denied by chance and of others just as capriciously granted suzanna had decided the previous evening that shed go up to liverpool and reestablish contact with cal there was no use in circumspection now events were clearly approaching a crisispoint cal had to be warned and plans made the kind of plans that could only be made face to face about how they could best protect mimis book and their lives in the coming storm she tried calling him til about midnight but nobody answered in the morning she rang apolline fresh from salisbury to tell her what shed seen and learned at the shrine of the mortalities she was prepared for apolline to reject the information immacolatas spirit had offered out of contempt for its source but that proved not to be the case why shouldnt we believe it she said if the dead cant be honest who can besides it only confirms what we already knew suzanna told her she planned to go to liverpool and talk with cal you wont be alone up there apolline informed her some people went looking for raptures in your grandmothers house you might want to find out if they had any luck ill do that ill call you when ive seen them dont expect me to be sober before setting out suzanna tried calling chariot street once more this time her call received the number disconnected tone the operator could not tell her why the morning news bulletin would have answered the question had she switched on the radio the television would even have shown her pictures of the patch of blasted ground where the mooney house had once stood but she tuned in too late for the news only catching the weatherreport which promised snow and more snow attempting the journey by car was she knew a certain disaster instead she took a taxi to euston and the midmorning train north just about the time she was settling down for the fourhour trip to liverpool lime street which in fact took six cal was half way to birmingham on the eighttwenty train via runcorn and wolverhampton hed called gluck from a telephone box at the pier head where hed gone following the confrontation in the fog there was no particular plan in this hed just felt the need to go to the river and the last night bus before dawn had taken him there hed slipped the scourge at least for the time being he even entertained the thought that the creature might be satisfied with the devastation it had wrought but his gut knew differently the angel shadwells flame of god had an insatiable appetite for death it would not be satisfied until they were all dust shadwell included he hoped indeed the only comfort he drew from the nights horrors was the sense hed had that hed been viewing the salesmans farewell performance the wind off the river was bitter the snow in it pricked his skin like needles but he leaned on the railings and watched the water until his fingers and face were numb then with the clocks on the liver building all offering times in the vicinity of six he went in search of sustenance he was in luck a small cafe was open serving breakfast to the earlyrun bus drivers he bought himself a substantial meal thawing out as he ate his eggs and toast still trying to sort out what was for the best then around sixthirty he tried to get through to gluck he hadnt really expected any reply but luck was with him at least in this for just as he was about to put the receiver down the phone at the other end was picked up hello said a sleepthickened voice though cal knew gluck scarcely at all hed seldom if ever been so happy to make contact with someone mr gluck its cal mooney you probably wont remember me but of course i remember how are things on the mersey i have to talk to you its urgent im all ears i cant on the phone well come and see me do you have my address yes ive still got your card then come id enjoy the company these welcoming words coming after the losses of the night were almost too much cal felt his eyes pricking ill get the first train down he said ill be here cal stepped out of the telephone box into the biting air daylight was still a while away the snowbound streets were almost deserted as he trudged up towards the station a truck laboured through the gloom spreading grit on the icy road a newspaper vendor was laying out the early morning edition in the dubious shelter of a doorway otherwise he saw nobody it was difficult to imagine as he trudged that there would ever be another spring in spook city suzanna stood at the end of chariot street and stared at the sight before her there were too many people milling around for her to advance any further her suspicion of uniforms had not mellowed nor had that of cuckoos in large numbers but she could see dearly from where she stood that the mooney house no longer existed it had been razed literally to the ground and the fire that had consumed it had spread along the row in both directions the scourge had come visiting in the night trembling she left the scene and made her way to rue street fearing the worst she found there nothing she hadnt anticipated mimis house had been gutted what was she to do now return to london and leave cal if hed survived to his own devices she had no way of tracing him she could only trust that somehow hed find his way to her things were so damn chaotic with the kind spread across the country and cal missing and the book she didnt dare think too hard about that she just turned her back on the ruins of mimis house and walked away down rue street what little store of optimism shed possessed defeated by what shed seen as she turned the corner a kerbcrawler drew up alongside her and a round face wearing sunglasses leaned out of the window youre going to get cold he said go to hell she told him and quickened her step he kept pace with her i told you to go to hell she said throwing him a look intended to leave him limp he slid his glasses down his nose and stared at her the eyes revealed beneath were bright gold nimrod who else had it not been for the eyes shed never have recognized him his face had filled out all but a hint of his good looks gone i need feeding he said how about you his appetite seemed to have expanded in direct proportion to the direness of their jeopardy she sat across the table of the chinese restaurant where he took her and watched him wade through the menu devouring not only his food but most of hers too it didnt take long for them to provide each other with outlines of their recent investigations most of her news was stale stuff now the scourge was amongst them but nimrod had more current information gleaned from conversations overheard and questions asked at chariot street he was able to report no bodies had been found so it might be safely assumed that cal had not perished there remains had however been found in rue street i didnt know any of them personally he said but im afraid you did who balm de bono de bono he was at rue street last night she fell silent thinking of the brief time shed spent with de bono and of their debates together now he was gone and how soon would the rest of them follow what do we do nimrod she murmured do we try and hide again another weave there arent enough of us to fill a prayer mat nimrod said mournfully besides we dont have the raptures theres very little power left between us so we sit back and wait for the scourge to pick us off is that what youre saying nimrod drew his hand over his face ive fought about as hard as i can he said i think we all have he fetched a tobacco tin from his pocket and began to roll himself a cigarette ive made my mistakes he said i fell for shadwells lies i even fell in love you did he made a slight smile which reminded suzanna of the irrepressible creature hed once been oh yes he said ive had my adventures in the kingdom but they didnt last long there was always a part of me that never left the fugue that still hasnt left he lit the matchthin cigarette hed rolled i suppose thats ludicrousi he said given that the place doesnt exist any longer hed forsaken his dark glasses as soon as the waiter had retired his eyes their gold untarnished were on her now looking for some sliver of hope you can remember it she said the fugue of course so can i or at least i think i can so maybe it isnt lost he shook his head dont be sentimental he chided memories arent enough it was fruitless to argue the niceties of that he was telling her that he was in pain he didnt want platitudes or metaphysics she turned over in her head the problem of whether she should tell him what she knew that she had reason to hope that all was not lost that the fugue might be again one day it was she knew a slender hope but he needed a lifeline however tenuous its not over she said dream on he replied its finished i tell you the fugues not gone he looked up from his cigarette what do you mean in the gyre i used the loom used the loom what are you saying or it used me maybe a bit of both how why to keep everything from being lost nimrod was leaning across the table now i dont understand he said neither do i fully she replied but something happened some force she sighed she didnt have the words to describe those moments part of her wasnt even sure it had happened but of one thing she was certain i dont believe in defeat nimrod i dont care what this fucking scourge is i wont lie down and die because of it you dont have to he said youre a cuckoo you can walk the other way you should know better than that she said sharply the fugue belongs to anyone wholl die for it me cal he looked chastened i know he said im sorry its not just you who needs the fugue nimrod we all do she glanced towards the window through the bamboo blinds she could see that the snow was coming down again with fresh vehemence i never believed in edeni she said softly not the way the bible tells it original sin and all that crap but maybe the storys got an echo somewhere in it an echo of the way things really were a place of miracles where magic was made and the scourge ended up believing the eden story because it was a corrupted version of the truth does it matter nimrod sighed whether the scourge is an angel or not whether it comes from eden or not how does that alter anything the point is it believes its uriel and that means itll destroy us the point was incontestable when the world was coming to an end what did names matter i think we should be together he said after a pause instead of spread across the country perhaps we can muster something if were all in one place i see the sense in that better than the scourge picking us off but where there was a place he said where it never came i remember it vaguely apolline will tell us better what kind of place a hill i think it was he said his unblinking stare on the white paper tablecloth between them some kind of hill well go there then shall we its as good a place to die as any ii dust and ashes the saints on the facade of the church of st philomena and st callixtus had long since lost their faces to the rain they had no eyes to see the visitors that came to the door in the early evening of st december nor did they have ears to hear the debate on the step even if they had heard and seen even if theyd stepped off their pedestals and gone out to warn england that it had an angel in its midst their alarms would have gone unheeded england had no need of saints tonight nor any night it had martyrs enough hobart stood on the threshold the scourges light visible through the flesh of his throat and darting from the corners of his mouth he had hold of shadwells arm and would not let him step out of the snow this is a church he said not with uriels voice but with his own sometimes the angel seemed to give him the right to selfgovernment for a while only to pull the leash tight again if its host grew fractious yes its a church said shadwell and were here to destroy it hobart shook his head no he said i wont do that shadwell was too tired for argument this was not the first of the days visits since leaving chariot street the angel had led them to several sites around the country where it remembered the seerkind taking refuge during the last holocaust all had been wasted journeys the places when they were still recognizable were devoid of magic or its makers the weather had deteriorated by the hour snow now blanketed the country from one end to the other and shadwell was weary of both the trek and the chill hed become anxious too as each pursuit ended in disappointment anxious that uriel would grow impatient and his control of the creature would begin the slip that was why hed brought the angel here where he knew there was magic or its leavings this was where immacolata had made the rake a place part shrine part womb here uriels hunger for destruction would be assuaged for tonight at least we have work to do inside he told uriels host the scourges work but hobart still refused to cross the threshold we cant destroy it he said gods house there was irony aplenty in the fact that he shadwell raised a catholic and uriel gods fire should be ready to demolish this pitiful temple while hobart whose only religion had been the law refused this was the man who kept not the bible close to his heart but a book of faerytales so why this sudden fastidiousness did he sense that death was close and it was time to repent his godlessness if so shadwell was unmoved youre the dragon hobart he said you can do what you like the man shook his head and at his denial the light in his throat brightened you wanted fire youve got it shadwell went on i dont want it hobart said his words becoming choked take it away the last syllables were forced through chattering teeth smoke came too up from his belly and after it uriels voice no more argument it demanded though it seemed to have reclaimed the reins of hobarts body the man still fought to keep control for himself the conflict made him shake violently a display shadwell was certain would draw unwelcome attention if they didnt soon step out of public view there are seerkind inside he said your enemies his coaxing went unheard by either uriel or hobart either the angel was losing its grip on its vessel or hobart had developed new powers of resistance for uriel was having to fight hard to regain total possession one or other of them began to beat the bodys fist against the portico perhaps to distract its opponent the flesh caught between man and angel burst and bled shadwell tried to avoid being spattered but the inspectors grip was fiercer than ever holding him close the wasted head turned in shadwells direction from the smoky cavern between his teeth hobarts voice emerged barely decipherable get it out of me he pleaded i can do nothing shadwell said wiping a fleck of blood from his upper lip with his free hand its too late he knows that came the reply not hobarts voice this time but uriels hes the dragon forever hobart had begun to sob his snot and tears boiling away as they reached the furnace of his mouth dont be afraidi said uriel its tone a parody of shadwell at his silkiest do you hear me hobart the head nodded loosely as if the muscle of the neck it was carried on was half cut through shall we go inside said shadwell again that dislocated nodding the body was free of twitches now the face a blank as final proof of the angels triumph hobart dropped his hold on shadwell then turned and went ahead of the salesman into the church it was deserted the candles cold the smell of incense souring there are raptures here said uriel indeed there are said shadwell following the creature down the aisle to the chancel rail he had expected the crucifix above the altar to win some response from the angel but uriel passed it by without a glance and crossed to the baptistery door it laid hobarts broken hand upon the wood the boards smouldered the door flew open it was the same procedure at the second door with urielinhobart leading the way they descended into the crypt they were not alone there a light was burning at the far end of the passage along which immacolata had come to meet shadwell from the shrine presumably without further word uriel began along the corridor ribbons of its hidden self flowing from hobarts torso and grazing the caskets in the walls pleasuring in their stillness their silence it was half way between stairs and shrine when a priest stepped from an intersecting passageway and blocked the path his face was pale as if powdered a streak of blue dirt some sign of obsequience daubed in the centre of his forehead who are you he demanded step aside said shadwell youre trespassing the man retorted get out of here uriel had stopped a yard or two from where the priest stood and now threw its hand out and snatched hold of one of the casket ledges its other hand taking hold of hobarts hair and dragging the mans face towards the wall as if to beat its own skull open this was not the angels doing shadwell realized but hobarts using the distraction of the priests appearance he was again attempting to seize control the contested body immediately became epileptic a throttled roar emerging from its throat which may have been intended as a warning to the priest if so it went uncomprehended the man stood his ground as uriel twisted hobarts head back in his direction bone and cartilage audibly grinding upon each other a moment passed priest and angel face to face then uriels flame erupted from hobarts mouth the effect in the confined space of the passage was more impressive than anything shadwell had witnessed in rue street the shockwave threw him backwards but he was too much the voyeur to be denied the spectacle and hauled himself upright to watch uriels lethal theorems proved on its victim the priests body was lifted against the ceiling and pinned there until the flames had devoured it it was over in seconds and shadwell squinted through the smoke to see uriel moving off towards the shrine with hobart loosing a sobbing howl of horror at what had been done shadwell followed dwindling motes of fiery ash falling around him the fire had not just caught the priest but was eating at the very brick of the passageway and consuming the caskets in the niches the lead of their inner linings dripped from the ledges and the bodies came with it shrouds burning around their illustrious bones as he approached the door of the shrine shadwells feet slowed this had been immacolatas domain here shed been allpowerful worshipped by unmanned men whose abeyance to christ and his mother had been a sham men whod believed her a goddess hed never believed that himself so why did he have this sudden fear upon him a desecrators fear he stepped inside the shrine and there had his answer as he surveyed the bones on the walls he knew as only a lover could know that the creature hed lusted after and finally betrayed was still holding court here death had no hold on her she was in the walls or in the air somewhere near goddess he heard himself say there was no time to warn uriel a second priest younger than his dead brother appeared from the shadows and ran at the angel knife in hand hobarts cry stopped and he turned his mutinous hands to the task of preventing a second slaughter clamping them to his face to dam the coming fire the device gave the attacker time to deliver a cut the knife entering hobarts side but as the priest withdrew it for a second stab uriels benediction spurted between hobarts fingers then broke out entirely taking the flesh and bone of his hands with it the fire caught the priest head on and flung him across the shrine he danced against the bones for a heartbeat then he like his brother was ash hed done serious damage to hobart but it took uriel less time to cauterize the wound with its glance than it had taken the knife to deliver it the task done it turned its gaze on shadwell for a breathless moment the salesman thought it meant to burn him where he stood but no dont be afraid it said it had offered the same meagre comfort to hobart mere minutes before the sentiment had sounded hollow then but more so now in the light of the way it had maimed its host hobarts hands which hed once envisaged burning with righteous fire had been reduced to withered claws in the act of trying to prevent that fire from doing its work hobart was sobbing again as he or the angel held the stumps up to be examined had uriel left him with the burden of pain his nerveendings must be suffering or did he sob that his body was an instrument in these abominations the arms dropped and uriel turned his attention to the walls i like these bones it said and wandered over to the most elaborate of the designs tendrils thin as sewingthread and lightning bright skipped from its borrowed torso and face and ran over the skulls and ribcages there was a moment of hiatus the fire roaring in the niches outside the ashes of the second priest still hanging in the air in that moment shadwell heard immacolatas voice it was the most intimate of whispers a lovers whisper what have you done she said he glanced across at uriel who was still entranced by the macabre symmetry of the wall it made no sign of having heard the incantatrix again the question what have you done she said it knows no mercy he did not need to voice his response thought was enough and you did he answered i didnt know myself immacolata told him i think this scourge is the same its called uriel shadwell reminded her its an angel whatever it is you have no power over it i freed it shadwell responded it obeys me why lie immacolata said i know when youre afraid the din of destruction broke the exchange shadwell looked up from his thoughts to see uriel its tendrils extended across the wall sweep all the bones from their places like so much crockery from a piled table they fell around it in a dusty litter the remains of fully half a hundred people uriel laughed another trick it had caught from shadwell the sound made more distressing by its artificiality it had found a game it liked turning to the next wall it proceeded to vandalize that in the same manner then on to the third tell it to stop immacolatas ghost whispered as bones large and small joined the myriad on the ground if youre not afraid tell it to stop but shadwell simply watched as the angel cleared the fourth wall at a stroke then turned its attention to the ceiling youll be next immacolata said shadwell flattened himself against the now naked brick as remains rained down no he murmured the bones stopped falling there were none left on either walls or ceiling slowly the dust began to settle uriel turned to shadwell why do you whisper behind my back it enquired lightly shadwell glanced towards the door how far would he get if he tried to run now a yard or two probably there was no escape it knew it heard where is she uriel demanded the demolished chamber was hushed from one end to the other make her show herself she used me shadwell began shell tell you lies tell you i loved raptures i didnt you must believe me i didnt he felt the angels countless eyes upon him their stare silenced him you can hide nothing from me the angel pronounced i know what youve desired in all its triviality and you neednt fear me no no i enjoy the dust you are shadwell i enjoy your futility your meaningless desires but the other thats here the woman whose raptures i can smell she i want to kill tell her to show herself and be done with it shes dead already so why does she hide i dont came immacolatas voice and the bones on the floor churned like a sea as the ghost rose from them not simply from them but of them defying uriels destruction as her will made a new anatomy from the fragments the result was far more than a sum of its parts it was shadwell saw not one but all of the sisters or a projection of their collective spirit why should i hide from you the monument said every shard in its body revolved as she spoke are you happy now she asked what is happy uriel wanted to know dont bother to protest your innocence the phantom said you know you dont belong in this world i came here before and you left do so again when im done uriel replied when the rapturemakers are extinguished thats my duty duty immacolata said and her bones laughed why do i amuse you uriel demanded you are so deceived you think youre alone i am alone no youve forgotten yourself and so youve been forgotten i am uriel i guard the gate you are not alone nobody nothing is alone youre part of something more i am uriel i guard the gate theres nothing left to guard immacolata said but your duty i am uriel i look at yourself i dare you throw the man youre wearing away and look at yourself uriel did not speak its reply but shrieked it i will not and with its words it unleashed its fury against the body of bones the statue flew apart as the fire struck it burning fragments shattering against the walls shadwell shielded his face as uriels flame ran back and forth across the chamber to eradicate the incantatrixs image completely it was not satisfied for a long while scouring each corner of the shrine until every last offending shard was chased to ash only then did that same sudden tranquillity descend that shadwell loathed so much the angel sat hobarts wretched body on a pile of bones and picked up a skull between the fireblackened hands might it not be cleaner the angel said its words measured if we emptied the whole world of living things the suggestion was floated so delicately its tone so perfectly a copy of shadwells reasonable man that it took him a moment to comprehend the ambition of what it proposed well it said might it not it looked up at shadwell though its features were still in essence hobarts all trace of the man had been banished from them uriel shone from every pore i asked a question it said would that not be fine shadwell murmured that it would then we should see such afire shouldnt we it said rising from its seat of bones it went to the door and stared off down the passageway where the caskets still burned ohit said with yearning in its voice such afire then eager not to delay its goals consummation by a moment it started back towards the stairs and the sleeping kingdom beyond iv the secret isle the train was an hour late reaching birmingham when it finally arrived the snow was still falling and taxis couldnt be had for love nor money cal asked for directions to harborne and waited in line for twentyfive minutes to board the bus which then crawled from stop to stop taking on further chilled passengers until it was so overburdened it could carry no more progress was slow the citycentre was snarled with traffic reducing everything to a snails pace once out of the centre the roads were hazardous dusk and snow conspiring to cut visibility and the driver never risked more than ten miles an hour everyone sat in wilful cheerfulness avoiding each others eyes for fear of having to make conversation the woman whod seated herself beside cal was nursing a small terrier encased in a tartan coat and a picture of misery several times he caught its doleful eyes regarding him and returned its gaze with a consoling smile hed eaten on the train but he still felt lightheaded utterly divorced from the dismal scenes their route had to offer the wind slapped him from his reverie however once he stepped out of the bus on harborne hill the woman with the tartan dog had given him directions to waterloo road assuring him that it was a threeminute trot at the outside in fact it took him almost half an hour to find during which time the chill had clawed its way through his clothes and into his marrow glucks house was a large doublefronted building its facade dominated by a monkeypuzzle tree which rose to challenge the eaves twitching with cold he rang the bell he didnt hear it sound in the housei so he knocked hard then harder a light was turned on in the hallway and after what seemed an age the door was opened to reveal gluck the remains of a chewed cigar in his hand grinning and instructing him to get in out of the cold before his balls froze he didnt need a second invitation gluck closed the door after him and threw a piece of carpet against it to keep out the draught then led cal down the hallway it was a tight squeeze the passage was all but choked by cardboard boxes piled to well above head height are you moving cal asked as gluck ushered him into an idyllically warm kitchen which was similarly littered with boxes bags and piles of paperwork good god no gluck replied take off your wet stuff ill fetch you a towel cal skinned off his soaked jacket and equally sodden shirt and was taking off his shoes which oozed water like sponges when gluck returned with not only a towel but a sweater and a pair of balding corduroys try these he said slinging the clothes into cals lap ill make some tea you like tea he didnt wait for an answer i live on tea sweet tea and cigars he filled the kettle and lit the antiquated gas cooker that done he fetched a pair of hikers socks from the radiator and gave them to cal getting warmer he asked much id offer you something stronger he said as he produced teacaddy sugar and a chipped mug from a cupboard but i dont touch it my father died of drink he put several heaped spoons of tea into the pot i must tell you he said wreathed in steam i never expected to hear from you again sugar please pick up the milk will you well go through to the study taking the pot sugar and mug he led cal out of the kitchen and upstairs to the first landing it was in the same condition as the floor below its decoration neglected its lamps without shades and heaped everywhere the same prodigious amount of paperwork as though some mad bureaucrat had willed gluck his lifes work he pushed open one of the doors and cal followed him into a large cluttered room more boxes more files which was hot enough to grow orchids in and reeked of stale cigar smoke gluck set the tea down on one of the halfdozen tables claiming his own mug from beside a heap of notes then drew two armchairs up beside the electric fire sit sit he exhorted cal whose gaze had been drawn to the contents of one of the boxes it was full to brimming with dried frogs ah said gluck no doubt youre wondering yes cal confessed i am why frogs why indeed gluck replied its one of the countless questions were trying to answer it isnt just frogs of course we get cats dogs a lot of fish weve had tortoises aeschylus was killed by a tortoise thats one of the first recorded falls falls from the heavens said gluck how many sugars frogs from the sky its very common sugars two cal peered into the box again and took a trio of frogs out each was tagged on the tag was written the date it fell and where one had come down in utah one in dresden a third in county cork are they dead on arrival he asked not always said gluck handing cal his tea sometimes they arrive unharmed other times in pieces theres no pattern to it or rather there is but weve still to find it he sipped his tea noisily now he said youre not here to talk about frogs no im not what are you here to talk about i dont know where to begin those are always the best tales gluck declared his face glowing begin with the most preposterous cal smiled here was a man ready for a story well he said taking a deep breath and he began hed intended to keep the account short but after ten minutes or so gluck began to interrupt his story with discretionary questions it consequently took several hours to tell the whole thing during which gluck smoked his way through an heroic cigar at last the narrative reached glucks doorstep and it became shared memory for two or three minutes gluck said nothing nor did he even look at cal but studied the debris of stubs and matches in the ashtray it was cal who broke the silence do you believe me he said gluck blinked and frowned as though hed been stirred from thoughts of something entirely different shall we make some more tea he said he tried to stand up but cal took fierce hold of his arm do you believe me he demanded of course said gluck with a trace of sadness in his voice i think im obliged to youre sane youre articulate youre damnably particular yes i believe you but you must understand cal that in doing so i deliver a mortal blow to several of my fondest illusions you are looking at a man in mourning for his theories he stood up ah well he picked up the pot from the table then set it down again come next doori he said there were no curtains at the window of the next room through it cal saw that the snow had thickened to nearblizzard proportions while hed been talking the garden at the back of the house and the houses beyond had become a white nowhere but gluck hadnt brought him in to show him the view it was the walls he was directing cals attention to every available inch was covered with maps most of which looked to have been up there since the world was young they were stained with an accrual of cigar smoke scrawled over in a dozen different pens and infested with countless coloured pins each presumably marking a place where some anomalous phenomenon had occured and on the fringes of these maps tacked up in mindboggling profusion were photographs of the events grainy thumbnail pictures footwide enlargements strips of sequential images lifted from a home movie there were many he could make no sense of and others that looked patently fake but for every blurred or phony photograph there were two that pictured something genuinely startling like the frumpy woman standing in a domestic garden up to her ankles in what seemed to be a trawlers deepsea catch or the policeman standing guard outside a threestorey house which had fallen over on its face though not a single brick was out of place or the car bonnet which bore the imprint of two human faces side by side some of the pictures were comical in their casual weirdness others had a grim authenticity about them the witnesses sometimes distressed sometimes shielding their faces that was anything but amusing but all whether ludicrous or alarming went to support the same thesis that the world was stranger than most of humankind ever assumed this is just the tip of the iceberg said gluck ive got thousands of these photographs tens of thousands of testimonies some of the pictures cal noted were linked by threads of various colours to pins in the maps you think theres a pattern here said cal i believe so but now after hearing what youve told me i begin to think maybe i was looking in the wrong place for it some of my evidence you see overlaps with your account for the last three weeks while you were trying to contact me max and i were up in scotland looking at a site we just found in the highlands we picked up some very strange articles there id assumed it was a landing place of some kind for our visitors i think now i was wrong it was probably the valley your unweaving took place in what did you find the usual debris coins clothing personal effects of one kind or another we boxed them all up and brought them back down with us to examine at leisure we could have made them fit our pet theories you know but now i think much of thats in ruins id like to see that stuff cal said ill unpack it for youi said gluck his expression since cal had told his story had been that of a deeply perplexed man even now he surveyed the map room with something akin to despair in the past few hours hed seen his whole worldview thrown into disarray im sorry said cal what for gluck replied telling me about miracles please dont be ill just as happily believe in your mystery as in mine itll just take a little time to adjust all i ask is that the mystery be there oh it isi said cal believe me it is i just dont know where his attention strayed from glucks face to the window and the blank scene beyond more and more he feared for his beloved exiles the night the scourge and the snow all seemed to be conspiring to erase them he crossed to the window the temperature plummeted as he approached the icy glass i have to find them he said i have to be with them hed successfully kept his sense of desolation at bay until now but sobs suddenly wracked him he heard gluck come to his side but he didnt have sufficient mastery of himself to control his tears they kept falling gluck put a comforting hand on his shoulder its good to see somebody so in need of the miraculousi he said well find your seerkind mooney trust me if theres a clue to their whereabouts its here we have to be quick cal said softly i know but well find them not just for you but for me i want to meet your lost people theyre not mine in a way they are and youre theirs i could see that on your face thats why i believe you where do we begin that was cals question the house was packed with reports from basement to attic perhaps as gluck had said there was somewhere amongst them a clue a line in a report a photograph that would point to the kinds location but where how many testimonies would they have to dig through before they uncovered some hint of the hiding place that assumed of course that in this time of jeopardy theyd band together if not if they were spread across the isles then it was a completely lost cause as opposed to one almost lost cal chided himself for that thought it was no use being defeatist he had to believe that there was a chance of discovery had to believe the task before them wasnt just a way to occupy the time before the cataclysm he would take gluck as his model gluck whod spent his life in pursuit of something hed never really seen not doubting for an instant the validity of that pursuit gluck who even now was brewing tea and digging out files behaving as though he believed to his core that the solution to their problem was close at hand theyd made a base in the study gluck had cleared the largest desk and laid on it a map of britain so vast it hung over the top like a tablecloth the spectred isle he said to cal study it a while see if any of the sites weve investigated down the years ring a bell all right ill go sort through the reports and break open the boxes we brought from scotland he got about his business leaving cal to peruse the map which was even more heavily annotated than those in the next room many of the symbols crossed lines and dusters of dots accompanied by cryptic acronyms what the letters ufo signified needed no explanation but what was a suspected tmd or a cirrus vs he decided to ignore the notes which were only distracting him and simply examine the map systematically quarter inch by quarter inch beginning at lands end and working his way back and forth across the country he was grateful that he need only examine the land because the seas around britain those regions whose names had always enchanted him on the weather reports fastnet viking forties tiree those too had their share of miracles it stood to reason if there were squid falling on suburbia perhaps there were rains of tyres and chimney stacks on the north sea he had moved to and fro across the country half a dozen times when gluck reappeared any luck he wanted to know not so far said cal gluck put a foothigh heap of reports on one of the chairs maybe well find something here he said ive started with events in the neighbourhood of spook city and well spread out from there seems logical you dig in anything that seems faintly familiar set aside as long as you keep reading ill keep supplying gluck pinned the map up on the wall beside the desk and left cal to wade through the first collection of reports the work required concentration which cal found hard to come by it was tenthirty and he already wanted sleep but as he leafed through this catalogue of neglected wonders his weary eyes and wearier brain forgot their fatigue reinvigorated by the startling stuff before them many of the incidents were variations on by now familiar themes events in defiance of laws geographical temporal and metrological misplaced menageries excursions from distant stars houses larger inside than out radios that picked up the voices of the dead ice in midsummer trees and hives that hummed the lords prayer all these things had taken place not in the faraway but in preston and healey bridge in scunthorpe and windermere solid stoical places inhabited by pragmatists not prone to hysteria this country which gluck had called the spectred isle was alive from one end to the other with delirious visions it too was wonderland gluck came and went supplying fresh files and fresh tea at intervals but otherwise doing as little as possible to disturb cals concentration it was difficult cal found not to be sidetracked by many of the more bizarre accounts but by disciplining himself severely he sifted out the one in every hundred or so that contained some detail that might connect the event described with the fugue or its inhabitants some he knew of already the destruction of shearmans house for instance but there were other reports of words seen in the air of a man whose pet monkey quoted the psalms which had occurred in places hed never heard of perhaps the kind were there now it was only when he decided to take a short break from his labours that gluck mentioned hed unpacked the boxes theyd brought from scotland and asked if cal wanted to examine the contents he followed gluck back into the map room and there every item tagged and marked meticulously was the litter events in the valley had left behind there wasnt much either the survivors had destroyed the bulk of it or natural processes had done the job but there were a few pitiful reminders of the disaster personal belongings of no particular interest and some weaponry into both categories weapon and personal effects fell the one item that made cals skin run with gooseflesh there laid across one of the boxes was shadwells jacket he stared at it nervously something you recognize said gluck cal told him what and from where my god said gluck thats the jacket his incredulity was understandable viewed by the light of a bare bulb there was nothing so remarkable about the garment but it still took cal a minute to pluck up the courage to pick it up the lining which had probably seduced hundreds in its time seemed quite unexceptional there was perhaps a gleam in the cloth that was not entirely explicable but no more evidence than that of its powers perhaps theyd gone out of it now that its owner had discarded it but cal wasnt willing to take the risk he threw it down again covering up the lining we should take it with us gluck said when we go go where to meet with the seerkind no i dont think so surely it belongs with themi gluck said maybei cal replied without conviction but we have to find them first back to work then he returned to the reports taking a break had been an error he found it difficult to reestablish his rhythm but he pushed on using as a spur the sad remains next door and the thought that they might soon represent his last keepsakes of the kind at threefortyfive in the morning he finished going through the reports gluck had taken the opportunity to sleep for a while in one of the armchairs cal stirred him and presented him with the nine key files hed selected is this all said gluck there were others i wasnt sure about i kept them aside but i thought they might be red herrings true enough said gluck he went over to the map and put pins in the nine locations then he stood back and looked there was no discernible pattern to the sites they were spread irregularly over the country not one was within fifty miles of another nothing said cal dont be so hasty gluck told him sometimes the connections take a little while to become apparent we dont have a while cal reminded him wearily the long hours of sleeplessness were catching up with him his shoulder where shadwells bullet had wounded him ached indeed his whole body ached its useless he said let me study it said gluck see if i can find the pattern cal threw up his hands in exasperation there is no pattern he said all i can do is go to those places one by one why dont you go lay your head down for a few hours i prepared a bed in the spare room its up one more flight second on your left i feel so bloody useless youll be even more useless if you dont get some sleep go on i think ill have to ill get going first thing he climbed the stairs the upper landing was cold his breath went before him he didnt undress but slung the blankets over him and left it at that there were no curtains at the frostencrusted window and the snow outside cast a blue luminescence into the room bright enough to read by but it didnt keep him from sleep more than thirty seconds iv past hope they came at the summons all of them came in ones and twos sometimes sometimes in families or groups of friends they came with few suitcases the only possessions they cared about those theyd brought out of the fugue and carried upon their persons souvenirs of their lost world stones seeds the keys of their houses and of course they brought their raptures what few they had brought them to the place nimrod had told suzanna about but had failed to name apolline had remembered it however it was a place in the time before the weave that the scourge had never found it was called payments hill suzanna feared that the cuckoos would have wrought some profound change on the area dug it up or levelled it but no the hill was untouched and the copse below it where the families had spent that distant summer had flourished and become a wood shed also questioned the wisdom of their taking refuge out of doors in such appalling weather the pundits were already pronouncing this the bitterest december in living memory but she was assured that beleaguered as they were the kind had solutions to such simple problems they had been safe below rayments hill once perhaps they would be safe there again the sense of relief amongst them at being reunited was palpable though most had survived well enough in the kingdom circumstances had obviously required that they keep their grief hidden now back amongst their own people they could reminisce about the old country and that was no small comfort nor were they entirely defenceless here though their powers were vastly reduced without the fugue to fuel them they still had one or two deceiving raptures to call into play it was doubtful theyd keep the power that had destroyed chariot street at bay for long but beggars couldnt be choosers and when they were finally gathered in the groves between the trees their collective presence working a subtle transformation upon bush and branch she felt the indisputable rightness of this decision if the scourge eventually found them theyd at least be together at the end there were only two notable absentees cal was one of course the other was the book shed given into his hands a book whose living pages had contained echoes of this midwinter wood she prayed they were both safe somewhere the book and its keeper safe and dreaming perhaps it was the thought hed been in the process of shaping when sleep came which prompted the dream he had he imagined that he woke and reaching into the pocket of his jacket which was unaccountably deep took out the book which hed saved from destruction back at chariot street he tried to open it but his fingers were numb and he fumbled like a fool when eventually he got the trick there was a shock waiting for the pages were blank every one of them blank as the world outside the window the stories and the illustrations had gone and the snow kept falling on the seas of viking and dogger bank and on the land too it fell on healey bridge and blackpool on bath and devizes burying the houses and streets the factories and the cathedrals filling the valleys until they were indistinguishable from the hills blinding the rivers smothering the trees until at last the spectred isle was as blank as the pages of suzannas book all this made perfect sense to his dreaming self for were they not part of the same story the book and the world outside it warp and weft one world indivisible the sights made him afraid emptiness was inside and out and he had no cure for it suzanna he murmured in his sleep longing to put his arms around her to hug her close to him but she wasnt near even in dreams he could not pretend she was near couldnt bring her to his side all he could do was hope she was safe hope she knew more than he did about keeping nullity at bay i dont remember being happy a voice out from the past whispered in his ear he couldnt put a name to it but he knew its owner was long gone he pressed his dream into reverse in pursuit of its identity the words came again more strongly i dont remember being happy memory gave him the name this time and a face too it was lilia pellicia and she was standing at the bottom of the bed only it wasnt the bed hed gone to sleep in it wasnt even the same room he looked round there were others here too conjured from the past freddy cammell was peering at his reflection apolline was straddling a chair a bottle to her lips at her side stood jerichau nursing a goldeneyed child he knew now where he was and when this was his room in chariot street the night the fragment of the carpet had come unwoven without prompting lilia spoke again the same line that had brought him here i dont remember being happy why of all the extraordinary sights hed seen and conversations hed heard since that night had his memory chosen to replay this moment lilia looked at him her distress was all too apparent it was as though her secondsight had predicted the night of snow he was dreaming through had known even then that all was lost he wanted to comfort her wanted to tell her that happiness was possible but he had neither the conviction nor the will to misrepresent the truth apolline was speaking now what about the hill she said what about the hill he thought if hed once known what shed been talking about hed forgotten since what was it called she asked where we stayed her words began to slide away go on he willed her but the remembered warmth of the room was already fading a chill from the present had crept over him driving that balmy august night into retreat he listened still his heart beginning to thump in his head his brain hadnt rerun this conversation arbitrarily there was method in it some secret was about to be divulged if he could only hold on long enough what was it called apollines faltering voice repeated where we stayed that last summer i remember that as if it were yesterday she looked across at lilia for a reply cal looked too answer her he thought but the chill was getting worse summoning him back from the past into the bleak present he desperately wanted to take with him the clue that was hovering on lilias lips i remember that apolline said again her stridency growing thinner with every syllable as if it were yesterday he stared at lilia willing her to speak she was already as transparent as cigarette smoke please god answer her he said as her image began to flicker out entirely she opened her mouth to speak for a moment it seemed hed lost her but her reply came so softly it hurt to listen for it rayments hill she said then shed gone rayments hill he woke with the words on his lips the blankets had slid off him as he slept and he was so cold his fingers were numb but hed claimed the place from the past that was all he needed he sat up there was daylight at the window the snow was still coming down gluck he called where are you kicking a box of notes downstairs in his haste he went in search of the man and found him slumped in the armchair where hed sat to hear cal tell his tale he shook glucks arm telling him to wake up but he was swimming in deep waters and didnt surface until cal said virgil at which his eyes opened as though hed been slapped what he said he squinted up at cal oh its you i thought i heard my father he ran his palm over his bleary features what time is it i dont know morning sometime want some tea gluck i think i know where they are the words brought him round he stood up mooney you mean it where what do you know about a place called rayments hill never heard of it then thats where they are part thirteen magic night the woods are lovely dark and deep but i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep robert frost stopping by woods on a snowy evening i blizzard ice had stopped the clocks of england though the meteorologists had been predicting siberian conditions for more than a week the sudden drop in temperature found the country as usual unprepared trains had ceased to run aircraft were grounded telephone and power lines were down in yorkshire and lincolnshire villages and even small towns in the southern counties cut off by drifting snow the plea from the media was to stay at home advice that was widely taken leaving industry and commerce to dwindle and in some areas stop entirely nobody was moving and with good reason large sections of motorway were closed either blocked by snow or stranded vehicles the major roads were a nightmare the minor roads impassable to all intents and purposes the spectred isle had ground to a halt it had taken cal some time to locate rayments hill amongst glucks comprehensive supply of maps but he found it eventually it was in somerset south of glastonbury in ordinary conditions it was perhaps an hours drive down the m today however god alone knew how long it would take gluck of course wanted to come with him but cal suspected that if the seerkind were indeed in hiding at the hill theyd not take kindly to his bringing a stranger into their midst he put the point to gluck as gently as he could try as he might gluck couldnt conceal his disappointment but said he understood how delicate these encounters could be hed been preparing himself for just such a meeting all his life he would not insist and yes of course cal could take one of the cars though neither was exactly reliable as cal prepared to leave bundled up as best they could devise against the cold gluck presented him with a parcel roughly tied up with string what is it he asked the jacket gluck replied and some of the other evidence i picked up i dont want to take it especially not the jacket its their magic isnt it gluck said take it damn you dont make a thief of me under protest i put some cigars in too a little peace offering from a friend he grinned i envy you cal every frozen mile he had time to doubt as he drove time to call himself a fool for hoping again for even daring to believe some memory hed dredged up would lead him to the lost ones but his dream or a part of it at least was validated as he drove england was a blank page the blizzard had blotted everything out somewhere beneath its shroud people were presumably about their lives but there was little sign of that doors were locked and curtains closed against a day that had begun back towards night somewhere around noon those few hardy souls who were out in the storm hurried along the pavements as fast as the ice underfoot would allow eager to be back beside their fires where the television would be promising a christmas of plastic snow and sentiment there was practically no traffic on the roads which allowed cal to take liberties with the law crossing intersections on red and ignoring oneway systems as he escaped the city gluck had helped him plan his route before he left and the news bulletins kept him alerted to road closures so he made reasonably good progress at first joining the m south of birmingham and managing a steady forty miles an hour until just north of the worcester junction the radio informed him that a fatal accident had dosed the motorway between junctions eight and nine cursing he was obliged to leave the motorway and take the a through great malvern tewkesbury and gloucester going was much slower here no attempt had been made to dear or grit the road and several vehicles had simply been abandoned by drivers whod decided that to press on was tantamount to suicide the weather worsened as he approached bristol obliging him to cut his speed to a crawl blinded by snow he missed the turn for the a and had to retrace his route the sky now almost pitch black though it was still only the middle of the afternoon a mile or so short of shepton mallet he stopped for petrol and chocolate to be told by a garage attendant that most of the roads south of the town were blocked he began to feel plotted against it was as though the weather was somehow part of the scourges masterplan that it knew he was near and was throwing obstacles in his path to see just how hard hed fight to reach his place of execution but if that were so then at least it meant he was on the right track that somewhere in the wilderness ahead his loved ones were waiting the truth in the warning hed been given at the garage became all too apparent when he turned off the a road at lydford on fosse and onto a minor thoroughfare that would in theory carry him west to rayments hill hed known before setting out that this would be the most problematic part of the journey but there was no alternative no main road fed this area there were only narrow tracks and backwaters most of which he knew would have been buried beneath the drifts he advanced maybe two miles the road ahead white on white until the iceclogged tread of the tyres would no longer grip and the car came to a halt its spinning wheels doing no more than kick up sheets of snow he revved the engine bullying it and coaxing it by turns but the vehicle was not going to move without help reluctantly he got out and immediately sank to midshin in the snow gluck had lent him a pair of hiking boots and heavy socks which protected his feet but the chill soaked through his trousers in an instant he put up the hood of his anorak again glucks gift and trudged round to the back of the car having no shovel all he could do was clear the snow by hand his efforts bore no fruit after twenty minutes work he hadnt succeeded in getting the car to move an inch either forward or backward he decided to give up on the task before his fingertips froze taking refuge in the car the engine idling so as to keep the heat coming he sat and considered the options available to him the last sign of human habitation had been back at the turn into this road two miles behind him two miles of digging through the drifts with the snow still falling in near as damnit total darkness suppose after that walk he could get someone foolish or charitable enough to help him hours would have been lost there were two other options one that he stay where he was and sit out the night this he rejected without a second thought the other that he finish the journey to rayments hill on foot to judge by his map which was not detailed the road forked a little way on if he were to take the lefthand track it would in principle take him to the vicinity of the hill hed be guided almost entirely by instinct however for virtually all distinguishing features of the landscape ditches hedgerows the road itself had disappeared but what else could he do it was better to travel blind than not at all with the decision made his spirits rose and he turned his attention to the problem of protecting himself against the elements in the back of the car upturned between the seats and presumably overlooked he found a box of glucks precious reports hoping hed be forgiven this trespass he clambered over onto the back seat and proceeded to put several layers of paper and photographs between his skin and his clothing insulating himself with tales of falling frogs and talking bees the supply exhausted he tore up the box itself and double lined his trousers which would take the brunt of the cold with cardboard finally he ripped up two chamois leathers he found on the back window ledge and wrapped them around his face pulling his anorak hood up and tying its drawstring tight to seal himself in with more paper lining his gloves he was as ready for the onslaught as hed ever be picking up the parcel gluck had given him he turned off the engine and stepped out to meet the snow this is the act of a lunatic he thought as he slammed the door and began to trudge away from the car im mad mooney to the bitter end it wasnt as dark outside as hed anticipated in the time it had taken to prepare for his march the fury of the blizzard had abated somewhat and the landscape was suffused with a milky brightness the canvas of snow more luminous than the laden sky above it there were even breaks in the cloud stars glimmered between he began to think he might have a chance after all the first quartermile did nothing to dispel his optimism but with the next quarter his makeshift insulation began to fail the damp started to creep through the cardboard beneath his trousers numbing his legs it crept through his gloves and their lining too making his fingers ache worse still he couldnt find any sign of the fork in the road marked on the map and became more certain with every dragging step that hed missed the turning his present route leading away from the hill rather than towards it he decided to take a risk and strike out across the fields the land to his left rose steeply perhaps at the top hed get a better grasp of the lay of the land he glanced back in the direction of the car but he could no longer see it no matter he was committed now he made towards the white face of the hill and began to climb the break in the clouds had grown larger and there was an expanse of glittering sky above him pinpointed with stars hed learned the names of the major constellations when he bought his telescope and he could name them easily he the memory man they meant nothing of course those names except in the human perspective they were just tags bestowed by some stargazer whod seemed to see a pattern in the scattering overhead a bow and arrow a bear a plough they meant nothing in the cosmic context but it was a necessary comfort to see the stars and call them by name as if you knew them as friends without that courtesy the sight might break a mans heart the ache in his legs and hands was contagious his arms and torso had caught it so had his prick and balls his ears and sinuses indeed there seemed to be no part of him that didnt give him pain but there was no going back another thirty yards would bring him to the top of the hill he estimated and began to count them off at eighteen he had to stop to gain some breath for the remaining twelve walking against both the snow and the incline was claiming more energy than he had to give as he stood gasping for air like an asthmatic he glanced down at the tracks hed left in the snow hed taken his path to be straight but it wandered back and forth wildly not wanting to think about what that signified he turned back to his ascent every step now was a major challenge he was obliged to lift his knees to groin height in order to step over the snow rather than try and drag through it his freezing muscles protested every stride but he finally got there presented at the summit with a pure white panorama it was a as though the house of england had been deserted and a dustsheet thrown over its furniture til the owners returned if they returned it was possible standing on the rise looking down on the blankness below the silence utter to believe they would never come back to this forsaken place and that he was alone but there was a hill and it could only be the one he sought because there was no other between it and the place he stood however lay an expanse of snowcovered fields at the sight of the distance he had yet to cover his innards seemed to sink but he knew that standing still would only make his muscles seize up and so began to career down the slope barely in control of his body towards the bottom the snow became deeper and deeper still until he was waisthigh in it and he was not so much walking as swimming but as he started across the field towards the hill the crippling ache of cold began to fade and a welcome deadness replaced it half way across his fingers let slip the package gluck had given him a fact his increasingly narrowed consciousness was barely aware of his shrinking thoughts had turned to how comfortable the snow he was ploughing through looked maybe he should give up his trek for a while and lay down on this pristine pillow his head was heavier by the moment and the snow would be oh so comfortable where was the harm in lying down in it til he felt stronger but lazy as his thoughts were becoming he wasnt so far gone not to know sleep would kill him if he stopped now he stopped forever he reached the bottom of rayments hill on the verge of collapse then drove himself step by step up the slope it was longer than the first one but not so steep he couldnt think far enough ahead to wonder what hed find on the other side it took all his mental effort to instruct his limbs to move but as he came within a few yards of the brow he raised his head in the dim hope of seeing the stars the clouds had sealed them from sight however a fresh assault was mustering in the sky two more steps and he reached the summit turning his gaze on the landscape laid out below the hill there was nothing to see no sign of anything even resembling a hiding place however vestigial for as far as his appalled sight stretched only snowcovered fields and more of the same rolling away into the distance deserted and silent he was alone if hed had the strength to weep he would have wept instead he let his exhaustion triumph and he fell down in the snow there was no way he could make the return journey to the car even if hed been able to find his way that fatal sleep hed kept denying himself would just have to claim him but as his lids began to dose he caught a movement in the wastes at the base of the hill something was running about in the snow he tried to focus failed pressed his fingers to his face to stir himself looked up and tried again his eyes didnt deceive him there was something moving on the blank page in front of him an animal of some kind could it be a monkey he plunged his arms into the snow and hauled himself up but as he did so he lost his balance and pitched forward for several seconds earth and sky became a blur as he tumbled down the slope coming to a halt encased in ice it took him a moment to reorient himself but when he did he saw the animal and yes it was a monkey fleeing from him he stood up more snow than man and stumbled after it where in gods name was it running to there were only open fields ahead of it suddenly the animal vanished one moment it was plainly in front of him and he was gaining on it the very next it had disappeared from the field as though it had fled through an open door and slammed it closed he halted not believing the evidence of his befuddled sight was the animal a mirage of some kind or had the cold simply undone his sanity he stared at the snow there were distinctly tracks there paw tracks where the monkey had been playing he followed them and the testimony of his eyes was confirmed the tracks stopped dead a few feet from where he stood beyond the spot there was simply clean crisp snow acres of it all right he said to the empty field where are you as he spoke he took another step towards the place where the monkey had pulled its disappearing trick and asked his question again please he said his voice failing where are you there was no answer of course mirages were silent he stared at the tracks and felt the last vestiges of hope go out of him then a voice said dont stand in the cold he looked up there was nobody visible to right or left of him but the instructions came again two paces forward and be quick about it he took one tentative step as he was about to take the second an arm appeared from the air directly in front of him and seizing hold of his anorak claimed him from the snow ii shelter from the storm there was a wood on the other side of the curtain through which cal had been yanked its thatch of branches so dense all but a sprinkling of snow had been kept from the ground so that it was mossy and leafstrewn underfoot the place was dark but he could see a fire burning some way off from him its light welcome its promise of warmth even more so of the man whod dragged him out of the snow there was no sign at least he failed to see anyone until a voice said terrible weather were having and he turned to find the monkey novello and its human companion standing no more than two yards from him camouflaged by stillness it was smith who did it said the monkey leaning towards cal him who pulled you through dont let them blame me the man threw the animal a sideways glance hes not speaking to me novello announced because i strayed outside well its done now isnt it why dont you come along to the fire youd better lie down before you fall down yes cal said please smith led the way cal followed his stupefied brain still grappling with what hed just experienced the kind might be cornered but they werent without a trick or two the illusion that kept this wood from sight had survived dose scrutiny and once on the other side there was a second surprise the season though the branches of the trees above him were bare and it was last summers moss he was walking on there was a scent of spring in the air as if the ice that gripped the spectred isle from end to end had no hold here sap was rising buds were swelling things on every side were turning their cells to the sweet labour of growth the sudden clemency induced a mild euphoria in him but his frozen limbs hadnt got the message as he came within a few yards of the fire he felt his body lose its power to hold itself up he reached out to one of the trees for support but it stepped away from him or so it seemed and he fell forward he didnt hit the ground there were arms to catch him and he gave himself over to them they carried him to the vicinity of the fire and he was gently laid down a hand touched his cheek and he looked away from the flames to see suzanna kneeling at his side firelight on her face he said her name or at least hoped he did then he passed out it had happened before that hed closed his eyes seeing her only to wake and find her gone but not this time this time she was waiting for him on the other side of sleep not just waiting but holding him and rocking him the layers of clothes paper pulp and photographs hed been wearing had been peeled off him as he slept and a blanket wrapped around his nakedness i found my way home he said to her when he could get his tongue to work again i went to chariot street to fetch you she said but the house had gone i know and rue street too he nodded de bono came looking for me he halted silenced by the memory even the fire and her arms around him couldnt prevent his shuddering as he stood again in the fog and glimpsed what it had half concealed the scourge came after us he said and shadwell she added yes how did you know she told him about the shrine so what happens now he said we wait we keep the rapture up and we wait were all here now you were the only one missing im found now he said softly she tightened her hold on him and therell be no more separations she said well just have to pray they pass us by no praying please said a voice from behind suzanna we dont want angels hearing us cal craned his neck to see the newcomer the lines on the face before him were deeper than theyd been the beard a little more grizzled but it was still lems face lems smile poet lo said bending to put his hand through cals hair we almost lost you no chance said cal with a slow smile have you still got the fruits lo patted the breast pocket of his coat the modernity of which rather suited him got them here he said speaking of which is the man hungry i can always eat said cal theres food to be had when you want it thank you lem was about to depart then turned back and very solemnly said will you help me plant calhoun when the time comes you know i will lem nodded ill see you in a while he said and withdrew from the circle of firelight are my clothes dry cal asked i cant wander around like this let me see if i can borrow something for you suzanna replied he sat up to let her rise but before she did so she kissed him on the lips it was not a casual kiss its touch did more to warm him than a dozen fires when she left his side he had to wrap the blanket around him to cover up the fact that more than sap was rising tonight alone he had time to think though hed come within spitting distance of death it was already difficult to remember the pain hed been in such a short time ago possible even to think there was no world at all beyond this enchanted wood and that they could stay here forever and make magic but seductive as that thought was he knew indulging it even for a moment was dangerous if there was to be a life for the kind after tonight if by some miracle uriel and its keeper did pass them by then that life had to be lived as part of the wonderland hed found in glucks bureau of miracles one world indivisible after a dozing time suzanna returned with a collection of clothes and laid them beside him im going to make a round of the lookouts she said til see you later he thanked her for the clothes and began to dress this was his second borrowed skin in twentyfour hours and it was predictably given its source odder than anything gluck had supplied he took pleasure in the collision of styles a formal waistcoat and a battered leather jacket odd socks and pigskin shoes now thats the way a poet should dress lemuel declared when he came back for cal like a blind thief ive been called worse cal replied there was talk of food there was said lem and escorted him away from the fire once his flamedazzled eyes had grown accustomed to the halflight he realized there were kind everywhere perched in the branches or sitting on the ground between the trees surrounded by their earthly goods despite the wonders these people had been intimate with tonight they resembled any band of refugees their eyes dark and full of caution their mouths tight some it was true had decided to make the best of what might well be their last night alive lovers lay in each others arms exchanging whispers and kisses a singer poured a lilt onto the air to which three women were dancing the stillness between their steps so profound they were lost amongst the trees but most of the fugitives were inert keeping themselves under lock and key for fear their dread show the smell of coffee came to greet cal as lem brought him into a clearing where another fire smaller than the one hed slept by was burning half a dozen kind were eating here he knew none of them this is calhoun mooney lem announced a poet one of the number who was sitting in a chair while a woman carefully shaved his head said i remember you from the orchard youre the cuckoo yes have you come to die with us said a girl crouching beside the fire pouring herself coffee the remark which would have been judged an indiscretion in most company drew laughter if thats what it comes to said cal well dont go on an empty stomach said the shaved man as his barber towelled the last of the suds from his scalp cal realized hed grown his mane to conceal a skull decorated with rhymthic pigmentation from the gaze of the kingdom now he could parade it again weve only got bread and coffee lem said suits me cal told him you saw the scourge said another of the company yes cal replied must we talk about that hamel said the girl at the fire the man ignored her what was it like he asked cal shrugged huge he said hoping the subject would be dropped but it wasnt just hamel who wanted to know all of them even the girl whod objected were waiting for further details it had hundreds of eyes he said thats all i saw really maybe we could blind it hamel said drawing on his cigarette how said lem the old science we dont have the power to keep the screen up much longer said the woman whod been doing the shaving where are we going to get the strength to meet the scourge i dont understand this old science business said cal sipping at the coffee lem had brought him its all gone anyway said the shaved man our enemies kept it hamel reminded him that bitch immacolata and her fancyman they had it and those who made the loom said the girl theyre dead and gone lem said anyway said cal you couldnt blind the scourge why not said hamel too many eyes hamel wandered to the fire and threw the stub of his cigarette into its heart all the better to see us with he said the flame the stub burned with was bright blue which made cal wonder what the man had been smoking turning his back on the fire hamel disappeared between the trees leaving silence in his wake will you excuse me poet said lem ive got to go find my daughters of course cal sat down to finish his meal leaning his back against a tree to watch the comings and goings his short sleep had only taken the edge off his fatigue eating made him dozy again he might have slept where he sat but that the strong coffee hed drunk had gone straight to his bladder and he needed to relieve himself he got up and went in search of a secluded bush to do just that rapidly losing his bearings amongst the trees in one grove he came upon a couple dancing to the latenight music from a small transistor radio like lovers left on a dance floor after the place had closed too absorbed in each other to be parted in another place a child was being taught to count its abacus a string of floating lights its mother had spoken into being he found a deserted spot to unburden himself and was fumbling to do the buttons of his borrowed trousers up again when somebody took hold of his arm he turned to find apolline dubois at his side she was in black as ever but was wearing lipstick and mascara which didnt flatter her had he not seen the all but empty vodka bottle in her hand her breath would have told him shed had a good nights drinking behind her id offer you some she said but its all ive got left dont worry he told her me she said i never worry its all going to end badly whether i worry or not drawing herself closer to him she peered at his face you look sick she announced when did you last have a shave as he opened his mouth to answer her something happened to the air around them a tremor ran through it with darkness at its heels she forsook her hold on him instantly dropping the vodka bottle in the same moment it struck his foot but he managed to bite back his curse and was thankful for it every sound from between the trees music or mathematics had ceased utterly so had the noises in the undergrowth and from the branches the wood was suddenly deathbed quiet the shadows thickening between the trees he put his arm out and clutched hold of one of the trunks fearful of losing all sense of geography when he looked around apolline was backing away from him only her powdered face visible then she turned away and that too was gone he wasnt entirely alone off to his right he saw somebody step from the cover of the trees and hurriedly kick earth over the small fire by which mother and child had been engaged in their lessons they were there still the womans hand pressed over her offsprings mouth the childs eyes turned up to look at her wide with fear as the last light was snuffed out cal saw her mouth ask a question of the man who in answer jerked his thumb over his shoulder then the scene went to black for a few moments cal stayed put vaguely aware that there were people moving past him purposefully as if to their stations rather than remain where he was clinging to the tree like a man in a flood he decided to go in the direction the firesmotherer had pointed and find out what was going on hands extended to help him plot his course as he navigated his way between the trees his every movement produced some unwelcome sound his pigskin shoes creaked his hands touching a trunk brought fragments of bark down in a pattering rain but there was a destination in sight the trees were thinning out and between them he could see the brightness of snow its light made the going easier and by it he came to within ten yards of the edge of the wood he knew now where he was ahead lay the field where hed seen novello playing and louring over it the white slope of rayments hill as he started to move closer somebody put their hand on his chest halting him and a nod from a dogged face at his side directed him back the way hed come but somebody crouched in the shrubbery closer to the edge of the trees turned to look at him and with a raised hand signalled that he should be allowed passage it was only when he came within a yard of her hidingplace that he saw it was suzanna though they were very near the perimeter of the trees and the snowlight was almost lurid she was difficult to see a rapture was wrapped around her like a veil strengthening on her exhaled breaths weakening on the intake her attention was on the field again and the hill beyond snow was still falling without pause it seemed to have erased his tracks though not perhaps unaided its here she whispered without looking his way he studied the scene before him there was nothing out there but the hill and the snow i dont see he began she silenced him with a touch and nodded towards the young trees at the outskirts of the wood she sees it her whisper said he studied the saplings and realized that one was flesh and blood a young girl was standing at the very edge of the trees her arms extended her hands holding onto the branches of saplings to left and right somebody moved out of the halflight and took up a position beside suzanna how close he said cal knew the voice though the man was much changed nimrod the golden eyes glanced at cal without registering anything then looked away before returning with recognition in them apolline had been right cal thought he must look bad nimrod stretched his arm in front of suzanna and clasped cals hand tightly as he broke contact again the girl at the perimeter let out the tiniest exclamation and nimrods question how close was answered shadwell and hobart had appeared at the top of the hill though the sky at their backs was dark they were darker still against it their ragged silhouettes unmistakable they found us nimrod breathed not yet said suzanna very slowly she stood up and as if on that signal a tremor the twin to the rumour that had first hushed the wood ran through the trees the air seemed to darken even further theyre strengthening the screen nimrod whispered cal wished he had some useful role to play in this but all he could do was watch the hill and hope the enemy would turn its back and go searching elsewhere hed known shadwell too long to believe this likely however and he wasnt surprised when the salesman started down the slope towards the field the enemy was obstinate hed come to give the gift of death hed spoken of in chariot street and he wouldnt be satisfied until hed done so hobart or the power inside him was lingering on the brow of the hill where it could better survey the terrain even at this distance the flesh of its face flared and darkened like embers in a high wind cal glanced behind him the kind were just visible standing at regular intervals between the trees their concentration focused on the rapture that stood between them and slaughter its redoubled effect was strong enough to invade his eyes though he stood within the walls for a moment the darkness of the wood grew tenuous and it seemed he could see through it to the snow on the other side he looked back at shadwell who had reached the bottom of the slope and was scanning the landscape ahead of him it was only now seeing the man clearly that cals thoughts returned to the jacket that shadwell had lost or thrown away and which he too had abandoned in his travels it was out there somewhere in the field behind rayments hill where his frozen fingers had let it fall as shadwell started to walk towards the wood he stood up and whispered the jacket suzanna was close to him her answer barely audible what about it shadwell had stopped walking again and was scrutinizing the snow in front of him was some vestige of cals and novellos tracks still visible do you know where the jacket is suzanna was saying yes he said on the other side of the hill the salesman had raised his eyes once more and was staring at the scene in front of him even from a distance it was clear the expression on his face was one of puzzlement even suspicion the illusion was apparently holding but for how long on the hill above him uriel spoke its words carrying on the snowladen wind i smell them it said shadwell nodded and took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket lighting it beneath the flap of his coat then he returned his gaze to the scene in front of him was it the chill that made him squint or was he seeing a ghost of something against the glare of snow were just going to get weaker said suzanna unless we get help from the jacket cal said it had power once she replied maybe it still does can you find it i dont know thats not the answer we need yes i can find it she looked back towards the hill shadwell had decided to rejoin uriel and was climbing the slope once more the angel had sat hobarts body in the snow and was staring up at the clouds ill go with you said nimrod theyll be able to see us from up there well make a detour get out round the back he looked at suzanna yes he said yes she replied go on while theres still time he was away at speed cal in tow weaving through the trees and the kind standing between them the strain of keeping the shield up against the sight of man and angel was taking its toll several of the rapturers had collapsed others were plainly near it nimrods sense of direction was faultless they came out on the far side of the wood and instantly threw themselves face down in the snow the depth of the fall was in their favour they could practically tunnel through it keeping the drifts between them and the hill as much as possible but the snow could not protect them all the way there were patches of open ground that had to be crossed if they werent to follow a route so hopelessly circuitous theyd not reach their target before dawn the wind was blowing sheets of loose snow before it but in the gaps between them they had a clear view of the hill and those on the summit should they chance to look down had a clear view of them theyd caught the rhythm of the wind however laying low when it died down and making a run when a gust gave them cover by this means they crept within thirty yards of the flank of the hill unseen and it seemed the most dangerous part of the route was over when the wind suddenly dropped and in the lull cal heard shadwells triumphant voice you he said pointing down at them i see you he stepped down the side of the hill a few yards then went back up to alert uriel who was still gazing at the sky run for it cal yelled to nimrod and giving up any attempt at concealment they both ploughed on through the snow cal leading now as he went in search of what hed lost a glance up at the summit showed him that shadwell had roused hobart who had stood up the man was stark naked indifferent to the blizzard his body blackened by fire and smoke any moment cal knew that same fire would find nimrod and himself he began to run again expecting the flame at any moment three stumbling steps and still it didnt come now four and five six seven still there was no avenging flame bafflement made him look once more towards the hill shadwell was still at the summit imploring the angel to do its damnedest but in the window between one gust of snow and the next cal saw that uriel had other business distracting it from its role as executioner he started to run again knowing that he and nimrod had been granted a precious chance at life but unable to stop himself mourning the sight of suzanna climbing the hill to meet the angels gaze iii on the hill she had no plan in mind but as shed watched nimrod and cal creeping towards the hill it had become perfectly apparent that unless there was some diversion theyd be sighted and killed she was not about to ask for volunteers if anyone was going to distract the angels fire it surely had to be her after all she and hobart had played this game of dragons before or a variation upon it rather than step directly out through the screen and so give shadwell his target she slipped through the trees and out at the flank moving from drift to drift until she was some distance from the wood only then did she move out into full view of the dragon had she been faster she might have prevented shadwell from seeing cal and nimrod at all as it was she heard his accusing cry moments before she emerged from hiding twenty seconds later and shadwell would have succeeded in rousing hobart and the death inside him to action but when the salesman climbed back up the hill hobarts eyes were already on her and wouldnt be dislodged before making this appearance shed watched the two figures at the summit intently to see if she could make any sense of the politics between them but their behaviour or more particularly uriels confounded her surely the scourge had as much appetite for the chase as shadwell but it seemed utterly distracted from the matter in hand staring up at the sky as if mesmerized only once was it moved to show its fire when without any apparent cue the body of the man it occupied spontaneously combusted flames cocooning him until his clothes were burned from his back and his flesh seared hed not moved an inch as the fire did its work but had stood in the midst of his pyre like a martyr gazing over the empty landscape until again without any apparent reason the fire died now as she climbed to meet him she saw just how traumatized hobarts body was the flames that had enveloped him were only the most recent of countless assaults his flesh had endured hed been wounded several times some of the holes ineptly sealed his hands were horribly maimed his face hair and brows burned away was barely recognizable but seeing the way his eyes stared from his blistered features one impression was confirmed he and perhaps the force within him was somehow mesmerized there was no sign that he felt pain from his wounds nor shame that he stood naked before her not the glorious victim of his dreams but a column of wretchedness stinking of death and cooked meat meeting that blank stare the fear necessity had kept at bay so far rose up in her was it possible she could get beyond this trance to the hobart with whom shed shared that story of maiden knight and dragon if she could perhaps she might survive this confrontation or at least waylay the enemy long enough for the kind to prepare new defences shadwell had seen her now beside hobart the man looked positively dapper but his face told another story his features which had pretended so much in their time were manic now the sham of courtesy he produced for her more pitiful than ironic well well he said and where did you appear from his hands were plunged deep into his pockets to keep them warm and they stayed there he made no attempt to take hold of her or even approach her he knew presumably she could not escape the summit alive i came to see hobart she told him im afraid he isnt here shadwell replied liar she said hobarts eyes were still on her was there a flicker of response in them im telling you the truthi shadwell protested hobarts gone this thing its just a shell you know whats inside and it isnt hobart thats a pity she said playing his civilized game while it gave her time to think no loss said shadwell but we had unfinished business you and hobart oh yes she was looking straight at the burned man as she spoke i was hoping hed remember me at this hobarts head sagged a little then rose again a primitive nod you do remember she said the eyes didnt leave her for an instant are you the dragon she asked him shut up said shadwell or the knight i told you to be quiet he made a move towards her but before he could get within striking distance hobart raised his arm and put the black stump of his hand on shadwells chest the salesman stepped back from it hes frightened suzanna thought the stain of fear she saw around his head only confirmed what his face already admitted there was more power here than he knew to handle and he was afraid but he wasnt so cowed as to keep his silence burn her he said to hobart make her tell us where they are her gut convulsed she hadnt taken that possibility into account that theyd torture her to make her tell but it was too late for flight besides hobart showed no sign of obeying shadwells instructions he simply watched her the way the knight in the book had watched her a wounded creature at the end of his story and she in her turn felt as shed felt then both afraid and strong the body before her was a receptacle for devastating power but if she could just reach into it oh so gently and speak with the hobart whose secret heart she knew perhaps just perhaps she could coax him into siding with her against the scourge dragons had weaknesses maybe angels did too could she make him raise its throat to her i remember you he said the voice was faltering and pained but it was clearly that of hobart not his tenant she glanced sideways at shadwell who was watching this encounter with bewilderment then back at hobart catching sight as she did so of something flickering in the unsealed holes of his body her instinct was to step back but he stopped her dont he said dont leave me it wont harm you you mean the dragon yes he said the snows made it slow it thinks its in the sand alone now the scourges inactivity began to make some vague sense perched on the hill surveying the wilderness of snow it had lost its grip on the present it was back in the void it had occupied for the millennium where it waited for fresh instructions from its maker shadwell was not that maker he was dust human dust it no longer heard him but it knew the smell of the kind it had howled as much from this very spot and when the raptures failed as soon they must the wilderness would no longer keep it from its duty seeing them it would do what it had come to do not for shadwells sake but for its own she had to get to it quickly do you remember the book she said to hobart he took a moment to answer her in the silence the furnace in his body brightened again she began to fear that his words of comfort had been misplaced that these two lawgivers were so much a part of each other that the breaking of one trance had alerted the other tell me she said the book oh yes he told her and with his recognition the light intensified we were there he said in the trees you and me and he stopped talking and his face which had been slack suddenly contorted there was panic there as the fires rose to the lips of his wounds from the corner of her eyes she could see shadwell stepping back slowly as if from a ticking bomb her mind careered around for a delaying tactic but none came hobart was raising his broken hands to his face and in the gesture she comprehended how theyd been destroyed hed tried to stymie the scourges fire once before and his flesh had been forfeit burn her she heard shadwell mutter then the fire began to come it didnt appear suddenly as shed expected but oozed from the hurts hed sustained and from his nostrils and mouth and prick and pores running in fiery rivulets through which dans of the angels intention ran still slothful but growing stronger shed lost the race hobart was not quite beaten however he was making one last gallant attempt to speak his mind the chattering ceased as he forced his mouth open but before he could utter a word uriel ignited his spittle fire licked up across his face the geometries behind it sharpening through the flames suzanna saw hobarts eyes on her and as their gaze met he threw back his head she knew the gesture of old he was offering her his throat kill me and be done the dragon had said hobart was demanding that same kindness now in the only way left to him kill me and be done in the book shed hesitated and lost her chance to fell her enemy this time she wouldnt falter she had the menstruum as a weapon and as ever it knew her intention better than she did even as her thoughts embraced the notion of murder it was flying from her crossing the space between her and hobart in a silver instant and snatching hold of him his throat was offered but it was not his throat it took it was his heart she felt the heat of his body fly back along the river into her head and with it the rhythm of his life his heart was beating in her grasp she clasped it tight no trace of guilt touching her he wanted death and she had it to give that was a fair exchange he shuddered but his heart for all its sins was brave and beat on fire was coming from everywhere about him he wept it shat it sweated it she could smell her hair singeing steam rose between them as the snow melted and was boiled away the geometries were taking control of the fire now shaping it aiming it any moment it would be upon her she gripped his heart tighter still feeling it swell against her hold still beating still beating just as she thought it was beyond her the muscle gave up its work and stopped from somewhere in hobart a noise rose which his lungs could not have made nor his mouth expelled but she heard it clearly and so did shadwell part sob part sigh it was his last word the body in which she still had her minds fingers was dead before the sound had faded she began to call the menstruum out of him but the scourge caught its tail and an echo of the void came to meet her along the stream she had a taste of its lunacy and its pain before she snatched her lethal strength back to her there was an empty moment while steam rose and snow fell then the sometime knight and dragon hobart fell dead at her feet what have you done shadwell said she wasnt sure killed hobart certainly but beyond that the corpse face down in front of her showed no sign of occupancy the fires from it were suddenly extinguished had hobarts death driven uriel out of the man or was it simply biding its time you killed him shadwell said yes how jesus how she was readying herself to resist him if he attacked but it wasnt murder in his look it was disgust youre one of the magicians arent you he said youre here with them i was she told him but theyve gone shadwell youve missed your chance you might trick me with your deceits he said his voice full of pretended innocence im only human but you cant hide from the angel youre right she said im afraid like you afraid its got nowhere to hide now she reminded him casting a look at hobarts corpse wont it need somebody its either you or me and im rotten with magic youre clean for a fraction of a second shadwells facade dropped and she had her words confirmed even amplified he was not simply afraid he was terrified it wont touch me he protested his throat constricted i woke it it owes me its life do you think it cares she said arent we all fodder to a thing like that in the face of her questions his pretence to indifference failed him he began to run his tongue over his lips top then bottom over and over you dont want to die do you she said at least not like that this time it was his glance that went to the body on the ground it wouldnt dare he said but he dropped his volume as he spoke as though fearful it would hear him help me she said to him together we might be able to control it its not possible he replied as he spoke the body in the warm mud between them burst into incandescent flames this time there was nothing left for uriels fire to devour but muscle and bone hobart had been stripped as naked as a man could get the skin burst blood boiling up in a hundred places suzanna stepped back to avoid being caught by the rain of heat and in doing so put herself within shadwells reach he took hold of her placing her body between him and the fire but the scourge had already left hobart and had taken itself into the hill the ground began to shake the din of grinding rock and pulped earth rising from beneath them whatever uriel had gone underground to devise suzanna wanted to run from it while there was time but shadwell still had hold of her and much as she wished to let the menstruum strike him down he was the only ally she had left he it was whod woken the beast and been its companion if anyone knew its weaknesses he was the man the roaring in the ground climbed to a crescendo and with it the whole hill tipped she heard shadwell cry out then he fell taking suzanna with him his hold probably saved her life for as they rolled down the slope the ground at the summit of rayments hill erupted rock and frozen earth were carried skywards then hailed down on their heads she had no time to protect herself from its descent she was still spitting snow from her mouth when something struck her on the back of the neck she tried to keep hold of consciousness but it slipped her and she slid into the night behind her eyes shadwell was still beside her when she came round his hold on her so fierce it had deadened her arm from elbow to fingertip at first she thought the blow shed sustained had affected her sight but it was a fog that had closed off the world around them a cold clinging fog that seemed to encompass the entire hill through it shadwell watched her his eyes two slits in his filthied face youre alive he said how long have we been here a minute or two wheres the scourge she asked him he shook his head its not reasoning any more he said hobart was right it doesnt know where it is youve got to help me thats why you stayed or else well neither of us get out of here alive so how she said he gave her a small twitching smile placate it he said again how give it what it wants give it the magicians she laughed in his face try again she said its the only option once its got them itll be satisfied itll leave us alone im not going to give it anything his grip strengthened he crabbed his way through the muck to her side its going to find them anyway sooner or later he said he was on the verge of sobbing like a baby theres no chance they can survive this but we can if we can just make the bastards show themselves it wont want us once its got them itll be satisfied his face was inches away every tic and tear was hers to scrutinize i know you hate me he said i deserve it so dont do it for me do it for yourself i can make it worth your while she looked at him with something close to awe that even now he could bargain ive got stuff stashed away he said a fortune you name your price its all yours whatever you want free gratis and he stopped oh sweet jesus he said somewhere in the fog something had begun to howl a rising wail which he recognized and feared he seemed to decide that it was no use hoping shed aid him for he let her go and rose to his feet the fog was equally dense on every side it took him several seconds to elect an escape route but once he had he was away at a stumbling run as the howl which could only be uriel shook the hill suzanna stood up the fog and her aching head making the surroundings swim the ground was so churned it was impossible to tell where the slope of the hill lay so she couldnt orient herself to get back to the wood all she could do was run as fast as possible away from the howl blood coursing down the back of her neck twice she fell twice her body made contact with an earth that seemed ready to open up beneath her she was on the verge of collapse when a figure loomed from the fog ahead of her calling her name it was hamel im here she yelled to him over the din of the scourge he was with her in seconds leading her over the treacherous ground and back towards the wood luck was on shadwells side once he was away from the hill itself the fog thinned and he realized that either by instinct or accident hed chosen the best direction to run in the road was not far from here hed be away down it before the angel had finished on the hill away to some safe place on the other side of the globe where he could lick his wounds and put this whole horror out of his head he chanced a look over his shoulder his blessed flight had already put a good distance between himself and the scene of devastation the only sign of the angel was the fog and that still clung to the hill he was safe he slowed his pace as he came within sight of the hedgerow which bounded the road all he had to do now was follow it until he came to a gate the snow was still falling but his sudden turn of speed had got him heated sweat was running down his back and chest even as he unbuttoned his coat however he realized the warmth was not selfgenerated the snow was turning to slush beneath his feet as heat rose from the ground and with it a sudden spring shoots bursting from the earth and rising like snakes towards his face as they flowered he realized the depth of his error they came with fire for sap these blossoms and at their hearts were uriels eyes uriels countless eyes he could go neither forward nor back they were all around him to his horror he heard the angels voice in his head as he had first heard it back in the rub al khali do i dare it said mocking his boast to suzanna do i dare and then it was upon him one moment he was only himself a man a history the next he was pressed to the lid of his creaking skull as the angel of eden claimed him his last act as a man with a body he could call his own was to shriek shadwell she said no time to enjoy it hamel remarked grimly weve got to get back before they start to move out move out she said no we mustnt do that the scourge is still here its in the hill no choice hamel replied the raptures are almost used up see they were within a few yards of the trees now and there was indeed a smoky presence in the air a hint of what was concealed behind the screen no strength left hamel said any sign of cal she asked or nimrod he gave a short dismissive shake of the head they were gone his look said and not worth fretting for she glanced back at the hill hoping for some sign that contradicted him but there was no movement fog still held court at the summit the upturned earth around it was still are you coming he wanted to know she followed him her head throbbing the first step taken through snow the second through thicket there was a child crying in the depths of the hideaway its sobs inconsolable see if you can keep her quiet hamel she said but gently are we going or arent we he said yes she conceded we have to i just want to see cal back first theres no time he insisted all right she said i heard you well go he grunted and turned away from her hamel she called after him what thank you for coming after me i want to be out of here he said plainly and went in search of the sobbing leaving her to return to the lookout post that offered the best view of the hill there were several kind keeping watch there anything she asked one of them he didnt need to answer a murmur amongst them drew her gaze to the hill the fog cloud was stirring it was as if something in its midst had taken a vast breath for the cloud folded upon itself growing smaller and smaller until the force that haunted it became visible uriel had found the salesman though it was shadwells body that stood in the mud of rayments hill the eyes burned with a seraphic light from the purposeful way it surveyed the field there could be little doubt that the distraction which had made it mild had passed the angel was no longer lost in a remembered void it knew both where it was and why weve got to move she said the children first the order came not an instant too soon for even as the message ran through the trees and the fugitives began their last dash for safety uriel turned its murderous eyes on the field below rayments hill and the snow began to burn iv symmetry no trace of the route cal had described across the field behind the hill was visible when he and nimrod reached there the blizzard had erased it all they could do was guess at the path he would have followed and dig in the vicinity in the hope of chancing upon the lost package but it was nearly hopeless his route to the hill had been far from direct fatigue had made him reel and wander like a drunkard and since then the wind had rearranged the drifts so that in some places they were deep enough to bury a man upright the driving snow obscured the hilltop most of the time so cal could only guess at what was happening up there what chance did anyone have of survival against shadwell and the scourge little or none probably but then suzanna had brought him out of the gyre alive hadnt she against all the odds the thought of her on the hill distracting uriels fatal gaze made him dig with greater devotion to the task without really believing they had a hope in hell of finding the jacket their digging steadily took he and nimrod further apart until cal could no longer see his fellow searcher through the veil of snow but at one point he heard the man cry out in alarm and turned to see a flickering brightness in the wastes behind him something was burning on the hill he started back towards it but sense prevailed over heroics if suzanna was alive then she was alive if she was dead he was wasting her sacrifice turning his back on the search as he began again any pretence to a system in the work forgotten the roaring in the hill began climaxing in the din of erupting earth this time he didnt look back didnt try to pierce the veil for news of love he simply dug and dug turning his grief into fuel for the task in his haste he almost lost the treasure in the act of finding it his hands already covering the glimpse of paper before his distracted brain had registered what it was when it did he began to dig like a terrier shovelling snow behind him not quite daring to believe hed found the package as he dug the wind brought a voice to him then whipped it away again a cry for help somewhere in the wilderness it wasnt nimrod so he kept digging the voice came back he looked up narrowing his eyes against the onslaught was there somebody wading through the snow some way off from him like the voice the sight came and went the package was just as evasive but even as he was thinking hed been mistaken and there was nothing to find his frozen fingers closed on the thing as he pulled it from the drift the paper which was almost mush tore and the contents fell in the snow a box of cigars some trinkets and the jacket he picked it up if it had looked unremarkable at glucks house it looked more so now he hoped somebody in the wood had a clue as to how to unleash its powers because he certainly didnt he looked around for nimrod to give him the news and saw two figures trudging towards him one holding the other up the bearer was nimrod the man he was helping the same cal had heard and glimpsed presumably so swathed in protective clothing he was unrecognizable nimrod had seen the prize cal had lifted up to show him however and was coaxing the man to pick up his speed yelling something to cal as he approached the wind stole the words away but he yelled them again as he came closer is this a friend of yours the man he was all but carrying lifted his snowencrusted face and fumbled with the scarf that was wrapped around its lower half before hed pulled it down however cal said virgil the scarf came away and gluck was looking up at him with a mixture of shame and triumph on his face in equal measure forgive me he said i had to be here i had to see if theres anything left to see nimrod shouted over the din of the wind cal looked back towards rayments hill between the gusts it was apparent that the top of the hill had been entirely blown open over it a pall of smoke was rising its underbelly lit by flames the wood he said forgetting nimrod and gluck he began to plough through the snow back towards the hill and what lay beyond there was nothing arbitrary in the scourges attack it was systematically destroying the field and the surrounding region in the knowledge that sooner or later its eyes would find the creatures whose proximity it smelt in the trees there was an organized retreat the children accompanied by either guardians or parents moving through to the rear of the wood and out into the open air few others moved but stayed at their stations preserving the integrity of their hiding place suzanna wasnt certain if this was defiance or fatalism perhaps a little of both but however deep they dug their store of raptures was all but exhausted it was a matter of seconds rather than minutes now before urielinshadwells glance reached the trees when it did so the woods would burn invisible or no hamel was at suzannas side as she watched the angels approach are you coming he said in a moment its now or never maybe it would be never then she was so transfixed by the formidable power being unleashed in front of her she couldnt avert her astonished gaze it fascinated her that strength of this magnitude should be turned to the sordid business of atrocity something was wrong with a reality that made that possible and offered no cure for it nor hope of cure we have to go said hamel then go she told him tears were welling in her eyes she resented them coming between her and seeing but with them she felt the menstruum rising not to protect her but to be with her at the last to give her its little sum of joy the angel raised its sights she heard hamel shout then the trees to the right of where she stood burst into flames there were cries from the depths of the wood as the screen was breached scatter somebody yelled hearing its prey the scourge caused shadwells face to smile a smile to end the world with then the light in the bloated body intensified as uriel mustered a final fire to destroy the rapturers forever a beat before it broke a voice said shadwell it was the salesmans name that had been called but it was uriel that looked round its calamitous glance momentarily postponed suzannas gaze left the scourge and went to the speaker it was cal he was walking across the smoking ground that had once been the snowcovered field at the bottom of the hill walking straight towards the enemy at the sight of him she didnt hesitate to break cover she stepped out from the margin of the trees and into the open air nor did she come alone though she didnt take her eyes off cal for an instant she heard whispers and footfalls at her side as the kind appeared from hiding a gesture of solidarity in the face of extinction which moved her profoundly at the last their appearance here said were together cuckoo and kind part of one story none of which prevented an awed voice which she recognized as that of apolline from saying is he out of his fucking mind as cal continued to advance across the earth uriel had laid waste behind her the crackling of flames mounted as the fire fanned by the wind spread through the woods its glow washed the ground throwing the shadows of the kind towards the two figures in the field ahead shadwell with his fine clothes torn and singed his face paler than a dead mans cal in his pigskin shoes the flamelight picking out threads in his jacket no not his jacket shadwells the jacket of illusions how could she have been so slow as not to have noticed it earlier was it the fact that it fitted him so well though it had been made for a man half his size again or was it simply that his face had claimed all her attention that face which even now had about it a purposefulness shed come to love he was within ten yards of the scourge and now stood still urielinshadwell said nothing but there was a restlessness in the salesmans body that threatened to detonate at any moment cal fumbled to unbutton the jacket frowning at the ineptitude of his fingers but he got the trick of it on the fourth attempt and the jacket fell open that done he spoke his voice was thin but it didnt shake ive got something to show you he said at first urielinshadwell offered no response when it did it was not the possessor who replied but the possessed theres nothing there i want the salesman said its not for you cal replied his voice growing stronger its for the angel of eden for uriel this time neither scourge nor salesman replied cal took hold of the front panel of the jacket and opened it exposing the lining dont you want to look he enquired silence answered him whatever you see he went on its yours somebody at suzannas side whispered what does he think hes doing she knew but didnt waste precious effort on a reply cal needed all the power she could will to him all her hope all her love again he addressed the scourge what do you see he said this time he got an answer nothing it was shadwell who spoke i see nothing oh cal suzanna breathed catching the flicker of despair that crossed his face she knew exactly what he was thinking and shared his doubt were the raptures in the jacket dead had they withered away without victims to nourish them leaving him standing before uriel unarmed a long moment passed then from somewhere in the belly of the angel there rose a low moan as it came shadwells mouth opened and he spoke again but it was quietly this time as if to himself or the thing inside himself dont look he said suzanna held her breath not daring to believe his words were a warning yet how else could they be construed you do see something cal said no shadwell replied look said cal opening the jacket as wide as he could look and see suddenly shadwell began yelling its lies he screeched his body shuddering now its all corruption but the moan that was still rising from the creature inside him drowned his warnings out this was not the howl suzanna had heard in the rock of rayments hill not an insane cry of rage this sound was sad infinitely sad and as if answering sound with light the jacket whose threads shed feared bankrupt began to brighten immediately shadwells warnings began again tinged with a new hysteria dont he shouted dont damn you the scourge was deaf to the appeals of its host however it had its innumerable eyes on the lining of the jacket willing forth from it a vision only it could see for cal the moment carried terror and joy in such confusion he could not tell one from the other not that it mattered events now were out of his hands all he could do was stand his ground while the jacket performed whatever deceits it had power to perform he hadnt meant to put it on that hadnt been a part of his plan at all indeed hed had no plan hed just plunged through the snow hoping he wasnt too late to intervene but events had already outpaced him uriels glance had found the kinds refuge and was destroying it the jacket which hed dug for was redundant the kinds bluff was called but the sight of the salesman put another thought into his head that the jackets raptures had worked when shadwell had worn it and that he had no better option now than to do the same no sooner had he slipped his arms into it than it fitted itself to him snug as a surgeons glove he felt its embrace as a bargain made hereafter it was a part of him and he of it even now as he stood before uriel he could feel it tapping into him seeking his humanity to add spice to the illusion it was creating the angels gaze was fixed on the lining entranced the face it wore becoming more distorted with every breath shadwell wasted on his pleas and predictions itll deceive you he roared its magic do you hear me if the angel was aware of his panic it didnt comprehend it or if it comprehended it didnt care the jackets genius for seduction was rising to its greatest triumph all it had enthralled hitherto were cuckoos whose hearts were malleable and sentimental and whose desires scarcely rose above the pedestrian but the dreamlife of the entity which now gazed into it was of a different order entirely uriel had no halcyon childhood to mourn nor lovers to pine for its mental powers though theyd been long left to sterility were immense and the jackets raptures were pressed to their limits to produce an image of what it most desired the garment had begun to writhe and ripple on cals back its seams creaking around him as though it could scarcely bear what was being asked of it and was ready to fly apart he felt he might do the same if this wasnt over soon the jackets demands upon him were becoming intolerable as it dug deeper and ever deeper into him trawling his soul for the inspiration to match the angels need his torso and arms had grown numb his hands no longer owned the strength to hold the jacket open it was left to the forces loose in the lining to spread the coat wide while he stood in the flux of power his mind assaulted by fragments of whatever uriel was yearning after he could make only partial sense of them there was a planet of light he saw turning over and over before him its immensity grazing his lips there was a flame sea lapping at a beach of stone and cloud there were forms his minds eye couldnt endure to look at making riddles of their breath but they were all fugitive visions and when theyd gone he was back standing on the same dead earth his body being wasted by uriels hunger the jacket had reached its limits it had begun to disintegrate threads being sucked from its warp and weft and burned away before him but uriel wasnt about to be cheated its eyes drew on the fabric demanding it make good the promise cal had voiced beneath this assault the jacket finally capitulated but in its destruction uriels demand was answered the lining burst and from it rose the image uriels appetite had shaped its brightness blinding cal he heard shadwell bellow then his own cries rose over the din pleading with the angel to take its dream to its bosom uriel didnt hesitate it wanted this vision as much as cal wanted rid of it through a haze of anguish cal saw shadwells body begin to bloat as the angel inside him prepared to show itself the salesman could only wail his despair as he felt himself plucked into the air uriels geometries bearing him up his skin was tight as a drum stretched to the limits of its tolerance his mouth a toothlined o as his cartilage tore and sinew snapped then he broke his body bursting to release its captive the fragments incinerated in the instant they flew by the glory his destruction unleashed before him cal saw plainly the incarnation hed only glimpsed in the fog on chariot street uriels eyes uriels geometry uriels hunger and then its magnetism drew the illusion its will had made out from the ruins of the jacket and up to meet it the vision stood revealed as bright as uriel and as vast as well it had to be for the image the raptures had made was another uriel the seraphs equal in every way as it rose up the vestiges of the jacket fell away from cal but its degeneration did not compromise the creature it had parented uriels mirror stood unbowed before the power that had summoned it into being cal robbed both of his strength and of the images hed peeped on tasted a terrible banality he had no energy left to look up and wonder at the majesty above him his eyes were turned inward and he saw only emptiness there a desert in which his dust blew with the dust of all the things hed ever loved and lost blew to the end of time and knew neither rest nor meaning his body surrendered and he fell as though hed been shot while the dust in his head whipped him away into the void he witnessed nothing of what followed suzanna saw his collapse ignoring the giants that towered over the burning wood she went to his aid overhead the angels hovered like twin suns their energies filling the air with invisible needles careless of their stings she bent her back to the task of dragging cal away from this rendezvous of spirit and spirit she was beyond fear now or hope the first and only necessity was to have cal safe in her arms whatever followed would follow it was beyond her others had come to her assistance apolline hamel and from the far side of the field nimrod together they picked cal up and took him out of the region of needles laying him down gently where the ground was softest above them the confrontation was reaching a new plateau uriels form had become impossibly complex its anatomy transforming at the speed of its thought part engine part citadel all meticulous fire and its conjured companion was matching it change for change darts passing between them like needles threaded with fire drawing them closer and closer still until they were locked like lovers if there had once been a distinction between uriel the real and uriel the imagined that no longer pertained such divisions were for cuckoos who believed they lived both inside their heads and out to whom thought was only lifes shadow and not its own true self uriel knew better it had needed the old science to seduce it into confessing its profoundest desire simply to see its own true face and seeing it know how it had been before loneliness had corrupted it now it embraced that remembered self and learned its lesson on the instant the pit of its insanity had been as deep as the stars it had descended from were high unreminded of its nature it had sunk into obsession devoted to a dead duty but looking on itself seeing the glory of its condition it shed that lunacy and shedding it looked starward there were heavens it had business in where the age it had wasted here was but a day and its grief all grief an unknown state on the thought it rose it and itself one triumphant splendour there were clouds above it was away between them in moments leaving only a rain of dwindling light on the faces of those who watched it pass from sight gone said lo when even the light had died and there was only a gruel of snow shed from above is it over then apolline wanted to know i think it is said hamel there were tears pouring down his cheeks a fresh gust of wind had lent new fervour to the flames that were devouring the wood it did not matter much they no longer had need to take refuge there perhaps tonight marked an end to refuges suzanna looked down at cal whom she was cradling as shed once cradled jerichau but jerichau had died in her arms cal would not she swore he would not he had not escaped the furnace of the jackets destruction unmarked the skin of his face and his chest were burned or perhaps stained but that was the only outward damage how is he said a voice she didnt know she looked up to meet the harried gaze of a cuckoo like herself muffled up in several layers of clothing suzanna he said my name is gluck im a friend of calhouns youre welcome said someone gluck beamed hes not going to die said suzanna stroking cals face hes just sleeping awhile hes had a busy nighti said nimrod and there were tears on his stoical face too pouring down v the sleepwalker there was a wilderness and cal was dust in the wilderness and his hopes and dreams were dust in the wilderness all driven before the same unforgiving wind he had tasted uriels condition before its healing hed shared the spirits loneliness and desolation and his frail mind had been snatched up into the void and left there to die he knew no way out in the final arithmetic his life was a wasteland of fire of snow of sand all of it a wasteland and he would wander there til he could wander no more to those who were tending him he seemed simply to be resting at least at first they let him sleep in the belief that hed wake healed his pulse was strong his bones unbroken all he needed was time to recover his strength but when he woke the following afternoon in glucks house it was immediately clear that something was profoundly amiss his eyes opened but cal was not in them his gaze was devoid of recognition or response it and he were as blank as an empty page suzanna couldnt know none of them could what hed shared with uriel during their confrontation but she could make an educated guess if her experience of the menstruum had taught her anything it was that every exchange was a twoway street cal had conspired with immacolatas jacket to give uriel its vision but what had the lunatic spirit given him in return when after two days there was no sign of improvement in his state they called in expert help but though the doctors exhausted their tests on him they could find nothing physiologically wrong this was not a coma they ventured so much as a trance and they knew no precedent for it except perhaps sleepwalking one of their number even went so far as to suggest the condition might be selfinduced a possibility suzanna did not entirely dismiss there were no reasons they could find they finally announced as to why the patient wasnt up and awake and living a healthy life there are plenty of reasons suzanna thought but none that she could begin to explain perhaps he had simply seen too much and the surfeit had left him indifferent to being and the dust rolled on sometimes he thought he heard voices in the wind very distant voices but they disappeared as quickly as they came and left him alone again that was for the best he knew because if there was a place beyond this wasteland and the voices were trying to coax him back it would bring him pain and he was better off without it besides sooner or later the inhabitants of that otherwhere would come to him theyd wither and die and join the dust in the wilderness that was how things happened always had and always would everything went to dust each day suzanna would spend several hours talking to him telling him how the day had gone and whom shed met mentioning the names of people he knew and places hed been in the hope of stirring him from his inertia but there was no response not a glimmer sometimes shed get into a quiet rage at his apparent indifference to her and tell him to his vacant face that he was being selfish she loved him didnt he know that she loved him and she wanted him to know her again and be with her other times shed come close to despair and however hard she tried she couldnt stem the tears of frustration and unhappiness shed leave his bedside then until shed composed herself again because she was fearful that somewhere in his sealed head hed hear her grief and flee even further into himself she even tried to reach him with the menstruum but he was a fortress and her subtle body could only gaze into him not enter what it saw gave her no cause for optimism it was as if he was uninhabited outside the window of glucks home it was the same story there were few signs of life this was the hardest winter since the beginning of the century snow fell on snow ice glazed ice as january crept to its dismal end people began not to ask after cal as frequently they had problems of their own in such a grim season and it was relatively easy for them to put him out of their minds because he wasnt in pain or at least in no pain he could express even gluck tactfully suggested that she was giving too much of her time over to nursing him she had her own healing to do a life to be put in some sort of order plans to be laid for the future shed done all that could be expected from a devoted friend and more he argued and she should start to share the burden with others i cant she told him why not he asked i love him she said and i want to be with him that was only half the answer of course the other half was the book there it lay in his room where shed put it the day theyd returned from rayments hill though it had been mimis gift to suzanna the magic that it now contained meant she could no longer open it alone just as shed needed cal at the temple in order to use the looms power and charge the book with their memories so she needed him again if they were to reverse the process the magic hung in the space between them she could not reclaim on her own what theyd imagined together until he woke the stories of the secret places would remain untold and if he didnt wake theyd remain that way forever in the middle of february with the false hint of a thaw in the air gluck took himself off to liverpool and by dint of some discreet enquiries in chariot street located geraldine kellaway she returned with him to harborne to visit cal his condition shocked her needless to say but she had that brand of pragmatism that would find her the first brewing tea after armageddon and within an hour shed taken it in her stride she returned to liverpool after two days back to the life shed established in cals absence promising to visit again soon if gluck had hoped her appearance would do something to break the deadlock of cals stupor he was disappointed the sleepwalker went on in the same fashion through february and early march while outside the promised thaw was delayed and delayed during the day theyd move him from his bed to the window and there hed sit overlooking the expanse of frostgripped ground behind glucks house though he was fed well chewing and swallowing with the mechanical efficiency of an animal though he was shaved and bathed daily though his legs were exercised to keep the muscles from wasting it was apparent to those few who still came visiting and especially to suzanna and gluck that he was preparing die and the dust rolled on vi rapture if finnegan hadnt called she would never have gone down to london but he had and she did as much at glucks insistence than from any great enthusiasm for the trip as soon as she got out of the house however and started travelling she began to feel the weight of recent weeks lift a little hadnt she once said to apolline that there was comfort in their at least being alive it was true they would have to make the best they could of that and not sigh for things circumstance had denied them she found finnegan less than his usual spritely self his career at the bank had floundered of late and he needed a shoulder to curse upon she supplied it happily more than content to hear his catalogue of woes if they distracted her from her own he reminded her when hed finished complaining and gnashing his teeth of something shed once said about never marrying a banker as it seemed hed soon be out of a job would she think again he wondered it was clear from his tone he didnt expect yes for an answer and he didnt get it but she told him she hoped theyd always be friends youre a strange woman he said as they parted apropos of nothing in particular she took the remark as flattery it was late afternoon by the time she got back to harborne another night of frost was on its way pearling the pavements and roofs when she went upstairs she found the sleepwalker had not been put in his chair but was sitting against heaped pillows on the bed his eyes as glazed as ever he looked sick the mark uriels revelation had left on his face was livid against his pallid skin shed left too early to shave him that morning and it distressed her to see how close to utter dereliction such minor neglect had left him looking talking quietly to him about where shed been she led him from the bed over to the chair beside the window where the light was a little better then she collected the electric razor from the bathroom and shaved his stubble at the beginning it had been an eerie business ministering to him like this and it had upset her but time had toughened her and shed come to view the various chores of keeping him presentable as a means to express her affection for him now however as dusk devoured the light outside she felt those early anxieties rising in her again perhaps it was the day shed spent out of the house and out of cals company that made her tender to this experience afresh perhaps it was also the sense she had that events were drawing to a close that there would not be many more days when she would have to shave him and bathe him that it was almost over night was upon the house so quickly the room soon became too gloomy to work in she went to the door and switched on the light his reflection appeared in the window hanging in the glass against the darkness outside she left him staring at it while she went for the comb there was something in the void ahead of him though he couldnt see what the wind was too strong and he as ever was dust before it but the shadow or whatever it was persisted and sometimes when the wind dropped a little it seemed he could almost see it studying him he looked back at it and its gaze held him so that instead of being blown on and away the dust he was made of momentarily stood still as he returned the scrutiny the face before him became clearer he knew it vaguely from some place hed gained and lost its eyes and the stain that ran from hairline to cheek belonged to somebody hed known once it irritated him not being able to remember where hed seen this man before it was not the face itself which finally reminded him but the darkness it was set against the last time hed seen this stranger perhaps the only time the man had been standing against another such darkness a cloud perhaps shot with lightning it had a name this cloud but he couldnt remember it the place had a name too but that was even further out of his reach the moment of their meeting he did remember however and some fragments of the journey that led up to it hed been in a rickshaw and hed passed through a region where time was somehow out of joint where today breathed yesterdays air and tomorrows too for curiositys sake he wanted to know the strangers name before the wind caught him and moved him on again but he was dust so he couldnt ask instead he pressed his motes towards the darkness on which the mysterious face hovered and reached to touch his skin it was not a living thing he made contact with it was cold glass his fingers fell from the window the heatrings theyd left shrinking if it was glass before him he dimly thought then he must be looking at himself surely the man hed met standing against that nameless cloud that was him a puzzle awaited suzanna when she returned to the room she was almost certain shed left cal with his hands on his lap but now his right arm hung at his side had he tried to move if so it was the first independent motion hed made since the trance had claimed him she started to speak to him softly asking him if he heard her if he saw her or knew her name but as ever it was a oneway conversation either his hand had simply slipped from his lap or shed been mistaken and it hadnt been there in the first place sighing she set to combing his hair he was still dust in a wilderness but now he was dust with a memory it was enough to give him weight the wind bullied him wanting its way with him but this time he refused to be moved it raged against him he ignored it standing his ground in the nowhere while he tried to fit the pieces of his thoughts together he had met himself once in a house near a cloud hed been brought there in a rickshaw while a world folded up around him what did it signify that hed come face to face with himself as an old man what did that mean the question was not so difficult to answer even for dust it meant he would at some future time step into that world and live there and from that what followed what followed that the place was not lost oh yes oh god in heaven yes that was it he would be there not tomorrow maybe or the day after that but someday some future day he would be there it was not lost the fugue was not lost it took only that knowledge that certainty and he woke suzanna he said where is it was the only question he voiced when theyd finished with their reunion wheres it hidden she went to the table and put mimis book into his hands here she said he ran his palm over the binding but declined to open it how did we do that he said he asked the question with such gravity like a child in the gyre she said you and i and the loom all of it he said all of it in here i dont know she told him in all honesty well see now no cal youre very weak still ill be strong he said simply once we open the book she could not better such argument instead she reached across and laid her hands on mimis gift as her fingers laced with his the lamp above their heads flickered and went out immersed in darkness they held the book between them as she and hobart had once held it on that occasion it had been hatred that had fuelled the forces in the pages this time it was joy they felt the book begin to tremble in their custody growing warm then it flew out of their hands towards the window the icy glass shattered and it disappeared tumbling away into the darkness cal got to his feet and hobbled to the window but before hed reached it the pages rose unbound like birds in the night outside like pigeons the thoughts the loom had inscribed between the lines spilling light and life then they swooped down again and out of sight cal turned away from the window the garden he said his legs felt as though they were made of cottonwool he needed suzannas support to get him to the door together they started down the flight gluck had heard the sound of breaking glass and was half way up the stairs to investigate a mug of tea in his hand hed seen wonders in his time but the sight of cal telling him to get outside outside left him openmouthed by the time hed found a question to ask cal and suzanna were already half way down the second flight of stairs he followed into the hallway and through the kitchen to the back door suzanna was unbolting it top and bottom though there had been winter at the window it was spring that awaited them on the threshold and in the garden itself spreading even as they watched the source of that season the home of their joy forever the place theyd fought and almost died to save the fugue it was emerging from the books scattered pages in all its singular majesty defying ice and darkness as it had defied so much else the months it had spent amongst the tales in the book had not been wasted it came with fresh mysteries and enchantments here in time suzanna would rediscover the old science and with it heal ancient breaches here too in some unimaginable year cal would go to live in a house on the borders of the gyre to which one day a young man would come whose history he knew it was all ahead all theyd dreamed together all waiting to be born even at that moment in sleeping cities across the isle the refugees were waking and rising from their pillows and throwing open the doors and windows despite the cold to meet the news the night was bringing them that what could be imagined need never be lost that even here in the kingdom rapture might find a home after tonight there would be only one world to live in and to dream and wonderland would never be more than a step away a thought away together cal suzanna and gluck left the house and went walking in that magic night ahead there were such sights unfolding friends and places theyd feared gone forever coming to greet them eager for shared rapture there was time for all their miracles now for ghosts and transformations for passion and ambiguity for noonday visions and midnight glory time in abundance for nothing ever begins and this story having no beginning will have no end
