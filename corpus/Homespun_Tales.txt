brother and sister xi the open door xii the hills of home rose o the river i the pine and the rose it was not long after sunrise and stephen waterman fresh from his dip in the river had scrambled up the hillside from the hut in the alderbushes where he had made his morning toilet an early ablution of this sort was not the custom of the farmers along the banks of the saco but the waterman house was hardly a stones throw from the water and there was a clear deep swimminghole in the willow cove that would have tempted the busiest man or the least cleanly in york county then too stephen was a child of the river born reared schooled on its very brink never happy unless he were on it or in it or beside it or at least within sight or sound of it the immensity of the sea had always silenced and overawed him left him cold in feeling the river wooed him caressed him won his heart it was just big enough to love it was full of charms and changes of varying moods and sudden surprises its voice stole in upon his ear with a melody far sweeter and more subtle than the boom of the ocean yet it was not without strength and when it was swollen with the freshets of the spring and brimming with the bounty of its sister streams it could dash and roar boom and crash with the best of them stephen stood on the side porch drinking in the glory of the sunrise with the saco winding like a silver ribbon through the sweet loveliness of the summer landscape and the river rolled on toward the sea singing its morning song creating and nourishing beauty at every step of its onward path cradled in the heart of a great mountainrange it pursued its gleaming way here lying silent in glassy lakes there rushing into tinkling little falls foaming great falls and thundering cataracts scores of bridges spanned its width but no steamers flurried its crystal depths here and there a rough little rowboat tethered to a willow rocked to and fro in some quiet bend of the shore here the silver gleam of a rising perch chub or trout caught the eye there a pickerel lay rigid in the clear water a fish carved in stone here eels coiled in the muddy bottom of some pool and there under the deep shadows of the rocks lay fat sleepy bass old and incredibly wise quite untempted by and wholly superior to the rural fishermans worm the river lapped the shores of peaceful meadows it flowed along banks green with maple beech sycamore and birch it fell tempestuously over dams and fought its way between rocky cliffs crowned with stately firs it rolled past forests of pine and hemlock and spruce now gentle now terrible for there is said to be an indian curse upon the saco whereby with every great sun the child of a paleface shall be drawn into its cruel depths lashed into fury by the stony reefs that impeded its progress the river looked now sapphire now gold now white now leaden gray but always it was hurrying hurrying on its appointed way to the sea after feasting his eyes and filling his heart with a morning draught of beauty stephen went in from the porch and pausing at the stairway called in stentorian tones get up and eat your breakfast rufus the boys will be picking the side jams today and im going down to work on the logs if you come along bring your own pickpole and peavey then going to the kitchen pantry he collected from the various shelves a pitcher of milk a loaf of bread half an apple pie and a bowl of blueberries and with the easy methods of a household unswayed by feminine rule moved toward a seat under an apple tree and took his morning meal in great apparent content having finished and washed his dishes with much more thoroughness than is common to unsuperintended man and having given rufus the second call to breakfast with the vigor and acrimony that usually mark that unpleasant performance he strode to a high point on the riverbank and shading his eyes with his hand gazed steadily downstream patches of green fodder and blossoming potatoes melted into soft fields that had been lately mown and there were glimpses of tasseling corn rising high to catch the sun far far down on the opposite bank of the river was the hint of a brown roof and the tip of a chimney that sent a slender wisp of smoke into the clear air beyond this and farther back from the water the trees apparently hid a cluster of other chimneys for thin spirals of smoke ascended here and there the little brown roof could never have revealed itself to any but a lovers eye and that discerned something even smaller something like a pinkish speck that moved hither and thither on a piece of greensward that sloped to the waterside shes up stephen exclaimed under his breath his eyes shining his lips smiling his voice had a note of hushed exaltation about it as if she whoever she might be had in condescending to rise conferred a priceless boon upon a waiting universe if she were indeed up so his tone implied then the day somewhat falsely heralded by the sunrise had really begun and the human race might pursue its appointed tasks inspired and uplifted by the consciousness of her existence it might properly be grateful for the fact of her birth that she had grown to womans estate and above all that in common with the sun the lark the morningglory and other beautiful things of the early day she was up and about her lovely cheery heartwarming business the handful of chimneys and the smokespirals rising here and there among the trees on the riverbank belonged to what was known as the brier neighborhood there were only a few houses in all scattered along a side road leading from the river up to liberty center there were no great signs of thrift or prosperity but the wiley cottage the only one near the water was neat and well cared for and nature had done her best to conceal mans indolence poverty or neglect bushes of sweetbrier grew in fragrant little forests as tall as the fences clumps of wild roses sprang up at every turn and over all the stone walls as well as on every heap of rocks by the wayside prickly blackberry vines ran and clambered and clung yielding fruit and thorns impartially to the neighborhood children the pinkish speck that stephen waterman had spied from his side of the river was rose wiley of the brier neighborhood on the edgewood side as there was another of her name on brigadier hill the edgewood minister called one of them the climbing rose and the other the brier rose or sometimes rose of the river she was well named the pinkish speck she had not only some of the sweetest attributes of the wild rose but the parallel might have been extended as far as the thorns for she had wounded her scores hearts be it understood not hands the wounding was on the whole very innocently done and if fault could be imputed anywhere it might rightly have been laid at the door of the kind powers who had made her what she was since the smile that blesses a single heart is always destined to break many more she had not a single silk gown but she had what is far better a figure to show off a cotton one not a brooch nor a pair of earrings was numbered among her possessions but any ordinary gems would have looked rather dull and trivial when compelled to undergo comparison with her bright eyes as to her hair the local milliner declared it impossible for rose wiley to get an unbecoming hat that on one occasion being in a frolicsome mood rose had tried on all the headgear in the village emporium childrens gingham shakers mourning bonnets for aged dames mens haying hats and visored caps and she proved superior to every test looking as pretty as a pink in the best ones and simply ravishing in the worst in fact she had been so fashioned and finished by nature that had she been set on a revolving pedestal in a showwindow the bystanders would have exclaimed as each new charm came into view look at her waist see her shoulders and her neck and chin and her hair while the children gazing with raptured admiration would have shrieked in unison i choose her for mine all this is as much as to say that rose of the river was a beauty yet it quite fails to explain nevertheless the secret of her power when she looked her worst the spell was as potent as when she looked her best hidden away somewhere was a vital spark which warmed every one who came in contact with it her lovely little person was a trifle below medium height and it might as well be confessed that her soul on the morning when stephen waterman saw her hanging out the clothes on the riverbank was not large enough to be at all out of proportion but when eyes and dimples lips and cheeks enslave the onlooker the soul is seldom subjected to a close or critical scrutiny besides rose wiley was a nice girl neat as wax energetic merry amiable economical she was a dutiful granddaughter to two of the most irritating old people in the county she never patronized her pugnosed pastyfaced girl friends she made wonderful pies and doughnuts and besides small souls if they are of the right sort sometimes have a way of growing to the discomfiture of cynics and the gratification of the angels so on one bank of the river grew the brier rose a fragile thing swaying on a slender stalk and looking at its pretty reflection in the water and on the other a sturdy pine tree well rooted against wind and storm and the sturdy pine yearned for the wild rose and the rose so far as it knew yearned for nothing at all certainly not for rugged pine trees standing tall and grim in rocky soil if in its present stage of development it gravitated toward anything in particular it would have been a welldressed white birch growing on an irreproachable lawn and the river now deep now shallow now smooth now tumultuous now sparkling in sunshine now gloomy under clouds rolled on to the engulfing sea it could not stop to concern itself with the petty comedies and tragedies that were being enacted along its shores else it would never have reached its destination only last night under a full moon there had been pairs of lovers leaning over the rails of all the bridges along its course but that was a common sight like that of the ardent couples sitting on its shady banks these summer days looking only into each others eyes but exclaiming about the beauty of the water lovers would come and go sometimes reappearing with successive installments of loves in a way wholly mysterious to the river meantime it had its own work to do and must be about it for the side jams were to be broken and the boom let out at the edgewood bridge ii old kennebec it was just seven oclock that same morning when rose wiley smoothed the last wrinkle from her dimity counterpane picked up a shred of cornhusk from the spotless floor under the bed slapped a mosquito on the windowsill removed all signs of murder with a moist towel and before running down to breakfast cast a frowning look at her pincushion almira otherwise mite shapley had been in her room the afternoon before and disturbed with her careless hand the pattern of roses pins they were kept religiously in the form of a maltese cross and if while she was extricating one from her clothing there had been an alarm of fire rose would have stuck the pin in its appointed place in the design at the risk of losing her life entering the kitchen with her light step she brought the morning sunshine with her the old people had already engaged in differences of opinion but they commonly suspended open warfare in her presence there were the usual last things to be done for breakfast offices that belonged to her as her grandmothers assistant she took yesterdays soda biscuits out of the steamer where they were warming and softening brought an apple pie and a plate of seed cakes from the pantry settled the coffee with a piece of dried fish skin and an egg shell and transferred some fried potatoes from the spider to a covered dish did you remember the meat grandpa were all out she said as she began buttoning a stiff collar around his reluctant neck remember land yes i wisht i ever could forgit anything the butcher says hes bout tired o travelin over the country lookin for critters to kill but if he finds anything hell be up along in the course of a week he aint a real smart butcher cyse higgins aint land rose dont button that dickey clean through my epperdummis i have to sport starched collars in this life on account o you and your granmother bein so chock full o style but i hope to the lord i shant have to wear em in another world you wont his wife responded with the snap of a dish towel or if you do theyll wilt with the heat rose smiled but the soft hand with which she tied the neckcloth about the old mans withered neck pacified his spirit and he smiled knowingly back at her as she took her seat at the breakfast table spread near the open kitchen door she was a dazzling rose and it is to be feared a wasted one for there was no one present to observe her clean pink calico and the still more subtle note struck in the green ribbon which was tied round her throat the ribbon that formed a sort of calyx out of which sprang the flower of her face as fresh and radiant as if it had bloomed that morning give me my coffee turrible quick said mr wiley i must be down to the bridge fore they start dogwarpin the side jam i notice youre always due at the bridge on churnin days remarked his spouse testily t aint me as appints drivin dates at edgewood replied the old man the boysll hev a turrible job this year the logs air ricked up jest like roses jackstraws i never see em so turrible ricked up in all my experence an lije dennett don know no more bout pickin a jam than coopers cow turrible sot in his ways too cant take a mite of advice i was tellin him how to go to work on that bung thats formed between the gret gray rock an the shore the awfullest place to bung that there is between this an biddeford and says he look here ive ben boss on this river for twelve year an ill be doggoned if im goin to be taught my business by any man this aint no river says i as youd know says i if youd ever lived on the kennebec pity you hed nt stayed on it says he i wish to the land i hed says i an then i come away for my tongues so turrible spry an sarcustic that i knew if i stopped any longer i should stir up strife theres some folks thatll set on addled aigs year in an year out as if there want good fresh ones bein laid every day an lije dennetts one of em when it comes to riverdrivin theres lots o folks as have made a good livin by mindin their own business observed the still sententious mrs wiley as she speared a soda biscuit with her fork mindin your own business is a turrible selfish trade responded her husband loftily if your neighbor is more ignorant than what you are particlarly if hes as ignorant as coopers cow youd ought as a kennebec man an a christian to set him on the right track though its always a turrible risky thing to do roses grandfather was called by the irreverent younger generation sometimes turrible wiley and sometimes old kennebec because of the frequency with which these words appeared in his conversation there were not wanting those of late who dubbed him uncle ananias for reasons too obvious to mention after a long indolent tolerably truthful and useless life he had at seventyfive lost sight of the dividing line between fact and fancy and drew on his imagination to such an extent that he almost staggered himself when he began to indulge in reminiscence he was a feature of the edgewood drive being always present during the five or six days that it was in progress sometimes sitting on the riverbank sometimes leaning over the bridge sometimes reclining against the buttend of a huge log but always chewing tobacco and expectorating to incredible distances as he criticized and damned impartially all the expedients in use at the particular moment i want to stay down by the river this afternoon said rose ever so many of the girls will be there and all my sewing is done up if grandpa will leave the horse for me ill take the drivers lunch to them at noon and bring the dishes back in time to wash them before supper i suppose you can go if the rest do said her grandmother though its an awful lazy way of spendin an afternoon when i was a girl there was no such dawdlin goin on i can tell you nobody thought o lookin at the river in them days there was nt time but its such fun to watch the logs rose exclaimed next to dancing the greatest fun in the world specially as all the young men in town will be there watchin too was the grandmothers reply eben brooks an richard bean got home yesterday with their doctors diplomas in their pockets mrs brooks says eben stood fortynine in a class o fiftyfive an seemed considable proud of him an i guess it is the first time he ever stood anywheres but at the foot i tell you when these fiftyfive new doctors git scattered over the country therell be considable many folks keepin house under ground dick beans goin to stop a spell with rufe an steve waterman thatll make one more to play in the river rufus aint hardly got his workin legs on yit allowed mr wiley but steves all right hes a turrible smart driver an turrible reckless too hell take all the chances there is though to a man thats lived on the kennebec there aint what can rightly be called any turrible chances on the saco hed better be tendin to his farm objected mrs wiley his hay is all in rose spoke up quickly and he only helps on the river when the farm work is nt pressing besides though its all play to him he earns his two dollars and a half a day he dont keer about the two and a half said her grandfather he jest cant keep away from the logs theres some that cant when i first moved here from gardner where the climate never suited me the climate of any place where you hev regular work never did an never will suit you remarked the old mans wife but the interruption received no comment such mistaken views of his character were too frequent to make any impression as i was sayin rose he continued when we first moved here from gardner we lived neighbor to the watermans steve an rufus was little boys then always playin with a couple o wild cousins o theirn considable older steve would scare his mother pretty nigh to death stealin away to the mill to ride on the carriage side o the log that was bein sawed hitchin clean out over the river an then jerkin back most into the jaws o the machinery he never hed any common sense to spare even when he was a young one remarked mrs wiley and i dont see as all the cademy education his father throwed away on him has changed him much and with this observation she rose from the table and went to the sink steve aint nobodys fool dissented the old man but hes kind o daft about the river when he was little he was allers buildin dams in the brook an sailin chips an runnin on the logs allers choppin up stickins an raftin em together in the pond i cailate mis waterman died considable afore her time jest from fright lookin out the winders and seein her boys slippin between the logs an gittin their daily dousin she could nt understand it an theres a heap o things womenfolks never do an never can understand jest because they air womenfolks one o the things is men i spose interrupted mrs wiley men in general but more particlarly husbands assented old kennebec howsomever theres another thing they dont an cant never take in an thats sport steve does riverdrivin as he would horseracin or tigershootin or tightrope dancin an he always did from a boy when he was about twelve to fifteen he used to help the riverdrivers spring and fall reglar he could nt do nothin but shin up an down the rocks after hammers an hatchets an ropes but he was turrible pleased with his job stepanfetchit they used to call him them days stepanfetchit waterman good name for him yet came in acid tones from the sink hes still steppin an fetchin only its rose thats doin the drivin now im not driving anybody that i know of answered rose with heightened color but with no loss of her habitual selfcommand then when he graduated from errants went on the crafty old man who knew that when breakfast ceased churning must begin steve used to get seventyfive cents a day helpin clear up the river if you can call this here silvry streamlet a river hed pick off a log here an there an send it afloat an dig out them that hed got ketched in the rocks and tidy up the banks jest like spring housecleanin if hed hed any kind of a boss an hed ben trained on the kennebec hed a made a turrible smart driver steve would hell be drownded thats whatll become o him prophesied mrs wiley specially if rose encourages him in such silly foolishness as ridin logs from his house down to ourn dark nights seein as how steve built ye a nice pigpen last month pears to me you might have a good word for him now an then mother remarked old kennebec reaching for his second piece of pie i want a mite deceived by that pigpen no moren i was by jed towles hencoop nor ivory dunns wellcurb nor pitt packards shedsteps if you hed ever kep up your buildins yourself roses beaux would nt hev to do their courtin with carpenters tools its the pigpen an the hencoop you want to keep your eye on mother not the motives of them as made em its turrible onsettlin to inspeck folks motives too turrible close riding a log is no more to steve than riding a horse so he says interposed rose to change the subject but i tell him that a horse does nt revolve under you and go sideways at the same time that it is going forwards logridin aint no trick at all to a man of sperit said mr wiley theres a few places in the kennebec where the waters too shaller to let the logs float so we used to build a flume an the logs would whiz down like arrers shot from a bow the boys used to collect by the side o that there flume to see me ride a log down an ive watched em drop in a dead faint when i spun by the crowd but land you cant drownd some folks not without you tie nailkags to their head an feet an drop em in the falls ive rid logs down the bilinest rapids o the kennebec an never lost my head i remember well the year o the gret freshet i rid a log from there there father thatll do said mrs wiley decisively ill put the cream in the churn an you jest work off some o your steam by bringin the butter for us afore you start for the bridge it dont do no good to brag afore your own womenfolks work goes considable bettern stories at every place cept the loafers bench at the tavern and the baffled raconteur who had never done a piece of work cheerfully in his life dragged himself reluctantly to the shed where before long one could hear him moving the dasher up and down sedately to his favorite churning tune of broad is the road that leads to death and thousands walk together there but wisdom shows a narrow path with here and there a traveler iii the edgewood drive just where the bridge knits together the two little villages of pleasant river and edgewood the glassy mirror of the saco broadens suddenly sweeping over the dam in a luminous torrent gushes of pure amber mark the middle of the dam with crystal and silver at the sides and from the seething vortex beneath the golden cascade the white spray dashes up in fountains in the crevices and hollows of the rocks the mad water churns itself into snowy froth while the foamflecked torrent deep strong and troubled to its heart sweeps majestically under the bridge then dashes between wooded shores piled high with steep masses of rock or torn and riven by great gorges there had been much rain during the summer and the saco was very high so on the third day of the edgewood drive there was considerable excitement at the bridge and a goodly audience of villagers from both sides of the river there were some who never came some who had no fancy for the sight some to whom it was an old story some who were too busy but there were many to whom it was the event of events a neverending source of interest above the fall covering the placid surface of the river thousands of logs lay quietly in boom until the turning out process on the last day of the drive should release them and give them their chance of display their brief moment of notoriety their opportunity of interesting amusing exciting and exasperating the onlookers by their antics heaps of logs had been cast up on the rocks below the dam where they lay in hopeless confusion adding nothing however to the problem of the moment for they too bided their time if they had possessed wisdom discretion and caution they might have slipped gracefully over the falls and steering clear of the hidden ledges about which it would seem they must have heard whispers from the old pine trees along the river have kept a straight course and reached their destination without costing the edgewood lumber company a small fortune or if they had inclined toward a jolly and adventurous career they could have joined one of the various jams or bungs stimulated by the thought that any one of them might be a keylog holding for a time the entire mass in its despotic power but they had been stranded early in the game and after lying high and dry for weeks would be picked off one by one and sent downstream in the tumultuous boil the foaming hubbub and flurry at the foot of the falls one enormous peeled log wallowed up and clown like a huge rhinoceros greatly pleasing the children by its clumsy cavortings some conflict of opposing forces kept it ever in motion yet never set it free below the bridge were always the real battlegrounds the scenes of the first and the fiercest conflicts a ragged ledge of rock standing well above the yeasty torrent marked the middle of the river stephen had been stranded there once just at dusk on a stormy afternoon in spring a jam had broken under the men and stephen having taken too great risks had been caught on the moving mass and leaping from log to log his only chance for life had been to find a footing on gray rock which was nearer than the shore rufus was ill at the time and mrs waterman so anxious and nervous that processions of boys had to be sent up to the river farm giving the frightened mother the latest bulletins of her sons welfare luckily the river was narrow just at the gray rock and it was a quite possible task though no easy one to lash two ladders together and make a narrow bridge on which the drenched and shivering man could reach the shore there were loud cheers when stephen ran lightly across the slender pathway that led to safety ran so fast that the ladders had scarce time to bend beneath his weight he had certainly taken chances but when did he not do that the loggers life is one of moving accidents by flood and field and stephen welcomed with wild exhilaration every hazard that came in his path to him there was never a dull hour from the moment that the first notch was cut in the tree for he sometimes joined the boys in the lumber camp just for a frolic till the later one when the hewn log reached its final destination he knew nothing of tooling a fourinhand through narrow lanes or crowded thoroughfares nothing of guiding a horse over the hedges and through the pitfalls of a stiff bit of hunting country his steed was the rearing plunging kicking log and he rode it like a river god the crowd loves daring and so it welcomed stephen with bravos but it knew as he knew that he was only doing his duty by the company only showing the saco that man was master only keeping the old waterman name in good repute ye cant drownd some folks old kennebec had said as he stood in a group on the shore not without you tie sandbags to em an drop em in the great eddy im the same kind i remember when i was stranded on jest sech a rock in the kennebec only they left me there all night for dead an i had to swim the rapids when it come daylight were well acquainted with that rock and them rapids exclaimed one of the riverdrivers to the delight of the company rose had reason to remember stephens adventure for he had clambered up the bank smiling and blushing under the hurrahs of the boys and coming to the wagon where she sat waiting for her grandfather had seized a moment to whisper did you care whether i came across safe rose say you did stephen recalled that question too on this august morning perhaps because this was to be a redletter day and some time when he had a free moment some time before supper when he and rose were sitting apart from the others watching the logs he intended again to ask her to marry him this thought trembled in him stirring the deeps of his heart like a great wave almost sweeping him off his feet when he held it too close and let it have full sway it would be the fourth time that he had asked rose this question of all questions but there was no ъperceptible difference in his excitement for there was always the possible chance that she might change her mind and say yes if only for variety wanting a thing continuously unchangingly unceasingly year after year he thought longing to reach it as the river longed to reach the sea such wanting might in course of time mean having rose drove up to the bridge with the mens luncheon and the under boss came up to take the baskets and boxes from the back of the wagon weve had a reglar tussle this mornin rose he said the logs are determined not to move ike billings thats the hansomest and fluentest allround swearer on the saco has tried his best on the side jam hes all out o cusswords and there haint a log budged now stid o dogwarpin this afternoon an lettin the oxen haul off all them stubborn logs by main force were goin to ask you to set up on the bank and smile at the jam land she can do it says ike a minute ago when rose starts smilin he says there aint a jam nor a bung in me that dont melt like wax and jest float right off same as the logs do when they get into quiet sunny water rose blushed and laughed and drove up the hill to mite shapleys where she put up the horse and waited till the men had eaten their luncheon the drivers slept and had breakfast and supper at the billings house a mile downriver but for several years mrs wiley had furnished the noon meal sending it down piping hot on the stroke of twelve the boys always said that up or down the whole length of the saco there was no such cooking as the wileys and much of this praise was earned by roses serving it was the old grandmother who burnished the tin plates and dippers till they looked like silver for crotchety and sharptongued as she was she never allowed rose to spoil her hands with soft soap and sand but it was rose who planned and packed rose who hemmed squares of old white tablecloths and sheets to line the baskets and keep things daintily separate rose also whose tarts and cakes were the pride and admiration of church sociables and sewing societies where could such smoking pots of beans be found a murmur of ecstatic approval ran through the crowd when the covers were removed pieces of sweet homefed pork glistened like varnished mahogany on the top of the beans and underneath were such deeps of fragrant juice as come only from slow fires and long quiet hours in brick ovens who else could steam and bake such mealy loaves of brown bread brown as plumpudding yet with no suspicion of sogginess who such soda biscuits big feathery tasting of cream and hardly needing butter and greenapple pies could such candied lower crusts be found elsewhere or more delectable filling or such rich nutty doughnuts doughnuts that had spurned the hot fat which is the ruin of so many and risen from its waves like goldenbrown venuses by the great seleckmen ejaculated jed towle as he swallowed his fourth id like to hev a wife two daughters and four sisters like them wileys and jest set still on the riverbank an hev em cook victuals for me id hev nothin to wish for then but a mouth as big as the sacos and i wish this custard pie was the size o bonnie eagle pond said ike billings id like to fall into the middle of it and eat my way out look at that bunch o chiny asters tied on t the bail o that biscuitpail said ivory dunn thats the girls doins you bet womenfolks dont seem to make no boquets after they git married lets divide em up an wear em drivin this afternoon mebbe theyll ketch the eye so t our rags wont show so bad land its lucky my hundred days is about up if i dont git home soon i shall be arrested for goin without cloes i set up bout all night puttin these blue patches in my pants an tryin to piece together a couple of old redflannel shirts to make one whole one thats the worst o drivin in these places where the pretty girls make a habit of comin down to the bridge to see the fun you hev to keep rigged up jest so stylish you cant git no chance at the rum bottle an you even hev to go a leetle mite light on swearin iv blasphemious swearin steve watermans an awful nice feller exclaimed ivory dunn just then stephen had been looking intently across the river watching the shapleys side door from which rose might issue at any moment and at this point in the discussion he had lounged away from the group and moving toward the bridge began to throw pebbles idly into the water hes an awful smart driver for one that dont foller drivin the year round continued ivory and hes the awfullest cleanspoken softspoken feller i ever see theres ben two black sheep in his family aready an steve kind o feels as if hed ought to be extry white remarked jed towle you fellers that belonged to the old drive remember pretty quick waterman well enough steves mother brought him up yes most of them remembered the waterman twins stephens cousins now both dead slow waterman so moderate in his steps and actions that you had to fix a landmark somewhere near him to see if he moved and pretty quick who shone by comparison with his twin id kind o forgot that pretty quick waterman was cousin to steve said the under boss he never worked with me much but he want cut off the same piece o goods as the other watermans great hemlock but he kep a cussin dictionary pretty quick did whenever he heard any new words he must a writ em down an then studied em all up in the wintertime to use in the spring drive swearin s a habit that hed ought to be practiced with turrible caution observed old mr wiley when the drivers had finished luncheon and taken out their pipes theres three kinds o swearin plain swearin profane swearin an blasphemious swearin logs air jest like mules theres times when a man cant seem to rip up a jam in good style thout a few words thats too strong for the infant classes in sundayschools but a man hed nt ought to tempt providencewhen hes ridin a log near the falls at high water or cuttin the keylog in a jam he aint in no place for blasphemious swearin jest a little easy perlite damn is bout all he can resk if he dont want to git drownded an hev his ghost walkin the riverbanks till kingdom come you an i long was the only ones that seen pretty quick go want we continued old kennebec glancing at long abe dennett cousin to short abe who lay on his back in the grass the smokewreaths rising from his pipe and the steel spikes in his heavy calkedsole boots shining in the sun there was folks on the bridge long answered but we was the only ones near enough to see an hear it was so onexpected an so soon over that them as was watchin upstream where the men was to work on the falls would nt a hed time to see him go down but i did an nobody aint heard me swear sence though its ten years ago i allers said it was rum an bravadder that killed pretty quick waterman that day the boys hed nt give him a dare that he hed nt took up he seemed like he was possessed an the logs was the same way they was fairly wild leapin around in the maddest kind o water you ever see the river was bilin high that spring it was an awful stubborn jam an pretty quick hed ben workin on it sence dinner he clumb up the bank moren once to have a pull at the bottle that was hid in the bushes interpolated mr wiley like as not that was his failin well most o the boys were on the other side o the river workin above the bridge an the boss hed called pretty quick to come off an leave the jam till mornin when theyd get horses an dogwarp it off log by log but when the boss got out o sight pretty quick jest stood right still swingin his axe an blasphemin so it would freeze your blood vowin he would nt move till the logs did if he stayed there till the crack o doom jest then a great ponderous log that hed ben churnin up an down in the falls for a week got free an come blunderin an thunderin downriver land it was chock full o water an looked bout as big as a church it come straight along buttend foremost an struck that jam full force so t every log in it shivered there was a crack the crack o doom sure enough for pretty quick an one o the logs lep right out an struck him jest where he stood with his axe in the air blasphemin the jam kind o melted an crumbled up an in a second pretty quick was whirlin in the white water he never riz at least where we could see him an we did nt find him for a week thats the whole story an i guess steve takes it as a warnin anyway he aint no friend to rum nor swearin steve aint he knows pretty quicks ways shortened his mothers life an you notice what a sharp lookout he keeps on rufus he needs it ike billings commented tersely some men seem to lose their wits when theyre workin on logs observed mr wiley who had deeply resented long dennetts telling of a story which he knew fully as well and could have told much better now natrally ive seen things on the kennebec three cheers for the saco hats off boys shouted jed towle and his directions were followed with a will as i was sayin continued the old man peacefully ive seen things on the kennebec that would nt happen on a small river an ive ben in turrible places an taken turrible resks resks that would a turned a saco river mans hair white but them is the times when my wits work the quickest i remember once i was smokin my pipe when a jam broke under me t was a small jam or what we call a small jam on the kennebec only about three hundred thousand pine logs the first thing i knowed i was shootin back an forth in the bilin foam hangin on t the end of a log like a spider my hands was clasped round the log and i never lost control o my pipe they said i smoked right along jest as cool an placid as a pondlily why d you quit drivin inquired ivory my strength want ekal to it mr wiley responded sadly i was all skin bones an nerve the compny would nt part with me altogether so they give me a place in the office down on the wharves that want so bad said jed towle why did nt you hang on to it sos to keep in sight o the kennebec i found i could nt be confined under cover my liver give all out my appetite failed me an i want wuth a days wages id learned engineerin when i was a boy an i thought id try runnin on the road a spell but it did nt suit my constitution my kidneys aint turrible strong an the doctors said id have brights disease if i did nt git some kind o work where there want no vibrations hard to find mr wiley hard to find said jed towle youre right responded the old man feelingly ive tried all kinds o labor some of em dont suit my liver some disagrees with my stomach and the rest of em has vibrations so here i set high an dry on the banks of life you might say like a stranded log as this wellknown simile fell upon the ear there was a general stir in the group for turrible wiley when rhetorical sometimes grew tearful and this was a mood not to be encouraged all right boss called ike billings winking to the boys well be there in a jiffy for the luncheon hour had flown and the work of the afternoon was waiting for them you make a chalkmark where you left off mr wiley an well hear the rest tomorrer only dont you forgit nothin remember t was the kennebec you was talkin about i will indeed responded the old man as i was sayin when interrupted i may be a stranded log but im proud that the mark o the gardner lumber compny is on me so t when i git to my journeys end theyll know where i belong and send me back to the kennebec before im sawed up id like to forgit this triflin brook in the sight of a goodsized river an rest my eyes on some fullgrown logs stead o these little damn pipestems you boys are playin with v the game of jackstraws there was a roar of laughter at the old mans boast but in a moment all was activity the men ran hither and thither like ants gathering their tools there were some oldfashioned pickpoles straight heavy levers without any dog and there were modern pickpoles and peaveys for every river has its favorite equipment in these things there was no dynamite in those days to make the stubborn jams yield and the dogwarp was in general use horses or oxen sometimes a line of men stood on the riverbank a long rope was attached by means of a steel spike to one log after another and it was dragged from the tangled mass sometimes after unloading the top logs those at the bottom would rise and make the task easier sometimes the work would go on for hours with no perceptible progress and mr wiley would have opportunity to tell the bystanders of a turrible jam on the kennebec that had cost the lumber company ten thousand dollars to break there would be great arguments on shore among the villagers as well as among the experts as to the particular log which might be a key to the position the boss would study the problem from various standpoints and the drivers themselves would pass from heated discussion into long consultations theyre paid by the day old kennebec would philosophize to the doctor an when theyre consultin they dont hev to be doggin which is a turrible sight harder work rose had created a small sensation on one occasion by pointing out to the under boss the keylog in a jam she was past mistress of the pretty game of jackstraws much in vogue at that time the delicate little lengths of polished wood or bone were shaken together and emptied on the table each jackstraw had one of its ends fashioned in the shape of some sort of implement a rake hoe spade fork or mallet all the pieces were intertwined by the shaking process and they lay as they fell in a hopeless tangle the task consisted in taking a tiny pickpole scarcely bigger than a match and with the bit of curved wire on the end lifting off the jackstraws one by one without stirring the pile or making it tremble when this occurred you gave place to your opponent who relinquished his turn to you when ill fortune descended upon him the game which was a kind of riverdriving and jampicking in miniature being decided by the number of pieces captured and their value no wonder that the under boss asked roses advice as to the keylog she had a fairys hand and her cunning at deciding the pieces to be moved and her skill at extricating and lifting them from the heap were looked upon in edgewood as little less than supernatural it was a favorite pastime and although a mans hand is ill adapted to it being overlarge and heavy the game has obvious advantages for a lover in bringing his head very close to that of his beloved adversary the jackstraws have to be watched with a hawks eagerness since the trembling can be discerned only by a keen eye but there were moments when stephen was willing to risk the loss of a battle if he could watch roses drooping eyelashes the delicate down on her pink cheek and the feathery curls that broke away from her hair he was looking at her now from a distance for she and mite shapley were assisting jed towle to pile up the tin plates and tie the tin dippers together next she peered into one of the beanpots and seemed pleased that there was still something in its depths then she gathered the fragments neatly together in a basket and followed by her friend clambered down the banks to a shady spot where the boomshers otherwise known as the crambry family were lined up expectantly it is not difficult to find a single fool in any community however small but a family of fools is fortunately somewhat rarer every county however can boast of one foolfamily and york county is always in the fashion with fools as with everything else the unique muchquoted and undesirable boomshers could not be claimed as indigenous to the saco valley for this branch was an offshoot of a still larger tribe inhabiting a distant township its beginnings were shrouded in mystery there was a frenchcanadian ancestor somewhere and a gypsy or indian grandmother they had always intermarried from time immemorial when one of the selectmen of their native place had been asked why the boomshers always married cousins and why the habit was not discouraged he replied that he really did nt know he sposed they felt it would be kind of odd to go right out and marry a stranger lest boomsher seem an unusual surname it must be explained that the actual name was french and could not be coped with by edgewood or pleasant river being something luite as impossible to spell as to pronounce as the family had lived for the last few years somewhere near the killick cranberry meadows they were called and completely described in the calling the crambry foolfamily a talented and much traveled gentleman who once stayed over night at the edgewood tavern proclaimed it his opinion that boomsher had been gradually corrupted from beaumarchais when he wrote the word on his visiting card and showed it to mr wiley old kennebec had replied that in the judgment of a man who had lived in large places and seen a turrible lot o life such a name could never have been given either to a christian or a heathen family that the way in which the letters was thrown together into it and the way in which they was sounded when read out loud was entirely agin reason it was true he said that beaumarchais bein such a foolname might a ben invented apurpose for a foolfamily but he would nt hold even with callin em boomsher crambry was well enough for em an a sight easier to speak stephen knew a good deal about the crambrys for he passed their socalled habitation in going to one of his woodlots it was only a month before that he had found them all sitting outside their brokendown fence surrounded by decrepit chairs sofas tables bedsteads bits of carpet and stoves whats the matter he called out from his wagon there aint nothin the matter said alcestis crambry fathers lead an were dividin up the furnerchure alcestis was the pride of the crambrys and the list of his attainments used often to be on his proud fathers lips it was he who was the largest for his size in the family he who could tell his brothers paul and arcadus by their looks he who knew a sour apple from a sweet one the minute he bit it he who at the early age of ten was bright enough to point to the cupboard and say puddin dad alcestis had enjoyed in consequence of his unusual intellectual powers some educational privileges and the killick schoolmistress well remembered his first day at the village seat of learning reports of what took place in this classic temple from day to day may have been wafted to the dull ears of the boy who was not thought ready for school until he had attained the ripe age of twelve it may even have been that specific rumors of the signs symbols and hieroglyphics used in educational institutions had reached him in the obscurity of his cranberry meadows at all events when confronted by the alphabet chart whose huge black capitals were intended to capture the wandering eyes of the infant class alcestis exhibited unusual almost unnatural excitement that is a my boy said the teacher genially as she pointed to the first character on the chart good god is that a cried alcestis sitting down heavily on the nearest bench and neither teacher nor scholars could discover whether he was agreeably surprised or disappointed in the letter whether he had expected if he ever encountered it to find it writhing in coils on the floor of a cage or whether it simply bore no resemblance to the ideal already established in his mind mrs wiley had once tried to make something of mercy the oldest daughter of the family but at the end of six weeks she announced that a girl who could nt tell whether the clock was going forrards or backwards and who rubbed a pockethandkerchief as long as she did a sheet would be no help in her household the crambrys had daily walked the five or six miles from their home to the edgewood bridge during the progress of the drive not only for the social and intellectual advantages to be gained from the company present but for the more solid compensation of a good meal they all adored rose partly because she gave them food and partly because she was sparkling and pretty and wore pink dresses that caught their dull eyes the afternoon proved a lively one in the first place one of the younger men slipped into the water between two logs part of a lot chained together waiting to be let out of the boom the weight of the mass higher up and the force of the current wedged him in rather tightly and when he had been pried out he declared that he felt like an apple after it had been squeezed in the cidermill so he drove home and rufus waterman took his place two hours hard work followed this incident and at the end of that time the bung that reached from the shore to watermans ledge the rock where pretty quick met his fate was broken up and the logs that composed it were started downriver there remained now only the great side jam at gray rock this had been allowed to grow gathering logs as they drifted past thus making higher water and a stronger current on the other side of the rock and allowing an easier passage for the logs at that point all was excitement now for this particular piece of work accomplished the boom above the falls would be turned out and the river would once more be clear and clean at the edgewood bridge small boys perching on the rocks with their heels hanging hands and mouths full of red astrakhan apples cheered their favorites to the echo while the drivers shouted to one another and watched the signs and signals of the boss who could communicate with them only in that way so great was the roar of the water the jam refused to yield to ordinary measures it was a difficult problem for the rocky riverbed held many a snare and pitfall there was a certain ledge under the water so artfully placed that every log striking under its projecting edges would wedge itself firmly there attracting others by its evil example that galootboss ought to hev shoved his crew down to that jam this mornin grumbled old kennebec to alcestis crambry who was always his most loyal and attentive listener but he would nt take no advice not if pharaoh nor boaz nor herod nor nicodemus come right out o the bible an give it to him the logs air contrary today sometimes theyll go along as easy as an old shoe an other times theyll do nothin but bung bung bung theres a log nestlin down in the middle o that jam that ive ben watchin for a week its a curous one to begin with an then it has a mark on it that you can reconize it by did ye ever hear tell o george the third king of england alcestis or aint he known over to the crambry medders well once upon a time men used to go through the forests over here an slash a mark on the trunks o the biggest trees that was the royal sign as you might say an meant that the tree was to be taken over to england to make masts an yardarms for the kings ships what made me think of it now is that the kings mark was an arrer an its an arrer thats on that there log im showin ye well sir i seen it fust at millikens mills a monday it was in trouble then an its ben in trouble ever sence thats allers the way therell be one pesky crooked contrary consarned log that cant go anywheres without gittin into difficulties you can yank it out an set it afloat an before you hardly git your doggin iron off of it itll be snarled up agin in some new place from the time its chopped down to the day it gets to saco it costs the compny bout ten times its pesky valler as lumber now theyve sent over to bensons for a team of horses an i bate ye they cant git em i wish i was the boss on this river alcestis i wish i was echoed the boy well your headfillin aint the right kind for a boss alcestis an youd better stick to dry land you set right down here while i go back a piece an git the pipe out o my coat pocket i guess nothin aint goin to happen for a few minutes the surmise about the horses unlike most of old kennebecs proved to be true bensons pair had gone to portland with a load of hay accordingly the tackle was brought the rope was adjusted to a log and five of the drivers standing on the riverbank attempted to drag it from its intrenched position it refused to yield the fraction of an inch rufus and stephen joined the five men and the augmented crew of seven were putting all their strength on the rope when a cry went up from the watchers on the bridge the dog had loosened suddenly and the men were flung violently to the ground for a second they were stunned both by the surprise and by the shock of the blow but in the same moment the cry of the crowd swelled louder alcestis crambry had stolen all unnoticed to the rope and had attempted to use his feeble powers for the common good when the blow came he fell backward and making no effort to control the situation slid over the bank and into the water the other crambrys not realizing the danger laughed audibly but there was no jeering from the bridge stephen had seen alcestis slip and in the fraction of a moment had taken off his boots and was coasting down the slippery rocks behind him in a twinkling he was in the water almost as soon as the boy himself doggoned idjut exclaimed old kennebec tearfully wuth the hull foolfamily if i hed nt a ben so old id a jumped in myself for you cant drownd a wiley not without you tie nailkags to their head an feet an drop em in the falls alcestis who had neither brains courage nor experience had better still the luck that follows the witless he was carried swiftly down the current but only fifty feet away a long slender log wedged between two low rocks on the shore jutted out over the water almost touching its surface the boys clothes were admirably adapted to the situation being full of enormous rents in some way the end of the log caught in the rags of alcestiss coat and held him just seconds enough to enable stephen to swim to him to seize him by the nape of the neck to lift him on the log and thence to the shore it was a particularly bad place for a landing and there was nothing to do but to lower ropes and drag the drenched men to the high ground above alcestis came to his senses in ten or fifteen minutes and seemed as bright as usual with a kind of added swagger at being the central figure in a dramatic situation i wonder you hed nt stove your brains out when you landed so turrible suddent on that rock at the foot of the bank said mr wiley to him i should but i took good care to light on my head responded alcestis a cryptic remark which so puzzled old kennebec that he mused over it for some hours vi hearts and other hearts stephen had brought a change of clothes as he had a habit of being ducked once at least during the day and since there was a halt in the proceedings and no need of his services for an hour or two he found rose and walked with her to a secluded spot where they could watch the logs and not be seen by the people you frightened everybody almost to death jumping into the river chided rose stephen laughed they thought i was a fool to save a fool i suppose perhaps not as bad as that but it did seem reckless i know and the boy no doubt would be better off dead but so should i be if i could have let him die rose regarded this strange point of view for a moment and then silently acquiesced in it she was constantly doing this and she often felt that her mental horizon broadened in the act but she could not be sure that stephen grew any dearer to her because of his moral altitudes besides stephen argued i happened to be nearest to the river and it was my job how do you always happen to be nearest to the people in trouble and why is it always your job if there are any rewards for good conduct being distributed im right in line with my hand stretched out stephen replied with meaning in his voice rose blushed under her flowery hat as he led the way to a bench under a sycamore tree that overhung the water she had almost convinced herself that she was as much in love with stephen waterman as it was in her nature to be with anybody he was handsome in his big way kind generous temperate well educated and welltodo no fault could be found with his family for his mother had been a teacher and his father though a farmer a college graduate stephen himself had had one year at bowdoin but had been recalled as the head of the house when his father died that was a severe blow but his mothers death three years after was a grief never to be quite forgotten rose too was the child of a gently bred mother and all her instincts were refined yes stephen in himself satisfied her in all the larger wants of her nature but she had an unsatisfied hunger for the world the world of portland where her cousins lived or better still the world of boston of which she heard through mrs wealthy brooks whose nephew claude often came to visit her in edgewood life on a farm a mile and a half distant from postoffice and stores life in the house with rufus who was rumored to be somewhat wild and unsteady this prospect seemed a trifle dull and uneventful to the trivial part of her though to the better part it was enough the better part of her loved stephen waterman dimly feeling the richness of his nature the tenderness of his affection the strength of his character rose was not destitute either of imagination or sentiment she did not relish this constant weighing of stephen in the balance he was too good to be weighed and considered she longed to be carried out of herself on a wave of rapturous assent but something seemed to hold her back some seed of discontent with the mans environment and circumstances some germ of longing for a gayer brighter more varied life no amount of selfsearching or argument could change the situation she always loved stephen more or less more when he was away from her because she never approved his collars nor the set of his shirt bosom and as he naturally wore these despised articles of apparel whenever he proposed to her she was always lukewarm about marrying him and settling down on the river farm still today she discovered in herself with positive gratitude a warmer feeling for him than she had experienced before he wore a new and becoming gray flannel shirt with the soft turnover collar that belonged to it and a blue tie the color of his kind eyes she knew that he had shaved his beard at her request not long ago and that when she did not like the effect as much as she had hoped he had meekly grown a mustache for her sake it did seem as if a man could hardly do more to please an exacting ladylove and she had admired him unreservedly when he pulled off his boots and jumped into the river to save alcestis crambrys life without giving a single thought to his own and was there ever after all such a noble devoted unselfish fellow or a better brother and would she not despise herself for rejecting him simply because he was countrified and because she longed to see the world of the fashion plates in the magazines the logs are so like people she exclaimed as they sat down i could name nearly every one of them for somebody in the village look at mite shapley that dancing little one slipping over the falls and skimming along the top of the water keeping out of all the deep places and never once touching the rocks stephen fell into her mood theres squire anderson coming down crosswise and bumping everything in reach you know hes always buying lumber and logs without knowing what he is going to do with them they just lie and rot by the roadside the boys always say that a toadstool is the old squires mark on a log and that stout clumsy one is short dennett what are you doing stephen only building a fence round this clump of harebells stephen replied theyve just got well rooted and if the boys come skidding down the bank with their spiked shoes the poor things will never hold up their heads again now theyre safe oh look rose there come the minister and his wife a portly couple of peeled logs exactly matched in size came ponderously over the falls together rose within a second of each other joined again and swept under the bridge side by side and oh oh dr and mrs cram just after them isnt that funny laughed rose as a very long slender pair of pines swam down as close to each other as if they had been glued in that position rose thought as she watched them who but stephen would have cared what became of the clump of delicate harebells how gentle such a man would be to a woman how tender his touch would be if she were ill or in trouble several single logs followed crooked ones stolid ones adventurous ones feeble swimmers deep divers some of them tried to start a small jam on their own account others stranded themselves for good and all as rose and stephen sat there side by side with little dan cupid for an invisible third on the bench there never was anything so like people rose repeated leaning forward excitedly and upon my word the minister and doctor couples are still together i wonder if theyll get as far as the fails at union that would be an odd place to part would nt it union stephen saw his opportunity and seized it theres a reason rose why two logs go downstream better than one and get into less trouble they make a wider path create more force and a better current its the same way with men and women oh rose there is nt a man in the world thats loved you as long or knows how to love you any better than i do youre just like a white birch sapling and im a great clumsy fir tree but if you ll only trust yourself to me rose ill take you safely downriver stephens big hand closed on roses little one she returned its pressure softly and gave him the kiss that with her as with him meant a promise for all the years to come the truth and passion in the man had broken the girls bonds for the moment her vision was clearer and realizing the treasures of love and fidelity that were being offered her she accepted them half unconscious that she was not returning them in kind how is the belle of two villages to learn that she should thank heaven fasting for a good mans love and stephen he went home in the dusk not knowing whether his feet were touching the solid earth or whether he was treading upon rainbows roses pink calico seemed to brush him as he walked in the path that was wide enough only for one his solitude was peopled again when he fed the cattle for roses face smiled at him from the haymow and when he strained the milk rose held the pans his nightly tasks over he went out and took his favorite seat under the apple tree all was still save for the crickets ceaseless chirp the soft thud of an august sweeting dropping in the grass and the swishswash of the water against his boat tethered in the willow cove he remembered when he first saw rose for that must have been when he began to love her though he was only fourteen and quite unconscious that the first seed had been dropped in the rich soil of his boyish heart he was seated on the kerosene barrel in the edgewood postoffice which was also the general country store where newspapers letters molasses nails salt codfish hairpins sugar liver pills canned goods beans and ginghams dwelt in genial proximity when she entered just a little pinkandwhite slip of a thing with a tin pail in her hand and a sunbonnet falling off her wavy hair stephen suddenly stopped swinging his feet she gravely announced her wants reading them from a bit of paper quart molasses package ginger lb cheese pairs shoe laces card shirt buttons while the storekeeper drew off the molasses she exchanged shy looks with stephen who clean welldressed and carefully mothered as he was felt all at once uncouth and awkward rather as if he were some clumsy lout pitchforked into the presence of a fairy queen he offered her the little bunch of bachelors buttons he held in his hand augury of the future had he known it and she accepted them with a smile she dropped her memorandum he picked it up and she smiled again doing still more fatal damage than in the first instance no words were spoken but rose even at ten had less need of them than most of her sex for her dimples aided by dancing eyes length of lashes and curve of lips quite took the place of conversation the dimples tempted assented denied corroborated deplored protested sympathized while the intoxicated beholder cudgeled his brain for words or deeds which should provoke and evoke more and more dimples the storekeeper hung the molasses pail over roses right arm and tucked the packages under her left and as he opened the mosquitonetting door to let her pass out she looked back at stephen perched on the kerosene barrel just a little girl a little glance a little dimple and stephen was never quite the same again the years went on and the boy became man yet no other image had ever troubled the deep placid waters of his heart now after many denials the hopes and longings of his nature had been answered and rose had promised to marry him he would sacrifice his passion for logging and driving in the future and become a staid farmer and man of affairs only giving himself a river holiday now and then how still and peaceful it was under the trees and how glad his mother would be to think that the old farm would wake from its sleep and a womans light foot be heard in the sunny kitchen heaven was full of silent stars and there was a moonglade on the water that stretched almost from him to rose his heart embarked on that golden pathway and sailed on it to the farther shore the river was free of logs and under the light of the moon it shone like a silver mirror the soft wind among the fir branches breathed roses name the river rippling against the shore sang rose and as stephen sat there dreaming of the future his dreams too could have been voiced in one word and that word rose vii the little house the autumn days flew past like shuttles in a loom the river reflected the yellow foliage of the white birch and the scarlet of the maples the wayside was bright with goldenrod with the red tassels of the sumac with the purple frostflower and feathery clematis if rose was not as happy as stephen she was quietly content and felt that she had more to be grateful for than most girls for stephen surprised her with first one evidence and then another of thoughtful generosity in his heart of hearts he felt that rose was not wholly his that she reserved withheld something and it was the subjugation of this rebellious province that he sought he and rose had agreed to wait a year for their marriage in which time roses cousin would finish school and be ready to live with the old people meanwhile stephen had learned that his maiden aunt would be glad to come and keep house for rufus the work at the river farm was too hard for a girl so he had persuaded himself of late and the house was so far from the village that rose was sure to be lonely he owned a couple of acres between his place and the edgewood bridge and here one afternoon only a month after their engagement he took rose to see the foundations of a little house he was building for her it was to be only a storyandahalf cottage of six small rooms the two upper chambers to be finished off later on stephen had placed it well back from the road leaving space in front for what was to be a most wonderful arrangement of flowerbeds yet keeping a strip at the back on the riverbrink for a small vegetable garden there had been a house there years beforeso many years that the blackened ruins were entirely overgrown but a few elms and an old appleorchard remained to shade the new dwelling and give welcome to the coming inmates stephen had fifteen hundred dollars in bank he could turn his hand to almost anything and his love was so deep that roses plumbline had never sounded bottom accordingly he was able with the help of two steady workers to have the roof on before the first of november the weather was clear and fine and by thanksgiving clapboards shingles two coats of brown paint and even the blinds had all been added this exhibition of reckless energy on stephens part did not wholly commend itself to the neighborhood steves too turrible spry said roses grandfather hell trip himself up some o these times you never will remarked his better half sagely the resks in life come along fast enough without runnin to meet em continued the old man theres good dough in rose but it aint moren half riz let somebody come along an drop in a little more yeast or set the dish a little mite nearer the stove an youll see what ll happen steves kept house for himself some time an i guess he knows more about breadmakin than you do there dont nobody know moren i do about nothin when my pipes drawin real good an nobodys thornin me to go to work replied mr wiley but nobodys willin to take the advice of a man thats seen the world an lived in large places an the risin generation is in a turrible hurry i don know how t is young folks air allers settin the clock forrard an the old ones puttin it back did you ketch anything for dinner when you was out this mornin asked his wife no i fished an fished till i was about ready to drop an i did git a few shiners but land they want as big as the worms i was ketchin em with so i pitched em back in the water an quit during the progress of these remarks mr wiley opened the door under the sink and from beneath a huge iron pot drew a round tray loaded with a glass pitcher and half a dozen tumblers which he placed carefully on the kitchen table this is the last days option ive got on this lemonadeset he said an if im goin to biddeford tomorrer ive got to make up my mind here an now with this observation he took off his shoes climbed in his stocking feet to the vantage ground of a kitchen chair and lifted a stone china pitcher from a corner of the highest cupboard shelf where it had been hidden this lemonades gittin kind o dusty he complained i callated to hev a kind of a spree on it when i got through choosin roses weddin present but i guess the pig ll hev to help me out the old man filled one of the glasses from the pitcher pulled up the kitchen shades to the top put both hands in his pockets and walked solemnly round the table gazing at his offering from every possible point of view there had been three lemonadesets in the window of a biddeford crockery store when mr wiley chanced to pass by and he had brought home the blue and green one on approval to th casual cyc it would have appeared as quite uniquely hideous until the red and yellow or the purple and orange ones had been seen after that no human being could have made a decision where each was so unparalleled in its ugliness and old kennebecs confusion of mind would have been perfectly understood by the connoisseur how do you like it with the lemonade in mother he inquired eagerly the thing that plagues me most is that the red an yaller one i hed home last week lights up bettern this an i believe ill settle on that for as i was thinkin last night in bed lemonade is mostly an evenin drink an rose wont be usin the set much by daylight root beer looks the hansomest in this purple set but rose loves lemonade bettern beer so i guess ill pack up this one an change it tomorrer mebbe when i get it out o sight an give the lemonade to the pig ill be easier in my mind in the opinion of the community at large stephens forehandedness in the matter of preparations for his marriage was imprudence and his desire for neatness and beauty flagrant extravagance the house itself was a foolish idea it was thought but there were extenuating circumstances for the maiden aunt really needed a home and rufus was likely to marry before long and take his wife to the river farm it was to be hoped in his case that he would avoid the snares of beauty and choose a good stout girl who would bring the dairy back to what it was in mrs watermans time all winter long stephen labored on the inside of the cottage mostly by himself he learned all trades in succession love being his only master he had many odd days to spare from his farm work and if he had not found days he would have taken nights scarcely a nail was driven without roses advice and when the plastering was hard and dry the wallpapers were the result of weeks of consultation among the quiet joys of life there is probably no other so deep so sweet so full of trembling hope and delight as the building and making of a home a home where two lives are to be merged in one and flow on together a home full of mysterious and delicious possibilities hidden in a future which is always rosecolored roses sweet little nature broadened under stephens influence but she had her moments of discontent and unrest always followed quickly by remorse at the thanksgiving sociable some one had observed her turquoise engagement ring some one who said that such a hand was worthy of a diamond that turquoises were a pretty color but that there was only one stone for an engagement ring and that was a diamond at the christmas dance the same some one had said that her waltzing would make her all the rage in boston she wondered if it were true and wondered whether if she had not promised to marry stephen some splendid being from a city would have descended from his heights bearing diamonds in his hand not that she would have accepted them she only wondered these disloyal thoughts came seldom and she put them resolutely away devoting herself with all the greater assiduity to her muslin curtains and ruffled pillowshams stephen too had his momentary pangs there were times when he could calm his doubts only by working on the little house the mere sight of the beloved floors and walls and ceilings comforted his heart and brought him good cheer the winter was a cold one so bitterly cold that even the rapid water at the gray rock was a mass of curdled yellow ice something that had only occurred once or twice before within the memory of the oldest inhabitant it was also a very gay season for pleasant river and edgewood never had there been so many cardparties sleighrides and tavern dances and never such wonderful skating the river was one gleaming glittering thoroughfare of ice from millikens mills to the dam at the edgewood bridge at sundown bonfires were built here and there on the mirrorlike surface and all the young people from the neighboring villages gathered on the ice while detachments of merry rosycheeked boys and girls those who preferred coasting met at the top of brigadier hill from which one could get a longer and more perilous slide than from any other point in the township claude merrill in his occasional visits from boston was very much in evidence at the saturday evening ice parties he was not an artist at the sport himself but he was especially proficient in the art of strapping on a ladys skates and murmuring as he adjusted the last buckle the prettiest foot and ankle on the river it cannot be denied that this compliment gave secret pleasure to the fair village maidens who received it but it was a pleasure accompanied by electric shocks of excitement a girls foot might perhaps be mentioned if a fellow were daring enough but the line was rigidly drawn at the ankle which was not a part of the human frame ever alluded to in the polite society of edgewood at that time rose in her red linseywoolsey dress and her squirrel furs and cap was the life of every gathering and when stephen took her hand and they glided upstream alone together in the crowd he used to wish that they might skate on and on up the crystal icepath of the river to the moon itself whither it seemed to lead them viii the garden of eden but the saco all this time was meditating one of its surprises the snapping cold weather and the depth to which the water was frozen were aiding it in its preparation for the greatest event of the season on a certain gray saturday in march after a week of mild temperature it began to rain as if after months of snowing it really enjoyed a new form of entertainment sunday dawned with the very floodgates of heaven opening so it seemed all day long the river was rising under its miles of unbroken ice rising at the threatening rate of four inches an hour edgewood went to bed as usual that night for the bridge at that point was set too high to be carried away by freshets but at other villages whose bridges were in less secure position there was little sleep and much anxiety at midnight a cry was heard from the men watching at millikens mills the great ice jam had parted from rolfes island and was swinging out into the open pushing everything before it all the ablebodied men in the village turned out of bed and with lanterns in hand began to clear the stores and mills for it seemed that everything near the riverbanks must go before that avalanche of ice stephen and rufus were there helping to save the property of their friends and neighbors rose and mite shapley had stayed the night with a friend and all three girls were shivering with fear and excitement as they stood near the bridge watching the nevertobeforgotten sight it is needless to say that the crambry family was on hand for whatever instincts they may have lacked the instinct for being on the spot when anything was happening was present in them to the most remarkable extent the town was supporting them in modest winter quarters somewhat nearer than killick to the center of civilization and the first alarm brought them promptly to the scene mrs crambry remarking at intervals if id known thered be so many out id ought to have worn my bunnit but i aint got no bunnit an if i had they say i aint got no head to wear it on by the time the jam neared the falls it had grown with its accumulations until it was made up of tier after tier of huge ice cakes piled side by side and one upon another with heaps of trees and branches and drifting lumber holding them in place some of the blocks stood erect and towered like icebergs and these glittering in the lights of the twinkling lanterns pushed solemnly forward cracking crushing and cutting everything in their way when the great mass neared the planing mill on the east shore the girls covered their eyes expecting to hear the crash of the falling building but impelled by the force of some mysterious current it shook itself ponderously and then with one magnificent movement slid up the riverbank tier following tier in grand confusion this left a water way for the main drift the ice broke in every direction and down down down from bonnie eagle and moderation swept the harvest of the winter freezing it came thundering over the dam bringing boats farming implements posts supports and every sort of floating lumber with it and cutting under the flour mill tipped it cleverly over on its side and went crashing on its way downriver at edgewood it pushed colossal blocks of ice up the banks into the roadway piling them end upon end ten feet in air then tearing and rumbling and booming through the narrows it covered the intervale at pleasant point and made a huge ice bridge below union falls a bridge so solid that it stood there for days a sight for all the neighboring villages this exciting event wonhi haxe forever set apart this winter from ail others in stephens memory even had it not been also the winter when he was building a house for his future wife but afterwards in looking back on the wild night of the ice freshet stephen remembered that roses manner was strained and cold and evasive and that when he had seen her talking with claude merrill it had seemed to him that that whippersnapper had looked at her as no honorable man in edgewood ever looked at an engaged girl he recalled his throb of gratitude that claude lived at a safe distance and his subsequent pang of remorse at doubting for an instant roses fidelity so at length april came the saco was still high turbid and angry and the boys were waiting at limington falls for the ossipee drive to begin stephen joined them there for he was restless and the river called him as it did every spring each stubborn log that he encountered gave him new courage and power of overcoming the rush of the water the noise and roar and dash the exposure and danger all made the blood run in his veins like new wine when he came back to the farm all the cobwebs had been blown from his brain and his first interview with rose was so intoxicating that he went immediately to portland and bought in a kind of secret penitence for his former fears a pale pinkflowered wallpaper for the bedroom in the new home it had once been voted down by the entire advisory committee mrs wiley said that pink was foolish and was always sure to fade and the border being a mass of solid roses was five cents a yard virtually a prohibitive price mr wiley said he should hate to hev a spell of sickness an lay abed in a room where there was things growin all over the place he thought roughplastered walls where you could lay an count the spots where the roof leaked was the most entertainin in sickness rose had longed for the lovely pattern but had sided dutifully with the prudent majority so that it was with a feeling of unauthorized and illegitimate joy that stephen papered the room at night a few strips at a time on the third evening when he had removed all signs of his work he lighted two kerosene lamps and two candles finding the effect under this illumination almost too brilliant and beautiful for belief rose should never see it now he determined until the furniture was in place they had already chosen the kitchen and bedroom things though they would not be needed for some months but the rest was to wait until summer when there would be the haymoney to spend stephen did not go back to the river farm till one oclock that night the pink bedroom held him in fetters too powerful to break it looked like the garden of eden he thought to be sure it was only fifteen feet square eden might have been a little larger possibly but otherwise the pink bedroom had every advantage the pattern of roses growing on a trellis was brighter than any flowerbed in june and the border well if the border had been five dollars a foot stephen would not have grudged the money when he saw the twenty running yards of rosy bloom rioting under the white ceiling before he blew out the last light he raised it high above his head and took one fond final look its the only place i ever saw he thought that is pretty enough for her she will look just as if she was growing here with all the other flowers and i shall always think of it as the garden of eden i wonder if i got the license and the ring and took her by surprise whether shed be married in june instead of august i could be all ready if i could only persuade her at this moment stephen touched the summit of happiness and it is a curious coincidence that as he was dreaming in his garden of eden the serpent having just arrived at edgewood was sleeping peacefully at the house of mrs brooks it was the serpents fourth visit that season and he explained to inquiring friends that his former employer had sold the business and that the new management while reorganizing had determined to enlarge the premises the three clerks who had been retained having two weeks vacation with half pay it is extraordinary how frequently wise serpents are retained by the management on half or even full salary while the services of the harmless doves are dispensed with and they are set free to flutter where they will ix the serpent rose wiley had the brightest eyes in edgewood it was impossible to look at her without realizing that her physical sight was perfect what mysterious species of blindness is it that descends now and then upon human creatures and renders them incapable of judgment or discrimination claude merrill was a glove salesman in a boston fancygoods store the calling itself is undoubtedly respectable and it is quite conceivable that a man can sell gloves and still be a man but claude merrill was a manikin he inhabited a very narrow space behind a very short counter but to him it seemed the earth and the fullness thereof when irreproachably neat and even exquisite in dress he gave a napoleonic glance at his array of gloveboxes to see if the female assistant had put them in proper order for the day when with that wonderful eye for detail that had wafted him to his present height of power he pounced upon the powdersprinklers and found them as he expected empty when with masterly judgment he had made up and ticketed a basket of misfits and odd sizes to attract the eyes of women who were their human counterparts he felt himself bursting with the pride and pomp of circumstance his cambric handkerchief adjusted in his coat with the monogram corner well displayed a last touch to the carefully trained lock on his forehead and he was ready for his customers six did you say miss i should have thought five and three quarters attend to that gentleman miss dix please i am very busy sixandahalf gray suede here they are an exquisite shade shall i try them on the right hand if you will perhaps youd better remove your elegant ring i should nt like to have anything catch in the setting miss dix sixandahalf black glace upper shelf third box for this lady shes in a hurry we shall see you often after this i hope madam no we dont keep silk or lisle gloves we have no call for them our customers prefer kid oh but he was in his element was claude merrill though the glamour that surrounded him in the minds of the edgewood girls did not emanate wholly from his finicky little person something of it was the glamour that belonged to boston remote fashionable gay rich almost inaccessible boston which none could see without the expenditure of five or six dollars in railway fare with the added extravagance of a night in a hotel if one would explore it thoroughly and come home possessed of all its illimitable treasures of wisdom and experience when claude came to edgewood for a sunday or to spend a vacation with his aunt he brought with him something of the magic of a metropolis suddenly to roses eye stephen looked larger and clumsier his shoes were not the proper sort his clothes were ordinary his neckties were years behind the fashion stephens dancing compared with claudes was as the deliberate motion of an ox to the hopping of a neat little robin when claude took a girls hand in the grand rightandleft it was as if he were about to try on a delicate glove the manner in which he held his lady in the polka or schottische made her seem a queen mite shapley was so affected by it that when rufus attempted to encircle her for the mazurka she exclaimed dont act as if you were spearing logs rufus of the two men stephen had more to say but claude said more he was thought brilliant in conversation but what wonder when one considered his advantages and his dazzling experiences he had customers who were worth their thousands ladies whose fingers never touched dishwater ladies who would nt buy a glove of anybody else if they went barehanded to the grave he lived with his sister maude arthurlena in a house where there were twentytwo other boarders who could be seated at meals all at the same time so immense was the diningroom he ate his dinner at a restaurant daily and expended twentyfive cents for it without blenching he went to the theater once a week and was often accompanied by lady friends who were elegant dressers in a moment of wrath stephen had called him a counterjumper but it was a libel so short and rough a means of exit from his place of power was wholly beneath claudes dignity it was with a pardon me miss dix that the noon hour having arrived he squeezed by that slave and victim and raising the hinged board that separated his kingdom from that of the ribbon department passed out of the store hat in hand serene in the consciousness that though other clerks might nibble luncheon from a brown paper bag he would speedily be indulging in an expensive repast and miss dix knew it and it was a part of his almost invincible attraction for her it seemed flying in the face of providence to decline the attentions of such a gorgeous butterfly of fashion simply because one was engaged to marry another man at some distant day all edgewood femininity united in saying that there never was such a perfect gentleman as claude merrill and during the time when his popularity was at its height rose lost sight of the fact that stephen could have furnished the stuff for a dozen claudes and have had enough left for an ordinary man besides april gave place to may and a veil hung between the lovers an intangible gossamerlike thing not to be seen with the naked eye but oh so plainly to be felt rose hid herself thankfully behind it while stephen had not courage to lift a corner she had twice been seen driving with claude merrill that stephen knew but she had explained that there were errands to be done that her grandfather had taken the horse and that mr merrills escort had been both opportune and convenient for these practical reasons claude was everywhere present the center of attraction the observed of all observers he was irresistible contagious almost epidemic rose was now gay now silent now affectionate now distant now coquettish in fine everything that was capricious mysterious agitating incomprehensible one morning alcestis crambry went to the postoffice for stephen and brought him back the newspapers and letters he had hung about the river farm so much that stephen finally gave him bed and food in exchange for numberless small errands rufus was temporarily confined in a dark room with some strange pain and trouble in his eyes and alcestis proved of use in many ways he had always been roses slave and had often brought messages and notes from the brier neighborhood so that when stephen saw a folded note among the papers his heart gave a throb of anticipation the note was brief and when he had glanced through it he said this is not mine alcestis it belongs to miss rose go straight back and give it to her as you were told and another time keep your wits about you or ill send you back to killick alcestis crambrys ideas on all subjects were extremely vague claude merrill had given him a letter for rose but his notion was that anything that belonged to her belonged to stephen and the waterman place was much nearer than the wileys particularly at dinnertime when the boy had slouched away stephen sat under the apple tree now a mass of roseate bloom and buried his face in his hands it was not precisely a loveletter that he had read nevertheless it blackened the light of the sun for him claude asked rose to meet him anywhere on the road to the station and to take a little walk as he was leaving that afternoon and could not bear to say goodbye to her in the presence of her grandmother underthecircumstances he wrote deeply underlining the words i cannot remain a moment longer in edgewood where i have been so happy and so miserable he did not refer to the fact that the time limit on his returnticket expired that day for his dramatic instinct told him that such sordid matters have no place in heroics stephen sat motionless under the tree for an hour deciding on some plan of action he had work at the little house but he did not dare go there lest he should see the face of dead love looking from the windows of the pink bedroom dead love cold sad merciless his cheeks burned as he thought of the marriage license and the gold ring hidden away upstairs in the drawer of his shaving stand what a romantic fool he had been to think he could hasten the glad day by a single moment what a piece of boyish folly it had been and how it shamed him in his own eyes when train time drew near he took his boat and paddled downstream if for the finland lovers reindeer there was but one path in all the world and that the one that led to her so it was for stephens canoe which had it been set free on the river by day or by night might have floated straight to rose he landed at the usual place a bit of sandy shore near the wiley house and walked drearily up the bank through the woods under the shade of the pines the white stars of the hepatica glistened and the pale anemones were coming into bloom partridgeberries glowed red under their glossy leaves and clumps of violets sweetened the air squirrels chattered woodpeckers tapped thrushes sang but stephen was blind and deaf to all the sweet harbingers of spring just then he heard voices realizing with a throb of delight that at any rate rose had not left home to meet claude as he had asked her to do looking through the branches he saw the two standing together mrs brookss horse with the offensive trunk in the back of the wagon being hitched to a tree near by there was nothing in the tableau to stir stephen to fury but he read between the lines and suffered as he read suffered and determined to sacrifice himself if he must so that rose could have what she wanted this miserable apology for a man he had never been the husband for rose she must take her place in a larger community worthy of her beauty and charm claude was talking and gesticulating ardently roses head was bent and the tears were rolling down her cheeks suddenly claude raised his hat and with a passionate gesture of renunciation walked swiftly to the wagon and looking back once drove off with the utmost speed of which the brookss horse was capable rose waving him a farewell with one hand and wiping her eyes with the other x the turquoise ring stephen stood absolutely still in front of the opening in the trees and as rose turned she met him face to face she had never dreamed his eyes could be so stern his mouth so hard and she gave a sob like a child you seem to be in trouble stephen said in a voice so cold she thought it could not be his i am not in trouble exactly rose stammered concealing her discomfiture as well as possible i am a little unhappy because i have made some one else unhappy and now that you know it you will be unhappy too and angry besides i suppose though youve seen everything there was to see there is no occasion for sorrow stephen said i did nt mean to break in on any interview i came over to give you back your freedom if you ever cared enough for me to marry me the time has gone by i am willing to own that i overpersuaded you but i am not the man to take a girl against her inclinations so we will say goodbye and end the thing here and now i can only wish here his smothered rage at fate almost choked himthat when you were selecting another husband you had chosen a whole man rose quivered with the scorn of his tone size is nt everything she blazed not in bodies perhaps but it counts for something in hearts and brains and it is convenient to have a sense of honor thats at least as big as a grain of mustardseed claude merrill is not dishonorable rose exclaimed impetuously or at least he is nt as bad as you think he has never asked me to marry him then he probably was not quite ready to speak or perhaps you were not quite ready to hear retorted stephen bitterly but dont let us have words therell be enough to regret without adding those i have seen ever since new years that you were not really happy or contented only i would nt allow it to myself i kept hoping against hope that i was mistaken there have been times when i would have married you willing or unwilling but i did nt love you so well then and now that theres another man in the case its different and im strong enough to do the right thing follow your heart and be happy in a year or two i shall be glad i had the grit to tell you so goodbye rose rose pale with amazement summoned all her pride and drawing the turquoise engagement ring from her finger handed it silently to stephen hiding her face as he flung it vehemently down the riverbank his dull eyes followed it and half uncomprehendingly saw it settle and glisten in a nest of brown pineneedles then he put out his hand for a last clasp and strode away without a word presently rose heard first the scrape of his boat on the sand then the soft sound of his paddles against the water then nothing but the squirrels and the woodpeckers and the thrushes then not even these nothing but the beating of her own heart she sat down heavily feeling as if she were wide awake for the first time in many weeks how had things come to this pass with her claude merrill had flattered her vanity and given her some moments of restlessness and dissatisfaction with her lot but he had not until today really touched her heart or tempted her even momentarily from her allegiance to stephen his eyes had always looked unspeakable things his voice had seemed to breathe feelings that he had never dared put in words but today he had really stirred her for although he had still been vague it was easy to see that his love for her had passed all bounds of discretion she remembered his impassioned farewells his despair his doubt as to whether he could forget her by plunging into the vortex of business or whether he had better end it all in the river as so many other brokenhearted fellows had done she had been touched by his misery even against her better judgment and she had intended to confess it all to stephen sometime telling him that she should never again accept attentions from a stranger lest a tragedy like this should happen twice in a lifetime she had imagined that stephen would be his largeminded greathearted magnanimous self and beg her to forget this fascinating willothewisp by resting in his deeper serener love she had meant to be contrite and faithful praying nightly that poor claude might live down his present anguish of which she had been the innocent cause instead what had happened she had been put altogether in the wrong stephen had almost cast her off and that too without argument he had given her her liberty before she had asked for it taking it for granted without question that she desired to be rid of him instead of comforting her in her remorse or sympathizing with her for so nobly refusing to shine in claudes larger world of boston stephen had assumed that she was disloyal in every particular and pray how was she to cope with such a disagreeable and complicated situation it would not be long before the gossips rolled under their tongues the delicious morsel of a broken engagement and sooner or later she must brave the displeasure of her grandmother and the little house that was worse than anything her tears flowed faster as she thought of stephens joy in it of his faithful labor of the savings he had invested in it she hated and despised herself when she thought of the house and for the first time in her life she realized the limitations of her nature the poverty of her ideals what should she do she had lost stephen and ruined his life now in order that she need not blight a second career must she contrive to return claudes love to be sure she thought it seemed indecent to marry any other man than stephen when they had built a house together and chosen wallpapers and a kitchen stove and diningroom chairs but was it not the only way to evade the difficulties suppose that stephen in a fit of pique should ask somebody else to share the new cottage as this dreadful possibility came into view roses sobs actually frightened the birds and the squirrels she paced back and forth under the trees wondering how she could have been engaged to a man for eight months and know so little about him as she seemed to know about stephen waterman today who would have believed he could be so autocratic so severe ss so unapproachable who could have foreseen that she rose wiley would ever be given up to another man handed over as coolly as if she had been a bale of cotton she wanted to return claude merrills love because it was the only way out of the tangle but at the moment she almost hated him for making so much trouble for hurting stephen for abasing her in her own eyes and above all for giving her rustic lover the chance of impersonating an injured emperor it did not simplify the situation to have mite shapley come in during the evening and run upstairs uninvited to sit on the foot of her bed and chatter rose had closed her blinds and lay in the dark pleading a headache mite was in high feather she had met claude merrill going to the station that afternoon he was much too early for the train which the station agent reported to be behind time so he had asked her to take a drive she did nt know how it happened for he looked at his watch every now and then but anyway they got to laughing and carrying on and when they came back to the station the train had gone was nt that the greatest joke of the season what did rose suppose they did next rose did nt know and did nt care her head ached too badly well they had driven to wareham and claude had hired a livery team there and had been taken into portland with his trunk and she had brought mrs brookss horse back to edgewood was nt that ridiculous and had nt she cut out rose where she least expected rose was distinctly apathetic and mite shapley departed after a very brief call leaving behind her an entirely new train of thought if claude merrill were so loveblighted that he could only by the greatest selfcontrol keep from flinging himself into the river how could he conceal his sufferings so completely from mite shapley little shallowpated scheming coquette so that pretty merrill feller has gone has he mother inquired old kennebec that night as he took off his wet shoes and warmed his feet at the kitchen oven well it aint a mite too soon i allers distrust that pinkanwhite rosyposy kind of a man one of the most turrible things that ever happened in gardner was brought about by jest sech a feller mothers hed nt hardly ought to name their boy babies claude without they expect em to play the dickens with the girls i don know nothin bout the fust claude there aint none of em in the bible air they but whoever he was i bate ye he hed a deceivin tongue if it hed nt ben for me that claude in gardner would a run away with my brothers fust wife an ill tell ye jest how i contrived to put a spoke in his wheel but mrs wiley being already somewhat familiar with the circumstances had taken her candle and retired to her virtuous couch xi rose sees the world was this the world after all rose asked herself and if so what was amiss with it and where was the charm the bewilderment the intoxication the glamour she had been glad to come to boston for the last two weeks in edgewood had proved intolerable she had always been a favorite heretofore from the days when the boys fought for the privilege of dragging her sled up the hills and filling her tiny mitten with peppermints down to the year when she came home from the wareham female seminary an acknowledged belle and beauty suddenly she had felt her popularity dwindling there was no real change in the demeanor of her acquaintances but there was a certain subtle difference of atmosphere everybody sympathized tacitly with stephen and she did not wonder for there were times when she secretly took his part against herself only a few candid friends had referred to the rupture openly in conversation but these had been blunt in their disapproval it seemed part of her ill fortune that just at this time rufus should be threatened with partial blindness and that stephens heart already sore should be torn with new anxieties she could hardly bear to see the doctors carriage drive by day after day and hear night after night that rufus was unresigned melancholy half mad while stephen as the doctor said was brother mother and father in one as gentle as a woman as firm as gibraltar these foes to her peace of mind all came from within but without was the hourly reproach of her grandmother whose scorching tongue touched every sensitive spot in the girls nature and burned it like fire finally a way of escape opened mrs wealthy brooks who had always been rheumatic grew suddenly worse she had heard of a magnetic physician in boston also of one who used electricity with wonderful effect and she announced her intention of taking both treatments impartially and alternately the neighbors were quite willing that wealthy ann brooks should spend the deceased ezras money in any way she pleased she had earned it goodness knows by living with him for twentyfive years but before the day for her departure arrived her right arm and knee became so much more painful that it was impossible for her to travel alone at this juncture rose was called upon to act as nurse and companion in a friendly way she seized the opportunity hungrily as a way out of her present trouble but knowing what mrs brookss temper was in time of health she could see clearly what it was likely to prove when pain and anguish wrung the brow rose had been in boston now for some weeks and she was sitting in the joy street boardinghouse joy street forsooth it was nearly bedtime and she was looking out upon a huddle of roofs and back yards upon a landscape filled with clotheslines ashbarrels and illfed cats there were no sleek country tabbies with the memory in their eyes of tasted cream nothing but cityborn citybred thin despairing cats of the pavement cats no more forlorn than rose herself she had seen boston for she had accompanied mrs brooks in the horsecars daily to the two different temples of healing where that lady worshiped and offered sacrifices she had also gone with maude arthurlena to claude merrills store to buy a pair of gloves and had overheard miss dix the fashionable lady assistant before mentioned say to miss brackett of the ribbon department that she thought mr merrill must have worn his blinders that time he stayed so long in edgewood this bit of polished irony was unintelligible to rose at first but she mastered it after an hours reflection she was nt looking her best that day she knew the cotton dresses that seemed so pretty at home were common and countrified here and her best black cashmere looked cheap and shapeless beside miss dixs brilliantine miss dixs figure was her strong point and her dressmaker was particularly skillful in the arts of suggestion concealment and revelation beauty has its chosen backgrounds rose in white dimity standing knee deep in her blossoming brier bushes the river running at her feet dark pine trees behind her graceful head sounded depths and touched heights of harmony forever beyond the reach of the modish miss dix but she was out of her element and suffered accordingly rose had gone to walk with claude one evening when she first arrived he had shown her the state house and the park street church and sat with her on one of the benches in the common until nearly ten she knew that mrs brooks had told her nephew of the broken engagement but he made no reference to the matter save to congratulate her that she was rid of a man who was so clumsy so dull and behind the times as stephen waterman saying that he had always marveled she could engage herself to anybody who could insult her by offering her a turquoise ring claude was very interesting that evening rose thought but rather gloomy and unlike his former self he referred to his grave responsibilities to the frail health of maude arthurlena and to the vicissitudes of business he vaguely intimated that his daily life in the store was not so pleasant as it had been formerly that there were those he would speak no more plainly who embarrassed him with undesired attentions those who without the smallest shadow of right vexed him with petty jealousies rose dared not ask questions on so delicate a topic but she remembered in a flash miss dixs heavy eyebrows snapping eyes and high color claude seemed very happy that rose had come to boston though he was surprised knowing what a trial his aunt must be now that she was so helpless it was unfortunate also that rose could not go on excursions without leaving his aunt alone or he should have been glad to offer his escort he pressed her hand when he left her at her door telling her she could never realize what a comfort her friendship was to him could never imagine how thankful he was that she had courageously freed herself from ties that in time would have made her wretched his heart was full he said of feelings he dared not utter but in the near future when certain clouds had rolled by he would unlock its treasures and then but no more tonight he could not trust himself rose felt as if she were assuming one of the characters in a mysterious romance such as unfolded itself only in books or in boston but thrilling as it was it was nevertheless extremely unsatisfactory convinced that claude merrill was passionately in love with her one of her reasons for coming to boston had been to fall more deeply in love with him and thus heal some at least of the wounds she had inflicted it may have been a foolish idea but after three weeks it seemed still worse a useless one for after several interviews she felt herself drifting farther and farther from claude and if he felt any burning ambition to make her his own he certainly concealed it with admirable art given up with the most offensive magnanimity by stephen and not greatly desired by claude that seemed the present status of proud rose wiley of the brier neighborhood it was june she remembered as she leaned out of the open window at least it was june in edgewood and she supposed for convenience sake they called it june in boston not that it mattered much what the poor city prisoners called it how beautiful the river would be at home with the trees along the banks in full leaf how she hungered and thirsted for the river to see it sparkle in the sunlight to watch the moonglade stretching from one bank to the other to hear the soft lap of the water on the shore and the distant murmur of the falls at the bridge and the brier neighborhood would be at its loveliest for the wild roses were in blossom by now and the little house how sweet it must look under the shade of the elms with the saco rippling at the back was poor rufus still lying in a darkened room and was stephen nursing him disappointed stephen dear noble old stephen xii gold and pinchbeck just then mrs brooks groaned in the next room and called rose who went in to minister to her real needs or to condole with her fancied ones whichever course of action appeared to be the more agreeable at the moment mrs brooks desired conversation it seemed or at least she desired an audience for a monologue for she recognized no antiphonal obligations on the part of her listeners the doctors were not doing her a speck of good and she was just squandering money in a miserable boardinghouse when she might be enjoying poor health in her own home and she did nt believe her hens were receiving proper care and she had forgotten to pull down the shades in the spare room and the sun would fade the carpet out all white before she got back and she did nt believe dr smiths magnetism was any more use than a cats foot nor dr robinsons electricity any better than a bumblebees buzz and she had a great mind to go home and try dr lord from bonnie eagle and there was a letter for rose on the bureau which had come before supper but the shiftless lazy worthless landlady had forgotten to send it up till just now the letter was from mite shapley but rose could read only half of it to mrs brooks little beside the news that the waterman barn the finest barn in the whole township had been struck by lightning and burned to the ground stephen was away at the time having taken rufus to portland where an operation on his eyes would shortly be performed at the hospital and one of the neighbors was sleeping at the river farm and taking care of the cattle still the house might not have been saved but for one of alcestis crambrys sudden bursts of common sense which occurred now quite regularly he succeeded not only in getting the horses out of the stalls but gave the alarm so promptly that the whole neighborhood was soon on the scene of action stephen was the only man mite reminded rose who ever had any patience with or took any pains to teach alcestis but he never could have expected to be rewarded in this practical way the barn was only partly insured and when she had met stephen at the station next day and condoled with him on his loss he had said oh well mite a little more or less does nt make much difference just now the rest would nt interest you mrs brooks said rose precipitately preparing to leave the room something about claude i suppose ventured that astute lady i think mite kind of fancied him i dont believe he ever gave her any real encouragement but hed make love to a pump claude merrill would and so would his father before him how my sister abby made out to land him we never knew for they said hed proposed to every woman in the town of bingham not excepting the wooden indian girl in front of the cigarstore and not one of em but our abby ever got a chance to name the day abby was as set as the everlastin hills and if shed made up her mind to have a man he could nt wriggle away from her nohow in the world it beats all how girls do run after these slickhaired sweettongued miss nancy kind o fellers that aint but little good as beaux an worth less than nothing as husbands rose scarcely noticed what mrs brooks said she was too anxious to read the rest of mite shapleys letter in the quiet of her own room stephen looks thin and pale so it ran on but he does not allow anybody to sympathize with him i think you ought to know something that i have nt told before for fear of hurting your feelings but if i were in your place id like to hear everything and then youll know how to act when you come home just after you left stephen ploughed up all the land in front of your new house every inch of it all up and down the road between the fence and the front doorstep and then he planted corn where you were going to have your flowerbeds he has closed all the blinds and hung a to let sign on the large elm at the gate stephen never was spiteful in his life but this looks a little like spite perhaps he only wanted to save his selfrespect and let people know that everything between you was over forever perhaps he thought it would stop talk once and for all but you wont mind you lucky girl staying nearly three months in boston so almira purled on in violet ink with shaded letters how i wish it had come my way though im not good at rubbing rheumatic patients even when they are his aunt is he as devoted as ever and when will it be how do you like the theater mother thinks you wont attend but by what he used to say i am sure church members in boston always go to amusements your loving friend almira shapley ps they say rufuss doctors bills here and the operation and hospital expenses in portland will mount up to five hundred dollars of course stephen will be dreadfully hampered by the toss of his barn and maybe he wants to let your house that was to be because he really needs money in that case the dooryard wont be very attractive to tenants with corn planted right up to the steps and no path left its two feet tall now and by august just when you were intending to move in it will hide the front windows not that youll care with a diamond on your engagement finger the letter was more than flesh and blood could stand and rose flung herself on her bed to think and regret and repent and if possible to sob herself to sleep she knew now that she had never admired and respected stephen so much as at the moment when under the reproach of his eyes she had given him back his ring when she left edgewood and parted with him forever she had really loved him better than when she had promised to marry him claude merrill on his native boston heath did not appear the romantic inspiring figure he had once been in her eyes a week ago she distrusted him tonight she despised him what had happened to rose was the dilation of her vision she saw things under a wider sky and in a clearer light above all her heart was wrung with pity for stephen stephen with no comforting womans hand to help him in his sore trouble stephen bearing his losses alone his burdens and anxieties alone his nursing and daily work alone oh how she felt herself needed needed that was the magic word that unlocked her better nature darkness is the time for making roots and establishing plants whether of the soil or of the soul and all at once rose had become a woman a little one perhaps but a whole woman and a bit of an angel too with healing in her wings when and how had this metamorphosis come about last summer the fragile brierrose had hung over the river and looked at its pretty reflection in the placid surface of the water its few buds and blossoms were so lovely it sighed for nothing more the changes in the plant had been wrought secretly and silently in some mysterious way as common to soul as to plant life the roots had gathered in more nourishment from the earth they had stored up strength and force and all at once there was a marvelous fructifying of the plant hardiness of stalk new shoots everywhere vigorous leafage and a shower of blossoms but everything was awry boston was a failure claude was a weakling and a flirt her turquoise ring was lying on the riverbank stephen did not love her any longer her flowerbeds were ploughed up and planted in corn and the cottage that stephen had built and she had furnished that beloved cottage was to let she was in boston but what did that amount to after all what was the state house to a bleeding heart or the old south church to a pride wounded like hers at last she fell asleep but it was only by stopping her ears to the noises of the city streets and making herself imagine the sound of the river rippling under her bedroom windows at home the backyards of boston faded and in their place came the banks of the saco strewn with pineneedles fragrant with wild flowers then there was the bit of sunny beach where stephen moored his boat she could hear the sound of his paddle boston lovers came acourting in the horsecars but hers had floated downstream to her just at dusk in a birchbark canoe or sometimes in the moonlight on a couple of logs rafted together but it was all over now and she could see only stephens stern face as he flung the despised turquoise ring down the riverbank xiii a country chevalier it was early in august when mrs wealthy brooks announced her speedy return from boston to edgewood its jest as well rose is comin back said mr wiley to his wife i never favored her goin to boston where that rosyposy claude feller is when he was down here he was kep kind o tied up in a boxstall but there hes caperin loose round the pastur i should think rose would be ashamed to come back after the way shes carried on remarked mrs wiley but if she needed punishment i guess shes got it bein compnykeeper to wealthy ann brooks bein a church member in good an reglar standin i spose wealthy annll go to heaven but i can only say that it would be a sight pleasanter place for a good many if she did nt rose has ben foolish an flirty an wrongheaded allowed her grandfather but it wont do no good to treat her like a hardened criminile sames you did afore she went away she aint hardly got her wisdom teeth cut in love affairs she aint broke the laws of the state o maine nor any o the ten commandments she aint disgraced the family an theres a chance for her to reform seein as how she aint twenty year old yet i was turrible wild an hotheaded myself afore you ketched me an tamed me down you aint so tame now as i wish you was mrs wiley replied testily if you could smoke a clay pipe t would calm your nerves mother an help you to git some philosophy inter you you need a little philosophy turrible bad i need patience considable more was mrs wileys withering retort thats the way with folks said old kennebec reflectively as he went on peacefully puffing if you try to indoose em to take an intrest in a brannew virtue they wont look at it but they ll run down a side street an buy half a yard more o some turrible old shopworn trait o character that theyve kep in stock all their lives an that everybodys sick to death of there was a man in gardner but alas the experiences of the gardiner man though told in the same delightful fashion that had won mrs wileys heart many years before now fell upon the empty air in these years of old kennebecs anecdotage his pipe was his best listener and his truest confidant mr wileys constant intercessions with his wife made roses homecoming somewhat easier and the sight of her own room and belongings soothed her troubled spirit but the days went on and nothing happened to change the situation she had lost a lover that was all and there were plenty more to choose from or there always had been but the only one she wanted was the one who made no sign she used to think that she could twist stephen around her little finger that she had only to beckon to him and he would follow her to the ends of the earth now fear had entered her heart she no longer felt sure because she no longer felt worthy of him and feeling both uncertainty and unworthiness her lips were sealed and she was rendered incapable of making any bid for forgiveness so the little world of pleasant river went on to all outward seeming as it had ever gone on one side of the stream a girls heart was longing and pining and sickening with hope deferred and growing too with such astonishing rapidity that the very angels marveled and on the other a mans whole vision of life and duty was widening and deepening under the fructifying influence of his sorrow the corn waved high and green in front of the vacant riverside cottage but stephen sent no word or message to rose he had seen her once but only from a distance she seemed paler and thinner he thought the result probably of her metropolitan gayeties he heard no rumor of any engagement and he wondered if it were possible that her love for claude merrill had not after all been returned in kind this seemed a wild impossibility his mind refused to entertain the supposition that any man on earth could resist falling in love with rose or having fallen in that he could ever contrive to climb out so he worked on at his farm harder than ever and grew soberer and more careworn daily rufus had never seemed so near and dear to him as in these weeks when he had lived under the shadow of threatened blindness the burning of the barn and the strain upon their slender property brought the brothers together shoulder to shoulder if you lose your girl steve said the boy and i lose my eyesight and we both lose the barn why itll be us two against the world for a spell the to let sign on the little house was an arrant piece of hypocrisy nothing but the direst extremity could have caused him to allow an alien step on that sacred threshold the ploughing up of the flowerbeds and planting of the corn had served a double purpose it showed the too curious public the finality of his break with rose and her absolute freedom it also prevented them from suspecting that he still entered the place his visits were not many but he could not bear to let the dust settle on the furniture that he and rose had chosen together and whenever he locked the door and went back to the river farm he thought of a verse in the bible therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken it was now friday of the last week in august the river was full of logs thousands upon thousands of them covering the surface of the water from the bridge almost up to the brier neighborhood the edgewood drive was late owing to a long drought and low water but it was to begin on the following monday and lije dennett and his under boss were looking over the situation and planning the campaign as they leaned over the bridgerail they saw mr wiley driving clown the river road when he caught sight of them he hitched the old white horse at the corner and walked toward them filling his pipe the while in his usual leisurely manner were not busy this forenoon said lije dennett spose we stand right here and let old kennebec have his say out for once weve never heard the end of one of his stories an hes ben talkin for twenty years all right rejoined his companion with a broad grin at the idea im willin if you are but whos goin to tell our famlies the reason weve deserted em i bate yer we shant budge till the crack o doom the road commissionerll come along once a year and mend the bridge under our feet but old kennebecll talk straight on till the day o jedgment mr wiley had one of the most enjoyable mornings of his life and felt that after half a century of neglect his powers were at last appreciated by his fellow citizens he proposed numerous strategic movements to be made upon the logs whereby they would move more swiftly than usual he described several successful drives on the kennebec when the logs had melted down the river almost by magic owing to his generalship and he paid a tribute in passing to the docility of the boss who on that occasion had never moved a single log without asking his advice from this topic he proceeded genially to narrate the lifehistories of the boss the under boss and several indians belonging to the crew histories in which he himself played a gallant and conspicuous part the conversation then drifted naturally to the exploits of riverdrivers in general and mr wiley narrated the sorts of feats in logriding pickpolethrowing and the shooting of rapids that he had done in his youth these stories were such as had seldom been heard by the ear of man and as they passed into circulation instantaneously we are probably enjoying some of them to this day they were still being told when a crambry child appeared on the bridge bearing a note for the old man upon reading it he moved off rapidly in the direction of the store ejaculating bless my soul i clean forgot that saleratus and mothers settin at the kitchen table with the bowl in her lap waitin for it got so intrested in your listnin i never thought o the time the connubial discussion that followed this breach of discipline began on the arrival of the saleratus and lasted through supper and rose went to bed almost immediately afterward for very dullness and apathy her life stretched out before her in the most aimless and monotonous fashion she saw nothing but heartache in the future and that she richly deserved it made it none the easier to bear feeling feverish and sleepless she slipped on her gray shaker cloak and stole quietly downstairs for a breath of air her grandfather and grandmother were talking on the piazza and good humor seemed to have been restored i was over to the tavern tonight she heard him say as she sat down at a little distance i was over to the tavern tonight an a feller from gorham got to talkin an braggin bout what a stock o goods they kep in the store over there an says i i bate ye dollars to doughnuts that there haint a darn thing ye can ask for at bill pikes store at pleasant river that he cant go down cellar or up attic or out in the barn chamber an git for ye well sir he took me up an i borrered the money of joe dennett who held the stakes an we went right over to bill pikes with all the boys follerin on behind an the gorham man never let on what he was going to ask for till the hull crowd of us got inside the store then says he as plite as a basket o chips mr pike id like to buy a pulpit if you can oblige me with one bill scratched his head an i held my breath then says he pears to me id ought to hev a pulpit or two if i can jest remember where i keep em i dont never callate to be out o pulpits but im so plagued for room i cant keep em in here with the grocries jim thats his new store boy you jest take a lantern an run out in the far corner o the shed at the end o the hickory woodpile an see how many pulpits weve got in stock well jim run out an when he come back he says weve got two mr pike shall i bring one of em in at that the boys all bust out laughin an hollerin an tauntin the gorham man an he paid up with a good will i tell ye i dont approve of bettin said mrs wiley grimly but ill try to sanctify the money by usin it for a new washboiler the fact is explained old kennebec somewhat confused that the boys made me spend every cent of it then an there rose heard her grandmothers caustic reply and then paid no further attention until her keen ear caught the sound of stephens name it was a part of her unhappiness that since her broken engagement no one would ever allude to him and she longed to hear him mentioned so that perchance she could get some inkling of his movements i met stephen tonight for the first time in a week said mr wiley he kind o keeps out o my way lately hes goin to drive his span into portland tomorrow mornin and bring rufus home from the hospital sunday afternoon the doctors think theyve made a success of their job but rufus has got to be bandaged up a spell longer stephen is goin to join the drive monday mornin at the bridge here so ill get the latest news o the boy land ill be turrible glad if he gets out with his eyesight if its only for steves sake hes a turrible good fellow steve is he said something tonight that made me set more store by him than ever i told you i hed nt heard an unkind word agin rose sence she come home from boston an no more i hev till this evenin there was two or three fellers talkin in the postoffice an they did nt suspicion i was settin on the steps outside the screen door that jim jenkins that rose so everlastinly snubbed at the tavern dance spoke up an says he this time last year rose wiley could a hed the choice of any man on the river an now i bet ye she cant get nary one steve was there jest goin out the door with some bags o coffee an sugar under his arm i guess youre mistaken about that he says speakin up jest like lightnin so long as stephen watermans alive rose wiley can have him for one and that everybodys welcome to know he spoke right out loud an plain jest as if he was readin the declaration of independence i expected the boys would everlastinly poke fun at him but they never said a word i guess his eyes flashed for he come out the screen door slammin it after him and stalked by me as if he was too worked up to notice anything or anybody i did nt foller him for his long legs git over the ground too fast for me but thinks i mebbe ill hev some use for my lemonadeset after all i hope to the land you will responded mrs wiley for im about sick o movin it round when i sweep under my bed and i shall be glad if rose an stephen do make it up for wealthy ann brookss gossip is too much for a christian woman to stand xiv housebreaking where was the pale rose the faded rose that crept noiselessly down from her room wanting neither to speak nor to be spoken to nobody ever knew she vanished forever and in her place a thing of sparkles and dimples flashed up the stairway and closed the door softly there was a streak of moonshine lying across the bare floor and a merry ghost with dressinggown held prettily away from bare feet danced a gay fandango among the yellow moonbeams there were breathless flights to the open window and kisses thrown in the direction of the river farm there were impressive declamations at the lookingglass where a radiant creature pointed to her reflection and whispered worthless little pig he loves you after all then when quiet joy had taken the place of mad delight there was a swoop down upon the floor an impetuous hiding of brimming eyes in the white counterpane and a dozen impassioned promises to herself and to something higher than herself to be a better girl the mood lasted and deepened and still rose did not move her heart was on its knees before stephens faithful love his chivalry his strength her troubled spirit like a frail boat tossed about in the rapids seemed entering a quiet harbor where there were protecting shores and a still still evening star her sails were all torn and drooping but the harbor was in sight and the poor little weatherbeaten craft could rest in peace a period of grave reflection now ensued under the bedclothes where one could think better suddenly an inspiration seized her an inspiration so original so delicious and above all so humble and praiseworthy that it brought her head from her pillow and she sat bolt upright clapping her hands like a child the very thing she whispered to herself gleefully it will take courage but im sure of my ground after what he said before them all and ill do it grandma in biddeford buying church carpets stephen in portland was ever such a chance the same glowing rose came downstairs two steps at a time next morning bade her grandmother goodbye with suspicious pleasure and sent her grandfather away on an errand which with attendant conversation would consume half the day then bundles after bundles and baskets after baskets were packed into the wagon behind the seat beneath the seat and finally under the laprobe she gave a dramatic flourish to the whip drove across the bridge went through pleasant river village and up the leafy road to the little house stared the to let sign scornfully in the eye alighted and ran like a deer through the aisles of waving corn past the kitchen windows to the back door if he has kept the big key in the old place under the stone where we both used to find it then he has nt forgotten me or anything thought rose the key was there and rose lifted it with a sob of gratitude it was but five minutes work to carry all the bundles from the wagon to the back steps and another five to lead old tom across the road into the woods and tie him to a tree quite out of the sight of any passerby when after running back she turned the key in the lock her heart gave a leap almost of terror and she started at the sound of her own footfall through the open door the sunlight streamed into the dark room she flew to tables and chairs and gave a rapid sweep of the hand over their surfaces he has been dusting here and within a few days too she thought triumphantly the kitchen was perfection as she always knew it would be with one door opening to the shaded road and the other looking on the river windows too framing the appleorchard and the elms she had chosen the furniture but how differently it looked now that it was actually in place the tiny shed had piles of split wood with great boxes of kindlings and shavings all in readiness for the bride who would do her own cooking who but stephen would have made the very wood ready for a womans homecoming and why had he done so much in may when they were not to be married until august then the door of the bedroom was stealthily opened and here rose sat down and cried for joy and shame and hope and fear the very flowered paper she had refused as too expensive how lovely it looked with the white chamber set she brought in her simple wedding outfit of blankets bedlinen and counterpanes and folded them softly in the closet and then for the rest of the morning she went from room to room doing all that could remain undiscovered even to laying a fire in the new kitchen stove this was the plan stephen must pass the house on his way from the river farm to the bridge where he was to join the riverdrivers on monday morning she would be out of bed by the earliest peep of dawn put on stephens favorite pink calico leave a note for her grandmother run like a hare down her side of the river and up stephens steal into the house open blinds and windows light the fire and set the kettle boiling then with a sharp knife she would cut down two rows of corn and thus make a green pathway from the front kitchen steps to the road next the false and insulting to let sign would be forcibly tweaked from the tree and thrown into the grass she would then lay the table in the kitchen and make ready the nicest breakfast that two people ever sat down to and oh would two people sit down to it or would one go off in a rage and the other die of grief and disappointment then having done all she would wait and palpitate and palpitate and wait until stephen came surely no propertyowner in the universe could drive along a road observe his corn leveled to the earth his sign removed his house open and smoke issuing from his chimney without going in to surprise the rogue and villain who could be guilty of such vandalism and when he came in oh she had all day sunday in which to forecast with mingled dread and gladness and suspense that allimportant alldecisive first moment all day sunday to frame and unframe penitent speeches all day sunday would it ever be monday if so what would tuesday bring would the sun rise happy on mrs stephen waterman of pleasant river or miserable miss rose wiley of the brier neighborhood xv the dream room long ago when stephen was a boy of fourteen or fifteen he had gone with his father to a distant town to spend the night after an early breakfast next morning his father had driven off for a business interview and left the boy to walk about during his absence he wandered aimlessly along a quiet side street and threw himself down on the grass outside a pretty garden to amuse himself as best he could after a few minutes he heard voices and turning peeped through the bars of the gate in idle boyish curiosity it was a small brown house the kitchen door was open and a table spread with a white cloth was set in the middle of the room there was a cradle in a far corner and a man was seated at the table as though he might be waiting for his breakfast there is a kind of sentiment about the kitchen in new england a kind of sentiment not provoked by other rooms here the farmer drops in to spend a few minutes when he comes back from the barn or field on an errand here in the great clean sweet comfortable place the busy housewife lives sometimes rocking the cradle sometimes opening and shutting the oven door sometimes stirring the pot darning stockings paring vegetables or mixing goodies in a yellow bowl the children sit on the steps stringing beans shelling peas or hulling berries the cat sleeps on the floor near the woodbox and the visitor feels exiled if he stays in sittingroom or parlor for here where the mother is always busy is the heart of the farmhouse there was an open back door to this kitchen a door framed in morningglories and the woman or was she only girl standing at the stove was pretty oh so pretty in stephens eyes his boyish heart went out to her on the instant she poured a cup of coffee and walked with it to the table then an unexpected interesting thing happened something the boy ought not to have seen and never forgot the man putting out his hand to take the cup looked up at the pretty woman with a smile and she stooped and kissed him stephen was fifteen as he looked on the instant he became a man with a mans hopes desires ambitions he looked eagerly hungrily and the scene burned itself on the sensitive plate of his young heart so that as he grew older he could take the picture out in the dark from time to time and look at it again when he first met rose he did not know precisely what she was to mean to him but before long when he closed his eyes and the old familiar picture swam into his field of vision behold by some spiritual chemistry the pretty womans face had given place to that of rose all such teasing visions had been sternly banished during this sorrowful summer and it was a thoughtful sober stephen who drove along the road on this mellow august morning the dust was deep the goldenrod waved its imperial plumes making the humble waysides gorgeous the river chattered and sparkled till it met the logs at the brier neighborhood and then lapsing into silence flowed steadily under them till it found a vent for its spirits in the dashing and splashing of the falls haying was over logging was to begin that day then harvesting then woodcutting then eternal successions of ploughing sowing reaping haying logging harvesting and so on to the endless end of his days here and there a red or a yellow branch painted only yesterday caught his eye and made him shiver he was not ready for winter his heart still craved the summer it had missed hello what was that cornstalks prone on the earth sign torn down and lying flat in the grass blinds open fire in the chimney he leaped from the wagon and flinging the reins to alcestis crambry said stay right here out of sight and dont you move till i call you and striding up the green pathway he flung open the kitchen door a forest of corn waving in the doorway at the back morningglories clambering round and round the windowframes the table with shining white cloth the kettle humming and steaming something bubbling in a pan on the stove the fire throwing out sweet little gleams of welcome through the open damper all this was taken in with one incredulous rapturous twinkle of an eye but something else too rose of all roses rose of the river rose of the world standing behind a chair with her hand pressed against her heart her lips parted her breath coming and going she was glowing like a jewel glowing with the extraordinary brilliancy that emotion gives to some women she used to be happy in a gay sparkling way like the shallow part of the stream as it chatters over white pebbles and bright sands now it was a broad steady full happiness like the deeps of the river under the sun dont speak stephen till you hear what i have to say it takes a good deal of courage for a girl to do as i am doing but i want to show how sorry i am and its the only way she was trembling and the words came faster and faster ive been very wrong and foolish and made you very unhappy but i have nt done what you would have hated most i have nt been engaged to claude merrill he has nt so much as asked me i am here to beg you to forgive me to eat breakfast with me to drive me to the ministers and marry me quickly quickly before anything happens to prevent us and then to bring me home here to live all the days of my life oh stephen dear honestly honestly you have nt lost anything in all this long miserable summer ive suffered too and im better worth loving than i was will you take me back rose had a tremendous power of provoking and holding love and stephen of loving his was too generous a nature for revilings and complaints and reproaches the shores of his heart were strewn with the wreckage of the troubled summer but if the tide of love is high enough it washes such things out of remembrance he just opened his arms and took rose to his heart faults and all with joy and gratitude and she was as happy as a child who has escaped the scolding it richly deserves and who determines for very thankfulness sake never to be naughty again you dont know what youve done for me stephen she whispered with her face hidden on his shoulder i was just a common little prickly rosebush when you came along like a good gardener and grafted in something better the something better was your love stephen dear and its made everything different the silly rose you were engaged to long ago has disappeared somewhere i hope you wont be able to find her under the new leaves she was all i wanted said stephen you thought she was the girl answered because you did nt see the prickles but youd have felt them some time the old rose was a selfish thing not good enough for you the new rose is going to be your wife and rufuss sister and your mothers daughter all in one then such a breakfast was spread as stephen in his sorry years of bachelor existence had forgotten could exist but before he broke his fast he ran out to the wagon and served the astonished alcestis with his wedding refreshments then and there bidding him drive back to the river farm and bring him a package that lay in the drawer of his shavingstand a package placed there when hot youth and love and longing had inspired him to hurry on the marriage day theres an envelope alcestis he cried a long envelope way way back in the corner and a small box on top of it bring them both and my wallet too and if you find them all and get them to me safely you shall be bridesmaid and groomsman and best man and usher and maid of honor at a wedding in less than an hour off with you drive straight and use the whip on dolly when he reentered the kitchen flushed with joy and excitement rose put the various good things on the table and he almost tremblingly took his seat fearing that contact with the solid wood might wake him from this entrancing vision id like to put you in your chair like a queen and wait on you he said with a soft boyish stammer but i am too dazed with happiness to be of any use its my turn to wait upon you and i oh how i love to have you dazed rose answered ill be at the table presently myself but we have been housekeeping only three minutes and we have nothing but the tin coffeepot this morning so ill pour the coffee from the stove she filled a cup with housewifely care and brought it to stephens side as she set it down and was turning she caught his look a look so full of longing that no loving woman however busy could have resisted it then she stooped and kissed him fondly fervently stephen put his arm about her and drawing her down to his knee rested his head against her soft shoulder with a sigh of comfort like that of a tired child he had waited for it ten years and at last the dream room had come true the old peabody pew a christmas romance of a country church dedication to a certain handful of dear new england women of names unknown to the world dwelling in a certain quiet village alike unknown we have worked together to make our little corner of the great universe a pleasanter place in which to live and so we know not only one anothers names but something of one anothers joys and sorrows cares and burdens economies hopes and anxieties we all remember the dusty uphill road that leads to the green church common we remember the white spire pointing upward against a background of blue sky and feathery elms we remember the sound of the bell that falls on the sabbath morning stillness calling us across the daisysprinkled meadows of june the golden hayfields of july or the dazzling whiteness and deep snowdrifts of december days the little cabinetorgan that plays the doxology the hymnbooks from which we sing praise god from whom all blessings flow the sweet freshness of the old meetinghouse within and without how we have toiled to secure and preserve these humble mercies for ourselves and our children there really is a dorcas society as you and i well know and one not unlike that in these pages and you and i have lived through many discouraging laughable and beautiful experiences while we emulated the bible dorcas that woman full of good works and alms deeds there never was a peabody pew in the tory hill meetinghouse and nancys love story and justins never happened within its centuryold walls but i have imagined only one of the many romances that have had their birth under the shadow of that steeple did we but realize it as you have sat there on openwindowed sundays looking across purple cloverfields to blue distant mountains watching the palmleaf fans swaying to and fro in the warm stillness before sermon time did not the place seem full of memories for has not the life of two villages ebbed and flowed beneath that ancient roof you heard the hum of droning bees and followed the airy wings of butterflies fluttering over the gravestones in the old churchyard and underneath almost every mossgrown tablet some humble romance lies buried aud all but forgotten if it had not been for you i should never have written this story so i give it back to you tied with a sprig from ophelias nosegay a sprig of rosemary thats for remembrance k d w august the old peabody pew edgewood like all the other villages along the banks of the saco is full of sunny slopes and leafy hollows there are little rounded greenclad hillocks that might like their scriptural sisters skip with joy and there are grand rocky hills tufted with gaunt pine trees these leading the eye to the splendid heights of a neighbor state where snowcrowned peaks tower in the blue distance sweeping the horizon in a long line of majesty tory hill holds its own among the others for peaceful beauty and fair prospect and on its broad level summit sits the whitepainted orthodox meetinghouse this faces a grassy common where six roads meet as if the early settlers had determined that no one should lack salvation because of a difficulty in reaching its visible source the old church has had a dignified and fruitful past dating from that day in when young paul coffin received his call to preach at a stipend of fifty pounds sterling a year answering that never having heard of any uneasiness among the people about his doctrine or manner of life he declared himself pleased to settle as soon as might be judged convenient but that was a hundred and fifty years ago and much has happened since those simple strenuous old days the chastening hand of time has been laid somewhat heavily on the town as well as on the church some of her sons have marched to the wars and died on the field of honor some seeking better fortunes have gone westward others wearying of village life the rocky soil and rigors of farmwork have become entangled in the noise and competition the rush and strife of cities when the sexton rings the bell nowadays on a sunday morning it seems to have lost some of its oldtime militant strength something of its hope and courage but it still rings and although the davids and solomons the matthews marks and pauls of former congregations have left few descendants to perpetuate their labors it will go on ringing as long as there is a tabitha a dorcas a lois or a eunice left in the community this sentiment had been maintained for a quarter of a century but it was now especially strong as the old tory hill meetinghouse had been undergoing for several years more or less extensive repairs in point of fact the still stronger word improvements might be used with impunity though whenever the dorcas society being female and therefore possessed of notions regarding comfort and beauty suggested any serious changes the finance committees which were inevitably male in their composition generally disapproved of inaking any impious alterations in a tabernacle chapel temple or any other building used for purposes of worship the majority in these august bodies asserted that their ancestors had prayed and sung there for a century and a quarter and what was good enough for their ancestors was entirely suitable for them besides the community was becoming less and less prosperous and churchgoing was growing more and more lamentably uncommon so that even from a business standpoint any sums expended upon decoration by a poor and struggling parish would be worse than wasted in the particular year under discussion in this story the valiant and progressive mrs jeremiah burbank was the president of the dorcas society and she remarked privately and publicly that if her ancestors liked a smoky church they had a perfect right to the enjoyment of it but that she did nt intend to sit through meeting on winter sundays with her white ostrich feather turning gray and her eyes smarting and watering for the rest of her natural life whereupon this being in a business session she then and there proposed to her already hypnotized constituents ways of earning enough money to build a new chimney on the other side of the church an awestricken community witnessed this beneficent act of vandalism and finding that no thunderbolts of retribution descended from the skies greatly relished the change if one or two aged persons complained that they could not sleep as sweetly during sermontime in the now clear atmosphere of the church and that the parsons eye was keener than before why that was a mere detail and could not be avoided what was the loss of a little sleep compared with the discoloration of mrs jere burbanks white ostrich feather and the smarting of mrs jere burbanks eyes a new furnace followed the new chimney in due course and as a sense of comfort grew there was opportunity to notice the lack of beauty twice in sixty years had some welltodo summer parishioner painted the interior of the church at his own expense but although the roof had been many times reshingled it had always persisted in leaking so that the ceiling and walls were disfigured by unsightly spots and stains and streaks the question of shingling was tacitly felt to be outside the feminine domain but as there were five women to one man in the church membership the feminine domain was frequently obliged to extend its limits into the hitherto unknown matters of tarring and waterproofing were discussed in and out of season and the very schoolchildren imbibed knowledge concerning lapping overlapping and crosslapping and first and second quality of cedar shingles miss lobelia brewster who had a rooted distrust of anything done by mere man created strife by remarking that she could have stopped the leak in the belfry tower with her red flannel petticoat better than the milltown man with his newfangled rubber sheeting and that the last shingling could have been more thoroughly done by a female infant babe whereupon the person criticized retorted that he wished miss lobelia brewster had a few infant babes to put on the job hed like to see em try meantime several male members of the congregation who at one time or another had sat on the roof during the hottest of the dogdays to see that shingling operations were conscientiously and skillfully performed were very pessimistic as to any satisfactory result ever being achieved the angle of the roof what they call the pitch they say that thats always been wrong announced the secretary of the dorcas in a business session is it that kind of pitch that the bible says you cant touch without being defiled if not i vote that we unshingle the roof and alter the pitch this proposal came from a sister named maria sharp who had valiantly offered the year before to move the smoky chimney with her own hands if the menfolks would nt but though the incendiary suggestion of altering the pitch was received with applause at the moment subsequent study of the situation proved that such a proceeding was entirely beyond the modest means of the society then there arose an ingenious and militant carpenter in a neighboring village who asserted that he would shingle the meetinghouse roof for such and such a sum and agree to drink every drop of water that would leak in afterward this was felt by all parties to be a promise attended by extraordinary risks but it was accepted nevertheless miss lobelia brewster remarking that the rash carpenter being already married could not marry a dorcas anyway and even if he died he was not a resident of edgewood and therefore could be more easily spared and that it would be rather exciting just for a change to see a man drink himself to death with rainwater the expected tragedy never occurred however and the inspired shingler fulfilled his promise to the letter so that before many months the dorcas society proceeded with incredible exertion to earn more money and the interior of the church was neatly painted and made as fresh as a rose with no smoke no rain no snow nor melting ice to defile it the good old landmark that had been pointing its finger heavenward for over a century would now be clean and fragrant for years to come and the weary sisters leaned back in their respective rockingchairs and drew deep breaths of satisfaction these breaths continued to be drawn throughout an unusually arduous haying season until in fact a visitor from a neighboring city was heard to remark that the tory hill meetinghouse would be one of the best preserved and pleasantest churches in the whole state of maine if only it were suitably carpeted this thought had secretly occurred to many a dorcas in her hours of piemaking preserving or cradlerocking but had been promptly extinguished as flagrantly extravagant and altogether impossible now that it had been openly mentioned the contagion of the idea spread and in a month every sort of honest machinery for the increase of funds had been set in motion harvest suppers pie sociables old folks concerts apron sales and as a last resort a subscription paper for the church floor measured hundreds of square yards and the carpet committee announced that a good ingrain could not be purchased even with the church discount for less than ninetyseven cents a yard the dorcases took out their pencils and when they multiplied the surface of the floor by the price of the carpet per yard each dorcas attaining a result entirely different from all the others there was a shriek of dismay especially from the secretary who had included in her mathematical operation certain figures in her possession representing the cubical contents of the church and the offending pitch of the roof thereby obtaining a product that would have dismayed a croesus time sped and efforts increased but the dorcases were at length obliged to clip the wings of their desire and content themselves with carpeting the pulpit and pulpit steps the choir and the two aisles leaving the floor in the pews until some future year how the women cut and contrived and matched that hardlybought red ingrain carpet in the short december afternoons that ensued after its purchase so that having failed to be ready for thanksgiving it could be finished for the christmas festivities they were sewing in the church and as the last stitches were being taken maria sharp suddenly ejaculated in her impulsive fashion would nt it have been just perfect if we could have had the pews repainted before we laid the new carpet it would indeed the president answered but it will take us all winter to pay for the present improvements without any thought of fresh paint if only we had a few more menfolks to help along or else none at all was lobelia brewsters suggestion its havin so few that keeps us all stirred up if there want any anywheres wed have women deacons and carpenters and painters and get along first rate for somehow the supply o women always holds out same as it does with caterpillars an flies an grasshoppers everybody laughed although maria sharp asserted that she for one was not willing to be called a caterpillar simply because there were too many women in the universe i never noticed before how shabby and scarred and dirty the pews are said the ministers wife as she looked at them reflectively ive been thinking all the afternoon of the story about the poor old woman and the lily and nancy wentworths clear voice broke into the discussion do you remember some one gave her a stalk of easter lilies and she set them in a glass pitcher on the kitchen table after looking at them for a few minutes she got up from her chair and washed the pitcher until the glass shone sitting down again she glanced at the little window it would never do she had forgotten how dusty and blurred it was and she took her cloth and burnished the panes then she scoured the table then the floor then blackened the stove before she sat down to her knitting and of course the lily had done it all just by showing in its whiteness how grimy everything else was the ministers wife who had been in edgewood only a few months looked admiringly at nancys bright face wondering that fiveandthirty years of life including ten of schoolteaching had done so little to mar its serenity the lily story is as true as the gospel she exclaimed and i can see how one thing has led you to another in making the church comfortable but my husband says that two coats of paint on the pews would cost a considerable sum how about cleaning them i dont believe theyve had a good hard washing since the flood the suggestion came from deacon millers wife to the president they cant even be scrubbed for less than fifteen or twenty dollars for i thought of that and asked mrs simpson yesterday and she said twenty cents a pew was the cheapest she could do it for weve done everything else said nancy wentworth with a twitch of her thread why dont we scrub the pews theres nothing in the orthodox creed to forbid is there speakin o creeds and here old mrs sargent paused in her work elder ransom from acreville stopped with us last night an he tells me they recite the euthanasian creed every few sundays in the episcopal church i did nt want him to know how ignorant i was but i looked up the word in the dictionary it means easy death and i cant see any sense in that though its a terrible long creed the elder says an if its any longer n ourn i should think anybody might easy die learnin it i think the word is athanasian ventured the ministers wife elder ransoms always plumb full o doctrine asserted miss brewster pursuing the subject for my part im glad he preferred acreville to our place he was so busy bein a minister he never got round to bein a human creeter when he used to come to sociables and picnics always lookin kind o like the potato blight i used to think how complete hed be if he had a foldin pulpit under his coattails they make foldin beds nowadays an i spose they could make foldin pulpits if there was a call land sakes i hope there wont be exclaimed mrs sargent an the elder never said much of anything either though he was always preachin now your husband mis baxter always has plenty to say after you think hes all through theres water in his well when the others is all dry but how about the pews interrupted mrs burbank i think nancys idea is splendid and i want to see it carried out we might make it a picnic bring our luncheons and work all together let every woman in the congregation come and scrub her own pew some are too old others live at too great a distance and the ministers wife sighed a little indeed most of those who once owned the pews or sat in them seem to be dead or gone away to live in busier places ive no patience with em gallivantin over the earth and here lobelia rose and shook the carpet threads from her lap i should nt want to live in a livelier place than edgewood seems though we wash and hang out mondays iron tuesdays cook wednesdays clean house and mend thursdays and fridays bake saturdays and go to meetin sundays i dont hardly see how they can do any moren that in chicago never mind if we have lost members said the indomitable mrs burbank the members we still have left must work all the harder well each clean our own pew then take a few of our neighbors and then hire mrs simpson to do the wainscoting and floor can we scrub friday and lay the carpet saturday my husband and deacon miller can help us at the end of the week all in favor manifest it by the usual sign contraryminded it is a vote there never were any contraryminded when mrs jere burbank was in the chair public sentiment in edgewood was swayed by the dorcas society but mrs burbank swayed the dorcases themselves as the wind sways the wheat ii the old meetinghouse wore an animated aspect when the eventful friday came a cold brilliant sparkling december day with good sleighing and with energy in every breath that swept over the dazzling snowfields the sexton had built a fire in the furnace on the way to his morning work a fire so economically contrived that it would last exactly the four or five necessary hours and not a second more at eleven oclock all the pillars of the society had assembled having finished their own household work and laid out on their respective kitchen tables comfortable luncheons for the men of the family if they were fortunate enough to number any among their luxuries water was heated upon oilstoves set about here and there and there was a brave array of scrubbingbrushes cloths soap and even sand and soda for it had been decided and manifestedbytheusualsignandnocontrarymindedanditwasavote that the dirt was to come off whether the paint came with it or not each of the fifteen women present selected a block of seats preferably one in which her own was situated and all fell busily to work there is nobody here to clean the rightwing pews said nancy wentworth so i will take those for my share youre not making a very wise choice nancy and the ministers wife smiled as she spoke the infant class of the sundayschool sits there you know and i expect the paint has had extra wear and tear families dont seem to occupy those pews regularly nowadays i can remember when every seat in the whole church was filled wings an all mused mrs sargent wringing out her washcloth in a reminiscent mood the one in front o you nancy was always called the deef pew in the old times and all the folks that was hard o hearin used to congregate there the next pew has nt been occupied since i came here said the ministers wife no answered mrs sargent glad of any opportunity to retail neighborhood news squire beans folks have moved to portland to be with the married daughter somebody has to stay with her and her husband wont the squire aint a strong man and hes most too old to go to meetin now the youngest son just died in new york so i hear what ailed him inquired maria sharp i guess he was completely wore out takin care of his health returned mrs sargent he had a splendid constitution from a boy but he was always afraid it would nt last him the seat back o squire beans is the old peabody pew aint that the peabody pew youre scrubbin nancy i believe so nancy answered never pausing in her labors its so long since anybody sat there its hard to remember it is the peabodys i know it because the aisle runs right up facin it i can see old deacon peabody settin in this end same as if t was yesterday he had died before jere and i came back here to live said mrs burbank the first i remember justin peabody sat in the end seat the sister that died next and in the corner against the wall mrs peabody with a crape shawl and a palmleaf fan they were a handsome family you used to sit with them sometimes nancy esther was great friends with you yes she was nancy replied lifting the tattered cushion from its place and brushing it and i with her what is the use of scrubbing and carpeting when there are only twenty pewcushions and six hassocks in the whole church and most of them ragged how can i ever mend this i should nt trouble myself to darn other peoples cushions this unchristian sentiment came in mrs millers ringing tones from the rear of the church i dont know why argued maria sharp im going to mend my aunt achsas cushion and we havent spoken for years but hers is the next pew to mine and im going to have my part of the church look decent even if she is too stingy to do her share besides there are nt any peabodys left to do their own darning and nancy was friends with esther yes its nothing more than right nancy replied with a note of relief in her voice considering esther though he dont belong to the scrubbin sex there is one peabody alive as you know if you stop to think maria for justins alive and livin out west somewheres at least hes as much alive as ever he was he was as good as dead when he was twentyone but his mother was always too softhearted to bury him there was considerable laughter over this sally of the outspoken mrs sargent whose keen wit was the delight of the neighborhood i know hes alive and doing business in detroit for i got his address a week or ten days ago and wrote asking him if hed like to give a couple of dollars toward repairing the old church everybody looked at mrs burbank with interest has nt he answered asked maria sharp nancy wentworth held her breath turned her face to the wall and silently wiped the paint of the wainscoting the blood that had rushed into her cheeks at mrs sargents jeering reference to justin peabody still lingered there for any one who ran to read but fortunately nobody ran they were too busy scrubbing not yet folks dont hurry about answering when you ask them for a contribution replied the president with a cynicism common to persons who collect funds for charitable purposes george wickham sent me twentyfive cents from denver when i wrote him a receipt i said thank you same as aunt polly did when the neighbors brought her a piece of beef ever so much obleeged but dont forget me when you come to kill a pig now mrs baxter you shant clean james bruces pew or what was his before he turned second advent ill do that myself for he used to be in my sundayschool class hes the backbone o that congregation now asserted mrs sargent and they say hes goin to marry mrs sam peters who sings in their choir as soon as his year is up they make a perfect fool of him in that church you cant make a fool of a man that nature aint begun with argued miss brewster jim bruce never was very strongminded but i declare it seems to me that when men lose their wives they lose their wits i was sure jim would marry hannah thompson that keeps house for him i suspected she was lookin out for a life job when she hired out with him hannah thompson may keep jims house but shell never keep jim thats certain affirmed the president and i cant see that mrs peters will better herself much i dont blame her for one came in no uncertain tones from the leftwing pews and the widow buzzell rose from her knees and approached the group by the pulpit if theres anything duller than cookin three meals a day for yourself and settin down and eatin em by yourself and then gettin up and clearin em away after yourself id like to know it i should nt want any goodlookin pleasantspoken man to offer himself to me without he expected to be snapped up thats all but if youve made out to get one husband in york county you can thank the lord and not expect any more favors i used to think tom was poor compny and complain i could nt have any conversation with him but land i could talk at him and theres considerable comfort in that and i could pick up after him now every room in my house is clean and every closet and bureau drawer too i cant start drawin in another rug for ive got all the rugs i can step foot on i dried so many apples last year i shant need to cut up any this season my jelly and preserves aint out and there i am and there most of us are in this village without a man to take steps for and trot round after theres just three husbands among the fifteen women scrubbin here now and the rest of us is all old maids and widders no wonder the menfolks die or move away like justin peabody a place with such a mess o womenfolks aint healthy to live in whatever lobelia brewster may say iii justin peabody had once faithfully struggled with the practical difficulties of life in edgewood or so he had thought in those old days of which nancy wentworth was thinking when she wiped the paint of the peabody pew work in the mills did not attract him he had no capital to invest in a stock of goods for storekeeping schoolteaching offered him only a pittance there remained then only the farm if he were to stay at home and keep his mother company justin dont seem to take no holt of things said the neighbors good heavens it seemed to him that there were no things to take hold of that was his first thought later he grew to think that the trouble all lay in himself and both thoughts bred weakness the farm had somehow supported the family in the old deacons time but justin seemed unable to coax a competence from the soil he could and did rise early and work late till the earth sow crops but he could not make the rain fall nor the sun shine at the times he needed them and the elements however much they might seem to favor his neighbors seldom smiled on his enterprises the crows liked justins corn better than any other in edgewood it had a richness peculiar to itself a quality that appealed to the most jaded palate so that it was really worth while to fly over a mile of intervening fields and pay it the delicate compliment of preference justin could explain the attitude of caterpillars worms grasshoppers and potatobugs toward him only by assuming that he attracted them as the magnet in the toy boxes attracts the miniature fishes land o liberty look at em congregate ejaculated jabe slocum when he was called in for consultation now if youd gone in for breedin insecks you could be as proud as cuffy an exhibit em at the county fair theyd give yer prizes for size an numbers an speed i guess why say theyre real crowded for room the plants aint give em enough leaves to roost on have you tried bug death it acts like a tonic on them said justin gloomily sho you dont say so now mine cant abide the sight nor smell of it what bout paris green they thrive on it its as good as an appetizer well said jabe slocum revolving the quid of tobacco in his mouth reflectively the bug that aint got no objection to pison is a bug thats got ways o thinkin an feelin an reasonin that i aint able to cope with praps its all a leadin o providence mebbe it shows youd ought to quit farmin crops an take to raisin live stock justin did just that as a matter of fact a year or two later but stock that has within itself the power of being live has also rare qualification for being dead when occasion suits and it generally did suit justins stock it proved prone not only to all the general diseases that cattleflesh is heir to but was capable even of suicide at least it is true that two valuable jersey calves tied to stakes on the hillside had flung themselves violently down the bank and strangled themselves with their own ropes in a manner which seemed to show that they found no pleasure in existence at all events on the peabody farm these were some of the little tragedies that had sickened young justin peabody with life in edgewood and nancy wentworth even then realized some of them and sympathized without speaking in a girls poor helpless way mrs simpson had washed the floor in the right wing of the church and nancy had cleaned all the paint now she sat in the old peabody pew darning the forlorn faded cushion with gray carpetthread thread as gray as her own life the scrubbingparty had moved to its labors in a far corner of the church and two of the women were beginning preparations for the basket luncheons nancys needle was no busier than her memory long years ago she had often sat in the peabody pew sometimes at first as a girl of sixteen when asked by esther and then on coming home from school at eighteen finished she had been invited now and again by mrs peabody herself on those sundays when her own invalid mother had not attended service those were wonderful sundays sundays of quiet trembling peace and maiden joy justin sat beside her and she had been sure then but had long since grown to doubt the evidence of her senses that he too vibrated with pleasure at the nearness was there not a summer morning when his hand touched her white lace mitt as they held the hymnbook together and the lines of the rise my soul and stretch thy wings thy better portion trace became blurred on the page and melted into something indistinguishable for a full minute or two afterward were there not looks and looks and looks or had she some misleading trick of vision in those days justins dark handsome profile rose before her the level brows and fine lashes the wellcut nose and lovable mouth the peabody mouth and chin somewhat too sweet and pliant for strength perhaps then the eyes turned to hers in the old way just for a fleeting glance as they had so often done at prayermeeting or sociable or sunday service was it not a mans heart she had seen in them and oh if she could only be sure that her own womans heart had not looked out from hers drawn from its maiden shelter in spite of all her wish to keep it hidden then followed two dreary years of indecision and suspense when justins eyes met hers less freely when his looks were always gloomy and anxious when affairs at the peabody farm grew worse and worse when his mother followed her husband the old deacon and her daughter esther to the buryingground in the churchyard then the end of all things came the end of the world for nancy justins departure for the west in a very frenzy of discouragement over the narrowness and limitation and injustice of his lot over the rockiness and barrenness and unkindness of the new england soil over the general bitterness of fate and the bludgeonings of chance he was a failure born of a family of failures if the world owed him a living he had yet to find the method by which it could be earned all this he thought and uttered and much more of the same sort in these days of humbled pride self was paramount though it was a self he despised there was no time for love who was he for a girl to lean upon he who could not stand erect himself he bade a stiff goodbye to his neighbors and to nancy he vouchsafed little more a handshake with no thrill of love in it such as might have furnished her palm at least some memories to dwell upon a few stilted words of leavetaking a halting meaningless sentence or two about his botch of life then he walked away from the wentworth doorstep but halfway down the garden path where the shriveled hollyhocks stood like sentinels did a wave of something different sweep over him a wave of the boyish irresponsible past when his heart had wings and could fly without fear to its mate a wave of the past that was rushing through nancys mind wellnigh burying her in its bittersweet waters for he lifted his head and suddenly retracing his steps he came toward her and taking her hand again said forlornly you ll see me back when my luck turns nancy nancy knew that the words might mean little or much according to the manner in which they were uttered but to her hurt pride and sore shamed womaninstinct they were a promise simply because there was a choking sound in justins voice and tears in justins eyes you ll see me back when my luck turns nancy this was the phrase upon which she had lived for more than ten years nancy had once heard the old parson say ages ago that the whole purpose of life was the growth of the soul that we eat sleep clothe ourselves work love all to give the soul another day month year in which to develop she used to wonder if her soul could be growing in the monotonous round of her dull duties and her duller pleasures she did not confess it even to herself nevertheless she knew that she worked ate slept to live until justins luck turned her love had lain in her heart a bird without a song year after year her mother had dwelt by her side and never guessed her father too and both were dead the neighbors also lynxeyed and curious had never suspected if she had suffered no one in edgewood was any the wiser for the maiden heart is not commonly worn on the sleeve in new england if she had been openly pledged to justin peabody she could have waited twice ten years with a decent show of selfrespect for long engagements were viewed rather as a matter of course in that neighborhood the endless months had gone on since that gray november day when justin had said goodbye it had been just before thanksgiving and she went to church with an aching and ungrateful heart the parson read from the eighth chapter of st matthew a most unexpected selection for that holiday if you cant find anything else to be thankful for he cried go home and be thankful you are not a leper nancy took the drastic counsel away from the church with her and it was many a year before she could manage to add to this slender store anything to increase her gratitude for mercies given though all the time she was outwardly busy cheerful and helpful justin had once come back to edgewood and it was the bitterest drop in her cup of bitterness that she was spending that winter in berwick where so the neighbors told him she was a great favorite in society and was receiving much attention from gentlemen so that she had never heard of his visit until the spring had come again parted friends did not keep up with one anothers affairs by means of epistolary communication in those days in edgewood it was not the custom spoken words were difficult enough to justin peabody and written words were quite impossible especially if they were to be used to define his halfconscious desires and his fluctuations of will or to recount his disappointments and discouragements and mistakes iv it was saturday afternoon the th of december and the weary sisters of the dorcas band rose from their bruised knees and removed their little stores of carpettacks from their mouths this was a feminine custom of long standing and as no village dressmaker had ever died of pins in the digestive organs so were no symptoms of carpettacks ever discovered in any dorcas living or dead men wondered at the habit and reviled it but stood confounded in the presence of its indubitable harmlessness the red ingrain carpet was indeed very warm beautiful and comforting to the eye and the sisters were suitably grateful to providence and devoutly thankful to themselves that they had been enabled to buy sew and lay so many yards of it but as they stood looking at their completed task it was cruelly true that there was much left to do the aisles had been painted dark brown on each side of the red strips leading from the doors to the pulpit but the rest of the church floor was a thing of shreds and patches each member of the carpet committee had paid as a matter of pride however ill she could afford it three dollars and sixtyseven cents for sufficient carpet to lay in her own pew but these brilliant spots of conscientious effort only made the stretches of bare unpainted floor more evident and that was not all traces of former spasmodic and individual efforts desecrated the present ideals the doctors pew had a pinkandblue brussels on it the lawyers striped staircarpeting the browns from deerwander sported straw matting and were not abashed while the greens the whites the blacks and the grays displayed floor coverings as dissimilar as their names i never noticed it before exclaimed maria sharp but it aint christian that floor its heathenish and ungodly for mercys sake dont swear maria said mrs miller nervously weve done our best and lets hope that folks will look up and not down it is nt as if they were going to set in the chandelier theyll have something else to think about when nancy gets her hemlock branches and white carnations in the pulpit vases this morning my abner picked off two pinks from a plant ive been nursing in my diningroom for weeks trying to make it bloom for christmas i slapped his hands good and its been haunting me ever since to think i had to correct him the day before christmas come lobelia we must be hurrying one thing comforts me exclaimed the widow buzzell as she took her hammer and tacks preparatory to leaving and that is that the methodist meetinhouse aint got any carpet at all mrs buzzell mrs buzzell interrupted the ministers wife with a smile that took the sting from her speech it will be like punishing little abner miller if we think those thoughts on christmas eve we shall surely be haunted afterward and anyway interjected maria sharp who always saved the situation you just wait and see if the methodists dont say theyd rather have no carpet at all than have one that dont go all over the floor i know em and she put on her hood and blanketshawl as she gave one last fond look at the improvements im going home to get my supper and come back afterward to lay the carpet in my pew my beans and brown bread will be just right by now and perhaps it will rest me a little besides i must feed zekiel as nancy wentworth spoke she sat in a corner of her own modest rear seat looking a little pale and tired her waving dark hair had loosened and fallen over her cheeks and her eyes gleamed from under it wistfully nowadays nancys eyes never had the sparkle of gazing into the future but always the liquid softness that comes from looking backward the church will be real cold by then nancy objected mrs burbank goodnight mrs baxter oh no i shall be back by halfpast six and i shall not work long do you know what i believe ill do mrs burbank just through the holidays christmas and new years both coming on sunday this year therell be a great many out to church not counting the strangers thatll come to the special service tomorrow instead of putting down my own pew carpet thatll never be noticed here in the back ill lay it in the old peabody pew for the red aislestrip leads straight up to it the ministers always go up that side and it does look forlorn thats so and all the more because my pew thats exactly opposite in the left wing is new carpeted and cushioned replied the president i think its real generous of you nancy because the riverboro folks knowing that youre a member of the carpet committee will be sure to notice and think its queer you have nt made an effort to carpet your own pew never mind smiled nancy wearily riverboro folks never go to bed on saturday nights without wondering what edgewood is thinking about them the ministers wife stood at her window watching nancy as she passed the parsonage how wasted how wasted she sighed going home to eat her lonely supper and feed zekiel i can bear it for the others but not for nancy now she has lighted her lamp now she has put fresh pine on the fire for new smoke comes from the chimney why should i sit down and serve my dear husband and nancy feed zekiel there was some truth in mrs baxters feeling mrs buzzell for instance had three sons maria sharp was absorbed in her lame father and her sundayschool work and lobelia brewster would not have considered matrimony a blessing even under the most favorable conditions but nancy was framed and planned for other things and zekiel was an insufficient channel for her soft womanly sympathy and her bright activity of mind and body zekiel had lost his tail in a mowingmachine zekiel had the asthma and the immersion of his nose in milk made him sneeze so he was wont to slip his paw in and out of the dish and lick it patiently for five minutes together nancy often watched him pityingly giving him kind and gentle words to sustain his fainting spirit but tonight she paid no heed to him although he sneezed violently to attract her attention she had put her supper on the lighted table by the kitchen window and was pouring out her cup of tea when a boy rapped at the door heres a paper and a letter miss wentworth he said its the second this week and they think over to the store that that berwick widower must be settin up and takin notice she had indeed received a letter the day before an unsigned communication consisting only of the words second epistle of john verse x she had taken her bible to look out the reference and found it to be having many tilings to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full the envelope was postmarked new york and she smiled thinking that mrs emerson a charming lady who had spent the summer in edgewood and had sung with her in the village choir was coming back as she had promised to have a sleigh ride and see edgewood in its winter dress nancy had almost forgotten the first letter in the excitements of her busy day and now here was another from boston this time she opened the envelope and found again only a sipgle sentence printed not written lest she should guess the hand she wondered second epistle of john verse and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another was it mrs emerson could it be any one else was it no it might have been years ago but not now not now and yet he was always so different from other people and once in church he had handed her the hymnbook with his finger pointing to a certain verse she always fancied that her secret fidelity of heart rose from the fact that justin peabody was different from the hour of their first acquaintance she was ever comparing him with his companions and always to his advantage so long as a woman finds all men very much alike as lobelia brewster did save that she allowed some to be worse she is in no danger but the moment in which she perceives and discriminates subtle differences marveling that there can be two opinions about a mans superiority that moment the miracle has happened and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another no it could not be from justin she drank her tea played with her beans abstractedly and nibbled her slice of steaming brown bread not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee no not a new one twelve fifteen years old that commandment that we love one another who was speaking who had written these words the first letter sounded just like mrs emerson who had said she was a very poor correspondent but that she should just drop down on nancy one of these days but this second letter never came from mrs emerson well there would be an explanation some time a pleasant one one to smile over and tell zekiel and repeat to the neighbors but not an unexpected sacred beautiful explanation such a one as the heart of a woman could imagine if she were young enough and happy enough to hope she washed her cup and plate replaced the uneaten beans in the brown pot and put them away with the round loaf folded the cloth lobelia brewster said nancy always set out her meals as if she was entertainin company from portland closed the stove dampers carried the lighted lamp to a safe corner shelf and lifted zekiel to his cushion on the highbacked rocker doing all with the nice precision of long habit then she wrapped herself warmly and locking the lonely little house behind her set out to finish her work in the church v at this precise moment justin peabody was eating his own beans and brown bread articles of diet of which his detroit landlady was lamentably ignorant at the new tavern not far from the meetinghouse it would not be fair to him to say that mrs burbanks letter had brought him back to edgewood but it had certainly accelerated his steps for the first six years after justin peabody left home he had drifted about from place to place saving every possible dollar of his uncertain earnings in the conscious hope that he could go back to new england and ask nancy wentworth to marry him the west was prosperous and progressive but how he yearned in idle moments for the grimmer and more sterile soil that had given him birth then came what seemed to him a brilliant chance for a lucky turn of his savings and he invested them in an enterprise which wonderfully as it promised failed within six months and left him penniless at that moment he definitely gave up all hope and for the next few years he put nancy as far as possible out of his mind in the full belief that he was acting an honorable part in refusing to drag her into his tangled and fruitless way of life if she ever did care for him and he could not be sure she was always so shy she must have outgrown the feeling long since and be living happily or at least contentedly in her own way he was glad in spite of himself when he heard that she had never married but at least he had nt it on his conscience that he had kept her single on the th of december justin his business day over was walking toward the dreary house in which he ate and slept as he turned the corner he heard one woman say to another as they watched a man stumbling sorrowfully down the street going home will be the worst of all for him to find nobody there that was what going home had meant for him these ten years but he afterward felt it strange that this thought should have struck him so forcibly on that particular day entering the boardinghouse he found mrs burbanks letter with its edgewood postmark on the hall table and took it up to his room he kindled a little fire in the airtight stove watching the flame creep from shavings to kindlings from kindlings to small pine and from small pine to the round hardwood sticks then when the result seemed certain he closed the stove door and sat down to read the letter whereupon all manner of strange things happened in his head and heart and flesh and spirit as he sat there alone his hands in his pockets his feet braced against the legs of the stove it was a cold winter night and the snow and sleet beat against the windows he looked about the ugly room at the washstand with its square of oilcloth in front and its detestable bowl and pitcher at the rigors of his white iron bedstead with the valley in the middle of the lumpy mattress and the darns in the rumpled pillowcases at the dull photographs of the landladys hideous husband and children enshrined on the mantelshelf looked at the abomination of desolation surrounding him until his soul sickened and cried out like a childs for something more like home it was as if a spring thaw had melted his icebound heart and on the crest of a wave it was drifting out into the milder waters of some unknown sea he could have laid his head in the kind lap of a woman and cried comfort me give me companionship or i die the wind howled in the chimney and rattled the loose windowsashes the snow freezing as it fell dashed against the glass with hard cutting little blows at least that is the way in which the wind and snow flattered themselves they were making existence disagreeable to justin peabody when he read the letter but never were elements more mistaken it was a june sunday in the boardinghouse bedroom and for that matter it was not the boardinghouse bedroom at all it was the old orthodox church on tory hill in edgewood the windows were wide open and the smell of the purple clover and the humming of the bees were drifting into the sweet wide spaces within justin was sitting in the end of the peabody pew and nancy wentworth was beside him nancy cool and restful in her white dress darkhaired nancy under the shadow of her shirred muslin hat rise my soul and stretch thy wings thy better portion trace the melodeon gave the tune and nancy and he stood to sing taking the book between them his hand touched hers and as the music of the hymn rose and fell the future unrolled itself before his eyes a future in which nancy was his wedded wife and the happy years stretched on and on in front of them until there was a row of little heads in the old peabody pew and mother and father could look proudly along the line at the young things they were bringing into the house of the lord the recalling of that vision worked like magic in justins blood his soul rose and stretched its wings and traced its better portion vividly as he sprang to his feet and walked up and down the bedroom floor he would get a few days leave and go back to edgewood for christmas to join with all the old neighbors in the service at the meetinghouse and in pursuance of this resolve he shook his fist in the face of the landladys husband on the mantelpiece and dared him to prevent he had a salary of fifty dollars a month with some very slight prospect of an increase after january he did not see how two persons could eat and drink and lodge and dress on it in detroit but he proposed to give nancy wentworth the refusal of that magnificent future that brilliant and tempting offer he had exactly one hundred dollars in the bank and sixty or seventy of them would be spent in the journeys counting two happy blessed fares back from edgewood to detroit and if he paid only his own fare back he would throw the price of the other into the pond behind the wentworth house he would drop another ten dollars into the plate on christmas day toward the repairs on the church if he starved he would do that he was a failure everything his hand touched turned to naught he looked himself full in the face recognizing his weakness and in this supremest moment of recognition he was a stronger man than he had been an hour before his drooping shoulders had straightened the restless look had gone from his eyes his somber face had something of repose in it the repose of a settled purpose he was a failure but perhaps if he took the risks and if nancy would take them but that was the trouble women were so unselfish they were always willing to take risks and one ought not to let them perhaps he might do better in trying to make a living for two than he had in working for himself alone he would go home tell nancy that he was an unlucky goodfornaught and ask her if she would try her hand at making him over vi these were the reasons that had brought justin peabody to edgewood on the saturday afternoon before christmas and had taken him to the new tavern on tory hill near the meetinghouse nobody recognized him at the station or noticed him at the tavern and after his supper he put on his overcoat and started out for a walk aimlessly hoping that he might meet a friend or failing that intending to call on some of his old neighbors with the view of hearing the village news and securing some information which might help him to decide when he had better lay himself and his misfortunes at nancy wentworths feet they were pretty feet he remembered that fact well enough under the magical influence of familiar sights and sounds and odors he was restless miserable anxious homesick not for detroit but for some heretofore unimagined good yet like bunyans shepherd boy in the valley of humiliation he carried the herb called heartsease in his bosom for he was at last loving consciously how white the old church looked and how green the blinds it must have been painted very lately that meant that the parish was fairly prosperous there were new shutters in the belfry tower too he remembered the former open space and the rusty bell and he liked the change did the chimney use to be in that corner no but his father had always said it would have drawn better if it had been put there in the beginning new shingles within a year that was evident to a practiced eye he wondered if anything had been done to the inside of the building but he must wait until the morrow to see for of course the doors would be locked no the one at the right side was ajar he opened it softly and stepped into the tiny square entry that he recalled so well the one through which the sundayschool children ran out to the steps from their catechism apparently enjoying the sunshine after a spell of orthodoxy the little entry where the village girls congregated while waiting for the last bell to ring they made a soft blur of pink and blue and buff a little flutter of curls and braids and fans and sunshades in his minds eye as he closed the outer door behind him and gently opened the inner one the church was flooded with moonlight and snowlight and there was one lamp burning at the back of the pulpit a candle too on the pulpit steps there was the tiptaptip of a tackhammer going on in a distant corner was somebody hanging christmas garlands the new red carpet attracted his notice and as he grew accustomed to the dim light it carried his eye along the aisle he had trod so many years of sundays to the old familiar pew the sound of the hammer ceased and a woman rose from her knees a stranger was doing for the family honor what he ought himself to have done the woman turned to shake her skirt and it was nancy wentworth he might have known it women were always faithful they always remembered old landmarks old days old friends old duties his father and mother and esther were all gone who but dear nancy would have made the old peabody pew right and tidy for the christmas festival bless her kind womanly heart she looked just the same to him as when he last saw her mercifully he seemed to have held in remembrance all these years not so much her youthful bloom as her general qualities of mind and heart her cheeriness her spirit her unflagging zeal her bright womanliness her gray dress was turned up in front over a crimson moreen petticoat she had on a cozy jacket a fur turban of some sort with a red breast in it and her cheeks were flushed from exertion sweet records and promises as sweet had always met in nancys face and either he had forgotten how pretty she was or else she had absolutely grown prettier during his absence nancy would have chosen the supreme moment of meeting very differently but she might well have chosen worse she unpinned her skirt and brushed the threads off smoothed the pew cushions carefully and took a last stitch in the ragged hassock she then lifted the bible and the hymnbook from the rack and putting down a bit of flannel on the pulpit steps took a flatiron from an oilstove and opening the ancient books pressed out the wellthumbed leaves one by one with infinite care after replacing the volumes in their accustomed place she first extinguished the flame of her stove which she tucked out of sight and then blew out the lamp and the candle the church was still light enough for objects to be seen in a shadowy way like the objects in a dream and justin did not realize that he was a man in the flesh looking at a woman spying it might be upon her privacy he was one part of a dream and she another and he stood as if waiting and fearing to be awakened nancy having done all came out of the pew and standing in the aisle looked back at the scene of her labors with pride and content and as she looked some desire to stay a little longer in the dear old place must have come over her or some dread of going back to her lonely cottage for she sat down in justins corner of the pew with folded hands her eyes fixed dreamily on the pulpit and her ears hearing not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning justins grasp on the latch tightened as he prepared to close the door and leave the place but his instinct did not warn him quickly enough after all for obeying some uncontrollable impulse nancy suddenly fell on her knees in the pew and buried her face in the cushions the dream broke and in an instant justin was a man worse than that he was an eavesdropper ashamed of his unsuspected presence he felt himself standing with covered head and feet shod in the holy temple of a womans heart but his involuntary irreverence brought abundant grace with it the glimpse and the revelation wrought their miracles silently and irresistibly not by the slow processes of growth which nature demands for her enterprises but with the sudden swiftness of the spirit in an instant changes had taken place in justins soul which his socalled experiencing religion twentyfive years back had been powerless to effect he had indeed been baptized then but the recording angel could have borne witness that this second baptism fructified the first and became the real herald of the new birth and the new creature vii justin peabody silently closed the inner door and stood in the entry with his head bent and his heart in a whirl until he should hear nancy rise to her feet he must take this heavensent chance of telling her all but how do it without alarming her a moment and her step sounded in the stillness of the empty church obeying the first impulse he passed through the outer door and standing on the step knocked once twice three times then opening it a little and speaking through the chink he called is miss nancy wentworth here im here in a moment came nancys answer and then with a little wondering tremor in her voice as if a hint of the truth had already dawned whats wanted youre wanted nancy wanted badly by justin peabody come back from the west the door opened wide and justin faced nancy standing halfway down the aisle her eyes brilliant her lips parted a week ago justins apparition confronting her in the empty meetinghouse after nightfall even had she been prepared for it as now by his voice would have terrified her beyond measure now it seemed almost natural and inevitable she had spent these last days in the church where both of them had been young and happy together the two letters had brought him vividly to mind and her labor in the old peabody pew had been one long excursion into the past in which he was the most prominent and the bestloved figure i said id come back to you when my luck turned nancy these were so precisely the words she expected him to say should she ever see him again face to face that for an additional moment they but heightened her sense of unreality well the luck hasnt turned after all but i could nt wait any longer have you given a thought to me all these years nancy more than one justin for the very look upon his face the tenderness of his voice the attitude of his body outran his words and told her what he had come home to say told her that her years of waiting were over at last you ought to despise me for coming back again with only myself and my empty hands to offer you how easy it was to speak his heart out in this dim and quiet place how tonguetied he would have been sitting on the black haircloth sofa in the wentworth parlor and gazing at the open soapstone stove oh men are such fools cried nancy smiles and tears struggling together in her speech as she sat down suddenly in her own pew and put her hands over her face they are agreed justin humbly but ive never stopped loving you whenever ive had time for thinking or loving and i was nt sure that you really cared anything about me and how could i have asked you when i had nt a dollar in the world there are other things to give a woman besides dollars justin are there well you shall have them all every one of them nancy if you can make up your mind to do without the dollars for dollars seem to be just what i cant manage her hand was in his by this time and they were sitting side by side in the cushionless carpetless wentworth pew the door stood open the winter moon shone in upon them that it was beginning to grow cold in the church passed unnoticed the grasp of the womans hand seemed to give the man new hope and courage and justins warm confiding pleading pressure brought balm to nancy balm and healing for the wounds her pride had suffered joy too halfconscious still that her life need not be lived to the end in unfruitful solitude she had waited as some gray lake lies full and smooth awaiting the star below the twilight justin peabody might have been no other womans star but he was nancys just you sitting beside me here makes me feel as if id been asleep or dead all these years and just born over again said justin ive led a respectable hardworking honest life nancy he continued and i dont owe any man a cent the trouble is that no man owes me one ive got enough money to pay two fares back to detroit on monday although i was terribly afraid you would nt let me do it itll need a good deal of thinking and planning nancy for we shall be very poor nancy had been storing up fidelity and affection deep deep in the hive of her heart all these years and now the honey of her helpfulness stood ready to be gathered could i keep hens in detroit she asked i can always make them pay hens in three rooms nancy her face fell and no yard no yard a moments pause and then the smile came oh well ive had yards and hens for thirtyfive years doing without them will be a change i can take in sewing no you cant nancy i need your backbone and wits and pluck and ingenuity but if i cant ask you to sit with your hands folded for the rest of your life as id like to you shant use them for other people youre marrying me to make a man of me but im not marrying you to make you a drudge his voice rang clear and true in the silence and nancys heart vibrated at the sound o justin justin theres something wrong somewhere she whispered but well find it out together you and i and make it right youre not like a failure you dont even look poor justin there is nt a man in edgewood to compare with you or i should be washing his dishes and darning his stockings this minute and i am not a pauper therell be the rent of my little house and a carload of my furniture so you can put the threeroom idea out of your mind and your firm will offer you a larger salary when you tell them you have a wife to take care of oh i see it all and it is as easy and bright and happy as can be justin put his arm around her and drew her close with such a throb of gratitude for her belief and trust that it moved him almost to tears there was a long pause then he said now i shall call for you tomorrow morning after the last bell has stopped ringing and we will walk up the aisle together and sit in the old peabody pew we shall be a nine days wonder anyway but this will be equal to an announcement especially if you take my arm we dont either of us like to be stared at but this will show without a word what we think of each other and what weve promised to be to each other and its the only thing that will make me feel sure of you and settled in my mind after all these mistaken years have you got the courage nancy i should nt wonder i guess if ive had courage enough to wait for you ive got courage enough to walk up the aisle with you and marry you besides said nancy now it is too late for us to stay here any longer and you must see me only as far as my gate for perhaps you have nt forgotten yet how interested the brewsters are in their neighbors they stood at the little wentworth gate for a moment hand close clasped in hand the night was clear the air was cold and sparkling but with nothing of bitterness in it the sky was steely blue and the evening star glowed and burned like a tiny sun nancy remembered the shepherds song she had taught the sundayschool children and repeated softly for i my sheep was watching beneath the silent skies when sudden far to eastward i saw a star arise then all the peaceful heavens with sweetest music rang and glory glory glory the happy angels sang so i this night am joyful though i can scarce tell why it seemeth me that glory hath met us very nigh and we though poor and humble have part in heavenly plan for born tonight the prince of peace shall rule the heart of man justins heart melted within him like wax to the womans vision and the womans touch oh nancy nancy he whispered if i had brought my bad luck to you long long ago would you have taken me then and have i lost years of such happiness as this there are some things it is not best for a man to be certain about said nancy with a wise smile and a last goodnight viii ring out sweet bells oer woods and dells your lovely strains repeat while happy throngs with joyous songs each accent gladly greet christmas morning in the old tory hill meetinghouse was felt by all of the persons who were present in that particular year to be a most exciting and memorable occasion the old sexton quite outdid himself for although he had rung the bell for more than thirty years he had never felt greater pride or joy in his task was not his son john home for christmas and johns wife and a grandchild newly named nathaniel for himself were there not spareribs and turkeys and cranberries and mince pies on the pantry shelves and barrels of rosy baldwins in the cellar and bottles of mothers root beer just waiting to give a holiday pop the bell itself forgot its age and the suspicion of a crack that dulled its voice on a damp day and inspired by the bright frosty air the sextons inspiring pull and the christmas spirit gave out nothing but joyous tones dingdong dingdong it fired the ambitions of star scholars about to recite hymns and sing solos it thrilled little girls expecting dolls before night it excited beyond bearing dozens of little boys being buttoned into refractory overcoats dingdong dingdong mothers fingers trembled when they heard it and mothers voices cried if that is the second bell the children will never be ready in time where are the overshoes where are the mittens hurry jack hurry jennie dingdong dingdong wheres sallys muff wheres fathers fur cap is the sleigh at the door are the hot soapstones in have all of you your money for the contribution box dingdong dingdong it was a blithe bell a sweet true bell a holy bell and to justin pacing his tavern room as to nancy trembling in her maiden chamber it rang a christmas message awake glad heart arise and sing it is the birthday of thy king the congregation filled every seat in the old meetinghouse as maria sharp had prophesied there was one illnatured spinster from a rival village who declared that the church floor looked like josephs coat laid out smooth but in the general chorus of admiration approval and goodwill this envious speech though repeated from mouth to mouth left no sting another item of interest long recalled was the fact that on that august and unapproachable day the pulpit vases stood erect and empty though nancy wentworth had filled them every sunday since any one could remember this instance though felt at the time to be of mysterious significance if the cause were ever revealed paled into nothingness when after the ringing of the last bell nancy wentworth walked up the aisle on justin peabodys arm and they took their seats side by side in the old family pew and considable close too though there was plenty o room and no one that i ever heard of so much as suspicioned that they had ever kept company and do you spose she knew justin was expected back when she scrubbed his pew afriday and this explains the empty pulpit vases and i always said that nancy would make a real handsome couple if she ever got anybody to couple with during the unexpected and solemn procession of the two up the aisle the soprano of the village choir stopped short in the middle of the doxology and the three other voices carried it to the end without any treble also among those present there were some who could not remember afterward the precise petitions wafted upward in the opening prayer and could it be explained otherwise than by cheerfully acknowledging the bounty of an overruling providence that nancy wentworth should have had a new winter dress for the first time in five years a winter dress of dark brown cloth to match her beaver muff and victorine the existence of this toilette had been known and discussed in edgewood for a month past and it was thought to be nothing more than a proper token of respect from a member of the carpet committee to the general magnificence of the church on the occasion of its reopening after repairs indeed you could have identified every member of the dorcas society that sunday morning by the freshness of her apparel the brown dress then was generally expected but why the white cashmere waist with collar and cuffs of point lace devised only and suitable only for the ministers wedding where it first saw the light the white waist can only be explained as showing distinct hope whispered the ministers wife during the reading of the church notices to me it shows more than hope i am very sure that nancy would never take any wear out of that lace for hope it means certainty answered maria who was always strong in the prophetic line justins identity had dawned upon most of the congregation by sermon time a stranger to all but one or two at first his presence in the peabody pew brought his face and figure back little by little to the minds of the old parishioners when the contribution plate was passed the sexton always began at the rightwing pews as all the sextons before him had done for a hundred years every eye in the church was already turned upon justin and nancy and it was with almost a gasp that those in the vicinity saw a tendollar bill fall in the plate the sexton reeled or if that is too intemperate a word for a pillar of the church the good man tottered but caught hold of the pew rail with one hand and putting the thumb of his other over the bill proceeded quickly to the next pew lest the stranger should think better of his gift or demand change as had occasionally been done in the olden time nancy never fluttered an eyelash but sat quietly by justins side with her bosom rising and falling under the beaver fur and her cold hands clasped tight in the little brown muff far from grudging this appreciable part of their slender resources she thrilled with pride to see justins offering fall in the plate justin was too absorbed in his own thoughts to notice anything but his munificent contribution had a most unexpected effect upon his reputation after all for on that day and on many another later one when his sudden marriage and departure with nancy wentworth were under discussion the neighbors said to one another justin must be making money fast out west he put ten dollars in the contribution plate asunday and paid the minister ten more next day for marryin him to nancy so the peabody luck has turned at last which as a matter of fact it had and all the time said the chairman of the carpet committee to the treasurer of the dorcas society all the time little as she realized it nancy was laying the carpet in her own pew now shes married to justin shell be the makin of him or i miss my guess you cant do a thing with menfolks without theyre right alongside where you can keep your eye and hand on em justins handsome and good and stiddy all he needs is some nice woman to put starch into him the edgewood peabodys never had a mite o stiffenin in em limp as dishrags every blessed one nancy wentworth fairly rustles with starch justin had nt been engaged to her but a few hours when they walked up the aisle together but did you notice the way he carried his head i declare i thought t would fall off behind i should nt wonder a mite but they prospered and come back every summer to set in the old peabody pew susanna and sue i mother anns children it was the end of may when spring goeth all in white the apple trees were scattering their delicate petals on the ground dropping them over the stone walls to the roadsides where in the moist places of the shadows they fell on beds of snowy innocence here and there a single tree was tinged with pink but so faintly it was as if the white were blushing now and then a tiny white butterfly danced in the sun and pearly clouds strayed across the sky in fleecy flocks everywhere the grass was of ethereal greenness a greenness drenched with the pale yellow of spring sunshine looking from earth to sky and from blossom to blossom the little world of the apple orchards shedding its falling petals like fairweather snow seemed made of alabaster and porcelain ivory and motherofpearl all shimmering on a background of tender green after you pass albion village with its streets shaded by elms and maples and its outskirts embowered in blossoming orchards you wind along a hilly country road that runs between grassy fields here the whiteweed is already budding and there are pleasant pastures dotted with rocks and fringed with spruce and fir stretches of woodland too where the road is lined with giant pines and you lift your face gratefully to catch the cool balsam breath of the forest coming from out this splendid shade this silence too deep to be disturbed by light breezes or vagrant winds you find yourself on the brow of a descending hill the first thing that strikes the eye is a lake that might be a great blue sapphire dropped into the verdant hollow where it lies when the eye reluctantly leaves the lake on the left it turns to rest upon the little shaker settlement on the right a dozen or so large comfortable white barns sheds and houses standing in the wide orderly spaces of their own spreading acres of farm and timber land there again the spring goeth all in white for there is no spot to fleck the dazzling quality of shaker paint and their apple plum and pear trees are so well cared for that the snowy blossoms are fairly hiding the branches the place is very still although there are signs of labor in all directions from a window of the girls building a quaint little grayclad figure is beating a braided rug a boy in homespun with his hair slightly long in the back and cut in a straight line across the forehead is carrying milkcans from the dairy to one of the sisters houses men in broadbrimmed hats with cleanshaven ascetic faces are ploughing or harrowing here and there in the fields while a group of sisters is busy setting out plants and vines in some beds near a cluster of noble trees that cluster of trees did the eye of the stranger realize it was the very startingpoint of this shaker community for in the year the valiant father james whittaker one of mother ann lees earliest english converts stopped near the village of albion on his first visit to maine as he and his elders alighted from their horses they stuck into the ground the willow withes they had used as whips and now a hundred years later the trees that had grown from these slender branches were nearly three feet in diameter from whatever angle you look upon the settlement the first and strongest impression is of quiet order harmony and a kind of austere plenty nowhere is the purity of the spring so apparent nothing is out of place nowhere is any confusion or appearance of loose ends or neglected tasks as you come nearer you feel the more surely that here there has never been undue haste nor waste no shirking no putting off till the morrow what should have been done today whenever a shingle or a clapboard was needed it was put on where paint was required it was used that is evident and a look at the great barns stored with hay shows how the fields have been conscientiously educated into giving a full crop to such a spot as this might any tired or sinful heart come for rest hoping somehow in the midst of such frugality and thrift such selfdenying labor such temperate use of gods good gifts such shining cleanliness of outward things to regain and wear the white flower of a blameless life the very air of the place breathed peace so thought susanna hathaway and little sue who skipped by her side thought nothing at all save that she was with mother in the country that it had been rather a sad journey with mother so quiet and pale and that she would be very glad to see supper should it rise like a fairy banquet in the midst of these strange surroundings it was only a mile and a half from the railway station to the shaker settlement and susanna knew the road well for she had driven over it more than once as child and girl a boy would bring the little trunk that contained their simple necessities later on in the evening so she and sue would knock at the door of the house where visitors were admitted and be undisturbed by any gossiping company while they were pleading their case are we most there mardie asked sue for the twentieth time look at me im being a butterfly or perhaps a white pigeon no id rather be a butterfly and then i can skim along faster and move my wings the airy little figure all lightness and brightness danced along the road the white cotton dress rising and falling the whitestockinged legs much in evidence the arms outstretched as if in flight straw hat falling off yellow hair and a little wisp of swansdown scarf floating out behind like the drapery of a baby mercury we are almost there her mother answered you can see the buildings now if you will stop being a butterfly dont you like them yes i specially like them all so white is it a town mardie it is a village but not quite like other villages i have told you often about the shaker settlement where your grandmother brought me once when i was just your age there was a thunderstorm they kept us all night and were so kind that i never forgot them then your grandmother and i stopped off once when we were going to boston i was ten then and i remember more about it the same sweet eldress was there both times what is an elderess mardie a kind of everybodys mother she seemed to be susanna responded with a catch in her breath id specially like her will she be there now mardie im hoping so but it is eighteen years ago i was ten and she was about forty i should think then o course shell be dead said sue cheerfully or either shell have no teeth or hair people dont always die before they are sixty sue do they die when they want to or when they must always when they must never never when they want to answered sues mother but o course they would nt ever want to if they had any little girls to be togedder with like you and me mardie and sue looked up with eyes that were always like two interrogation points eager by turns and by turns wistful but never satisfied no susanna replied brokenly of course they would nt unless sometimes they were wicked for a minute or two and forgot do the shakers shake all the time mardie or just once in a while and shall i see them do it sue dear i cant explain everything in the world to you while you are so little you really must wait until youre more grown up the shakers dont shake and the quakers dont quake and when youre older ill try to make you understand why they were called so and why they kept the name maybe the elderess can make me understand right off now id specially like it and sue ran breathlessly along to the gate where the north family house stood in its stately whiteandgreen austerity susanna followed and as she caught up with the impetuous sue the front door of the house opened and a figure appeared on the threshold mother and child quickened their pace and went up the steps susanna with a hopeless burden of fear and embarrassment clogging her tongue and dragging at her feet sue so expectant of new disclosures and fresh experiences that her face beamed like a full moon eldress abby for it was eldress abby had indeed survived the heavy weight of her fiftyfive or sixty summers and looked as if she might reach a yet greater age she wore the simple shaker afternoon dress of drab alpaca an irreproachable muslin surplice encircled her straight spare shoulders while her hair was almost entirely concealed by the stiffly wired transparent whitenet cap that served as a frame to the tranquil face the face itself was a network of delicate fine wrinkles but every wrinkle must have been as lovely in gods sight as it was in poor unhappy susanna hathaways some of them were graven by selfdenial and hard work others perhaps meant the giving up of home of parents and brothers or sisters perhaps some worldly love the love that father adam bequeathed to the human family had been slain in abbys youth and the scars still remained to show the bodys suffering and the spirits triumph at all events whatever foes had menaced her purity or her tranquillity had been conquered and she exhaled serenity as the rose sheds fragrance do you remember the little nelson girl and her mother that stayed here all night years ago asked susanna putting out her hand timidly why seems to me i do assented eldress abby genially so many comes and goes its hard to remember all did nt you come once in a thunderstorm yes one of your barns was struck by lightning and we sat up all night yee yee i remember well your mother was a beautiful spirit i could nt forget her yea is always thus pronounced by the shakers and we came once again mother and i and spent the afternoon with you and went strawberrying in the pasture yee yee so we did i hope your mother continues in health she died the very next year susanna answered in a trembling voice for the time of explanation was near at hand and her heart failed her wont you come into the sittingroom and rest a while you must be tired walking from the deepot no thank you not just yet ill step into the front entry a minute sue run and sit in that rockingchair on the porch and watch the cows going into the big barn do you remember eldress abby the second time i came how you sat me down in the kitchen with a bowl of wild strawberries to hull for supper they were very small and ripe i did my best for i never meant to be careless but the bowl slipped and fell my legs were too short to reach the floor and i could nt make a lap so in trying to pick up the berries i spilled juice on nay dress and on the white apron you had tied on for me then my fingers were stained and wet and the hulls kept falling in with the soft berries and when you came in and saw me you held up your hands and said dear dear you have made a mess of your work oh eldress abby theyve come back to me all day those words ive tried hard to be good but somehow ive made just such a mess of my life as i made of hulling the berries the bowl is broken i have nt much fruit to show and i am all stained and draggled i should nt have come to albion on the five oclock train that was an accident i meant to come at noon when you could turn me away if you wanted to nay that is not the shaker habit remonstrated abby you and the child can sleep in one of the spare chambers at the office building and be welcome but i want much more than that said susanna tearfully i want to come and live here where there is no marrying nor giving in marriage i am so tired with my disappointments and discouragements and failures that it is no use to try any longer i am mrs hathaway and sue is my child but i have left my husband for good and all and i only want to spend the rest of my days here in peace and bring up sue to a more tranquil life than i have ever had i have a little money so that i shall not be a burden to you and i will work from morning to night at any task you set me i will talk to the family said eldress abby gravely but there are a good many things to settle before we can say yee to all you ask let me confess everything freely and fully pleaded susanna and if you think im to blame i will go away at once nay this is no time for that it is our duty to receive all and try all then if you should be gathered in you would unburden your heart to god through the sister appointed to receive your confession will sue have to sleep in the childrens building away from me nay not now you are company not a shaker and anyway you could keep the child with you till she is a little older thats not forbidden at first though there comes a time when the ties of the flesh must be broken all youve got to do nows to be pure and peaceable gentle easy to be entreated and without hypocrisy thats about all there is to the shaker creed and thats enough to keep us all busy sue ran in from the porch excitedly and caught her mothers hand the cows have all gone into the barn she chattered and the shaker gentlemen are milking them and not one of them is shaking the least bit for i specially noticed and i looked in through the porch window and there is nice supper on a table bread and butter and milk and dried apple sauce and gingerbread and cottage cheese is it for us mardie susannas lip was trembling and her face was pale she lifted her swimming eyes to the sisters and asked is it for us eldress abby yee its for you she answered theres always a shaker supper on the table for all who want to leave the husks and share the feast come right in and help yourselves i will sit down with you supper was over and susanna and sue were lying in a little upper chamber under the stars it was the very one that susanna had slept in as a child or that she had been put to bed in for there was little sleep that night for any one she had leaned on the windowsill with her mother and watched the pillar of flame and smoke ascend from the burning barn and once in the early morning she had stolen out of bed and kneeling by the open window had watched the two silent shaker brothers who were guarding the smouldering ruins fearful lest the wind should rise and bear any spark to the roofs of the precious buildings they had labored so hard to save the chamber was spotless and devoid of ornament the paint was robins egg blue and of a satin gloss the shining floor was of the same color and neat braided rugs covered exposed places near the bureau washstand and bed various useful articles of shaker manufacture interested sue greatly the exquisite strawwork that covered the whiskbroom the mendingbasket pincushion needlebook spooland watchcases hairreceivers pintrays might all have been put together by fairy fingers sues prayers had been fervent but a trifle disjointed covering all subjects from jack and fardie to grandma in heaven and aunt louisa at the farm with special references to elderess abby and the shaker cows and petitions that the next day be fair so that she could see them milked excitement at her strange unaccustomed surroundings had put the childs mind in a very whirl and she had astonished her mother with a very new and disturbing version of the lords prayer ending god give us our debts and help us to forget our debtors and theirs shall be the glory amen now she lay quietly on the wall side of the clean narrow bed while her mother listened to hear the regular breathing that would mean that she was off for the land of dreams the childs sleep would leave the mother free to slip out of bed and look at the stars free to pray and long and wonder and suffer and repent not wholly but in part for she was really at peace in all but the innermost citadel of her conscience she had left her husband and for the moment at all events she was fiercely glad but she had left her boy and jack was only ten jack was not the helpless clinging sort he was a little piece of his father and his favorite aunt louisa would surely take him and jack would scarcely feel the difference for he had never shown any special affection for anybody still he was her child nobody could possibly get around that fact and it was a stumblingblock in the way of forgetfulness or ease of mind oh but for that what unspeakable content she could feel in this quiet haven this selfrespecting solitude to have her thoughts her emotions her words her self to herself once more as she had had them before she was married at seventeen to go to sleep in peace without listening for a step she had once heard with gladness but that now sometimes stumbled unsteadily on the stair or to dream as happy women dreamed without being roused by the voice of the present john a voice so different from that of the past john that it made the heart ache to listen to it sues voice broke the stillness how long are we going to stay here mardie i dont know sue i think perhaps as long as theyll let us will fardie come and see us i dont expect him wholl take care of jack mardie your aunt louisa shell scold him awfully but he never cries he just says pooh what do i care oh i forgot to pray for that very nicest shaker gentleman that said hed let me help him feed the calves had nt i better get out of bed and do it id specially like to very well sue and then go to sleep safely in bed again there was a long pause and then the eager little voice began wholl take care of fardie now hes a big man he does nt need anybody what if hes sick we must go back to him i suppose tomorrow s sunday what if he needs us tomorrow mardie i dont know i dont know oh sue sue dont ask your wretched mother any more questions for she cannot bear them tonight cuddle up close to her love her and forgive her and help her to know whats right ii a son of adam when susanna nelson at seventeen married john hathaway she had the usual cogent reasons for so doing with some rather more unusual ones added thereto she was alone in the world and her life with an uncle her mothers only relative was an unhappy one no assistance in the household tasks that she had ever been able to render made her a welcome member of the family or kept her from feeling a burden and she belonged no more to the little circle at seventeen than she did when she became a part of it at twelve the hope of being independent and earning her own living had sustained her through the last year but it was a very timid selfdistrustful lovestarved little heart that john hathaway stormed and carried by assault her girls life in a country school and her uncles very rigid and orthodox home had been devoid of emotion or experience still her mother had early sown seeds in her mind and spirit that even in the most arid soil were certain to flower into beauty when the time for flowering came and intellectually susanna was the clever daughter of clever parents she was very immature because after early childhood her environment had not been favorable to her development at seventeen she began to dream of a future as bright as the past had been dreary and uneventful visions of happiness of goodness and of service haunted her and sometimes gleaming through the mists of dawning womanhood the figure all luminous of the man when john hathaway appeared on the horizon she promptly clothed him in all the beautiful garments of her dreams they were a grotesque misfit but when we intimate that women have confused the dream and the reality before and may even do so again we make the only possible excuse for poor little susanna nelson john hathaway was the very image of the outer world that lay beyond susannas village he was a fairly prosperous genial handsome young merchant who looked upon life as a place furnished by providence in which to have a good time his parents had frequently told him that it was expedient for him to settle down and he supposed that he might finally do so if he should ever find a girl who would tempt him to relinquish his liberty the line that divides liberty and license was a little vague to john hathaway it is curious that he should not have chosen for his lifepartner some thoughtless rosy romping young person whose highest conception of connubial happiness would have been to drive twenty miles to the seashore on a sunday and having partaken of all the seasons delicacies solid and liquid to come home hilarious by moonlight that however is not the way the little loveimps do their work in the world or is it possible that they are not imps at all who provoke and stimulate and arrange these strange marriages not imps but honest chastening little characterbuilders in any event the moment that john hathaway first beheld susanna nelson was the moment of his surrender yet the wooing was as incomprehensible as that of a fragile dainty little hummingbird by a pompous greedy bigbreasted robin susanna was like a new england anemone her face was oval in shape and as smooth and pale as a pearl her hair was dark not very heavy and as soft as a childs her lips were delicate and sensitive her eyes a cool gray clear steady and shaded by darker lashes when john hathaway met her shy maidenly glance and heard her pretty dovelike voice it is strange he did not see that there was a bit too much saint in her to make her a willing comrade of his gay roistering life but as a matter of fact john hathaway saw nothing at all nothing but that susanna nelson was a lovely girl and he wanted her for his own the type was one he had never met before one that allured him by its mysteries and piqued him by its shy aloofness john had a way with him a way that speedily won susanna and after all there was a best to him as well as a worst he had a twinkling eye an infectious laugh a sweet disposition and while he was oversusceptible to the charm of a pretty face he had a chivalrous admiration for all women coupled it must be confessed with a decided lack of discrimination in values his boyish lightheartedness had a charm for everybody including susanna a charm that lasted until she discovered that his heart was light not only when it ought to be light but when it ought to be heavy he was very much in love with her but there was nothing particularly exclusive unique individual or interesting about his passion at that time it was of the everyday sort which carries a wellmeaning man to the altar and sometimes in cases of exceptional fervor and duration even a little farther stock sizes of this article are common and inexpensive and john hathaways love when he married susanna was judged by the highest standards about as trivial an affair as cupid ever put upon the market or a man ever offered to a woman susanna on the same day offered john or the wooden idol she was worshiping as john her whole self mind body heart and spirit so the couple were united and smilingly signed the marriageregister a rite by which their love for each other was supposed to be made eternal will you love me said he will you love me said she then they answered together through foul and fair weather from sunrise to moonrise from moonrise to sunrise by heath and by harbour in orchard or arbour in the time of the rose in the time of the snows through smoke and through smother well love one another cinderella when the loverprince discovers her and fits the crystal slipper to her foot makes short work of flinging away her rags and in some such pretty airy unthinking way did susanna fling aside the dullness inhospitality and ugliness of her uncles home and depart in a cloud of glory on her wedding journey she had been lonely now she would have companionship she had been of no consequence now she would be queen of her own small domain she had been last with everybody now she would be first with one at least she had worked hard and received neither compensation nor gratitude henceforward her service would be gladly rendered at an altar where votive offerings would not be taken as a matter of course she was only a slip of a girl now marriage and housewifely cares would make her a woman some time perhaps the last great experience of life would come to her and then what a crown of joys would be hers love husband home children what a vision it was and how soon the chief glory of it faded never were two beings more hopelessly unlike than john hathaway single and john hathaway married but the bliss lasted a few years nevertheless partly because susannas charm was deep and penetrating the sort to hold a false man for a time and a true man forever partly because she tried as a girl or woman has seldom tried before to do her duty and to keep her own ideal unshattered john had always been convivial but susanna at seventeen had been at once too innocent and too ignorant to judge a mans tendencies truly or to rate his character at its real worth as time went on his earlier leanings grew more definite he spent on pleasure far more than he could afford and his conduct became a byword in the neighborhood his boy he loved he felt on a level with jack could understand him play with him punish him and make friends with him but little sue was different she always seemed to him the concentrated essence of her mothers soul and when unhappy days came he never looked in her radiant searching eyes without a consciousness of inferiority the little creature had loved her jolly handsome careless father at first even though she feared him but of late she had grown shy silent and timid for his indifference chilled her and she flung herself upon her mothers love with an almost unchildlike intensity this unhappy relation between the child and the father gave susannas heart new pangs she still loved her husband not dearly but a good deal and over and above that remnant of the old love which still endured she gave him unstinted care and hopeful maternal tenderness the crash came in course of time john transcended the bounds of his wifes patience more and more she made her last protests then she took one passionate day to make up her mind a day when john and the boy were away together a day of complete revolt against everything she was facing in the present and so far as she could see everything that she had to face in the future prayer for light left her in darkness and she had no human creature to advise her conscience was overthrown she could see no duty save to her own outraged personality often and often during the year just past she had thought of the peace the grateful solitude and shelter of that shaker settlement hidden among new england orchards that quiet haven where there was neither marrying nor giving in marriage now her bruised heart longed for such a life of nunlike simplicity and consecration where men and women met only as brothers and sisters where they worked side by side with no thought of personal passion or personal gain but only for the common good of the community albion village was less than three hours distant by train she hastily gathered her plainest clothes and sues packed them in a small trunk took her mothers watch her own little store of money and the twentydollar gold piece johns senior partner had given sue on her last birthday wrote a letter of goodbye to john and went out of her cottage gate in a storm of feeling so tumultuous that there was no room for reflection besides she had reflected and reflected for months and months so she would have said and the time had come for action susanna was not unlettered but she certainly had never read meredith or she would have learned that love is an affair of two and only for two that can be as quick as constant in intercommunication as are sun and earth through the cloud or face to face they take their breath of life from each other in signs of affection proofs of faithfulness incentives to admiration but a solitary soul dragging a log must make the log a god to rejoice in the burden the demigod that poor blind susanna married had vanished and she could drag the log no longer but she made one mistake in judging her husband in that she regarded him at thirtytwo as a finished product a man who was finally this and that and behaved thus and so and would never be any different the age of discretion is a movable feast of extraordinary uncertainty and john hathaway was a little behindhand in overtaking it as a matter of fact he had never for an instant looked life squarely in the face he took a casual glance at it now and then after he was married but it presented no very distinguishable features nothing to make him stop and think nothing to arouse in him any special sense of responsibility boys have a way of growing up however sooner or later at least most of them have and that possibility was not sufficiently in the foreground of susannas mind when she finished what she considered an exhaustive study of her husbands character i am leaving you john she wrote to see if i can keep the little love i have left for you as the father of my children i seem to have lost all the rest of it living with you i am not perfectly sure that i am right in going for everybody seems to think that women mothers especially should bear anything rather than desert the home i could not take jack away for you love him and he will be a comfort to you a comfort to you yes but what will you be to him now that he is growing older that is the thought that troubles me yet i dare not take him with me when he is half yours you will not miss me nor will the loss of sue make any difference oh john how can you help loving that blessed little creature so much better and so much more gifted than either of us that we can only wonder how we came to be her father and mother your sin against her is greater than that against me for at least you are not responsible for bringing me into the world i know louisa will take care of jack and she lives so near that you can see him as often as you wish i shall let her know my address which i have asked her to keep to herself she will write to me if you or jack should be seriously ill but not for any other reason as for you there is nothing more that i can say except to confess freely that i was not the right wife for you and that mine was not the only mistake i have tried my very best to meet you in everything that was not absolutely wrong and i have used all the arguments i could think of but it only made matters worse i thought i knew you john in the old days how comes it that we have traveled so far apart we who began together it seems to me that some time you must come to your senses and take up your life seriously for this is not life the sorry thing you have lived lately but i cannot wait any longer i am tired tired tired of waiting and hoping too tired to do anything but drag myself away from the sight of your folly you have wasted our childrens substance indulged your appetites until you have lost the respect of your best friends and you have made me who was your choice your wife the head of your house the woman who brought your children into the world you have made me an object of pity a poor neglected thing who could not meet her neighbors eyes without blushing when jack and his father returned from their outing at eight oclock in the evening having had supper at a wayside hotel the boy went to bed philosophically lighting his lamp for himself the conclusion being that the two other members of the household were a little late but would be in presently the next morning was bright and fair jack waked at cockcrow and after calling to his mother and sue jumped out of bed ran into their rooms to find them empty then bounced down the stairs two at a time going through the sittingroom on his way to find ellen in the kitchen his father was sitting at the table with the stilllighted student lamp on it the table where lessons had been learned books read stories told mending done checkers and dominoes played the big round walnut table that was the focus of the family life but mothers table not fathers john hathaway had never left his chair nor taken off his hat his cane leaned against his knee his gloves were in his left hand while the right held susannas letter he was asleep although his lips twitched and he stirred uneasily his face was haggard and behind his closed lids somewhere in the center of thought and memory a train of fiery words burned in an everwidening circle round and round and round ploughing searing their way through some obscure part of him that had heretofore been without feeling but was now all quick and alive with sensation you have made me who was your choice your wife the head of your house the woman who brought your children into the world you have made me an object of pity a poor neglected thing who could not meet her neighbors eyes without blushing any one who wished to pierce john hathaways armor at that period of his life would have had to use a very sharp and pointed arrow for he was well wadded with the belief that a man has a right to do what he likes susannas shaft was tipped with truth and dipped in the blood of her outraged heart the storedup force of silent years went into the speeding of it she had never shot an arrow before and her skill was instinctive rather than scientific but the powers were on her side and she aimed better than she knew those who took note of john hathaways behavior that summer would have testified willingly to that it was the summer in which his boyish irresponsibility slipped away from him once and for all a summer in which the face of life ceased to be an indistinguishable mass of meaningless events and disclosed an order a reason a purpose hitherto unseen and undefined the boy grew up rather tardily it must be confessed his soul had not added a cubit to its stature in sunshine gayety and prosperity it took the shock of grief hurt pride solitude and remorse to make a man of john hathaway iii divers doctrines it was a radiant july morning in albion village and when sue first beheld it from the bedroom window at the shaker settlement she had wished ardently that it might never never grow dark and that jack and fardie might be having the very same sunshine in farnham it was not noon yet but experience had in some way tempered the completeness of her joy for the marks of tears were on her pretty little face she had neither been scolded nor punished but she had been dragged away from a delicious play without any adequate reason she had disappeared after breakfast while susanna was helping sister tabitha with the beds and the dishes but as she was the most docile of children her mother never thought of anxiety at nine oclock eldress abby took susanna to the laundry house and there under a spreading maple were sue and the two youngest little shakeresses children of seven and eight respectively sue was directing the plays chattering planning ordering and suggesting expedients to her slowerminded and less experienced companions they had dragged a large box from one of the sheds and set it up under the tree the interior had been quickly converted into a commodious residence one not in the least of a shaker type small bluingboxes served for bedstead and diningtable bits of broken china for the dishes while tiny flat stones were the seats and four clothespins tastefully clad in handkerchiefs surrounded the table do they kneel in prayer before they eat as all believers do asked shaker mary i dont believe adam and eve was believers cause who would have taught them to be replied sue still we might let them pray anyway though clothespins dont kneel nicely ive got another one all dressed said little shaker jane we cant have any more adam and eve did nt have only two children in my sundayschool lesson cain and abel objected sue cant this one be a company pleaded mary anxious not to waste the clothespin but where could compny come from queried sue there was nt any more people anywheres but just adam and eve and cain and abel put the clothespin in your apronpocket jane and bimeby well let eve have a little new baby and ill get mardie to name it right out of the bible now lets begin adam is awfully tired this morning he says eve ive been workin all night and i cant eat my breakfuss now mary you be cain hes a little boy and you must say fardie play a little with me please and fardie will say childen should nt talk at the what subjects of conversation would have been aired at the adamic family board before breakfast was finished will never be known for eldress abby with a firm but not unkind grasp took shaker jane and mary by their little hands and said mornings not the time for play run over to sister martha and help her shell the peas then therell be your seams to oversew sue watched the disappearing children and saw the fabric of her dream fade into thin air but she was a person of considerable individuality for her years her lip quivered tears rushed to her eyes and flowed silently down her cheeks but without a glance at eldress abby or a word of comment she walked slowly away from the laundry her chin high sue meant all right she was only playing the plays of the world said eldress abby but you can well understand susanna that we cant let our shaker children play that way and get wrong ideas into their heads at the beginning we dont condenm an honest orderly marriage as a worldly institution but we claim it has no place in christs kingdom therefore we leave it to the world where it belongs the worlds people live on the lower plane of adam the shakers try to live on the christ plane in virgin purity longsuffering meekness and patience i see i know susanna answered slowly with a little glance at injured sue walking toward the house but we need nt leave the children unhappy this morning for i can think of a play that will comfort them and please you come back sue wait a minute mary and jane before you go to sister martha we will play the story that sister tabitha told us last week do you remember about mother ann lee in the english prison the soapbox will be her cell for it was so small she could not lie down in it take some of the shingles jane and close up the open side of the box do you see the large brown spot in one of them mary push that very hard with a clothespin and there ll be a hole through the shingle thats right now sister tabitha said that mother ann was kept for days without food for people thought she was a wicked dangerous woman and they would have been willing to let her die of starvation but there was a great keyhole in the door and james whittaker a boy of nineteen who loved mother ann and believed in her put the stem of a clay pipe in the hole and poured a mixture of wine and milk through it he managed to do this day after day so that when the jailer opened the cell door expecting to find mother ann dying for lack of food she walked out looking almost as strong and well as when she entered you can play it all out and afterwards you can make the ship that brought mother ann and the other shakers from liverpool to new york the clothespins can be who will they be jane william lee nancy lee james whittaker and i forget the others recited jane like an obedient parrot and it will be splendid to have james whittaker for he really came to albion said mary perhaps he stood on this very spot more than once mused abby it was mother anns vision that brought them to this land a vision of a large tree with outstretching branches every leaf of which shone with the brightness of a burning torch oh if the vision would only come true if believers would only come to us as many as the leaves on the tree she sighed as she and susanna moved away from the group of chattering children all as eager to play the history of shakerism as they had been to dramatize the family life of adam and eve there must be so many men and women without ties living useless lives with no aim or object in them susanna said i wonder that more of them do not find their way here the peace and goodness and helpfulness of the life sink straight into my heart the brothers and sisters are so friendly and cheery with one another there is neither gossip nor hard words there is pleasant work and your thoughts seem to be all so concentrated upon right living that it is like heaven below only i feel that the cross is there bravely as you all bear it there are roses on my cross most beautiful to see as i turn from all the dross from which it sets me free quoted eldress abby devoutly it is easy enough for me continued susanna for it was no cross for me to give up my husband at the time but oh if a woman had a considerate loving man to live with one who would strengthen her and help her to be good one who would protect and cherish her one who would be an example to his children and bring them up in the fear of the lord that would be heaven below too and how could she bear to give it all up when it seems so good so true so right might nt two people walk together to god if both chose the same path its my belief that one can find the road better alone than when somebody else is going alongside to distract them not that the lord is going to turn anybody away not even when they bring him a lot of burnedout trash for a gift said eldress abby bluntly but dont you believe he sees the difference between a person that comes to him when there is nowhere else to turn a person thats tried all and found it wanting and one that gives up freely pleasure and gain and husband and home to follow the christ life yes he must he must susanna answered faintly but the children eldress abby if you had nt any you could perhaps keep yourself from wanting them but if you had how could you give them up jesus was the great saviour of mankind but next to him it seems as if the children had been the little saviours from the time the first one was born until this very day yee ive no doubt they keep the worst of the worlds people those that are living in carnal marriage without a thought of godliness ive no doubt children keep that sort from going to the lowest perdition allowed eldress abby and those we bring up in the community make the best converts but to a shaker the greater the sacrifice the greater the glory i wish you was gathered in susanna for your hands and feet are quick to serve your face is turned toward the truth and your heart is all ready to receive the revelation i wish i need nt turn my back on one set of duties to take up another murmured susanna timidly yee no doubt you do your business is to find out which are the higher duties and then do those just make up your mind whether youd rather replenish earth as youve been doing or replenish heaven as were trying to do but i must go to my work ten oclock in the mornings a poor time to be discussing doctrine youre for weeding susanna i suppose brother ansel was seated at a grindstone under the apple trees teaching intermittently a couple of boys to grind a scythe when susanna came to her work in the herbgarden sue walking discreetly at her heels ansel was a slowmoving humorouslyinclined easygoing brother who was drifting into the kingdom of heaven without any special effort on his part id bout as lives be a shaker as anything else had been his rather dubious statement of faith when he requested admittance into the band of believers no more crosses accordin to my notion an considable more chance o crowns his experience of life on the adamic plane the holy estate of matrimony being the chief sin of this way of thought had disposed him to regard woman as an apparently necessary but not especially desirable being the theory of holding property in common had no terrors for him he was generous unambitious frugalminded somewhat lacking in energy and just as actively interested in his brothers welfare as in his own which is perhaps not saying much shakerism was to him not a craving of the spirit not a longing of the soul but a simple prudent theory of existence lessening the various risks that man is exposed to in his journey through this vale of tears womenfolks makes splendid shakers he was wont to say theyre all right as sisters cause their belief makes em safe it kind o shears em o their strength tames their sperits takes the sting out of em an keeps em from bein sassy an domineerin jest as long as they think marriage is right theyll marry ye spite of anything ye can do or say four of em married my father one after another though he fit em off as hard as he knew how but if ye can once get the faith o mother ann into em theyre as good afterwards as they was wicked afore theres no stoppin womenfolks once ye get em started they dont keer whether its heaven or the other place so long as they get where they want to go elder daniel gray had heard brother ansel state his religious theories more than once when he was first gathered in and secretly lamented the lack of spirituality in the new convert the elder was an instrument more finely attuned sober humble pureminded zealous consecrated to the truth as he saw it he labored in and out of season for the faith he held so dear yet as the years went on he noted that ansel notwithstanding his eccentric views lived an honest temperate godfearing life talking no scandal dwelling in unity with his brethren and sisters and upholding the banner of shakerism in his own peculiar way as susanna approached him ansel called out the yairbs are all ready for ye susanna the weeds have been on the rampage sence yesterdays rain seems like the more uselesser a thing is the more it flourishes the yairbs grow oh yes they make out to grow but you dont see em come leapin an tearin out o the airth like weeds then theres the birds ive jest been stoppin my grindin to look at em carry on take em all in all there aint nothin so lazy an aimless an busyboutnothin as birds they go kitin roun from tree to tree hoppin an chirpin flyin here an there thout no airthly objeck ceptin to fly back agin theres a heap o useless critters in the univarse but i guess birds are bout the uselessest less its grasshoppers mebbe i dont care what you say about the grasshoppers ansel but you shant abuse the birds said susanna stooping over the beds of tansy and sage thyme and summer savory weeds or no weeds were going to have a great crop of herbs this year ansel yee so we be we sowed moren usual sos to keep the two jiners at work longs we could take that scythe over to the barn jacob an fetch me another an step spry whats a jiner ansel winter shakers i call em theyre reglar constitooshanal dyedinthewool jiners jinin most anything an hookin on most anywheres they jine when it comes on too cold to sleep outdoors an they onjine when it comes on spring elder grays always hopin to gather in new souls so he gives the best of em a few months trial how are ye hannah he called to a sister passing through the orchard to search for any possible green apples under the trees make us a good oldfashioned deepdish pandowdy an well all do our best to eat it i suppose the jiners get discouraged and fear they cant keep up to the standard not everybody is good enough to lead a selfdenying shaker life said susanna pushing back the close sunbonnet from her warm face which had grown younger smoother and sweeter in the last few weeks nay i spose likely less theyre same as me a born shaker ansel replied i dont hanker after strong drink dont like tobaccer always could keep my temper thout smokin aint particlar bout meateatin dont keer bout heapin up riches cant stand the ways o worldly womenfolks jest as lives confess my sins to the elder as not cause i haint sinned any to amount to anything sence i made my first confession there i be a natural follerer o mother ann lee susanna drew her shaker bonnet forward over her eyes and turned her back to brother ansel under the pretense of reaching over to the rows of sweet marjoram she had never supposed it possible that she could laugh again and indeed she seldom felt like it but ansels interpretations of shaker doctrine were almost too much for her latent sense of humor what are you smiling at and me so sad mardie quavered sue piteously from the little plot of easy weeding her mother had given her to do i keep remembering my game it was such a christian game too lots nicer than mother ann in prison for jane said her mother and father was both believers and nobody was good enough to pour milk through the keyhole but her i wanted to give the clothespins story names like hilda and percy but i called them adam and eve and cain and abel just because i thought the shakers would specially like a bible play i love elderess abby but she does stop my happiness mardie thats the second time today for she took moses away from me when i was kissing him because he pinched his thumb in the window why did you do that sue remonstrated her mother softly remembering ansels proximity you never used to kiss strange little boys at home in farnham moses is nt a boy hes only six and thats a baby besides i like him better than any little boys at home and thats the reason i kissed him theres no harm in boykissing is there mardie you dont know anybody here very well yet not well enough to kiss them susanna answered rather hopeless as to the best way of inculcating the undesirability of the adamic plane of thought at this early age while we stay here sue we ought both to be very careful to do exactly as the shakers do by this time mother and child had reached the orchard end of a row and brother ansel was thirstily waiting to deliver a little more of the information with which his mind was always teeming them boston people that come over to our public meetin last sunday he began they was dretful scairt bout what would become o the human race if it should all turn shakers i guess you need nt worry i says itll take considable of a spell to convert all you city folks i says an after all what if the world should come to an end i says if half we hear is true bout the way folks carry on in new york and chicago its bout time it stopped i says an i guess the lord could

much to give up brother ansel susanna asked bouts much as any sinner ever had that jined this community replied ansel complacently the list o what i consecrated to this society when i was gathered in was one horse one wagon one twoyearold heifer one axe one saddle one padlock one bed and bedding four turkeys eleven hens one pair o ploughirons two chains and eleven dollars in cash can you beat that oh yes things said susanna absentmindedly i was thinking of family and friends pleasures and memories and ambitions and hopes i guess it dont pinch you any worse to give up a hope than it would a good twoyearold heifer retorted ansel but there you cant never tell what folksll hang on to the hardest the man that drove them boston folks over here last sunday did you notice him the one that had the sister with a bright red dress an hat on land i could think just how hell must look whenever my eye lighted on that girls gitup well i done my best to exhort that driver bein as how we had a good

mornin an put the cat in the shed nights iv louisas mind louisa otherwise mrs adlai banks the elder sister of susanna s husband was a rockribbed widow of fortyfive summers fortyfive winters would seem a better phrase in which to assert her age who resided on a small farm twenty miles from the manufacturing town of farnham when the fates were bestowing qualities of mind and heart upon the hathaway babies they gave the more graceful genial likable ones to john not realizing perhaps what bad use he would make of them and endowed louisa with great deposits of honesty sincerity energy piety and frugality all so mysteriously compounded that they turned to granite in her hands if she had been consulted it would have been all the same she would never have accepted johns charm of personality at the expense of being saddled with his weaknesses and he would not have taken her castiron virtues at any price whatsoever she was sweeping her porch on that day in may when susanna and sue had wakened in the bare upper chamber at the shaker settlement sue cleareyed jubilant expectant unafraid susanna pale from her fitful sleep weary with the burden of her heart looking down the road mrs banks espied the form of her brother john walking in her direction and leading jack by the hand this was a most unusual sight for johns calls had been uncommonly few of late years since a man rarely visits a lady relative for the mere purpose of hearing a piece of her mind this piece large solid highly flavored with pepper and as acid as mental vinegar could make it was louisa bankss only contribution to conversation when she met her brother she could not stop for any airy persiflage about weather crops or politics when her one desire was to tell him what she thought of him goodmorning louisa shake hands with your aunt jack he cant till im through sweeping goodmorning john what brings you here john sat down on the steps and jack flew to the barn where there was generally an amiable hired man and a cheerful cow both infinitely better company than his highly respected and wealthy aunt i came because i had to bring the boy to the only relation ive got in the world john answered tersely my wifes left me well shes been a great while doing it remarked louisa digging her broom into the cracks of the piazza floor and making no pause for reflection if she had nt had the patience of job and the meekness of moses shed have gone long before whered she go i dont know she did nt say did you take the trouble to look through the house for her i aint certain you fairly know her by sight nowadays do you john flushed crimson but bit his lip in an attempt to keep his temper she left a letter he said and she took sue with her that was all right sues a nervous little thing and needs at least one parent she has nt been used to more so she wont miss anything jacks like most of the hathaways hell grow up his own way without anybodys help or hindrance what are you going to do with him leave him with you of course what else could i do very well ill take him and while im about it id like to give you a piece of my mind john was fighting for selfcontrol but he was too wretched and remorseful for rage to have any real sway over him is it the same old piece or a different one he asked setting his teeth grimly i should nt think youd have any mind left youve given so many pieces of it to me already i have some left and plenty too answered louisa dashing into the house banging the broom into a corner coming out again like a breeze and slamming the door behind her you can leave the boy here and welcome ill take good care of him and if you dont send me twenty dollars a month for his food and clothes ill turn him outdoors the more responsibility other folks rid you of the more youll let em and i wont take a feathers weight off you for fear youll sink into everlasting perdition i did nt expect any sympathy from you said john drearily pulling himself up from the steps and leaning against the honeysuckle trellis susannas just the same women are all as hard as the nether millstone theyre hard if theyre angels and hard if theyre devils it docs nt make much difference i guess youve found a few soft ones if report says true returned louisa bluntly youd better go and get some of their sympathy the kind you can buy and pay for the way youve ruined your life turns me fairly sick you had a good father and mother good education and advantages enough money to start you in business the best of wives and two children any man could be proud of one of em especially youve thrown em all away and what for horses and cards and gay company late suppers with wine and for aught i know whiskey you the son of a man who did nt know the taste of ginger beer youve spent your days and nights with a pack of carousing men and women that would take your last cent and not leave you enough for honest burial its a pity we did nt make a traveling preacher of you exclaimed john bitterly lord almighty i wonder how such women as you can live in the world you know so little about it and so little about men i know all i want to about em retorted louisa and precious little thats good they re a gluttonous selfindulgent extravagant reckless pleasureloving lot my husband was one of the best of em and he would nt have amounted to a hill of beans if i had nt devoted fifteen years to disciplining uplifting and strengthening him you managed to strengthen him so that he died before he was fifty it dont matter when a man dies said the remorseless mrs banks if hes succeeded in living a decent godfearing life as for you john hathaway ill tell you the truth if you are my brother for susannas too much of a saint to speak out dont be afraid susannas spoken out at last plainly enough to please even you im glad of it for i did nt suppose she had spunk enough to resent anything i shall be sorry tomorrow s likely as not for freeing my mind as much as i have but my tempers up and im going to be the humble instrument of providence and try to turn you from the error of your ways youve defaced and degraded the temple the lord built for you and if he should come this minute and try to turn out the crowd of evildoers youve kept in it i doubt if he could i hope hell approve of the way youve used your temple said john with stinging emphasis i should nt want to live in such a noisy one myself id rather be a bat in a belfry goodbye ive had a pleasant call as usual and youve been a real sister to me in my trouble you shall have the twenty dollars a month jacks clothes are in that valise and therell be a trunk tomorrow susanna said shed write and let you know her whereabouts so saying john hathaway strode down the path closed the gate behind him and walked rapidly along the road that led to the station it was a quiet road and he met few persons he had neither dressed nor shaved since the day before his face was haggard his heart was like a lump of lead in his breast of what use to go to the empty house in farnham when he could stifle his misery by a night with his friends no he could not do that either the very thought of them brought a sense of satiety and disgust the craving for what they would give him would come again in time no doubt but for the moment he was sick to the very soul of all they stood for the feeling of complete helplessness of desertion of being alone in midocean without a sail or a star in sight mounted and swept over him susanna had been his sail his star although he had never fully realized it and he had cut himself adrift from her pure steadfast love blinding himself with cheap and vulgar charms the next train to farnham was not due for an hour his steps faltered he turned into a clump of trees by the wayside and flung himself on the ground to cry like a child he who had not shed a tear since he was a boy of ten if susanna could have seen that often longedfor burst of despair and remorse that sudden recognition of his sins against himself and her that gush of penitent tears her heart might have softened once again a flicker of flame might have lighted the ashes of her dying love she might have taken his head on her shoulder and said never mind john lets forget and begin all over again matters did not look any brighter for john the next week for his senior partner joel atterbury requested him to withdraw from the firm as soon as matters could be legally arranged he was told that he had not been doing nor earning his share that his way of living during the year just past had not been any credit to the concern and that he atterbury sympathized too heartily with mrs john hathaway to take any pleasure in doing business with mr john johns remnant of pride completely humbled by this last withdrawal of confidence would not suffer him to tell atterbury that he had come to his senses and bidden farewell to the old life or so he hoped and believed to lose a wife and child in a way infinitely worse than death to hear the unwelcome truth that as a husband you have grown so offensive as to be beyond endurance to have your own sister tell you that you richly deserve such treatment to be virtually dismissed from a valuable business connection all this is enough to sober any man above the grade of a moral idiot and john was not that he was simply a selfindulgent pleasureloving thoughtless willful fellow without any great amount of principle he took his medicine however said nothing and did his share of the business from day to day doggedly keeping away from his partner as much as possible ellen the faithful maid of all work stayed on with him at the old home jack wrote to him every week and often came to spend sunday with him aunt louisas real good to me he told his father but shes not like mother seems to me mothers kind of selfish staying away from us so long when do you expect her back i dont know not before winter im afraid and dont call her selfish i wont have it your mother never knew she had a self if shed only left sue behind we could have had more good times we three together no our family is four jack and we can never have any good times one two or three of us because were four when ones away whichever it is its wrong but its the worst when its mother does your aunt louisa write to her yes sometimes but she never lets me post the letters do you write to your mother you ought to you know even if you dont have time for me you could ask your aunt to enclose your letters in hers do you write to her father yes i write twice a week john answered thinking drearily of the semiweekly notes posted in susannas empty worktable upstairs would she ever read them he doubted it unless he died and she came back to settle his affairs but of course he would nt die no such good luck would a man die who breakfasted at eight dined at one supped at six and went to bed at ten would a man die who worked in the garden an hour every afternoon with half a day saturday that being the task most disagreeable to him and most appropriate therefore for penance susanna loved flowers and had always wanted a garden but john had been too much occupied with his own concerns to give her the needed help or money so that she could carry out her plans the last year she had lost heart in many ways so that little or nothing had been accomplished of all she had dreamed it would have been laughable had it not been pathetic to see john hathaway dig delve grub sow water weed transplant generally at the wrong moment in that dreamgarden of susannas he asked no advice and read no books with feverish intensity with complete ignorance of natures laws and small sympathy with their intricacies he dug hoed raked fertilized and planted during that lonely summer his absentmindedness caused some expensive failures as when the wide expanse of susannas drying ground which was to be velvety lawn came up curly lettuce but he rooted out his frequent mistakes and patiently planted seeds or roots or bulbs over and over and over and over until something sprouted in his beds whether it was what he intended or not while he weeded the brilliant orange nasturtiums growing beside the magenta portulacca in a friendly proximity that certainly would never have existed had the mistress of the house been the headgardener he thought of nothing but his wife he knew her pride her reserve her sensitive spirit he knew her love of truth and honor and purity the standards of life and conduct she had tried to hold him to so valiantly and which he had so dragged in the dust during the blindness and the insanity of the last two years he john hathaway was a deserted husband susanna had crept away all wounded and resentful where was she living and how supporting herself and sue when she could not have had a hundred dollars in the world probably louisa was the source of income conscientious infernally disagreeable louisa would yet the rumor of his changed habit o life reach her by some means in her place of hiding sooner or later would she not yearn for a sight of jack would she not finally give him a chance to ask forgiveness or had she lost every trace of affection for him as her letter seemed to imply he walked the garden paths with these and other unanswerable questions and when he went to his lonely room at night he held the lamp up to a bit of poetry that he had cut from a magazine and pinned to the lookingglass if john hathaway could be brought to the reading of poetry he might even glance at the bible in course of time louisa would have said it was in may that susanna had gone and the first line of verse held his attention may comes day comes one who was away comes all the earth is glad again kind and fair to me may comes day comes one who was away comes set her place at hearth and board as it used to be may comes day comes one who was away comes higher are the hills of home bluer is the sea the hathaway house was in the suburbs on a rise of ground and as john turned to the window he saw the full moon hanging yellow in the sky it shone on the verdant slopes and low wooded hills that surrounded the town and cast a glittering pathway on the ocean that bathed the beaches of the nearby shore how long shall i have to wait he wondered before my hills of home look higher and my sea bluer because susanna has come back to hearth and board v the little quail bird susanna had helped at various household tasks ever since her arrival at the settlement for there was no room for drones in the shaker hive but after a few weeks in the kitchen with martha the herbgarden had been assigned to her as her particular province the sisters thinking her better fitted for it than for the preserving and pickling of fruit or the basketweaving that needed special apprenticeship the shakers were the first people to raise put up and sell garden seeds in our presentday fashion and it was they too who began the preparation of botanical medicines raising gathering drying and preparing herbs and roots for market and this industry driven from the field by modern machinery was still a valuable source of income in susannas day plants had always grown for susanna and she loved them like friends humoring their weakness nourishing their strength stimulating coaxing disciplining them until they could do no less than flourish under her kind and hopeful hand oh that sweet honest comforting little garden of herbs with its wholesome fragrances healing lay in every root and stem in every leaf and bud and the strong aromatic odors stimulated her flagging spirit or her aching head after the sleepless nights in which she tried to decide her future life and sues the plants were set out in neat rows and clumps and she soon learned to know the strange ones chamomile lobelia bloodroot wormwood lovage boneset lemon and sweet balm lavender and rue as well as she knew the old acquaintances familiar to every countrybred child pennyroyal peppermint or spearmint yellow dock and thoroughwort there was hoeing and weeding before the gathering and drying came then brother calvin who had charge of the great press would moisten the dried herbs and press them into quarterand halfpound cakes ready for sister martha who would superintend the younger shakeresses in papering and labeling them for the market last of all when harvesting was over brother ansel would mount the newly painted seedcart and leave on his driving trip through the country ansel was a capital salesman but brother issachar who once took his place and sold almost nothing brought home a lad on the seedcart who afterward became a shining light in the community thus said elder gray does god teach us the diversity of gifts whereby all may be unashamed if the albion shakers were honest and ardent in faith susanna thought that their works would indeed bear the strictest examination the brothers made brooms floor and dishmops tubs pails and churns and indeed almost every trade was represented in the various new england communities physicians there were a few but no lawyers sheriffs policemen constables or soldiers just as there were no courts or saloons or jails where there was perfect equality of possession and no private source of gain it amazed susanna to see the cheery labor often continued late at night from the sheer joy of it and the earnest desire to make the settlement prosperous while the brothers were hammering nailing planing sawing ploughing and seeding the sisters were carding and spinning cotton wool and flax making kerchiefs of linen straw shaker bonnets and dozens of other useful marketable things not forgetting their famous shaker apple sauce was there ever such a busy summer susanna wondered yet with all the early rising constant labor and simple fare she was stronger and hardier than she had been for years the shaker palate was never tickled with delicacies yet the food was well cooked and sufficiently varied at first there had been the winter vegetables squash yellow turnips beets and parsnips with once a week a special shaker dinner of salt codfish potatoes onions and milk gravy each sister served her turn as cook but all alike had a wonderful hand with flour and the wholewheat bread cookies ginger cake and milk puddings were marvels of lightness martha in particular could wean the novitiate shaker from a too riotous devotion to meateating better than most people for every dish she sent to the table was delicate savory and attractive dear patient devoted martha how susanna learned to love her as they worked together in the big sunny shining kitchen where the cookingstove as well as every tin plate and pan and spoon might have served as a mirror martha had joined the society in her mothers arms being given up to the lord and placed in the childrens order before she was one year old if you should unite with us susanna she said one night after the early supper when they were peeling apples together youd be thankful you begun early with your little sue for shes got a natural attraction to the world and for it not but that shes a tender loving obedient little soul but when shes among the other young ones theres a flyaway look about her that makes her seem more like a fairy than a child shes having rather a hard time learning shaker ways but shell do better in time sighed her mother she came to me of her own accord yesterday and asked bettent i have my curls cut off mardie i never put that idea into her head martha interrupted shes a visitor and can wear her hair as shes been brought up to wear it i know but i fear sue was moved by other than religious reasons i get up so early mardie she said and it takes so long to unsnarl and untangle me and i get so hot when im helping in the hayfield and then i have to be curled for dinner and curled again for supper and so it seems like wasting both our times her hair would be all the stronger for cutting i thought as its so long for her age but i could nt put the shears to it when the time came martha i had to take her to eldress abby she sat up in front of the little lookingglass as still as a mouse while the curls came off but when the last one fell into abbys apron she suddenly put her hands over her face and cried oh mardie we shall never be the same togedder you and i after this she seemed to see her little past her childhood slipping away from her all in an instant i did nt let her know that i cried over the box of curls last night you did wrong rebuked martha you should nt make an idol of your child or your childs beauty you dont think god might put beauty into the world just to give his children joy martha martha was no controversialist she had taken her opinions readymade from those she considered her superiors and although she was willing to make any sacrifice for her religion she did not wish to be confused by too many opposing theories of gods intentions you know i never argue when ive got anything baking she said and taking the spill of a cornbroom from a tabledrawer she opened the oven door and delicately plunged it into the loaf then gazing at the straw as she withdrew it she said you must talk doctrine with eldress abby susanna not with me but i guess doctrine wont help you so much as thinking out your life for yourself no one can sing my psalm for me reward must come from labor ill sow for peace and reap in truth gods mercy and his favor martha was the chief musician of the community and had composed many hymns and tunes some of them under circumstances that she believed might entitle them to be considered directly inspired her clear full voice filled the kitchen and floated out into the air after susanna as she called sue and darningbasket in hand walked across the road to the great barn the herbgarden was one place where she could think out her life although no decision had as yet been born of those thoughtful mornings another spot for meditation was the great barn relic of the wonderful earlier days and pride of the present settlement a hundred and seventyfive feet long and three and a half stories high it dominated the landscape first there was the cellar where all the refuse fell to do its duty later on in fertilizing the farm lands then came the first floor where the stalls for horses oxen and cows lined the walls on either side then came the second floor where hay was kept and to reach this a bridge forty feet long was built on stone piers ten feet in height sloping up from the ground to the second story over the easy slope of this bridge the full haycarts were driven to add their several burdens to the golden haymows high at the top was an enormous grain room where mounds of yellow cornears reached from floor to ceiling and at the back was a great window opening on massabesic pond and knights hill with the white mountains towering blue or snowcapped in the distance there was an oldfashioned listbottomed straightbacked shaker chair in front of the open window a chair as uncomfortable as shaker doctrines to the daughter of eve and there susanna often sat with her sewing or mending sue at her feet building castles out of corncobs plaiting the husks into little mats or taking out basting threads from her mothers work my head feels awfully undressed without my curls mardie she said im most afraid fardie wont like the looks of me do you think we ought to have asked him before we shingled me he does despise unpretty things so i think if we had asked him he would have said do as you think best he always says that when he does nt care what you do observed sue with one of her startling bursts of intuition sister martha has a printed card on the wall in the childrens diningroom and ive got to learn all the poetry on it because i need it worse than any of the others what we deem good order were willing to state eat hearty and decent and clear out your plate be thankful to heaven for what we receive and not make a mixture or compound to leave we often find left on the same china dish meat apple sauce pickle brown bread and minced fish anothers replenished with butter and cheese with pie cake and toast perhaps added to these you say it very nicely commended susanna theres more now if any virtue in this can be shown by peasant by lawyer or king on the throne we freely will forfeit whatever weve said and call it a virtue to waste meat and bread theres a great deal to learn when youre being a shaker sighed sue as she finished her rhyme theres a great deal to learn everywhere her mother answered what verse did eldress abby give you today for little tripping maids may follow god along the ways that saintly feet have trod quoted the child am i a tripping maid mardie she continued yes dear if i trip too much might nt i fall yes i suppose so is tripping the same as skipping about the same is it polite to tripanskip when youre following god it could nt be impolite if you meant to be good a tripping maid means just a young one what is a maid a little girl when a maid grows up what is she why shes a maiden i suppose when a maiden grows up what is she just a woman sue what is saintly feet feet like those of eldress abby or elder gray feet of people who have always tried to do right are brother ansels feet saintly hes a good kind hardworking man is good kind hardworking same as saintly well its not so very different perhaps now sue ive asked you before dont let your mind grope and your little tongue wag every instant it is nt good for you and it certainly is nt good for me all right but less i gropeanwag sometimes i dont see how ill ever learn the things i specially want to know sighed sue the insatiable shall i tell you a shaker story one that eldress abby told me last evening oh do mardie cried sue crossing her feet folding her hands and looking up into her mothers face expectantly once there was a very good shaker named elder calvin green and some one wrote him a letter asking him to come a long distance and found a settlement in the western part of new york state he and some other elders and eldresses traveled five days and stopped at the house of a certain joseph pelham to spend sunday and hold a meeting on monday morning very tired and wondering where to stay and begin his preaching the elder went out into the woods to pray for guidance when he rose from his knees feeling stronger and lighterhearted a young quail came up to him so close that he picked it up it was not a bit afraid neither did the old parent birds who were standing near by show any sign of fear though they are very timid creatures the elder smoothed the young birds feathers a little while and then let it go but he thought an angel seemed to say to him the quail is a sign you will know before night what it means and before tomorrow people will be coming to you to learn the way to god soon after a flock of these shy little birds alighted on joseph pelhams house and the elders were glad and thought it signified the flock of believers that would gather in that place for the shakers see more in signs than other people just at night a young girl of twelve or thirteen knocked at the door and told elder calvin that she wanted to become a shaker and that her father and mother were willing here is the little quail cried the elder and indeed she was the first who flocked to the meetings and joined the new community on their return to their old home across the state the elders took the little quail girl with them it was november then and the canals through which they traveled were clogged with ice one night having been ferried across the mohawk river they took their baggage and walked for miles before they could find shelter finally when they were within three miles of their home elder calvin shortened the way by going across the open fields through the snow up and down the hills and through the gullies and over fences till they reached the house at midnight safe and sound the brave little quail girl having trudged beside them the whole distance carrying her tin pail sue was transported with interest her lips parted her eyes shining her hands clasped oh i wish i could be a brave little quail girl mardie what became of her her name was polly reed and when she grew up she became a teacher of the shaker school then an eldress and even a preacher i dont know what kind of a little quail girl you would make sue do you think you could walk for miles through the ice and snow uncomplainingly i don knows i could sighed sue but she added hopefully perhaps i could teach or preach and then i could gropeanwag as much as ever i liked then after a lengthy pause in which her mind worked feverishly she said mardie i was just groping a little bit but i wont do it any more tonight if the old quail birds in the woods where elder calvin prayed if those old birds had been shaker birds there would nt have been any little quail birds would there because shakers dont have children and then perhaps there would nt have been any little polly reed susanna rose hurriedly from the listbottomed chair and folded her work ill go up and help you undress now she said its seven oclock and i must go to the family meeting vi susanna speaks in meeting it was the sabbath day and the believers were gathered in the meetinghouse brethren and sisters seated quietly on their separate benches with the children by themselves in their own place as the men entered the room they removed their hats and coats and hung them upon wooden pegs that lined the sides of the room while the women took off their bonnets then after standing for a moment of perfect silence they seated themselves in susannas time the sunday costume for the men included trousers of deep blue cloth with a white line and a vest of darker blue exposing a fullbosomed shirt that had a wide turneddown collar fastened with three buttons the sisters were in pure white dresses with neck and shoulders covered with snowy kerchiefs their heads crowned with their white net caps and a large white pocket handkerchief hung over the left arm their feet were shod with curious pointedtoed cloth shoes of ultramarine blue a fashion long since gone by susanna had now become accustomed to the curious solemn march or dance in which of course none but the believers ever joined and found in her present exalted mood the songs and the exhortations strangely interesting and not unprofitable tabitha the most aged of the group of albion sisters confessed that she missed the old times when visions were common when the spirit manifested itself in extraordinary ways and the gift of tongues descended sometimes in the western settlement where she was gathered in the whole north family would march into the highway in the fresh morning hours and while singing some sacred hymn would pass on to the center family and together in solemn yet glad procession they would mount the hillside to jehovahs chosen square there to sing and dance before the lord i wish we could do something like that now sighed hetty arnold a pretty young creature who had moments of longing for the pomps and vanities if we have to give up all worldly pleasures i think we might have more religious ones we were a younger church in those old times of which sister tabitha speaks said eldress abby you must remember hetty that we were children in faith and needed signs and manifestations pictures and objectlessons weve been trained to think and reason now and weve put away some of our picturebooks there have been revelations to tell us we needed movements and exercises to quicken our spiritual powers and to give energy and unity to our worship and there have been revelations telling us to give them up revelations bidding us to sing more revelations telling us to use wordless songs then anthems were given us and so it has gone on for we have been led of the spirit id like more picturebooks pouted hetty under her breath today the service began with a solemn song followed by speaking and prayer from a visiting elder then after a long and profound silence the company rose and joined in a rhythmic dance which signified the onward travel of the soul to full redemption the opening and closing of the hands meaning the scattering and gathering of blessing there was no accompaniment and both the music and the words were the artless expression of fervent devotion susanna sat in her corner beside the aged tabitha who would never dance again before the lord though her quavering voice joined in the chorus the spring floor rose and fell under the quick rhythmic tread of the worshipers and with each revolution about the room the song gained in power and fervor i am never weary bringing my life unto god i am never weary singing his way is good with the voice of an angel with power from above i would publish the blessing of soulsaving love the steps grew slower and more sedate the voices died away the arms sank slowly by the sides and the hands ceased their movement susanna rose to her feet she knew not how or why her cheeks were flushed her head bent dear friends she said i have now been among you for nearly three months sharing your life your work and your worship you may well wish to know whether i have made up my mind to join this community and i can only say that although i have prayed for light i cannot yet see my way clearly i am happy here with you and although i have been a church member for years i have never before longed so ardently to present my body and soul as a sacrifice unto the lord i have tried not to be a burden to you the small weekly sum that i put into the treasury i will not speak of lest i seem to think that the gift of god may be purchased with money as the scriptures say but i have endeavored to be loyal to your rules and customs your aims and ideals and to the confidence you have reposed in me oh my dear sisters and brothers pray for me that i be enabled to see my duty more plainly it is not the fleshpots that will call me back to the world if i go it will be because the duties i have left behind take such shape that they draw me out of his shelter in spite of myself i thank you for the help you have given me these last weeks god knows my gratitude can never be spoken in words elder grays voice broke the silence that followed susannas speech i only echo the sentiments of the family when i say that our sister susanna shall have such time as she requires before deciding to unite with this body of believers no pressure shall be brought to bear upon her and she will be as she ever has been a welcome guest under our roof she has been an inspiration to the children a comfort and aid to the sisters an intelligent comrade to the brethren and a sincere and earnest student of the truth may the spirit draw her into the virgin church of the new creation yee and amen exclaimed eldress abby devoutly for thus saith the lord of hosts i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory saith the lord of hosts o virgin church how great the light what cloud can dim thy way sang martha from her place at the end of a bench and all the voices took up the hymn softly as the company sat with bowed heads then brother issachar rose from his corner saying jesus called upon his disciples to give up everything houses lands relationships and even the selfishness of their own lives they could not call their lives their own lo we have left all and followed thee said peter fathers mothers wives children houses lands and even our own lives also it is a great price to pay but we buy heaven with it yee we do said brother thomas scattergood devoutly to him that overcometh shall the great prize be given god help the weaker brethren murmured young brother nathan in so low a voice that few could hear him moved by the same impulse tabitha abby and martha burst into one of the most triumphant of the shaker songs one that was never sung save when the meeting was full of the spirit i draw no blank nor miss the prize i see the work the sacrifice and ill be loyal ill be wise a faithful overcomer the company rose and began again to march in a circle around the center of the room the brethren two abreast leading the column the sisters following after there was a waving movement of the hands by drawing inward as if gathering in spiritual good and storing it up for future need in the marching and countermarching the worshipers frequently changed their positions ultimately forming into four circles symbolical of the four dispensations as expounded in shakerism the first from adam to abraham the second from abraham to jesus the third from jesus to mother ann lee and the fourth the millennial era the marching grew livelier the bodies of the singers swayed lightly with emotion the faces glowed with feeling over and over the hymn was sung gathering strength and fullness as the believers entered more and more into the spirit of their worship whenever the refrain came in with its militant fervor crude but sincere and effective the singers seenled faithintoxicated and sister martha in particular might have been treading the heavenly streets instead of the meetinghouse floor so complete was her absorption the voices at length grew softer and the movement slower and after a few moments reverent silence the company filed out of the room solemnly and without speech i am as sure that heavn is mine as though my vision could define or pencil draw the boundary line where love and truth shall con quer the lord aint shaken susanna hard enough yet thought brother ansel shrewdly from his place in the rear she aint altogether gathered in not by no manner o means because of that unregenerate son of adam shes left behind but theres the makins of a powful good shaker in susanna if she finally takes holt what manner of life is my husband living now that i have deserted him who is being a mother to jack these were the thoughts that troubled susanna hathaways soul as she crossed the grass to her own building vii the lower plane brother nathan bennett was twenty years old and sister hetty arnold was eighteen they had been left with the shakers by their respective parents ten years before and growing up in the faith they formally joined the community when they reached the age of discretion thus they had known each other from early childhood never in the familiar way common to the children of the world but with the cool cheerful casual wholly impersonal attitude of shaker friendship a relation seemingly outside of and superior to sex a relation more like that of two astral bodies than the more intimate one of a budding adam and eve when and where had this relationship changed its color and meaning neither nathan nor hetty could have told for years nathan had sat at his end of the young mens bench at the family or the public meeting with hetty exactly opposite him at the end of the girls row and for years they had looked across the dividing space at each other with unstirred pulses the rows of sisters sat in serene dignity one bench behind another and each sister was like unto every other in nathans vague dreamy boyishly indifferent eyes some of them were seventy and some seventeen but each modest figure sat in its place with quiet folded hands the stiff caps hid the hair whether it was silver or gold the white surplices covered the shoulders and concealed beautiful curves as well as angular outlines the throats were scarcely visible whether they were yellow and wrinkled or young and white the sisters were simply sisters to fairhaired nathan and the brothers were but brothers to little blackeyed hetty once was it on a sunday morning nathan glanced across the separating space that is the very essence and sign of shakerism the dance had just ceased and there was a long solemn stillness when god indeed seemed to be in one of his holy temples and the earth was keeping silence before him suddenly hetty grew to be something more than one of the figures in a long row she chained nathans eye and held it through her garments the grace of her glowed he saw that in spite of the way her hair had been cut and stretched back from the forehead a short dusky tendril softened and coaxed by the summer heat had made its way mutinously beyond the confines of her cap her eyes were cast down but the lashes that swept her round young cheek were quite different from any other lashes in the sisters row her breath came and went softly after the exertion of the rhythmic movements stirring the white muslin folds that wrapped her from throat to waist he looked and looked until his body seemed to be all eyes absolutely unaware of any change in himself quite oblivious of the fact that he was regarding the girl in any new and dangerous way the silence continued long and profound until suddenly hetty raised her beautiful lashes and met nathans gaze the gaze of a boy just turned to man ardent warm compelling there was a startled moment of recognition a tremulous approach almost an embrace of regard each sent an electric current across the protective separating space the two pairs of eyes met and said i love you in such clear tones that nathan and hetty marveled that the elder did not hear them somebody says that love like a scarlet spider can spin a thread between two hearts almost in an instant so fine as to be almost invisible yet it will hold with the tenacity of an iron chain the thread had been spun it was so delicate that neither nathan nor hetty had seen the scarlet spider spinning it but the strength of both would not avail to snap the bond that held them together the moments passed hettys kerchief rose and fell rose and fell tumultuously while her face was suffused with color nathans knees quivered under him and when the elder rose and they began the sacred march the lad could hardly stand for trembling he dreaded the moment when the lines of believers would meet and he and hetty would walk the length of the long room almost beside each other could she hear his heart beating nathan wondered while hetty was palpitating with fear lest nathan see her blushes and divine their meaning oh the joy of it the terror of it the strange exhilaration and the sudden sensation of sin and remorse the meeting over nathan flung himself on the haymow in the great barn while hetty sat with her synopsis of shaker theology at an open window of the girls building seeing nothing in the lines of print but visions that should not have been there it was nathan who felt most and suffered most and was most conscious of sin for hetty at first scarcely knew whither she was drifting she went into the herbgarden with susanna one morning during the week that followed the fatal sunday many of the plants to be used for seasoning sage summer savory sweet marjoram and the like were quite ready for gathering as the two women were busy at work susanna as full of her thoughts as hetty of hers the sound of a step was heard brushing the grass of the orchard hetty gave a nervous start her cheeks grew so crimson and her breath so short that susanna noticed the change it will be brother ansel coming along to the grindstone hetty stammered burying her head in the leaves no susanna answered it is nathan he has a long pole with a saw on the end he must be going to take the dead branches off the apple trees i heard ansel tell him yesterday to do it yee that will be it said hetty bending over the plants as if she were afraid to look elsewhere nathan came nearer to the herbgarden he was a tall stalwart handsome enough fellow even in his quaint working garb as the sisters spun and wove the cloth as well as cut and made the mens garments and as the brothers themselves made the shoes there was naturally no great air of fashion about the shaker raiment but nathan carried it better than most his skin was fair and rosy the down on his upper lip showed dawning manhood and when he took off his broadbrimmed straw hat and stretched to his full height to reach the upper branches of the apple trees he made a picture of clean wholesome vigorous youth suddenly susanna raised her head and surprised hetty looking at the lad with all her heart in her eyes at the same moment nathan turned and before he could conceal the telltale ardor of his glance it had sped to hetty with the instinct of selfpreservation he stooped instantly as if to steady the saw on the pole but it was too late to mend matters his tale was told so far as susanna was concerned but it was better she should suspect than one of the believers or eldress abby susanna worked on in silent anxiety the likelihood of such crises as this had sometimes crossed her mind and knowing how frail human nature is she often marveled that instances seemed so infrequent her instinct told her that in every community the risk must exist even though all were doubly warned and armed against the temptations that flesh is heir to yet no hint of danger had showed itself during the months in which she had been a member of the shaker family she had heard the elders plea to the young converts to take up a full cross against the flesh she had listened to eldress abby when she told them that the natural life its thoughts passions feelings and associations must be turned against once and forever but her heart melted in pity for the two poor young things struggling helplessly against instincts of which they hardly knew the meaning so cloistered had been the life they lived the kind conscientious hands that had fed them would now seem hard and unrelenting the place that had been home would turn to a prison the life that elder gray preached the life of a purer godliness than can be attained by marriage had seemed difficult perhaps but possible and now how cold and hopeless it would appear to these two young undisciplined flaming hearts hetty dear talk to me whispered susanna softly touching her shoulder and wondering if she could somehow find a way to counsel the girl in her perplexity hetty started rebelliously to her feet as nathan moved away farther into the orchard if you say a single thing to me or a word about me to eldress abby ill run away this very day nobody has any right to speak to me and i just want to be let alone its all very well for you she went on passionately what have you had to give up nothing but a husband you did nt love and a home you did nt want to stay in like as not youll be a shaker and theyll take you for a saint but anyway youll have had your life you are right hetty said susanna quietly but oh my dear the world outside isnt such a paradise for young girls like you motherless and fatherless and penniless you have a good home here cant you learn to like it out in the world people can do as they like and nobody thinks of calling them wicked sobbed hetty flinging herself down and putting her head in susannas aproned lap here youve got to live like an angel and if you dont youve got to confess every wrong thought youve had when the time comes whatever you do hetty be open and aboveboard dont be hasty and foolish or you may be sorry forever afterwards hettys mood changed again suddenly to one of mutiny and she rose to her feet you have nt got any right to interfere with me anyway susanna and if you think its your duty to tell tales youll only make matters worse and so saying she took her basket and fled across the fields like a hunted hare that evening as hetty left the infirmary where she had been sent with a bottle of liniment for the nursing sisters she came upon nathan standing gloomily under the spruce trees near the back of the building it was eight oclock and quite dark it had been raining during the late afternoon and the trees were still dripping drearily hetty came upon nathan so suddenly that although he had been in her thoughts she gave a frightened little cry when he drew her peremptorily under the shadow of the branches the rules that govern the shaker community are very strict but in reality the true believer never thinks of them as rules nor is trammeled by them they are fixed habits of the blood as common as natural as sitting or standing eating or drinking no brother is allowed to hold any lengthy interview with a sister nor to work walk or drive with her alone but these protective customs which all are bound in honor to keep are too much a matter of everyday life to be strange or irksome i must speak to you hetty whispered nathan i cannot bear it any longer alone what shall we do do echoed hetty trembling yes do there was no pretense of asking her if she loved or suffered or lived in torture and suspense they had not uttered a word to each other but their eyes had shed meanings you know we cant go on like this he continued rapidly we cant eat their food stay alongside of them pray their prayers and act a lie all the time we cant nay we cant said hetty oh nathan shall we confess all and see if they will help us to resist temptation i know thats what susanna would want me to do but oh i should dread it nay it is too late nathan answered drearily they could not help us and we should be held under suspicion forever after i feel so wicked and miserable and unfaithful i dont know what to do sobbed hetty yee so do i the lad answered and i feel bitter against my father too he brought me here to get rid of me because he did nt dare leave me on somebodys doorstep he ought to have come back when i was grown a man and asked me if i felt inclined to be a shaker and if i was good enough to be one and my stepfather would nt have me in the house so my mother had to give me away but theyre both dead and im alone in the world though ive never felt it because the sisters are so kind now they will hate me though they dont hate anybody youve got me hetty we must go away and be married wed better go tonight to the minister in albion what if he would nt do it why should nt he shakers take no vows though i feel bound hand and foot out of gratitude if any other two young folks went to him he would marry them and if he refuses there are two other ministers in albion besides two more in buryfield five miles farther if they wont marry us tonight ill leave you in some safe home and we ll walk to portland tomorrow im young and strong and i know i can earn our living somehow but we have nt the price of a lodging or a breakfast between us hetty said tearfully would it be sinful to take some of my basketwork and send back the money next week yee it would be so nathan answered sternly the least we can do is to go away as emptyhanded as we came i can work for our breakfast oh i cant bear to disappoint eldress abby cried hetty breaking anew into tears shell say weve run away to live on the lower plane after agreeing to crucify nature and follow the angelic life i know but there are five hundred people in albion all living in marriage and we shant be the only sinners nathan argued oh sister hetty dear hetty keep up your spirits and trust to me nathans hand stole out and met hettys in its warm clasp the first hand touch that the two ignorant young creatures had ever felt nathans knowledge of life had been a journey to the canterbury shakers in new hampshire with brother issachar hettys was limited to a few drives into albion village and half a dozen chats with the worlds people who came to the settlement to buy basketwork i am not able to bear the shaker life sighed nathan elder gray allows there be such nor i murmured hetty eldress harriet knows i am no saint hettys head was now on nathans shoulder the stiff shaker cap had resisted bravely but the girls head had yielded to the sweet proximity youth called to youth triumphantly the spirit was unheard and all the theories of celibacy and the angelic life that had been poured into their ears vanished into thin air the thick shade of the spruce tree hid the kiss that would have been so innocent had they not given themselves to the virgin church the drip drip drip of the branches on their young heads passed unheeded then one following the other silently along the highroad hurrying along in the shadows of the tall trees stealing into the edge of the woods or hiding behind a thicket of alders at the fancied sound of a footstep or the distant rumble of a wagon nathan and hetty forsook the faith of mother ann and went out into the world as adam and eve left the garden with the knowledge of good and evil implanted in their hearts the voice of eldress abby pursued hetty in her flight like the voice in a dream she could hear its clear impassioned accents saying the children of this world marry but the children of the resurrection do not marry for they are as the angels the solemn tones grew fainter and fainter as hettys steps led her farther and farther away from the quiet shaker village and its drabclad sisters and at last they almost died into silence because nathans voice was nearer and nathans voice was dearer viii concerning backsliders there was no work in the herbgarden now but there was never a moment from dawn till long after dusk when the busy fingers of the shaker sisters were still when all else failed there was the knitting socks for the brothers and stockings for the sisters and socks and stockings of every size for the children one of the quaint sights of the settlement to susanna was the clump of young sisters on the porch of the girls building knitting knitting in the afternoon sun even little shaker jane and mary maria and lucinda had their socks in hand and plied their short knittingneedles soberly and not unskillfully the sight of their industry incited the impetuous sue to effort and under the patient tutelage of sister martha she mastered the gentle art susanna never forgot the hour when coming from her work in the seedroom she crossed the grass with a message to martha and saw the group of children and girls on the western porch a place that caught every ray of afternoon sun the last glint of twilight and the first hint of sunset glow sister martha had been reading the sabbathschool lesson for the next day and as susanna neared the building marthas voice broke into a hymn falteringly the girls voices followed the lead uncertain at first of words or tune but gaining courage and strength as they went on as the waves of the mighty ocean gospel love we will circulate and as we give in due proportion we of the heavenly life partake heavenly life glorious life resurrecting soulinspiring regenerating gospel life it leadeth away from all sin and strife the clear innocent treble sounded sweetly in the virgin stillness and solitude of the settlement and as susanna drew closer she stopped under a tree to catch the picture sister martha grave tall discreet singing with all her soul and marking time with her hands so accustomed to the upward and downward movement of the daily service the straight plain dresses were as fresh and smooth as perfect washing could make them and the round childlike faces looked quaint and sweet with the cropped hair tucked under the stiff little caps sue was seated with mary and jane on the steps and susanna saw with astonishment that her needles were moving to and fro and she was knitting as serenely and correctly as a mother in israel singing too in a delicate little treble that was like a skylarks morning note susanna could hear her distinctly as she delightedly flung out the long words so dear to her soul and so difficult to dull little jane and mary resurrecting soulinspiring regenerating gospel life it leadeth away from all sin and strife janes cap was slightly unsettled causing its wearer to stop knitting now and then and pull it forward or push it back and in one of these little feminine difficulties susanna saw sue reach forward and deftly transfer the cap to her own head jane was horrified but rather slow to wrath and equally slow in ingenuity sue looked a delicious shaker with her delicate face her lovely eyes and her yellow hair grown into soft rings and quite intoxicated with her cap her knitting and the general air of holiness so unexpectedly emanating from her she moved her little hands up and down as the tune rose and fell in a way that would have filled eldress abby with joy susannas heart beat fast and she wondered for a moment as she went back to her room whether she could ever give sue a worldly childhood more free from danger than the life she was now living she found letters from aunt louisa and jack on reaching her room and they lay in her lap under a pile of towels to be read and reread while her busy needle flew over the coarse crash sue stole in quietly kissed her mothers cheek and sat down on her stool by the window marveling with every under of the needle and over of the yarn that it was she sue hathaway who was making a real stocking jacks pen was not that of an especially ready writer but he had a practical way of conveying considerable news his present contributions when freed from their phonetic errors and spelled in christian fashion read somewhat as follows father says i must write to you every week even if i make him do without so i will i am well and so is aunt louisa and any boy that lives with her has to toe the mark i tell you but she is good and has fine things to eat every meal what did sue get for her birthday i got a book from father and one from aunt louisa and the one from you that you told her to buy it is queer that people will give a boy books when he has only one knife and that a broken one theres a book prize to be given at the school and i am pretty afraid i will get that too it would be just my luck teachers think about nothing but books and what good they do but i heard of a boy that had a grand knife with five sharp blades and a corkscrew and in a shipwreck he cut all the ropes so the sail came down that was carrying them on to the rocks and then by boring a hole with his corkscrew all the water leaked out of the ship that had been threatening to sink the sailors i could use a little pocket money as aunt louisa keeps me short i have been spending sunday with father and had a pretty good time not so very father will take me about more when he stops going to the store which will be next week for good the kitchen floor is new painted and ellen says it sticks and aunt louisa is going to make ellen clean house in case you come home do you like where you are our teacher told the girls teacher it seemed a long stay for any one who had a family and the boys at school call me a half orphan and say my mother has left me and so my father has to board me in the country my money is run out again i sat down in a puddle this afternoon but it dried up pretty quick and did nt hurt my clothes so no more from your son jack this was the sort of message that had been coming to susanna of late bringing up little pictures of home duties and responsibilities homely tasks and trials john giving up the store for good what did that mean had he gone from bad to worse in the solitude that she had hoped might show him the gravity of his offenses the error of his ways in case she should die what then would become of the children would louisa accept the burden of jack for whom she had never cared would the shakers take sue she would be safe perhaps she would always be happy but brother and sister would be divided and brought up as strangers would little sue grown to big sue say some time or other my mother renounced the world for herself but what right had she to renounce it for me why did she rob me of the dreams of girlhood and the natural hopes of women when i was too young to give consent these and other unanswerable questions continually drifted through susannas mind disturbing its balance and leaving her like a shuttlecock bandied to and fro between conflicting blows mardie came a soft little voice from across the room mardie what is a backslider where did you hear that long word sue asked susanna rousing herself from her dream t is nt so long as regenerating and more easier regenerating means making over you know thered ought to be childrens words and grownup words thats what i think said sue decisively but what does backslider mean a backslider is one who has been climbing up a hill and suddenly begins to slip back does nt his feet take hold right or why does he slip perhaps he cant manage his feet perhaps they just wont climb yes or praps he just does nt want to climb any more but it must be frightensome sliding backwards i suppose it is is it wicked why yes it is generally perhaps always brother nathan and sister hetty were backsliders sister tabitha said so she told jane never to speak their names again any more than if they was dead then you had better not speak of them either theres so many things better not to speak of in the world sometimes i think t would be nicer to be an angel nicer perhaps but one has to be very good to be an angel backsliders could nt be angels i spose not while they were backsliders but perhaps theyd begin to climb again and then in time they might grow to be angels i should nt think likely remarked sue decisively clicking her needles as one who could settle most spiritual problems in a jiffy i think the sliding kind is diffrent from the climbing kind and they dont make easy angels a long pause followed this expression of opinion this simple division of the human race at the start into sheep and goats then presently the untiring voice broke the stillness again nathan and hetty slid back when they went away from here did we backslide when we left fardie and jack im not sure but that we did said poor susanna theres childrenshakers and brotherandsister shakers but no fatherandmother shakers no they think they can do just as much good in the world without being mothers and fathers do you think so yees i believe i do well are you a truly shaker or cant you be till you wear a cap im not a shaker yet sue youre just only a mother yes thats about all maybe wed better go back to where theres not so many sisters and more mothers so you ll have somebody to climb togedder with i could climb here sue and so could you yes but wholl fardie and jack climb with i wish theyd come and see us brother ansel would make fardie laugh and jack would love farmwork and wed all be so happy i miss fardie awfully he did nt speak to me much but i liked to look at his curly hair and think how lovely it would be if he did take notice of me and play with me a sob from susanna brought sue startled to her side you break my heart sue you break it every day with the things you say dont you love me sue moren tongue can tell cried sue throwing herself into her mothers arms dont cry darling mardie i wont talk any more not for days and days let me wipe your poor eyes dont let elder gray see you crying or hell think ive been naughty hes just going in downstairs to see eldress abby was it wrong what i said about backsliding or what mardie well help each udder climb an then well go home an help poor lonesome fardie shall we abby called elder gray stepping into the entry of the office building yee im coming eldress abby answered from the stairway go right out and sit down on the bench by the door where i can catch a few minutes more light for my darning the days seem to be growing short all to once did lemuel have a good sale of basketwork at the mountains rosetta has nt done so well for years at old orchard we seem to be prospering in every material direction daniel but my heart is heavy somehow and i have to be instant in prayer to keep from discouragement it has nt been an altogether good year with us spiritually confessed daniel perhaps we needed chastening if we needed it weve received it abby ejaculated as she pushed her darningball into the foot of a stocking nothing has happened since i came here thirty years ago that has troubled me like the running away of nathan and hetty if they had been new converts we should have thought the good seed had nt got fairly rooted but those children were brought to us when nathan was eleven and hetty nine i well remember for the boys father and the girls mother came on the same train a most unusual occurrence to receive two children in one day i have cause to remember hetty in her first month for she was as wild as a young hawk she laughed in meeting the first sunclay and when she came back i told her to sit behind me in silence for half an hour while i was reading my bible be still now hetty and labor to repent i said when the time was up she said in a meek little mite of a voice i think im least in the kingdom now eldress abby then run outdoors i said she kicked up her heels like a colt and was through the door in a second not long afterwards i put my hands behind me to tie my apron tighter and if that child had nt taken my small scissors lying on the table and cut buttonholes all up and down my strings hundreds of them while she was laboring to repent elder gray smiled reminiscently though he had often heard the story before neither of the children came from godly families he said but at least the parents never interfered with us nor came here putting false ideas into their childrens heads thats what i say continued abby and now after ten years training and discipline in the angelic life hetty being especially promising to think of their going away together and worse yet being married in albion village right at our very doors i dont hardly dare to go to bed nights for fear of hearing in the morning that some of the other young folks have been led astray by this foolish performance of hettys i know it was hettys fault nathan never had ingenuity enough to think and plan it all out nay nay abby dont be too hard on the girl ive watched nathan closely and he has been in a dangerous and unstable state even as long ago as his last confession but this piece of backsliding grievous as it is does nt cause me as much sorrow as the fall of brother ephraim to all appearance he had conquered his appetite and for five years he has led a sober life i had even great hopes of him for the ministry and suddenly like a great cloud in the blue sky has come this terrible visitation this reappearance of the old adam ephraim has returned to his idols how have you decided to deal with him daniel it is his first offense since he cast in his lot with us we must rebuke chastise and forgive yee yee i agree to that but how if he makes us the laughingstock of the community and drags our sacred banner in the dust we cant afford to have one of our order picked up in the streets by the worlds people have the worlds people found an infallible way to keep those of their order out of the gutters asked elder gray ephraim seems repentant if he is willing to try again we must be willing to do as much yee daniel you are right another matter that causes me anxiety is susanna i never yearned for a soul as i yearn for hers she has had the advantage of more education and more reading than most of us have ever enjoyed shes gifted in teaching and she wins the children shes discreet and spiritually minded her life in the world even with the influence of her dissipated husband has nt really stained only humbled her she would make such a shaker if she was once convinced as we have nt gathered in for years and years but i fear shes slipping slipping away daniel what makes you feel so now particularly shes diffrent as time goes on shes had more letters from that place where her boy is she cries nights and though she does nt relax a mite with her work she drags about sometimes like a bird with one wing elder daniel took off his broadbrimmed hat to cool his forehead and hair lifting his eyes to the first pale stars that were trembling in the sky hesitating in silver and then quietly deepening into gold brother ansel was a believer because he had no particular love for the world and no great susceptibility to its temptations but what had drawn daniel gray from the open sea into this quiet little backwater of a shaker settlement after an adventurous early life in which as if youthintoxicated he had plunged from danger to danger experience to experience he suddenly found himself in a society of which he had never so much as heard a company of celibate brothers and sisters holding all goods and possessions in common and trying to live the angelic life on earth illness detained him for a month against his will but at the end of that time he had joined the community and although it had been twentyfive years since his gathering in he was still steadfast in the faith his character was of puritanical sternness he was a strict disciplinarian and insisted upon obedience to the rules of shaker life the sacred laws of zion as he was wont to term them he magnified his office yet he was of a kindly disposition easily approached by children and not without a quaint oldtime humor there was a long pause while the two faithful leaders of the little flock were absorbed in thought then the elder said susannas all you say and the child well if she could be purged of her dross i never saw a creature better fitted to live the celestial life but we must not harbor any divided hearts here when the time comes we must dismiss her with our blessing yee i suppose so said eldress abby loyally but it was with a sigh had she and tabitha been left to their own instincts they would have gone out into the highways and hedges proselyting with the fervor of mother anns day and generation after all abby said the elder rising to take his leave still in a sort of mild tranceafter all abby i suppose the shakers dont own the whole of heaven id like to think so but i cant its a big place and it belongs to god ix love manifold the woods on the shores of massabesic pond were stretches of tapestry where every shade of green and gold olive and brown orange and scarlet melted the one into the other the somber pines made a deeptoned background patches of sumach gave their flaming crimson the goldenrod grew rank and tall in glorious profusion and the maples outside the office building were balls of brilliant carmine the air was like crystal and the landscape might have been bathed in liquid amber it was so saturated with october yellow susanna caught her breath as she threw her chamber window wider open in the early morning for the greater part of the picture had been painted during the frosty night throw your little cape round your shoulders and come quickly sue she exclaimed the child ran to her side oh what a goldy goldy morning she cried one crimson leaf with a long heavy stem that acted as a sort of rudder came down to the windowsill with a sidelong scooping flight while two or three gayly painted ones parted from the tree by the same breeze floated airily along as if borne on unseen wings finally alighting on sues head and shoulders like tropical birds you cried in the night mardie said sue i heard you snifferling and getting up for your hankchief but i did nt speak cause its so dreadful to be catched crying kneel down beside me and give me part of your cape her mother answered im going to let my sad heart fly right out of the window into those beautiful trees and maybe a glad heart will fly right in the child suggested maybe oh we must cuddle close and be still elder grays going to sit down under the great maple and do you see all the brothers seem to be up early this morning just as we are more love elder gray called issachar on his way to the toolhouse more love brother issachar more love brother ansel more love brother calvin more love more love more love so the quaint but not uncommon shaker greeting passed from brother to brother and as tabitha and martha and rosetta met on their way to dairy and laundry and seedhouse they too hearing the salutation took up the refrain and susanna and sue heard again from the womens voices that beautiful morning wish more love more love speeding from heart to heart and lip to lip mother and child were very quiet more love sue said susanna clasping her closely more love mardie whispered the child smiling and entering into the spirit of the salutation lets turn our heads farnham way ill take jack and you take fardie and well say togedder more love shall we more love john more love jack the words floated out over the trees in the womans trembling voice and the childs treble elder gray looks tired though hes just got up sue continued he is not strong replied her mother remembering brother ansels statement that the elder want diseased anywheres but did nt have no durability the elder would have a lovely lap sue remarked presently what a nice lap to sit in fardie has a nice lap too and uncle joel atterbury but not aunt louisa she lets you slide right off its a bony hard lap i love elder gray and i climbed on his lap one day he put me right down but im sure he likes children i wish i could take right hold of his hand and walk all over the farm but he would nt let me i spose morelove eldergray she cried suddenly bobbing up above the windowsill and shaking her fairy hand at him the elder looked up at the sound of the glad voice no human creature could have failed to smile back into the roguish face or have treated churlishly the sweet confident little greeting the heart of a real man must have an occasional throb of the father and when daniel gray rose from his seat under the maple and called more love child there was something strange and touching in his tone he moved away from the tree to his morning labors with the consciousness of something new to conquer long long ago he had risen victorious above many of the temptations that flesh is heir to women were his good friends his comrades his sisters they no longer troubled the waters of his soul but here was a child who stirred the depths who awakened the potential father in him so suddenly and so strongly that he longed for the sweetness of a human tie that could bind him to her but the current of the elders being was set towards sacrifice and holiness and the common joys of human life he felt could never and must never be his so he went to the daily round the common task only a little paler a little soberer than was his wont more love martha said susanna when she met martha a little later in the day more love susanna martha replied cheerily you heard our shaker greeting i see it was the beautiful weather the fine air and glorious colors that brought the inspiration this morning i guess it took us all out of doors and then it seemed to get into the blood besides tomorrows the day of sacrifice and that takes us all on to the mountaintops of feeling there have been times when i had to own up to a lack of love you martha who have such wonderful influence over the children such patience such affection it was nt always so when i was first put in charge of the children i did nt like the work they did nt respond to me somehow and when they were out of my sight they were ugly and disobedient my natural mother maria holmes took care of the girls clothing one day she said to me martha do you love the girls some of them are very unlovely i replied i know that she said but you can never help them unless you love them i thought mother very critical for i strove scrupulously to do my duty a few days after this the elder said to me martha do you love the girls i responded not very much you cannot save them unless you love them he said then i answered i will labor for a gift of love when the work of the day was over and the girls were in bed i would take off my shoes and spend several hours of the night walking the floor kneeling in prayer that i might obtain the coveted gift for five weeks i did this without avail when suddenly one night when the moon was full and i was kneeling by the window a glory seemed to overshadow the crest of a high mountain in the distance i thought i heard a voice say martha i baptize you into the spirit of love i sat there trembling for more than an hour and when i rose i felt that i could love the meanest human being that ever walked the earth i have never had any trouble with children since that night of the vision they seem different to me and i dare say i am different to them i wish i could see visions exclaimed susanna oh for a glory that would speak to me and teach me truth and duty life is all mist whichever way i turn id like to be lifted on to a high place where i could see clearly she leaned against the frame of the open kitchen door her delicate face quivering with emotion and longing her attitude simplicity and unconsciousness itself the baldest of shaker prose turned to purest poetry when susanna dipped it in the alembic of her own imagination labor for the gift of sight said martha who believed implicitly in spirits and visions labor this very night it must be said for susanna that she had never ceased laboring in her own way for many days the truth was that she felt herself turning from marriage she had lived now so long in the society of men and women who regarded it as an institution not compatible with the highest spiritual development that unconsciously her point of view had changed changed all the more because she had been so unhappy with the man she had chosen curiously enough and unfortunately enough for susanna hathaways peace of mind the greater aversion she felt towards the burden of the old life towards the irksomeness of guiding a weaker soul towards the claims of husband on wife the stronger those claims appeared if they had never been assumed ah but they had there was the rub one sight of little sue sleeping tranquilly beside her one memory of rebellious faulty jack one vision of john either as needing or missing her the rightful woman or falling deeper in the wiles of the wrong one for very helplessness any of these changed susanna the wouldbe saint in an instant into susanna the wife and mother speak to me for thy compassions sake she prayed from the little book of confessions that her mother had given her i will follow after thy voice would you betray your trust asked conscience no not intentionally would you desert your post never willingly you have divided the family taken a little quail bird out of the homenest and left sorrow behind you would god justify you in that for the first time susannas no rang clearly enough for her to hear it plainly for the first time it was followed by no vague misgivings no bewilderment no unrest or indecision i turn hither and hither thy purposes are hid from me but i commend my soul to thee then a sentence from the dear old book came into her memory and thy dead things shall revive and thy weak things shall be made whole she listened laying hold of every word till the nervous clenching of her hands subsided her face relaxed into peace then she lay down beside sue creeping close to her for the warmth and comfort and healing of her innocent touch and closing her eyes serenely knew no more till the morning broke the sabbath morning of confession day x brother and sister if susannas path had grown more difficult more filled with anxieties so had john hathaways the protracted absence of his wife made the gossips conclude that the break was a final one jack was only half contented with his aunt and would be fairly mutinous in the winter while louisas general attitude was such as to show clearly that she only kept the boy for susannas sake now and then there was a terrifying hint of winter in the air and the days of susannas absence seemed eternal to john hathaway yet he was a man about whom there would have been but one opinion that when deprived of a rather superior and highminded wife and the steadying influence of home and children he would go completely to the dogs whither he seemed to be hurrying when susannas wifely courage failed that he had done precisely the opposite and the unexpected thing shows us perhaps that men are not on the whole as capable of estimating the forces of their fellow men as is god the maker of men who probably expects something of the worst of them up to the very last it was at the end of a hopeless sunday when john took his boy back to his aunts towards night he wondered drearily how a woman dealt with a tenyearold boy who from sunrise to sunset had done every mortal thing he ought not to have done and had left undone everything that he had been told to do and as if to carry out the very words of the church service neither was there any health in him for he had an inflamed throat and a whining irritable discontented temper that could be borne only by a mother a father being wholly inadequate and apparently never destined for the purpose it was a mild evening late in october and louisa sat on the porch with her pepperandsalt shawl on and a black wool rigolette tied over her head jack very sulky and unresigned was dispatched to bed under the care of the one servant who was provided with a cupful of vinegar salt and water for a gargle john had more than an hour to wait for a returning train to farnham and although ordinarily he would have preferred to spend the time in the silent and unreproachful cemetery rather than in the society of his sister louisa he was too tired and hopeless to do anything but sit on the steps and smoke fitfully in the semidarkness louisa was much as usual she well knew who better her brothers changed course of life but neither encouragement nor compliment were in her line why should a man be praised for living a respectable life that john had really turned a sort of moral somersault and come up a different creature she did not realize in the least nor the difficulties surmounted in such a feat but she did give him credit secretly for turning about face and behaving far more decently than she could ever have believed possible she had no conception of his mental torture at the time but if he kept on doing well she privately intended to inform susanna and at least give her a chance of trying him again if absence had diminished her sense of injury one thing that she did not know was that john was on the eve of losing his partnership when jack had said that his father was not going back to the store the next week she thought it meant simply a vacation divided hearts broken vows ruined lives she could bear the sight of these with considerable philosophy but a lost income was a very different a very tangible thing she almost lost her breath when her brother knocked the ashes from his meerschaum and curtly told her of the proposed change in his business relations i dont know what i shall do yet he said whether i shall set up for myself in a small way or take a position in another concern that is if i can get one my stock of popularity seems to be pretty low just now in farnham id move away tomorrow and cut the whole gossipy deceitful hypocritical lot of em if i was nt afraid of closing the house and so losing susanna if she should ever feel like coming back to us these words and the thought back of them were too much for johns selfcontrol the darkness helped him and his need of comfort was abject suddenly he burst out oh louisa for heavens sake give me a little crumb of comfort if you have any how can you stand like a stone all these months and see a man suffering as i have suffered without giving him a word you brought it on yourself said louisa in selfexculpation does that make it any easier to bear cried john dont you suppose i remember it every hour and curse myself the more you know perfectly well that im a different man today i dont know what made me change it was as if something had been injected into my blood that turned me against everything i had liked best before i hate the sight of the men and the women i used to go with not because they are any worse but because they remind me of what i have lost i have reached the point now where i have got to have news of susanna or go and shoot myself that would be about the only piece of foolishness you have nt committed already replied louisa with a biting satire that would have made any man let go of the trigger in case he had gone so far as to begin pulling it where is she john went on without anger at her sarcasm where is she how is she what is she living on is she well is she just as bitter as she was at first does she ever speak of coming back tell me something tell me anything i will know something i say i will louisas calm demeanor began to show a little agitation for she was not used to the sight of emotion i cant tell you where susanna is for i made her a solemn promise i would nt unless you or jack were in danger of some kind but i dont mind telling you this much that shes well and in the safest kind of a shelter for shes been living from the first in a shaker settlement shaker settlement cried john starting up from his seat on the steps whats that i know shaker eggbeaters and gardenseeds and rockingchairs and oh yes i remember their religions against marriage thats the worst thing you could have told me that ends all hope if they once get hold of a woman like susanna theyll never let go of her if they dont believe in a womans marrying a good man theyd never let her go back to a bad one oh if i had only known this before if only youd told me louisa perhaps i could have done something maybe they take vows or sign contracts and so i have lost her altogether i dont know much about their beliefs and susanna never explained them returned louisa nervously but now that youve got something to offer her why dont you write and ask her to come back to you ill send your letter to her i dont dare louisa i dont dare groaned john leaning his head against one of the pillars of the porch i cant tell you the fear i have of susanna after the way ive neglected her this last year if she should come in at the gate this minute i could nt meet her eyes if youd read the letter she left me youd feel the same way i deserved it to the last word but oh it was like so many separate strokes of lightning and every one of them burned it was nothing but the truth but it was cut in with a sharp sword unless she should come back to me of her own accord and she never will i have nt got the courage to ask her just have nt got the courage thats all there is to say about it and here john buried his head in his hands a very queer thing happened to louisa banks at this moment a halfsecond before she would have murmured this rock shall fly from its firm base as soon as i when all at once and without warning a strange something occurred in the organ which she had always regarded and her opinion had never yet been questioned as a good tough lovetight heart first there was a flutter and a tremor running all along her spine then her eyes filled then a lump rose in her throat and choked her then words trembled on her tongue and refused to be uttered then something like a bird could it have been the highly respectable goodasnew heart throbbed under her black silk sunday waist then she grew like wax from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet then in a twinkling and so unconsciously as to be unashamed of it she became a sister you have seen a gray november morning melt into an indian summer noon louisa banks was like that when at the sight of a man in sore trouble sympathy was born in her to soften the rockiness of her original makeup there there john dont be so downhearted she stammered drawing her chair closer and putting her hand on his shoulder well bring it round right you see if we dont youve done the most yourself already for im proud of the way youve acted stiffening right up like an honest man and showing youve got some good sensible hathaway stuff in you after all and aint ashamed to turn your back on your evil ways susanna aint one to refuse forgiveness she forgave for a long time but she refused at last why should she change now john asked you remember she has nt heard a single word from you nor about you in that outoftheway place where shes been living said louisa consolingly she thinks youre the same as you were or worse maybe perhaps shes waiting for you to make some sign through me for she dont know that you care anything about her or are pining to have her back such a woman as susanna must know better than that cried john she ought to know that when a man got used to living with anybody like her he could never endure any other kind how should she know all that jacks been writing to her and telling her the news for the last few weeks though i have nt said a word about you because i did nt know how long your reformation was going to hold out but i wont let the grass grow under my feet now till i tell her just how things stand youre a good woman louisa i dont see why i never noticed it before its because ive been concealing my goodness too much stay here with me tonight and dont go back to brood in that dismal forsaken house well see how jack is in the morning and if hes all right take him along with you sos to be all there together if susanna comes back this week as i kind of hope she will make ellen have the house all nice and cheerful from top to bottom with a good supper ready to put on the table the night she comes youd better pick your asters and take em in for the parlor then ill cut the chrysanthemums for you in the middle of the week the day she comes ill happen in and stay to dinner if you find its going to be mortifying for you but if everything is as i expect it will be and the way susanna always did have things ill make for home and leave you to yourselves susanna aint one to nag and hector and triumph over a man when hes repented john hugged louisa pepperandsalt shawl black rigolctte and all when she finished this unprecedented speech and when he went to sleep that night in the old north chamber the one he and louisa had been born in the one his father and mother had died in it was with a little smile of hope on his lips set her place at hearth and board as it used to be these were the last words that crossed his waking thoughts before louisa went to her own bed she wrote one of her brief and characteristic epistles to susanna but it did not reach her for the hills of home had called johns wife so insistently on that sunday that the next day found her on her way back to farnham dear susanna so the letter read theres a new man in your house at farnham his name is john hathaway but hes made all over and it was high time i say its the hand of god he wont own up that it is but im letting him alone for ive done quarreling though i dont like to see a man get religion and deny it for all the world like peter in the new testament if you have nt used up the last one of your seventytimessevens i think youd better come back and forgive your husband if you dont youd better send for your son im willing to bear the burdens the lord intends specially for me but jack belongs to you and a goodsized heavy burden he is too for his age i cant deny that if he is a hathaway i think hes the kind of a boy that ought to be put in a barrel and fed through the bunghole till he grows up but of course im not used to childrens ways be as easy with john at first as you can i know you ll say i never was with my husband but he was different he got to like a bracing treatment adlai did manys the time he said to me louisa when you make up our minds im always contented but john is nt made that way hes a changed man now what weve got to do is to keep him changed he does nt bear you any grudge for leaving him so he wont reproach you hoping to see you before long i am yours as usual louisa banks xi the open door on the saturday evening before the yearly day of sacrifice the spiritual heads of each shaker family called upon all the believers to enter heartily next day into the humiliations and blessings of open confession the sabbath dawns upon an awed and solemn household footfalls are hushed the childrens chatter is stilled and all go to the morning meal in silence there is a strange quiet but it is not sadness it is a hush as when in israels camp the silver trumpets sounded and the people stayed in their tents then elder gray explained to susanna a summons comes to each believer for all have been searching the heart and scanning the life of the months past softly the one called goes to the door of the one appointed by the divine spirit the human representative who is to receive the gift of the burdened soul woman confesses to woman man to man it is the open door that leads to god susanna lifted eldress abbys latch and stood in her strong patient presence then all at once she knelt impulsively and looked up into her serene eyes do you come as a believer susanna tremblingly asked the eldress no eldress abby i come as a child of the world who wants to go back to her duty and hopes to do it better than she ever did before she ought to be able to because you have chastened her pride taught her the lesson of patience strengthened her will purified her spirit and cleansed her soul from bitterness and wrath i waited till afternoon when all the confessions were over may i speak now eldress abby bowed but she looked weak and stricken and old i had something you would have called a vision last night but i think of it as a dream and i know just what led to it you told me polly reeds story and the little quail bird had such a charm for sue that ive repeated it to her more than once in my sleep i seemed to see a mother quail with a little one beside her the two were always together happily flying or hopping about under the trees but every now and then i heard a sad little note as of a deserted bird somewhere in the wood i walked a short distance and parting the branches saw on the open ground another parent bird and a young one by its side darting hither and thither as if lost they seemed to be restlessly searching for something and always they uttered the soft sad note as if the nest had disappeared and they had been parted from the little flock of course my brain had changed the very meaning of the shaker story and translated it into different terms but when i woke this morning i could think of nothing but my husband and my boy the two of them seemed to me to be needing me searching for me in the dangerous open country while i was hidden away in the safe shelter of the wood i and the other little quail bird i had taken out of the nest do you think you could persuade your husband to unite with us asked abby wiping her eyes the tension of the situation was too tightly drawn for mirth or susanna could have smiled but she answered soberly no if john could develop the best in himself he could be a good husband and father a good neighbor and citizen and an upright business man but never a shaker did nt he insult your wifely honor and disgrace your home yes in the last few weeks before i left him all his earlier offenses were more against himself than me in a sense i forgave him many a time but i am not certain it was the seventy times seven that the bible bids us i am not free from blame myself i was hard the last year for i had lost hope and my pride was trailing in the dust i left him a bitter letter one without any love or hope or faith in it just because at the moment i believed i ought once in my life to let him know how i felt toward him how can you go back and live under his roof with that feeling its degradation it has changed i was morbid then and so wounded and weak that i could not fight any longer i am rested now and calm my pluck has come back and my strength ive learned a good deal here about casting out my own devils now i am going home and help him to cast out his perhaps he wont be there perhaps he does nt want me though when he was his very best self he loved me dearly but that was long long ago sighed susanna drearily oh this thing the worlds people call love groaned abby there is love and love even in the world outside for if it is adams world it is gods too abby the love i gave my husband was good i think but it failed somewhere and i am going back to try again i am not any too happy in leaving you and taking up perhaps heavier burdens than those from which i escaped night after night ive prayed to be the means of leading you to the celestial life said the eldress but my plaint was not worthy to be heard oh that god would increase our numbers and so revive our drooping faith we work we struggle we sacrifice we pray we defy the world and deny the flesh yet we fail to gather in believers dont say you ve failed dear dear abby cried susanna pressing the eldresss workstained hands to her lips god speaks to you in one voice to me in another does it matter so much as long as we both hear him surely its the hearing and the obeying that counts most wish me well dear friend and help me to say goodbye to the elder the two women found elder gray in the office and abby still unresigned laid susannas case before him the great architect has need of many kinds of workmen in his building said the elder there are those who are willing to put aside the ties of flesh for the kingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it there may also he those who are willing to take up the ties of the flesh for the kingdom of heavens sake answered susanna gently but with a certain courage her face glowed with emotion her eyes shone her lips were parted it was a new thought abby and daniel gazed at her for a moment without speaking then daniel said its a terrible cross to some of the brethren and sisters to live here outside of the world but maybe its more of a cross for such as you to live in it under such conditions as have surrounded you of late years to pursue good and resist evil to bear your cross cheerfully and to grow in grace and knowledge of truth while youre bearing it thats the lesson of life i suppose if you find you cant learn it outside come back to us susanna i will she promised and no words can speak my gratitude for what you have all done for me many a time it will come back to me and keep me from faltering she looked back at him from the open doorway timidly dont forget us sue and me altogether she said her eyes filling with tears come to farnham if you will and see if i am a credit to shaker teaching i shall never be here again perhaps and somehow it seems to me as if you elder gray with your education and your gifts ought to be leading a larger life than this ive hunted in the wild maine forests in my young days ive speared salmon in her rivers and shot rapids ill a birchbark canoe said the elder looking up from the pine table that served as a desk ive been before the mast and seen strange countries ive fought indians ive faced perils on land and sea but this shaker life is the greatest adventure of all adventure echoed susanna uncomprehendingly adventure repeated the elder smiling at his own thoughts whether i fail or whether i succeed its a splendid adventure in ethics abby and daniel looked at each other when susanna passed out of the office door they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have continued with us he quoted quietly abby wiped her eyes with her apron its a hard road to travel sometimes daniel she said yee but think where it leads abby think where it leads youre not going to complain of dust when youre treading the kings highway susanna left the office with a drooping head knowing the sadness that she had left behind brother ansel sat under the trees near by and his shrewd eye perceived the drift of coming events well susanna he drawled youre goin to leave us like most o the other jiners i can see that with one eye shut yes she replied with a half smile but you see ansel i jined john hathaway before i knew anything about shaker doctrines yee but whats to prevent your onjinin him they used to tie up married folks in the old times sot they could nt move an inch when they read the constitution and bylaws over em they used to put in till death do us part thats the way my father was hitched to his three wives but death did em part fortunately for him till death us do part is still in the marriage service susanna said and i think of it very often i want to know if thats there yit exclaimed ansel with apparent surprise i thought they must be leavin it out theres so much onjinin nowadays well accordin to my notions if there is anything wuss n marriage its hevin it hold till death for then menfolks dont git any chance of a speritual life till afterwards they certainly dont when theyre being dragged down by womenfolks an young ones i think the lasting part of the bargain makes it all the more solemn susanna argued oh yes its solemn enough but sos a prayer meetin an considable more elevatin and here ansel regarded the surrounding scenery with frowning disapproval as if it left much to be desired dont you think that there are any agreeable and pleasant women ansel ventured susanna land yes heaps of em but they all wear shaker bunnits i suppose you know more about the women in the outside world than most of the brothers on account of traveling so much i guess anybody t drives a seedcart or peddles stuff along the road knows enough o women to keep clear of em they ll come out the kitchen door choose their papers o seasonin an bottles o flavorin worry you bout the price an take the aidge off every dime make up an then onmake their minds bout what they want ask if its pure an when by good luck you git your cart out o the yard they come runnin along the road after ye to git ye to swap a bottle o vanilla for some spruce gum an give em back the change susanna could not help smiling at ansels arraignment of her sex do you think they follow you for the pleasure of shopping or the pleasure of your conversation ansel she asked slyly a little o both mebbe though the pleasures all on their side returned the unchivalrous ansel but take them same women cut their hair close to their heads theres a heap o foolishness in hair somehow purge em o their vanity so they wont be lookin in the glass all the time make em depend on one another for sassiety so they wont crave no conversation with menfolks an you git an article thats bout as good and bout as stiddy as a man you never seem to remember that men are just as dangerous to womens happiness and goodness as women are to mens said susanna courageously it dont seem so to me never see a man hardly that could stick to the straight an narrer if a woman wanted him to go the other way weak an unstable as water menfolks are an women are powful strong have your own way ansel im going back to the world but no man shall ever say i hindered him from being good youll see women clearer in another world therell be precious few of em to see retorted ansel youre about the best o the lot but even you have a kind of a managin way with ye besides fillin us all full o false hopes that wed gathered in a useful believer one callated to spread the doctrines o mother ann i know i know ansel and oh how sorry i am you would never believe how i long to stay and help you never believe how much you have helped me goodbye ansel youve made me smile when my heart was breaking i shant forget you xii the hills of home susanna had found sue in the upper chamber at the office building and began to make the simple preparations for her homeward journey it was the very hour when john hathaway was saying set her place at hearth and board as it used to be sue interfered with the packing somewhat by darting to and fro bringing her mother sacred souvenirs given her by the shaker sisters and the children needlebooks pinballs thimblecases packets of flowerseeds polished pebbles bottles of flavoring extract this is for fardie she would say and this for jack and this for ellen and this for aunt louisa the needlebook cause shes so useful oh im glad were going home mardie though i do love it here and i was most ready to be a truly shaker its kind of pityish to have your hair shingled and your stocking halfknitted and know how to say yee and then have it all wasted susanna dropped a tear on the dress she was folding the child was going home as she had come away from it gay irresponsible and merry it was only the mothers who hoped and feared and dreaded the very universe was working toward susannas desire at that moment but she was all unaware of the happiness that lay so near she could not see the freshness of the house in farnham the new bits of furniture here and there the autumn leaves in her own bedroom her worktable full of the records of johns sorrowful summer jack handsomer and taller and softer also in his welcoming mood ellen rosy and excited she did not know that joel atterbury had said to john that day i take it all back old man and i hope youll stay on in the firm nor that aunt louisa who was putting stiff shortstemmed chrysanthemums in cups and tumblers here and there through the house was much more flexible and human than was natural to her nor that john alternating between hope and despair was forever humming set her place at hearth and board as it used to be higher are the hills of home bluer is the sea it is often so they who go weeping to look for the dead body of a sorrow find a vision of angels where the body has lain i hope fardieil be glad to see us and ellen will have gingerbread sue chattered then pausing at the window she added im sorry to leave the hills cause ispecially like them dont you mardie we are leaving the shaker hills but we are going to the hills of home her mother answered cheerily dont you remember the farnham hills dear yes i remember and sue looked thoughtful they were farther off and covered with woods these are smooth and gentle and we shall miss the lake mardie yes but we can look at the blue sea from your bedroom window sue and well tell fardie about polly reed and the little quail bird wont we yes but he and jack will have a great deal to say to us and we must nt talk all the time about the dear kind shakers you know youre all buts mardie at which susanna smiled through her tears twilight deepened into dusk and dusk into dark and then the moon rose over the poplar trees outside the window where susanna and sue were sleeping the shaker brethren and sisters were resting serenely after their day of confession it was the aged tabithas last sabbath on earth but had she known it would have made no difference if ever a soul was ready for heaven it was tabithas there was an irish family at the foot of the long hill that lay between the settlement and the village of albion father mother and children had prayed to the virgin before they went to bed and the grayhaired minister in the lowroofed parsonage was writing his communion sermon on a text sacred to the orthodox christian world the same moon shone over all and over millions of others worshiping strange idols and holding strange beliefs in strange far lands yet none of them owned the whole of heaven for as elder gray said it is a big place and belongs to god susanna hathaway went back to john thinking it her plain duty and to me it seems beautiful that she found waiting for her at the journeys end a new love that was better than the old found a husband to whom she could say in that first sacred hour when they were alone together never mind john lets forget and begin all over again when susanna and sue alighted at the little railway station at farnham and started to walk through the narrow streets that led to the suburbs the mothers heart beat more and more tumultuously as she realized that the issues of four lives would be settled before nightfall little did sue reck of life issues skipping like a young roe from one side of the road to the other there are the hills not a bit changed mardie she cried and the sea is just where it was heres the house with the parrot do you remember now the place where the dog barks and snarls is coming next praps hell be dead or praps hell be nicer keep close to me till we get past the gate he did nt come out so praps he is dead or gone avisiting theres that specially lazy cow thats always lying down in the buxtons field i dont blieve shes moved since we came away do you spose she stands up to be milked mardie theres the old bridge over the brook just the same only the woodbines red theres theres oh mardie look look i do blieve its our jacky sue flew over the ground like a swallow calling jacky jacky its me and mardie come home jack extricated himself from his sisters strangling hug and settled his collar im awful glad to see you sukey he said but im getting too big to be kissed besides my pockets are full of angleworms and fishhooks are you too big to be kissed even by mother called susanna hurrying to her boy who submitted to her embrace with better grace o jack jack say youre glad to see mother say it say it i cant wait jack course im glad why would nt i be i tell you im tired of aunt louisa though shes easier than she was time and again ive packed my lunch basket and started to run away but i always made it a picnic and went back again thinking theyd make such a row over me aunt louisa is always kind when youre obedient susanna urgedъ she aint so stiff as she was ellen is real worried about her and thinks shes losing her strength shes so easy to get along with hows father bettern he was has nt he been well not so very always quiet and wont eat nor play nor anything im home with him since sunday what is the matter with your clothes asked susanna casting a maternal eye over him while she pulled him down here and up there with anxious disapproving glances you look so patched and wrinkled and grubby aunt louisa and father make me keep my best to put on for you if you should come i clean up and dress every afternoon at train time only i forgot today and came fishing its too cold to fish sonny it aint too cold to fish but its too cold for em to bite corrected jack why were you expecting us just now asked susanna i did nt write because because i thought perhaps it would be better to surprise you fathers expecting you every day not just this one said jack susanna sank down on a stone at the end of the bridge and leaning her head against the railing burst into tears in that moment the worst of her fears rolled away from her heart like the stone from the mouth of a sepulcher if her husband had looked for her return he must have missed her regretted her needed her just a little his disposition was sweet even if it were thoughtless and he might not meet her with reproaches after all there might not be the cold greeting she had often feared well youve concluded to come back have you it was about time if only john were a little penitent a little anxious to meet her on some common ground she felt her task would be an easier one have you got a pain mardie cried sue anxiously bending over her mother no dear she answered smiling through her tears and stretching a hand to both children to help her to her feet no dear ive lost one i cry when anything aches not when it stops remarked jack as the three started again on their walk say sukey you look bigger and fatter than you did when you went away and youve got short curls stead of long ones do you see how ive grown two inches im inches and inches bigger and taller sue boasted standing on tiptoe and stretching herself proudly and i can knit and pull maple candy and say yee and sing o virgin church how great thy light pooh said jack i can sing a sailors lifes the life for me yo ho yo ho step along faster mummy dear its most supper time aunt louisa wont scold if youre with me theres the house see fatherll be working in the garden covering up the asters so they wont freeze before you come there is no garden jack what do you mean wait till you see if theres no garden hurrah theres father at the window side of aunt louisa wont he be pleased i met you halfway and brought you home oh it was beautiful the autumn twilight the smoke of her own hearthside rising through the brick chimneys she thought she had left the way of peace behind her
