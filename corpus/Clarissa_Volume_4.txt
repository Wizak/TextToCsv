dearest miss howe i am in london and in my new lodgings they are neatly furnished and the situation for the town is pleasant but i think you must not ask me how i like the old gentlewoman yet she seems courteous and obliging her kinswomen just appeared to welcome me at my alighting they seemed to be genteel young women but more of their aunt and them as i shall see more miss sorlings has an uncle at barnet whom she found so very ill that her uneasiness on that account having large expectations from him made me comply with her desire to stay with him yet i wished as her uncle did not expect her that she would see me settled in london and mr lovelace was still more earnest that she would offering to send her back again in a day or two and urging that her uncles malady threatened not a sudden change but leaving the matter to her choice after she knew what would have been mine she made me not the expected compliment mr lovelace however made her a handsome present at parting his genteel spirit on all occasions makes he often wish him more consistent as soon as he arrived i took possession of my apartment i shall make good use of the light closet in it if i stay here any time one of his attendants returns in the morning to the lawn and i made writing to you by him an excuse for my retiring and now give me leave to chide you my dearest friend for your rash and i hope revocable resolution not to make mr hickman the happiest man in the world while my happiness is in suspense suppose i were to be unhappy what my dear would this resolution of yours avail me marriage is the highest state of friendship if happy it lessens our cares by dividing them at the same time that it doubles our pleasures by a mutual participation why my dear if you love me will you not rather give another friend to one who has not two she is sure of had you married on your mothers last birthday as she would have had you i should not i dare say have wanted a refuge that would have saved me many mortifications and much disgrace here i was broke in upon by mr lovelace introducing the widow leading in a kinswoman of hers to attend me if i approved of her till my hannah should come or till i had provided myself with some other servant the widow gave her many good qualities but said that she had one great defect which was that she could not write nor read writing that part of her education having been neglected when she was young but for discretion fidelity obligingness she was not to be outdone by any body so commented her likewise for her skill at the needle as for her defect i can easily forgive that she is very likely and genteel too genteel indeed i think for a servant but what i like least of all in her she has a strange sly eye i never saw such an eye halfconfident i think but indeed mrs sinclair herself for that is the widows name has an odd winking eye and her respectfulness seems too much studied methinks for the london ease and freedom but people cant help their looks you know and after all she is extremely civil and obliging and as for the young woman dorcas is her name she will not be long with me i accepted her how could i do otherwise if i had had a mind to make objections which in my present situation i had not her aunt present and the young woman also present and mr lovelace officious in his introducing them to oblige me but upon their leaving me i told him who seemed inclinable to begin a conversation with me that i desired that this apartment might be considered as my retirement that when i saw him it might be in the diningroom which is up a few stairs for this backhouse being once two the rooms do not all of them very conveniently communicate with each other and that i might be as little broken in upon as possible when i am here he withdrew very respectfully to the door but there stopt and asked for my company then in the diningroom if he were about setting out for other lodgings i would go with him now i told him but if he did not just then go i would first finish my letter to miss howe i see he has no mind to leave me if he can help it my brothers scheme may give him a pretence to try to engage me to dispense with his promise but if i now do i must acquit him of it entirely my approbation of his tender behaviour in the midst of my grief has given him a right as he seems to think of addressing me with all the freedom of an approved lover i see by this man that when once a woman embarks with this sex there is no receding one concession is but the prelude to another with them he has been ever since sunday last continually complaining of the distance i keep him at and thinks himself entitled now to call in question my value for him strengthening his doubts by my former declared readiness to give him up to a reconciliation with my friends and yet has himself fallen off from that obsequious tenderness if i may couple the words which drew from me the concessions he builds upon while we were talking at the door my new servant came up with an invitation to us both to tea i said he might accept of it if he pleased but i must pursue my writing and not choosing either tea or supper i desired him to make my excuses below as to both and inform them of my choice to be retired as much as possible yet to promise for me my attendance on the widow and her nieces at breakfast in the morning he objected particularly in the eye of strangers as to avoiding supper you know said i and you can tell them that i seldom eat suppers my spirits are low you must never urge me against a declared choice pray mr lovelace inform them of all my particularities if they are obliging they will allow for them i come not hither to make new acquaintance i have turned over the books i found in my closet and am not a little pleased with them and think the better of the people of the house for their sakes stanhopes gospels sharps tillotsons and souths sermons nelsons feasts and fasts a sacramental piece of the bishop of man and another of dr gauden bishop of exeter and inetts devotions are among the devout books and among those of a lighter turn the following not ill chosen ones a telemachus in french another in english steels rowes and shakespeares plays that genteel comedy of mr cibber the careless husband and others of the same author drydens miscellanies the tatlers spectators and guardians popes and swifts and addisons works in the blank leaves of the nelson and bishop gauden is mrs sinclairs name and in those of most of the others either sarah martin or mary horton the names of the two nieces i am exceedingly out of humour with mr lovelace and have great reason to be so as you will allow when you have read the conversation i am going to give you an account of for he would not let me rest till i gave him my company in the diningroom he began with letting me know that he had been out to inquire after the character of the widow which was the more necessary he said as he supposed that i would expect his frequent absence i did i said and that he would not think of taking up his lodging in the same house with me but what said i is the result of your inquiry why indeed the widows character was in the main what he liked well enough but as it was miss howes opinion as i had told him that my brother had not given over his scheme as the widow lived by letting lodgings and had others to let in the same part of the house which might be taken by an enemy he knew no better way than for him to take them all as it could not be for a long time unless i would think of removing to others so far was well enough but as it was easy for me to see that he spoke the slighter of the widow in order to have a pretence to lodge here himself i asked him his intention in that respect and he frankly owned that if i chose to stay here he could not as matters stood think of leaving me for six hours together and he had prepared the widow to expect that we should be here but for a few days only till we could fix ourselves in a house suitable to our condition and this that i might be under the less embarrassment if i pleased to remove fix ourselves in a house and we and our mr lovelace pray in what light he interrupted me why my dearest life if you will hear me with patience yet i am half afraid that i have been too forward as i have not consulted you upon it but as my friends in town according to what mr doleman has written in the letter you have seen conclude us to be married surely sir you have not presumed hear me out my dearest creature you have received with favour my addresses you have made me hope for the honour of your consenting hand yet by declining my most fervent tender of myself to you at mrs sorlingss have given me apprehensions of delay i would not for the world be thought so ungenerous a wretch now you have honoured me with your confidence as to wish to precipitate you yet your brothers schemes are not given up singleton i am afraid is actually in town his vessel lies at rotherhithe your brother is absent from harlowe place indeed not with singleton yet as i can hear if you are known to be mine or if you are but thought to be so there will probably be an end of your brothers contrivances the widows character may be as worthy as it is said to be but the worthier she is the more danger if your brothers agent should find us out since she may be persuaded that she ought in conscience to take a parents part against a child who stands in opposition to them but if she believes us married her good character will stand us instead and give her a reason why two apartments are requisite for us at the hour of retirement i perfectly raved at him i would have flung from him in resentment but he would not let me and what could i do whither go the evening advanced i am astonished at you said i if you are a man of honour what need of all this strange obliquity you delight in crooked ways let me know since i must stay in your company for he held my hand let me know all you have said to the people below indeed indeed mr lovelace you are a very unaccountable man my dearest creature need i to have mentioned any thing of this and could i not have taken up my lodgings in this house unknown to you if i had not intended to make you the judge of all my proceedings but this is what i have told the widow before her kinswomen and before your new servant that indeed we were privately married at hertford but that you had preliminarily bound me under a solemn vow which i am most religiously resolved to keep to be contented with separate apartments and even not to lodge under the same roof till a certain reconciliation shall take place which is of high consequence to both and further that i might convince you of the purity of my intentions and that my whole view in this was to prevent mischief i have acquainted them that i have solemnly promised to behave to you before every body as if we were only betrothed and not married not even offering to take any of those innocent freedoms which are not refused in the most punctilious loves and then he solemnly vowed to me the strictest observance of the same respectful behaviour to me i said that i was not by any means satisfied with the tale he had told nor with the necessity he wanted to lay me under of appearing what i was not that every step he took was a wry one a needless wry one and since he thought it necessary to tell the people below any thing about me i insisted that he should unsay all he had said and tell them the truth what he had told them he said was with so many circumstances that he could sooner die than contradict it and still he insisted upon the propriety of appearing to be married for the reasons he had given before and dearest creature said he why this high displeasure with me upon so wellintended an expedient you know that i cannot wish to shun your brother or his singleton but upon your account the first step i would take if left to myself would be to find them out i have always acted in this manner when any body has presumed to give out threatenings against it tis true i would have consulted you first and had your leave but since you dislike what i have said let me implore you dearest madam to give the only proper sanction to it by naming an early day would to heaven that were to be tomorrow for gods sake let it be tomorrow but if not was it his business my dear before i spoke yet he seemed to be afraid of me to say if not let me beseech you madam if my behaviour shall not be to your dislike that you will not tomorrow at breakfasttime discredit what i have told them the moment i give you cause to think that i take any advantage of your concession that moment revoke it and expose me as i shall deserve and once more let me remind you that i have no view either to serve or save myself by this expedient it is only to prevent a probable mischief for your own minds sake and for the sake of those who deserve not the least consideration from me what could i say what could i do i verily think that had he urged me again in a proper manner i should have consented little satisfied as i am with him to give him a meeting tomorrow morning at a more solemn place than in the parlour below but this i resolve that he shall not have my consent to stay a night under this roof he has now given me a stronger reason for this determination than i had before alas my dear how vain a thing to say what we will or what we will not do when we have put ourselves into the power of this sex he went down to the people below on my desiring to be left to myself and staid till their supper was just ready and then desiring a moments audience as he called it he besought my leave to stay that one night promising to set out either for lord ms or for edgeware to his friend belfords in the morning after breakfast but if i were against it he said he would not stay supper and would attend me about eight next day yet he added that my denial would have a very particular appearance to the people below from what he had told them and the more as he had actually agreed for all the vacant apartments indeed only for a month for the reasons he before hinted at but i need not stay here two days if upon conversing with the widow and her nieces in the morning i should have any dislike to them i thought notwithstanding my resolution abovementioned that it would seem too punctilious to deny him under the circumstances he had mentioned having besides no reason to think he would obey me for he looked as if he were determined to debate the matter with me and now as i see no likelihood of a reconciliation with my friends and as i have actually received his addresses i thought i would not quarrel with him if i could help it especially as he asked to stay but for one night and could have done so without my knowing it and you being of opinion that the proud wretch distrusting his own merits with me or at least my regard for him will probably bring me to some concessions in his favour for all these reasons i thought proper to yield this point yet i was so vexed with him on the other that it was impossible for me to comply with that grace which a concession should be made with or not made at all this was what i said what you will do you must do i think you are very ready to promise very ready to depart from your promise you say however that you will set out tomorrow for the country you know how ill i have been i am not well enough now to debate with you upon your encroaching ways i am utterly dissatisfied with the tale you have told below nor will i promise to appear to the people of the house tomorrow what i am not he withdrew in the most respectful manner beseeching me only to favour him with such a meeting in the morning as might not make the widow and her nieces think he had given me reason to be offended with him i retired to my own apartment and dorcas came to me soon after to take my commands i told her that i required very little attendance and always dressed and undressed myself she seemed concerned as if she thought i had repulsed her and said it should be her whole study to oblige me i told her that i was not difficult to be pleased and should let her know from time to time what assistance i should expect from her but for that night i had no occasion for her further attendance she is not only genteel but is well bred and well spoken she must have had what is generally thought to be the polite part of education but it is strange that fathers and mothers should make so light as they generally do of that preferable part in girls which would improve their minds and give a grace to all the rest as soon as she was gone i inspected the doors the windows the wainscot the dark closet as well as the light one and finding very good fastenings to the door and to all the windows i again had recourse to my pen mrs sinclair is just now gone from me dorcas she told me had acquainted her that i had dismissed her for the night she came to ask me how i liked my apartment and to wish me good rest she expressed her concern that they could not have my company at supper mr lovelace she said had informed them of my love of retirement she assured me that i should not be broken in upon she highly extolled him and gave me a share in the praise as to person but was sorry she said that she was likely to lose us so soon as mr lovelace talked of i answered her with suitable civility and she withdrew with great tokens of respect with greater i think than should be from distance of years as she was the wife of a gentleman and as the appearance of every thing about her as well house as dress carries the marks of such good circumstances as require not abasement if my dear you will write against prohibition be pleased to direct to miss laetitia beaumont to be left till called for at mr wilsons in pall mall mr lovelace proposed this direction to me not knowing of your desire that your letters should pass by a third hand as his motive for it was that my brother might not trace out where we are i am glad as well from this instance as from others that he seems to think he has done mischief enough already do you know how my poor hannah does mr lovelace is so full of his contrivances and expedients that i think it may not be amiss to desire you to look carefully to the seals of my letters as i shall to those of yours if i find him base in this particular i shall think him capable of any evil and will fly him as my worst enemy letter ii miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe with her two last letters no lviii lix of vol iii enclosed thursday night april i have yours just brought me mr hickman has helped me to a lucky expedient which with the assistance of the post will enable me to correspond with you every day an honest higler simon collins his name by whom i shall send this and the two enclosed now i have your direction whither goes to town constantly on mondays wednesdays and fridays and can bring back to me from mr wilsons what you shall have caused to be left for me i congratulate you on your arrival in town so much amended in spirits i must be brief i hope youll have no cause to repent returning my norris it is forthcoming on demand i am sorry your hannah cant be with you she is very ill still but not dangerously i long for your account of the women you are with if they are not right people you will find them out in one breakfasting i know not what to write upon his reporting to them that you are actually married his reasons for it are plausible but he delights in odd expedients and inventions whether you like the people or not do not by your noble sincerity and plain dealing make yourself enemies you are in the real world now you know i am glad you had thoughts of taking him at his offer if he had reurged it i wonder he did not but if he do not soon and in such a way as you can accept of it dont think of staying with him depend upon it my dear he will not leave you either night or day if he can help it now he has got footing i should have abhorred him for his report of your marriage had he not made it with such circumstances as leave it still in your power to keep him at distance if once he offer at the least familiarity but this is needless to say to you he can have i think no other design but what he professes because he must needs think that his report of being married to you must increase your vigilance you may depend upon my looking narrowly into the sealings of your letters if as you say he be base in that point he will be so in every thing but to a person of your merit of your fortune of your virtue he cannot be base the man is no fool it is his interest as well with regard to his expectations from his own friends as from you to be honest would to heaven however you were really married this is now the predominant wish of your anna howe letter iii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe thursday morning eight oclock i am more and more displeased with mr lovelace on reflection for his boldness in hoping to make me though but passively as i may say testify to his great untruth and i shall like him still less for it if his view in it does not come out to be the hope of accelerating my resolution in his favour by the difficulty it will lay me under as to my behaviour to him he has sent me his compliments by dorcas with a request that i will permit him to attend me in the diningroom meet him in good humour or not but i have answered that as i shall see him at breakfasttime i desired to be excused ten oclock i tried to adjust my countenance before i went down to an easier air than i had a heart and was received with the highest tokens of respect by the widow and her two nieces agreeable young women enough in their persons but they seemed to put on an air of reserve while mr lovelace was easy and free to all as if he were of long acquaintance with them gracefully enough i cannot but say an advantage which travelled gentlemen have over other people the widow in the conversation we had after breakfast gave us an account of the military merit of the colonel her husband and upon this occasion put her handkerchief to her eyes twice or thrice i hope for the sake of her sincerity she wetted it because she would be thought to have done so but i saw not that she did she wished that i might never know the loss of a husband so dear to me as her beloved colonel was to her and she again put the handkerchief to her eyes it must no doubt be a most affecting thing to be separated from a good husband and to be left in difficult circumstances besides and that not by his fault and exposed to the insults of the base and ungrateful as she represented her case to be at his death this moved me a good deal in her favour you know my dear that i have an open and free heart and naturally have as open and free a countenance at least my complimenters have told me so at once where i like i mingle minds without reserve encouraging reciprocal freedoms and am forward to dissipate diffidences but with these two nieces of the widow i never can be intimate i dont know why only that circumstances and what passed in conversation encouraged not the notion or i should have been apt to think that the young ladies and mr lovelace were of longer acquaintance than of yesterday for he by stealth as it were cast glances sometimes at them when they returned and on my ocular notice their eyes fell as i may say under my eye as if they could not stand its examination the widow directed all her talk to me as to mrs lovelace and i with a very ill grace bore it and once she expressed more forwardly than i thanked her for her wonder that any vow any consideration however weighty could have force enough with so charming a couple as she called him and me to make us keep separate beds their eyes upon this hint had the advantage of mine yet was i not conscious of guilt how know i then upon recollection that my censures upon there are not too rash there are no doubt many truly modest persons putting myself out of the question who by blushes at an injurious charge have been suspected by those who cannot distinguish between the confusion which guilt will be attended with and the noble consciousness that overspreads the face of a fine spirit to be thought but capable of an imputed evil the great roman as we read who took his surname from one part in three the fourth not then discovered of the world he had triumphed over being charged with a great crime to his soldiery chose rather to suffer exile the punishment due to it had he been found guilty than to have it said that scipio was questioned in public on so scandalous a charge and think you my dear that scipio did not blush with indignation when the charge was first communicated to him mr lovelace when the widow expressed her forward wonder looked sly and leering as if to observe how i took it and said they might take notice that his regard for my will and pleasure calling me his dear creature had greater force upon him than the oath by which he had bound himself rebuking both him and the widow i said it was strange to me to hear an oath or vow so lightly treated as to have it thought but of second consideration whatever were the first the observation was just miss martin said for that nothing could excuse the breaking of a solemn vow be the occasion of making it what it would i asked her after the nearest church for i have been too long a stranger to the sacred worship they named st jamess st annes and another in bloomsbury and the two nieces said they oftenest went to st jamess church because of the good company as well as for the excellent preaching mr lovelace said the royal chapel was the place he oftenest went to when he was in town poor man little did i expect to hear he went to any place of devotion i asked if the presence of the visible king of comparatively but a small territory did not take off too generally the requisite attention to the service of the invisible king and maker of a thousand worlds he believed this might be so with such as came for curiosity when the royal family were present but otherwise he had seen as many contrite faces at the royal chapel as any where else and why not since the people about court have as deep scores to wipe off as any people whatsoever he spoke this with so much levity that i could not help saying that nobody questioned but he knew how to choose his company your servant my dear bowing were his words and turning to them you will observe upon numberless occasions ladies as we are further acquainted that my beloved never spares me upon these topics but i admire her as much in her reproofs as i am fond of her approbation miss horton said there was a time for every thing she could not but say that she thought innocent mirth was mighty becoming in young people very true joined in miss martin and shakespeare says well that youth is the spring of life the bloom of gaudy years with a theatrical air she spoke it and for her part she could not but admire in my spouse that charming vivacity which so well suited his time of life mr lovelace bowed the man is fond of praise more fond of it i doubt than of deserving it yet this sort of praise he does deserve he has you know an easy free manner and no bad voice and this praise so expanded his gay heart that he sung the following lines from congreve as he told us they were youth does a thousand pleasures bring which from decrepid age will fly sweets that wanton in the bosom of the spring in winters cold embraces die and this for a compliment as he said to the two nieces nor was it thrown away upon them they encored it and his compliance fixed them in my memory we had some talk about meals and the widow very civilly offered to conform to any rules i would set her i told her how easily i was pleased and how much i chose to dine by myself and that from a plate sent me from any single dish but i will not trouble you my dear with such particulars they thought me very singular and with reason but as i liked them not so very well as to forego my own choice in compliment to them i was the less concerned for what they thought and still the less as mr lovelace had put me very much out of humour with him they however cautioned me against melancholy i said i should be a very unhappy creature if i could not bear my own company mr lovelace said that he must let the ladies into my story and then they would know how to allow for my ways but my dear as you love me said the confident wretch give as little way to melancholy as possible nothing but the sweetness of your temper and your high notions of a duty that never can be deserved where you place it can make you so uneasy as you are be not angry my dear love for saying so seeing me frown i suppose and snatched my hand and kissed it i left him with them and retired to my closet and my pen just as i have written thus far i am interrupted by a message from him that he is setting out on a journey and desires to take my commands so here i will leave off to give him a meeting in the diningroom i was not displeased to see him in his ridingdress he seemed desirous to know how i liked the gentlewomen below i told him that although i did not think them very exceptionable yet as i wanted not in my present situation new acquaintance i should not be fond of cultivating theirs he urged me still farther on this head i could not say i told him that i greatly liked either of the young gentlewomen any more than their aunt and that were my situation ever so happy they had much too gay a turn for me he did not wonder he said to hear me say so he knew not any of the sex who had been accustomed to show themselves at the town diversions and amusements that would appear tolerable to me silences and blushes madam are now no graces with our fine ladies in town hardened by frequent public appearances they would be as much ashamed to be found guilty of these weaknesses as men do you defend these two gentlewomen sir by reflections upon half the sex but you must second me mr lovelace and yet i am not fond of being thought particular in my desire of breakfasting and supping when i do sup by myself if i would have it so to be sure it should be so the people of the house were not of consequence enough to be apologized to in any point where my pleasure was concerned and if i should dislike them still more on further knowledge of them he hoped i would think of some other lodgings he expressed a good deal of regret at leaving me declaring that it was absolutely in obedience to my commands but that he could not have consented to go while my brothers schemes were on foot if i had not done him the credit of my countenance in the report he had made that we were married which he said had bound all the family to his interest so that he could leave me with the greater security and satisfaction he hoped he said that on his return i would name his happy day and the rather as i might be convinced by my brothers projects that no reconciliation was to be expected i told him that perhaps i might write one letter to my uncle harlowe he once loved me i should be easier when i had made one direct application i might possibly propose such terms in relation to my grandfathers estate as might procure me their attention and i hoped he would be long enough absent to give me time to write to him and receive an answer from him that he must beg my pardon he could not promise he would inform himself of singletons and my brothers motions and if on his return he found no reason for apprehension he would go directly for berks and endeavour to bring up with him his cousin charlotte who he hoped would induce me to give him an earlier day than at present i seemed to think of i seemed to think of my dear very acquiescent as i should imagine i told him that i should take that young ladys company for a great favour i was the more pleased with this motion as it came from himself and with no ill grace he earnestly pressed me to accept of a bank note but i declined it and then he offered me his servant william for my attendant in his absence who he said might be dispatched to him if any thing extraordinary fell out i consented to that he took his leave of me in the most respectful manner only kissing my hand he left the bank note unobserved by me upon the table you may be sure i shall give it him back at his return i am in a much better humour with him than i was where doubts of any person are removed a mind not ungenerous is willing by way of amends for having conceived those doubts to construe every thing that happens capable of a good instruction in that persons favour particularly i cannot but be pleased to observe that although he speaks of the ladies of his family with the freedom of relationship yet it is always of tenderness and from a mans kindness to his relations of the sex a woman has some reason to expect his good behaviour to herself when married if she be willing to deserve it from him and thus my dear am i brought to sit down satisfied with this man where i find room to infer that he is not by nature a savage but how could a creature who treating herself unpolitely gave a man an opportunity to run away with her expect to be treated by that man with a very high degree of politeness but why now when fairer prospects seem to open why these melancholy reflections will my beloved friend ask of her clarissa why can you ask why my dearest miss howe of a creature who in the worlds eye had enrolled her name among the giddy and inconsiderate who labours under a parents curse and the cruel uncertainties which must arise from reflecting that equally against duty and principle she has thrown herself into the power of a man and that man an immoral one must not the sense she has of her inconsideration darken her most hopeful prospects must it not even rise strongest upon a thoughtful mind when her hopes are the fairest even her pleasures were the man to prove better than she expects coming to her with an abatement like that which persons who are in possession of illgotten wealth must then most poignantly experience if they have reflecting and unseared minds when all their wishes answered if answered they sit down in hopes to enjoy what they have unjustly obtained and find their own reflections their greatest torment may you my dear friend be always happy in your reflections prays your ever affectionate cl harlowe mr lovelace in his next letter triumphs on his having carried his two great points of making the lady yield to pass for his wife to the people of the house and to his taking up his lodging in it though but for one night he is now he says in a fair way and doubts not but that he shall soon prevail if not by persuasion by surprise yet he pretends to have some little remorse and censures himself as to acting the part of the grand tempter but having succeeded thus far he cannot he says forbear trying according to the resolution he had before made whether he cannot go farther he gives the particulars of their debates on the abovementioned subjects to the same effect as in the ladys last letters it will by this time be seen that his whole merit with regard to the lady lies in doing justice to her excellencies both of mind and person though to his own condemnation thus he begins his succeeding letter and now belford will i give thee an account of our first breakfast conversation all sweetly serene and easy was the lovely brow and charming aspect of my goddess on her descending among us commanding reverence from every eye a courtesy from every knee and silence awful silence from every quivering lip while she armed with conscious worthiness and superiority looked and behaved as an empress would look and behave among her vassals yet with a freedom from pride and haughtiness as if born to dignity and to a behaviour habitually gracious he takes notice of the jealousy pride and vanity of sally martin and polly horton on his respectful behaviour to the lady creatures who brought up too high for their fortunes and to a taste of pleasure and the public diversions had fallen an easy prey to his seducing arts as will be seen in the conclusion of this work and who as he observed had not yet got over that distinction in their love which makes a woman prefer one man to another how difficult is it says he to make a woman subscribe to a preference against herself though ever so visible especially where love is concerned this violent this partial little devil sally has the insolence to compare herself with my angel yet owns her to be an angel i charge you mr lovelace say she show none of your extravagant acts of kindness before me to this sullen this gloomy beauty i cannot bear it then was i reminded of her first sacrifice what a rout do these women make about nothing at all were it not for what the learned bishop in his letter from italy calls the entanglements of amour and i the delicacies of intrigue what is there belford in all they can do for us how do these creatures endeavour to stimulate me a fallen woman is a worse devil than ever a profligate man the former is incapable of remorse that am not i nor ever shall they prevail upon me though aided by all the powers of darkness to treat this admirable creature with indignity so far i mean as indignity can be separated from the trials which will prove her to be either woman or angel yet with them i am a craven i might have had her before now if i would if i would treat her as flesh and blood i should find her such they thought i knew if any man living did that if a man made a goddess of a woman she would assume the goddess that if power were given to her she would exert that power to the giver if to nobody else and drs wife is thrown into my dish who thou knowest kept her ceremonious husband at haughty distance and whined in private to her insulting footman o how i cursed the blasphemous wretches they will make me as i tell them hate their house and remove from it and by my soul jack i am ready at times to think that i should not have brought her hither were it but on sallys account and yet without knowing either sallys heart or pollys the dear creature resolves against having any conversation with them but such as she can avoid i am not sorry for this thou mayest think since jealousy in a woman is not to be concealed from woman and sally has no command of herself what dost think here this little devil sally not being able as she told me to support life under my displeasure was going into a fit but when i saw her preparing for it i went out of the room and so she thought it would not be worth her while to show away in this manner he mentions what his meaning was in making the lady the compliment of his absence as to leaving her if i go but for one night i have fulfilled my promise and if she think not i can mutter and grumble and yield again and make a merit of it and then unable to live out of her presence soon return nor are women ever angry at bottom for being disobeyed through excess of love they like an uncontroulable passion they like to have every favour ravished from them and to be eaten and drunk quite up by a voracious lover dont i know the sex not so indeed as yet my clarissa but however with her my frequent egresses will make me look new to her and create little busy scenes between us at the least i may surely without exception salute her at parting and at return and will not those occasional freedoms which civility will warrant by degrees familiarize my charmer to them but here jack what shall i do with my uncle and aunts and all my loving cousins for i understand that they are more in haste to have me married than i am myself letter iv miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe friday april mr lovelace is returned already my brothers projects were his pretence i could not but look upon this short absence as an evasion of his promise especially as he had taken such precautions with the people below and as he knew that i proposed to keep close withindoors i cannot bear to be dealt meanly with and angrily insisted that he should directly set out for berkshire in order to engage his cousin as he had promised o my dearest life said he why will you banish me from your presence i cannot leave you for so long a time as you seem to expect i should i have been hovering about town ever since i left you edgware was the farthest place i went to and there i was not able to stay two hours for fear at this crisis any thing should happen who can account for the workings of an apprehensive mind when all that is dear and valuable to it is at stake you may spare yourself the trouble of writing to any of your friends till the solemnity has passed that shall entitle me to give weight to your application when they know we are married your brothers plots will be at an end and your father and mother and uncles must be reconciled to you why then should you hesitate a moment to confirm my happiness why once more would you banish me from you why will you not give the man who has brought you into difficulties and who so honourably wishes to extricate you from them the happiness of doing so he was silent my voice failed to second the inclination i had to say something not wholly discouraging to a point so warmly pressed ill tell you my angel resumed he what i propose to do if you approve of it i will instantly go out to view some of the handsome new squares or fine streets round them and make a report to you of any suitable house i find to be let i will take such a one as you shall choose and set up an equipage befitting our condition you shall direct the whole and on some early day either before or after we fix it must be at your own choice be pleased to make me the happiest of men and then will every thing be in a desirable train you shall receive in your own house if it can be so soon furnished as i wish the compliments of all my relations charlotte shall visit you in the interim and if it take up time you shall choose whom you will honour with your company first second or third in the summer months and on your return you shall find all that was wanting in your new habitation supplied and pleasures in a constant round shall attend us o my angel take me to you instead of banishing me from you and make me yours for ever you see my dear that here was no day pressed for i was not uneasy about that and the sooner recovered myself as there was not but however i gave him no reason to upbraid me for refusing his offer of going in search of a house he is accordingly gone out for this purpose but i find that he intends to take up his lodging here tonight and if tonight no doubt on other nights while he is in town as the doors and windows of my apartment have good fastenings as he has not in all this time given me cause for apprehension as he has the pretence of my brothers schemes to plead as the people below are very courteous and obliging miss horton especially who seems to have taken a great liking to me and to be of a gentler temper and manners than miss martin and as we are now in a tolerable way i imagine it would look particular to them all and bring me into a debate with a man who let him be set upon what he will has always a great deal to say for himself if i were to insist upon his promise on all these accounts i think i will take no notice of his lodging here if he dont let me know my dear your thoughts of every thing you may believe i gave him back his bank note the moment i saw him friday evening mr lovelace has seen two or three houses but none to his mind but he has heard of one which looks promising he says and which he is to inquire about in the morning saturday morning he has made his inquiries and actually seen the house he was told of last night the owner of it is a young widow lady who is inconsolable for the death of her husband fretchville her name it is furnished quite in taste every thing being new within these six months he believes if i like not the furniture the use of it may be agreed for with the house for a time certain but if i like it he will endeavour to take the one and purchase the other directly the lady sees nobody nor are the best apartments abovestairs to be viewed till she is either absent or gone into the country which she talks of doing in a fortnight or three weeks at farthest and to live there retired what mr lovelace saw of the house which were the saloon and two parlours was perfectly elegant and he was assured all is of a piece the offices are also very convenient coachhouse and stables at hand he shall be very impatient he says till i see the whole nor will he if he finds he can have it look farther till i have seen it except any thing else offer to my liking the price he values not he now does nothing but talk of the ceremony but not indeed of the day i dont want him to urge that but i wonder he does not he has just now received a letter from lady betty lawrance by a particular hand the contents principally relating to an affair she has in chancery but in the postscript she is pleased to say very respectful things of me they are all impatient she says for the happy day being over which they flatter themselves will ensure his reformation he hoped he told me that i would soon enable him to answer their wishes and his own but my dear although the opportunity was so inviting he urged not for the day which is the more extraordinary as he was so pressing for marriage before we came to town he was very earnest with me to give him and four of his friends my company on monday evening at a little collation miss martin and miss horton cannot he says be there being engaged in a party of their own with two daughters of colonel solcombe and two nieces of sir anthony holmes upon an annual occasion but mrs sinclair will be present and she gave him hope of the company of a young lady of very great fortune and merit miss partington an heiress to whom colonel sinclair it seems in his lifetime was guardian and who therefore calls mrs sinclair mamma i desired to be excused he had laid me i said under a most disagreeable necessity of appearing as a married person and i would see as few people as possible who were to think me so he would not urge it he said if i were much averse but they were his select friends men of birth and fortune who longed to see me it was true he added that they as well as his friend doleman believed we were married but they thought him under the restrictions that he had mentioned to the people below i might be assured he told me that his politeness before them should be carried into the highest degree of reverence when he is set upon any thing there is no knowing as i have said heretofore what one can do but i will not if i can help it be made a show of especially to men of whose character and principles i have no good opinion i am my dearest friend your ever affectionate cl harlowe see letter i of this volume see also vol ii letter xx mr lovelace in his next letter gives an account of his quick return of his reasons to the lady for it of her displeasure upon it and of her urging his absence from the safety she was in from the situation of the house except she were to be traced out by his visits i was confoundedly puzzled says he on this occasion and on her insisting upon the execution of a tooready offer which i made her go down to berks to bring up my cousin charlotte to visit and attend her i made miserable excuses and fearing that they would be mortally resented as her passion began to rise upon my saying charlotte was delicate which she took strangely wrong i was obliged to screen myself behind the most solemn and explicit declarations he then repeats those declarations to the same effect with the account she gives of them i began says he with an intention to keep my life of honour in view in the declaration i made her but as it has been said of a certain orator in the house of commons who more than once in a long speech convinced himself as he went along and concluded against the side he set out intending to favour so i in earnest pressed without reserve for matrimony in the progress of my harangue which state i little thought of urging upon her with so much strength and explicitness he then values himself upon the delay that his proposal of taking and furnishing a house must occasion he wavers in his resolutions whether to act honourable or not by a merit so exalted he values himself upon his own delicacy in expressing his indignation against her friends for supposing what he pretends his heart rises against them for presuming to suppose but have i not reason says he to be angry with her for not praising me for this my delicacy when she is so ready to call me to account for the least failure in punctilio however i believe i can excuse her too upon this generous consideration for generous i am sure it is because it is against myself that her mind being the essence of delicacy the least want of it shocks her while the meeting with what is so very extraordinary to me is too familiar to her to obtain her notice as an extraordinary he glories in the story of the house and of the young widow possessor of it mrs fretchville he calls her and leaves it doubtful to mr belford whether it be a real or a fictitious story he mentions his different proposals in relation to the ceremony which he so earnestly pressed for and owns his artful intention in avoiding to name the day and now says he i hope soon to have an opportunity to begin my operations since all is halcyon and security it is impossible to describe the dear creatures sweet and silent confusion when i touched upon the matrimonial topics she may doubt she may fear the wise in all important cases will doubt and will fear till they are sure but her apparent willingness to think well of a spirit so inventive and so machinating is a happy prognostic for me o these reasoning ladies how i love these reasoning ladies tis all over with them when once love has crept into their hearts for then will they employ all their reasoning powers to excuse rather than to blame the conduct of the doubted lover let appearances against him be ever so strong mowbray belton and tourville long to see my angel and will be there she has refused me but must be present notwithstanding so generous a spirit as mine is cannot enjoy its happiness without communication if i raise not your envy and admiration both at once but halfjoy will be the joy of having such a charming fly entangled in my web she therefore must comply and thou must come and then will show thee the pride and glory of the harlowe family my implacable enemies and thou shalt join with me in my triumph over them all i know not what may still be the perverse beautys fate i want thee therefore to see and admire her while she is serene and full of hope before her apprehensions are realized if realized they are to be and if evil apprehensions of me she really has before her beamy eyes have lost their lustre while yet her charming face is surrounded with all its virgin glories and before the plough of disappointment has thrown up furrows of distress upon every lovely feature if i can procure you this honour you will be ready to laugh out as i have often much ado to forbear at the puritanical behaviour of the mother before this lady not an oath not a curse nor the least free word escapes her lips she minces in her gait she prims up her horsemouth her voice which when she pleases is the voice of thunder is sunk into an humble whine her stiff hams that have not been bent to a civility for ten years past are now limbered into courtesies three deep at ever word her fat arms are crossed before her and she can hardly be prevailed upon to sit in the presence of my goddess i am drawing up instructions for ye all to observe on monday night saturday night most confoundedly alarmed lord sir what do you think cried dorcas my lady is resolved to go to church tomorrow i was at quadrille with the women below to church said i and down i laid my cards to church repeated they each looking upon the other we had done playing for that night who could have dreamt of such a whim as this without notice without questions her clothes not come no leave asked impossible she should think of being my wife besides she dont consider if she go to church i must go too yet not to ask for my company her brother and singleton ready to snap her up as far as she knows known by her clothes her person her features so distinguished not such another woman in england to church of all places is the devil in the girl said i as soon as i could speak well but to leave this subject till tomorrow morning i will now give you the instructions i have drawn up for yours and your companions behaviour on monday night instructions to be observed by john belford richard mowbray thomas belton and james tourville esquires of the body to general robert lovelace on their admission to the presence of his goddess ye must be sure to let it sink deep into your heavy heads that there is no such lady in the world as miss clarissa harlowe and that she is neither more nor less than mrs lovelace though at present to my shame be it spoken a virgin be mindful also that your old mothers name after that of her mother when a maid is sinclair that her husband was a lieutenantcolonel and all that you belford know from honest dolemans letter of her that let your brethren know see letter xxxviii vol iii mowbray and tourville the two greatest blunderers of the four i allow to be acquainted with the widow and nieces from the knowledge they had of the colonel they will not forbear familiarities of speech to the mother as of longer acquaintance than a day so i have suited their parts to their capacities they may praise the widow and the colonel for people of great honour but not too grossly nor to labour the point so as to render themselves suspected the mother will lead ye into her own and the colonels praises and tourville and mowbray may be both her vouchers i and you and belton must be only hearsay confirmers as poverty is generally suspectible the widow must be got handsomely aforehand and no doubt but she is the elegance of her house and furniture and her readiness to discharge all demands upon her which she does with ostentation enough and which makes her neighbours i suppose like her the better demonstrate this she will propose to do handsome things by her two nieces sally is near marriage with an eminent woollendraper in the strand if ye have a mind to it for there are five or six of them there the nieces may be inquired after since they will be absent as persons respected by mowbray and tourville for their late worthy uncles sake watch ye diligently every turn of my countenance every motion of my eye for in my eye and in my countenance will ye find a sovereign regulator i need not bid you respect me mightily your allegiance obliges you to that and who that sees me respects me not priscilla partington for her looks so innocent and discretion so deep yet seeming so softly may be greatly relied upon she will accompany the mother gorgeously dressed with all her jews extravagance flaming out upon her and first induce then countenance the lady she has her cue and i hope will make her acquaintance coveted by my charmer miss partingtons history is this the daughter of colonel sinclairs brotherinlaw that brotherinlaw may have been a turkeymerchant or any merchant who died confoundedly rich the colonel one of her guardians collateral credit in that to the old one whence she always calls mrs sinclair mamma though not succeeding to the trust she is just come to pass a day or two and then to return to her surviving guardians at barnet miss partington has suitors a little hundred her grandmother an aldermans dowager having left her a great additional fortune and is not trusted out of her guardians house without an old governante noted for discretion except to her mamma sinclair with whom nowandthen she is permitted to be for a week together pris will mammaup mrs sinclair and will undertake to court her guardian to let her pass a delightful week with her sir edward holden he may as well be if your shallow pates will not be clogged with too many circumstantials lady holden perhaps will come with her for she always delighted in her mamma sinclairs company and talks of her and her good management twenty times a day be it principally thy part jack who art a parading fellow and aimest at wisdom to keep thy brothervarlets from blundering for as thou must have observed from what i have written we have the most watchful and most penetrating lady in the world to deal with a lady worth deceiving but whose eyes will piece to the bottom of your shallow souls the moment she hears you open do you therefore place thyself between mowbray and tourville their toes to be played upon and commanded by thine if they go wrong thy elbows to be the ministers of approbation as to your general behaviour no hypocrisy i hate it so does my charmer if i had studied for it i believe i could have been an hypocrite but my general character is so well known that i should have been suspected at once had i aimed at making myself too white but what necessity can there be for hypocrisy unless the generality of the sex were to refuse us for our immoralities the best of them love to have the credit for reforming us let the sweet souls try for it if they fail their intent was good that will be a consolation to them and as to us our work will be the easier our sins the fewer since they will draw themselves in with a very little of our help and we shall save a parcel of cursed falsehoods and appear to be what we are both to angels and men mean time their very grandmothers will acquit us and reproach them with their selfdo selfhave and as having erred against knowledge and ventured against manifest appearances what folly therefore for men of our character to be hypocrites be sure to instruct the rest and do thou thyself remember not to talk obscenely you know i never permitted any of you to talk obscenely time enough for that when ye grow old and can only talk besides ye must consider priscs affected character my goddesss real one far from obscenity therefore do not so much as touch upon the double entendre what as i have often said cannot you touch a ladys heart without wounding her ear it is necessary that ye should appear worse men than myself you cannot help appearing so youll say well then there will be the less restraint upon you the less restraint the less affectation and if belton begins his favourite subject in behalf of keeping it may make me take upon myself to oppose him but fear not i shall not give the argument all my force she must have some curiosity i think to see what sort of men my companions are she will not expect any of you to be saints are you not men born to considerable fortunes although ye are not all of you men of parts who is it in this mortal life that wealth does not mislead and as it gives people the power of being mischievous does it not require great virtue to forbear the use of that power is not the devil said to be the god of this world are we not children of this world well then let me tell thee my opinion it is this that were it not for the poor and the middling the world would probably long ago have been destroyed by fire from heaven ungrateful wretches the rest thou wilt be apt to say to make such sorry returns as they generally do make to the poor and the middling this dear lady is prodigiously learned in theories but as to practices as to experimentals must be as you know from her tender years a mere novice till she knew me i dare say she did not believe whatever she had read that there were such fellows in the world as she will see in you four i shall have much pleasure in observing how shell stare at her company when she finds me the politest man of the five and so much for instructions general and particular for your behaviour on monday night and let me add that you must attend to every minute circumstance whether you think there be reason for it or not deep like golden ore frequently lies my meaning and richly worth digging for the hint of least moment as you may imagine it is often pregnant with events of the greatest be implicit am i not your general did i ever lead you on that i brought you not off with safety and success sometimes to your own stupid astonishment and now methinks thou art curious to know what can be my view in risquing the displeasure of my fairone and alarming her fears after four or five halcyon days have gone over our heads ill satisfy thee the visiters of the two nieces will crowd the house beds will be scarce miss partington a sweet modest genteel girl will be prodigiously taken with my charmer will want to begin a friendship with her a share in her bed for one night only will be requested who knows but on that very monday night i may

authority civil or uncivil if i have evidence upon evidence that she acknowledged though but tacitly her marriage and should i or should i not succeed and she forgive me or if she but descend to expostulate or if she bear me in her sight then will she be all my own all delicacy is my charmer i long to see how such a delicacy on any of these occasions will behave and in my situation it behoves me to provide against every accident i must take care knowing what an eel i have to do with that the little riggling rogue does not slip through my fingers how silly should i look staring after her when she had shot from me into the muddy river her family from which with so much difficulty i have taken her well then here are let me see how many persons are there who after monday night will be able to swear that she has gone by my name answered to my name had no other view in leaving her friends but to go by my name her own relations neither able nor willing to deny it first here are my servants her servant dorcas mrs sinclair mrs sinclairs two nieces and miss partington but for fear these evidences should be suspected here comes the jet of the business no less than four worthy gentlemen of fortune and family who were all in company such a night particularly at a collation to which they were invited by robert lovelace of sandounhall in the county of lancaster esquire in company with magdalen sinclair widow and priscilla partington spinster and the lady complainant when the said robert lovelace addressed himself to the said lady on a multitude of occasions as his wife as they and others did as mrs lovelace every one complimenting and congratulating her upon her nuptials and that she received such their compliments and congratulations with no other visible displeasure or repugnance than such as a young bride full of blushes and pretty confusion might be supposed to express upon such contemplative revolvings as those compliments would naturally inspire nor do thou rave at me jack nor rebel dost think i brought the dear creature hither for nothing and heres a faint sketch of my plot stand by varlets tantararara veil your bonnets and confess your master letter v mr lovelace to john belford esq sunday have been at church jack behaved admirably well too my charmer is pleased with me now for i was exceedingly attentive to the discourse and very ready in the auditors part of the service eyes did not much wander how could they when the loveliest object infinitely the loveliest in the whole church was in my view dear creature how fervent how amiable in her devotions i have got her to own that she prayed for me i hope a prayer from so excellent a mind will not be made in vain there is after all something beautifully solemn in devotion the sabbath is a charming institution to keep the heart right when it is right one day in seven how reasonable i think ill go to church once a day often i fancy it will go a great way towards making me a reformed man to see multitudes of wellappearing people all joining in one reverend act an exercise how worthy of a rational being yet it adds a sting or two to my former stings when i think of my projects with regard to this charming creature in my conscience i believe if i were to go constantly to church i could not pursue them i had a scheme come into my head while there but i will renounce it because it obtruded itself upon me in so good a place excellent creature how many ruins has she prevented by attaching me to herself by engrossing my whole attention but let me tell thee what passed between us in my first visit of this morning and then i will acquaint thee more largely with my good behaviour at church i could not be admitted till after eight i found her ready prepared to go out i pretended to be ignorant of her intention having charged dorcas not to own that she had told me of it going abroad madam with an air of indifference yes sir i intend to go to church i hope madam i shall have the honour to attend you no she designed to take a chair and go to the next church this startled me a chair to carry her to the next church from mrs sinclairs her right name not sinclair and to bring her back hither in the face of people who might not think well of the house there was no permitting that yet i was to appear indifferent but said i should take it for a favour if she would permit me to attend her in a coach as there was time for it to st pauls she made objections to the gaiety of my dress and told me that if she went to st pauls she could go in a coach without me i objected singleton and her brother and offered to dress in the plainest suit i had i beg the favour of attending you dear madam said i i have not been at church a great while we shall sit in different stalls and the next time i go i hope it will be to give myself a title to the greatest blessing i can receive she made some further objections but at last permitted me the honour of attending her i got myself placed in her eye that the time might not seem tedious to me for we were there early and i gained her good opinion as i mentioned above by my behaviour the subject of the discourse was particular enough it was about a prophets story or parable of an ewelamb taken by a rich man from a poor one who dearly loved it and whose only comfort it was designed to strike remorse into david on his adultery with uriahs wife bathsheba and his murder of the husband these women jack have been the occasion of all manner of mischief from the beginning now when david full of indignation swore king david would swear jack but how shouldst thou know who king david was the story is in the bible that the rich man should surely die nathan which was the prophets name and a good ingenious fellow cried out which were the words of the text thou art the man by my soul i thought the parson looked directly at me and at that moment i cast my eye full on my ewelamb but i must tell thee too that that i thought a good deal of my rosebud a better man than king david in that point however thought i when we came home we talked upon the subject and i showed my charmer my attention to the discourse by letting her know where the doctor made the most of his subject and where it might have been touched to greater advantage for it is really a very affecting story and has as pretty a contrivance in it as ever i read and this i did in such a grave way that she seemed more and more pleased with me and i have no doubt that i shall get her to favour me tomorrow night with her company at my collation sunday evening we all dined together in mrs sinclairs parlour all excessively right the two nieces have topped their parts mrs sinclair hers never was so easy as now she really thought a little oddly of these people at first she said mrs sinclair seemed very forbidding her nieces were persons with whom she could not wish to be acquainted but really we should not be too hasty in our censures some people improve upon us the widow seems tolerable she went no farther than tolerable miss martin and miss horton are young people of good sense and have read a great deal what miss martin particularly said of marriage and of her humble servant was very solid she believes with such notions she cannot make a bad wife i have said sallys humble servant is a woolen draper of great reputation and she is soon to be married i have been letting her into thy character and into the characters of my other three esquires in hopes to excite her curiosity to see you tomorrow night i have told her some of the worst as well as best parts of your characters in order to exalt myself and to obviate any sudden surprizes as well as to teach her what sort of men she may expect to see if she will oblige me with her company by her afterobservation upon each of you i shall judge what i may or may not do to obtain or keep her good opinion what she will like or what not and so pursue the one or avoid the other as i see proper so while she is penetrating into your shallow heads i shall enter her heart and know what to bid my own to hope for the house is to be taken in three weeks all will be over in three weeks or bad will be my luck who knows but in three days have i not carried that great point of making her pass for my wife to the people below and that other great one of fixing myself here night and day what woman ever escaped me who lodged under one roof with me the house too the house the people people after my own heart her servants will and dorcas both my servants three days did i say pho pho pho three hours i have carried my third point but so extremely to the dislike of my charmer that i have been threatened for suffering miss partington to be introduced to her without her leave which laid her under a necessity to deny or comply with the urgent request of so fine a young lady who had engaged to honour me at my collation on condition that my beloved would be present at it to be obliged to appear before my friends as what she was not she was for insisting that i should acquaint the women here with the truth of the matter and not go on propagating stories for her to countenance making her a sharer in my guilt but what points will not perseverance carry especially when it is covered over with the face of yielding now and parthianlike returning to the charge anon do not the sex carry all their points with their men by the same methods have i conversed with them so freely as i have done and learnt nothing of them didst thou ever know that a womans denial of any favour whether the least or the greatest that my heart was set upon stood her in any stead the more perverse she the more steady i that is my rule but the point thus so much against her will carried i doubt thou will see in her more of a sullen than of an obliging charmer for when miss partington was withdrawn what was miss partington to her in her situation she wanted no new acquaintances and what were my four friends to her in her present circumstances she would assure me if ever again and there she stopped with a twirl of her hand when we meet i will in her presence tipping thee a wink show thee the motion for it was a very pretty one quite new yet have i seen an hundred pretty passionate twirls too in my time from other fairones how universally engaging is it to put a woman of sense to whom a man is not married in a passion let the reception given to every ranting scene in our plays testify take care my charmer now thou art come to delight me with thy angry twirls that thou temptest me not to provoke a variety of them from one whose every motion whose every air carries in it so much sense and soul but angry or pleased this charming creature must be all loveliness her features are all harmony and made for one another no other feature could be substituted in the place of any one of hers but most abate of her perfection and think you that i do not long to have your opinion of my fair prize if you love to see features that glow though the heart is frozen and never yet was thawed if you love fines sense and adages flowing through teeth of ivory and lips of coral an eye that penetrates all things a voice that is harmony itself an air of grandeur mingled with a sweetness that cannot be described a politeness that if ever equaled was never excelled youll see all these excellencies and ten times more in this my gloriana mark her majestic fabric shes a temple sacred by birth and built by hands divine her soul the deity that lodges there nor is the pile unworthy of the god or to describe her in a softer style with rowe the bloom of opning flowrs unsullyd beauty softness and sweetest innocence she wears and looks like nature in the worlds first spring adieu varlets four at six on monday evening i expect ye all letter vi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe sunday april mr lovelace in his last letters having taken notice of the most material passages contained in this letter the following extracts from it are only inserted she gives pretty near the same account that he does of what passed between them on her resolution to go to church and of his proposal of st pauls and desire of attending her she praises his good behaviour there as also the discourse and the preacher is pleased with its seasonableness gives particulars of the conversation between them afterwards and commends the good observations he makes upon the sermon i am willing says she to have hopes of him but am so unable to know how to depend upon his seriousness for an hour together that all my favourable accounts of him in this respect must be taken with allowance being very much pressed i could not tell how to refuse dining with the widow and her nieces this day i am better pleased with them than i ever thought i should be i cannot help blaming myself for my readiness to give severe censures where reputation is concerned peoples ways humours constitutions education and opportunities allowed for my dear many persons as far as i know may appear blameless whom others of different humours and educations are too apt to blame and who from the same fault may be as ready to blame them i will therefore make it a rule to myself for the future never to judge peremptorily on first appearances but yet i must observe that these are not people i should choose to be intimate with or whose ways i can like although for the stations they are in they may go through the world with tolerable credit mr lovelaces behaviour has been such as makes me call this so far as it is passed an agreeable day yet when easiest as to him my situation with my friends takes place in my thoughts and causes me many a tear i am the more pleased with the people of the house because of the persons of rank they are acquainted with and who visits them sunday evening i am still well pleased with mr lovelaces behaviour we have had a good deal of serious discourse together the man has really just and good notions he confesses how much he is pleased with this day and hopes for many such nevertheless he ingenuously warned me that his unlucky vivacity might return but he doubted not that he should be fixed at last by my example and conversation he has given me an entertaining account of the four gentlemen he is to meet tomorrow night entertaining i mean for his humourous description of their persons manners c but such a description as is far from being to their praise yet he seemed rather to design to divert my melancholy by it than to degrade them i think at bottom my dear that he must be a goodnatured man but that he was spoiled young for want of check or controul i cannot but call this my circumstances considered an happy day to the end of it indeed my dear i think i could prefer him to all the men i ever knew were he but to be always what he has been this day you see how ready i am to own all you have charged me with when i find myself out it is a difficult thing i believe sometimes for a young creature that is able to deliberate with herself to know when she loves or when she hates but i am resolved as much as possible to be determined both in my hatred and love by actions as they make the man worthy or unworthy she dates again monday and declares herself highly displeased at miss partingtons being introduced to her and still more for being obliged to promise to be present at mr lovelaces collation she foresees she says a murderd evening letter vii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe monday night may i have just escaped from a very disagreeable company i was obliged so much against my will to be in as a very particular relation of this evenings conversation would be painful to me you must content yourself with what you shall be able to collect from the outlines as i may call them of the characters of the persons assisted by the little histories mr lovelace gave me of each yesterday the names of the gentlemen are belton mowbray tourville and belford these four with mrs sinclair miss partington the great heiress mentioned in my last mr lovelace and myself made up the company i gave you before the favourable side of miss partingtons character such as it was given to me by mrs sinclair and her nieces i will now add a few words from my own observation upon her behaviour in this company in better company perhaps she would have appeared to less disadvantage but notwithstanding her innocent looks which mr lovelace also highly praised he is the last person whose judgment i would take upon real modesty for i observed that upon some talk from the gentlemen not free enough to be easily censured yet too indecent in its implication to come from wellbred persons in the company of virtuous prople sic this young lady was very ready to apprehend and yet by smiles and simperings to encourage rather than discourage the culpable freedoms of persons who in what they went out of their way to say must either be guilty of absurdity meaning nothing or meaning something of rudeness mr belford in letter xiii of vol v reminds mr lovelace of some particular topics which passed in their conversation extremely to the ladys honour but indeed i have seen no women of whom i had a better opinion than i can say of mrs sinclair who have allowed gentlemen and themselves too in greater liberties of this sort than i had thought consistent with that purity of manners which ought to be the distinguishing characteristic of our sex for what are words but the body and dress of thought and is not the mind of a person strongly indicated by outward dress but to the gentlemen as they must be called in right of their ancestors it seems for no other do they appear to have mr belton has had university education and was designed for the gown but that not suiting with the gaiety of his temper and an uncle dying who devised to him a good estate he quitted the college came up to town and commenced fine gentleman he is said to be a man of sense mr belton dresses gaily but not quite foppishly drinks hard keeps all hours and glories in doing so games and has been hurt by that pernicious diversion he is about thirty years of age his face is a fiery red somewhat bloated and pimply and his irregularities threaten a brief duration to the sensual dream he is in for he has a short consumption cough which seems to denote bad lungs yet makes himself and his friends merry by his stupid and inconsiderate jests upon very threatening symptoms which ought to make him more serious mr mowbray has been a great traveller speaks as many languages as mr lovelace himself but not so fluently is of a good family seems to be about thirtythree or thirtyfour tall and comely in his person bold and daring in his look is a largeboned strong man has a great scar in his forehead with a dent as if his skull had been beaten in there and a seamed scar in his right cheek he likewise dresses very gaily has his servants always about him whom he is continually calling upon and sending on the most trifling messages half a dozen instances of which we had in the little time i was among them while they seem to watch the turn of his fierce eye to be ready to run before they have half his message and serve him with fear and trembling yet to his equals the man seems tolerable he talks not amiss upon public entertainments and diversions especially upon those abroad yet has a romancing air and avers things strongly which seem quite improbable indeed he doubts nothing but what he ought to believe for he jests upon sacred things and professes to hate the clergy of all religions he has high notions of honour a world hardly ever out of his mouth but seems to have no great regard to morals mr tourville occasionally told his age just turned of thirtyone he is also of an ancient family but in his person and manners more of what i call the coxcomb than any of his companions he dresses richly would be thought elegant in the choice and fashion of what he wears yet after all appears rather tawdry than fine one sees by the care he takes of his outside and the notice he bespeaks from every one by his own notice of himself that the inside takes up the least of his attention he dances finely mr lovelace says is a master of music and singing is one of his principal excellencies they prevailed upon him to sing and he obliged them both in italian and french and to do him justice his songs in both were decent they were all highly delighted with his performance but his greatest admirers were mrs sinclair miss partington and himself to me he appeared to have a great deal of affectation mr tourvilles conversation and address are insufferably full of those really gross affronts upon the understanding of our sex which the moderns call compliments and are intended to pass for so many instances of good breeding though the most hyperbolical unnatural stuff that can be conceived and which can only serve to show the insincerity of the complimenter and the ridiculous light in which the complimented appears in his eyes if he supposes a woman capable of relishing the romantic absurdities of his speeches he affects to introduce into his common talk italian and french words and often answer an english question in french which language he greatly prefers to the barbarously hissing english but then he never fails to translate into this his odious native tongue the words and the sentences he speaks in the other two lest perhaps it should be questioned whether he understands what he says he loves to tell stories always calls them merry facetious good or excellent before he begins in order to bespeak the attention of the hearers but never gives himself concern in the progress or conclusion of them to make good what he promises in his preface indeed he seldom brings any of them to a conclusion for if his company have patience to hear him out he breaks in upon himself by so many parenthetical intrusions as one may call them and has so many incidents springing in upon him that he frequently drops his own thread and sometimes sits down satisfied half way or if at other times he would resume it he applies to his company to help him in again with a devil fetch him if he remembers what he was driving at but enough and too much of mr tourville mr belford is the fourth gentleman and one of whom mr lovelace seems more fond than any of the rest for he is a man of tried bravery it seems and this pair of friends came acquainted upon occasion of a quarrel possibly about a woman which brought on a challenge and a meeting at kensington gravelpits which ended without unhappy consequences by the mediation of three gentlemen strangers just as each had made a pass at the other mr belford it seems is about seven or eight and twenty he is the youngest of the five except mr lovelace and they are perhaps the wickedest for they seem to lead the other three as they please mr belford as the others dresses gaily but has not those advantages of person nor from his dress which mr lovelace is too proud of he has however the appearance and air of a gentleman he is well read in classical authors and in the best english poets and writers and by his means the conversation took now and then a more agreeable turn and i who endeavoured to put the best face i could upon my situation as i passed for mrs lovelace with them made shift to join in it at such times and received abundance of compliments from all the company on the observations i made see letter xiii of vol v above referred to mr belford seems goodnatured and obliging and although very complaisant not so fulsomely so as mr tourville and has a polite and easy manner of expressing his sentiments on all occasions he seems to delight in a logical way of argumentation as also does mr belton these two attacked each other in this way and both looked at us women as if to observe whether we did not admire this learning or when they had said a smart thing their wit but mr belford had visibly the advantage of the other having quicker parts and by taking the worst side of the argument seemed to think he had upon the whole of his behaviour and conversation he put me in mind of that character of milton his tongue dropt manna and could make the worse appear the better reason to perplex and dash maturest counsels for his thoughts were low to vice industrious but to nobler deeds timrous and slothful yet he pleased the ear how little soever matters in general may be to our liking we are apt when hope is strong enough to permit it to endeavour to make the best we can of the lot we have drawn and i could not but observe often how much mr lovelace excelled all his four friends in every thing they seemed desirous to excel in but as to wit and vivacity he had no equal there all the others gave up to him when his lips began to open the haughty mowbray would call upon the prating tourville for silence when lovelace was going to speak and when he had spoken the words charming fellow with a free word of admiration or envy fell from every mouth he has indeed so many advantages in his person and manner that what would be inexcusable in another would if one watched not over ones self and did not endeavour to distinguish what is the essence of right and wrong look becoming in him mr belford to my no small vexation and confusion with the forwardness of a favoured and intrusted friend singled me out on mr lovelaces being sent for down to make me congratulatory compliments on my supposed nuptials which he did with a caution not to insist too long on the rigorous vow i had imposed upon a man so universally admired see him among twenty men said he all of distinction and nobody is regarded but mr lovelace it must indeed be confessed that there is in his whole deportment a natural dignity which renders all insolent or imperative demeanour as unnecessary as inexcusable then that deceiving sweetness which appears in his smiles in his accent in his whole aspect and address when he thinks it worth his while to oblige or endeavour to attract how does this show that he was born innocent as i may say that he was not naturally the cruel the boisterous the impetuous creature which the wicked company he may have fallen into have made him for he has besides as open and i think an honest countenance dont you think so my dear on all these specious appearances have i founded my hopes of seeing him a reformed man but it is amazing to me i own that with so much of the gentleman such a general knowledge of books and men such a skill in the learned as well as modern languages he can take so much delight as he does in the company of such persons as i have described and in subjects of frothy impertinence unworthy of his talents and his natural and acquired advantages i can think but of one reason for it and that must argue a very low mind his vanity which makes him desirous of being considered as the head of the people he consorts with a man to love praise yet to be content to draw it from such contaminated springs one compliment passed from mr belford to mr lovelace which hastened my quitting the shocking company you are a happy man mr lovelace said he upon some fine speeches made him by mrs sinclair and assented to by miss partington you have so much courage and so much wit that neither man nor woman can stand before you mr belford looked at me when he spoke yes my dear he smilingly looked at me and he looked upon his complimented friend and all their assenting and therefore affronting eyes both mens and womens were turned upon your clarissa at least my selfreproaching heart made me think so for that would hardly permit my eye to look up oh my dear were but a woman who gives reason to the world to think her to be in love with a man and this must be believed to be my case or to what can my supposed voluntary going off with mr lovelace be imputed to reflect one moment on the exaltation she gives him and the disgrace she brings upon herself the low pity the silent contempt the insolent sneers and whispers to which she makes herself obnoxious from a censuring world of both sexes how would she despise herself and how much more eligible would she think death itself than such a discovered debasement what i have thus in general touched upon will account to you why i could not more particularly relate what passed in this evenings conversation which as may be gathered from what i have written abounded with approbatory accusations and supposed witty retorts letter viii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe monday midnight i am very much vexed and disturbed at an odd incident mrs sinclair has just now left me i believe in displeasure on my declining to comply with a request she made me which was to admit miss partington to a share in my bed her house being crowded by her niecess guests and by their attendants as well as by those of miss partington there might be nothing in it and my denial carried a stiff and ill natured appearance but instantly upon her making the request it came into my thought that i was in a manner a stranger to every body in the house not so much as a servant i could call my own or of whom i had any great opinion that there were four men of free manners in the house avowed supporters of mr lovelace in matters of offence himself a man of enterprise all as far as i knew and as i had reason to think by their noisy mirth after i left them drinking deeply that miss partington herself is not so bashful a person as she was represented to me to be that officious pains were taken to give me a good opinion of her and that mrs sinclair made a greater parade in prefacing the request than such a request needed to deny thought i can carry only an appearance of singularity to people who already think me singular to consent may possibly if not probably be attended with inconveniencies the consequences of the alternative so very disproportionate i thought it more prudent to incur the censure than to risque the inconvenience i told her that i was writing a long letter that i should choose to write till i were sleepy and that a companion would be a restraint upon me and i upon her she was loth she said that so delicate a young creature and so great a fortune as miss partington should be put to lie with dorcas in a pressbed she should be very sorry if she had asked an improper thing she had never been so put to it before and miss would stay up with her till i had done writing alarmed at this urgency and it being easier to persist in a denial given than to give it at first i said miss partington should be welcome to my whole bed and i would retire into the diningroom and there locking myself in write all the night the poor thing she said was afraid to lie alone to be sure miss partington would not put me to such an inconvenience she then withdrew but returned begged my pardon for returning but the poor child she said was in tears miss partington had never seen a young lady she so much admired and so much wished to imitate as me the dear girl hoped that nothing had passed in her behaviour to give me dislike to her should she bring her to me i was very busy i said the letter i was writing was upon a very important subject i hoped to see the young lady in the morning when i would apologize to her for my particularity and then mrs sinclair hesitating and moving towards the door though she turned round to me again i desired her lighting her to take care how she went down pray madam said she on the stairshead dont give yourself all this trouble god knows my heart i meant no affront but since you seem to take my freedom amiss i beg you will not acquaint mr lovelace with it for he perhaps will think me bold and impertinent now my dear is not this a particular incident either as i have made it or as it was designed i dont love to do an uncivil thing and if nothing were meant by the request my refusal deserves to be called uncivil then i have shown a suspicion of foul usage by it which surely dare not be meant if just i ought to apprehend every thing and fly the house and the man as i would an infection if not just and if i cannot contrive to clear myself of having entertained suspicions by assigning some other plausible reason for my denial the very staying here will have an appearance not at all reputable to myself i am now out of humour with him with myself with all the world but you his companions are shocking creatures why again i repeat should he have been desirous to bring me into such company once more i like him not indeed i do not like him letter ix miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe tuesday may with infinite regret i am obliged to tell you that i can no longer write to you or receive letters from you your mother has sent me a letter enclosed in a cover to mr lovelace directed for him at lord ms and which was brought him just now reproaching me on this subject in very angry terms and forbidding me as i would not be thought to intend to make her and you unhappy to write to you without her leave this therefore is the last you must receive from me till happier days and as my prospects are not very bad i presume we shall soon have leave to write again and even to see each other since an alliance with a family so honourable as mr lovelaces is will not be a disgrace she is pleased to write that if i would wish to inflame you i should let you know her written prohibition but if otherwise find some way of my own accord without bringing her into the question to decline a correspondence which i must know she has for some time past forbidden but all i can say is to beg of you not to be inflamed to beg of you not to let her know or even by your behaviour to her on this occasion guess that i have acquainted you with my reason for declining to write to you for how else after the scruples i have heretofore made on this very subject yet proceeding to correspond can i honestly satisfy you about my motives for this sudden stop so my dear i choose you see rather to rely upon your discretion than to feign reasons with which you would not be satisfied but with your usual active penetration sift to the bottom and at last find me to be a mean and low qualifier and that with an implication injurious to you that i supposed you had not prudence enough to be trusted with the naked truth i repeat that my prospects are not bad the house i presume will soon be taken the people here are very respectful notwithstanding my nicety about miss partington miss martin who is near marriage with an eminent tradesman in the strand just now in a very respectful manner asked my opinion of some patterns of rich silks for the occasion the widow has a less forbidding appearance than at first mr lovelace on my declared dislike of his four friends has assured me that neither they nor any body else shall be introduced to me without my leave these circumstances i mention as you will suppose that your kind heart may be at ease about me that you may be induced by them to acquiesce with your mothers commands cheerfully acquiesce and that for my sake lest i should be thought an inflamer who am with very contrary intentions my dearest and best beloved friend your ever obliged and affectionate clarissa harlowe letter x miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe wedn may i am astonished that my mother should take such a step purely to exercise an unreasonable act of authority and to oblige the most remorseless hearts in the world if i find that i can be of use to you either by advice or information do you think i will not give it were it to any other person much less dear to me than you are do you think in such a case i would forbear giving it mr hickman who pretends to a little casuistry in such nice matters is of opinion that i ought not to decline such a correspondence thus circumstanced and it is well he is for my mother having set me up i must have somebody to quarrel with this i will come into if it will make you easy i will forbear to write to you for a few days if nothing extraordinary happen and till the rigour of her prohibition is abated but be assured that i will not dispense with your writing to me my heart my conscience my honour will not permit it but how will i help myself how easily enough for i do assure you that i want but very little farther provocation to fly privately to london and if i do i will not leave you till i see you either honourably married or absolutely quit of the wretch and in this last case i will take you down with me in defiance of the whole world or if you refuse to go with me stay with you and accompany you as your shadow whithersoever you go dont be frightened at this declaration there is but one consideration and but one hope that withhold me watched as i am in all my retirements obliged to read to her without a voice to work in her presence without fingers and to lie with her every night against my will the consideration is lest you should apprehend that a step of this nature would look like a doubling of your fault in the eyes of such as think your going away a fault the hope is that things will still end happily and that some people will have reason to take shame to themselves for the sorry part they have acted nevertheless i am often balancing but your resolving to give up the correspondence at this crisis will turn the scale write therefore or take the consequence a few words upon the subject of your last letters i know not whether your brothers wise project be given up or not a dead silence reigns in your family your brother was absent three days then at home one and is now absent but whether with singleton or not i cannot find out by your account of your wretchs companions i see not but they are a set of infernals and he the beelzebub what could he mean as you say by his earnestness to bring you into such company and to give you such an opportunity to make him and them reflectingglasses to one another the mans a fool to be sure my dear a silly fellow at least the wretches must put on their best before you no doubt lords of the creation noble fellows these yet who knows how many poor despicable souls of our sex the worst of them has had to whine after him you have brought an inconvenience upon yourself as you observe by your refusal of miss partington for your bedfellow pity you had not admitted her watchful as you are what could have happened if violence were intended he would not stay for the night you might have sat up after her or not gone to bed mrs sinclair pressed it too far you was overscrupulous if any thing happen to delay your nuptials i would advise you to remove but if you marry perhaps you may think it no great matter to stay where you are till you take possession of your own estate the knot once tied and with so resolute a man it is my opinion your relations will soon resign what they cannot legally hold and were even a litigation to follow you will not be able nor ought you to be willing to help it for your estate will then be his right and it will be unjust to wish it to be withheld from him one thing i would advise you to think of and that is of proper settlements it will be to the credit of your prudence and of his justice and the more as matters stand that something of this should be done before you marry bad as he is nobody accounts him a sordid man and i wonder he has been hitherto silent on that subject i am not displeased with his proposal about the widow ladys house i think it will do very well but if it must be three weeks before you can be certain about it surely you need not put off his day for that space and he may bespeak his equipages surprising to me as well as to you that he could be so acquiescent i repeat continue to write to me i insist upon it and that as minutely as possible or take the consequence i send this by a particular hand i am and ever will be your most affectionate anna howe letter xi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe thursday may i forego every other engagement i suspend ever wish i banish every other fear to take up my pen to beg of you that you will not think of being guilty of such an act of love as i can never thank you for but must for ever regret if i must continue to write to you i must i know full well your impatience of control when you have the least imagination that your generosity or friendship is likely to be wondered at my dearest dearest creature would you incur a maternal as i have a paternal malediction would not the world think there was an infection in my fault if it were to be followed by miss howe there are some points so flagrantly wrong that they will not bear to be argued upon this is one of them i need not give reasons against such a rashness heaven forbid that it should be known that you had it but once in your thought be your motives ever so noble and generous to follow so bad an example the rather as that you would in such a case want the extenuations that might be pleaded in my favour and particularly that one of being surprised into the unhappy step the restraint your mother lays you under would not have appeared heavy to you but on my account would you had once thought it a hardship to be admitted to a part of her bed how did i use to be delighted with such a favour from my mother how did i love to work in her presence so did you in the presence of yours once and to read to her in winter evenings i know was one of your joys do not give me cause to reproach myself on the reason that may be assigned for the change in you learn my dear i beseech you learn to subdue your own passions be the motives what they will excess is excess those passions in our sex which we take pains to subdue may have one and the same source with those infinitelyblacker passions which we used so often to condemn in the violent and headstrong of the other sex and which may only be heightened in them by custom and their freer education let us both my dear ponder well this thought look into ourselves and fear if i write as i find i must i insist upon your forbearing to write your silence to this shall be the sign to me that you will not think of the rashness you threaten me with and that you will obey your mother as to your own part of the correspondence however especially as you can inform or advise me in every weighty case by mr hickmans pen my trembling writing will show you my dear impetuous creature what a trembling heart you have given to your ever obliged or if you take so rash a step your for ever disobliged clarissa harlowe my clothes were brought to me just now but you have so much discomposed me that i have no heart to look into the trunks why why my dear will you fright me with your flaming love discomposure gives distress to a weak heart whether it arise from friendship or enmity a servant of mr lovelace carries this to mr hickman for dispatchsake let that worthy mans pen relieve my heart from this new uneasiness letter xii mr hickman to miss clarissa harlowe sent to wilsons by a particular hand friday may madam i have the honour of dear miss howes commands to acquaint you without knowing the occasion that she is excessively concerned for the concern she has given you in her last letter and that if you will but write to her under cover as before she will have no thoughts of what you are so very apprehensive about yet she bid me write that if she had bit the least imagination that she can serve you and save you those are her words all the censures of the world will be but of second consideration with her i have great temptations on this occasion to express my own resentments upon your present state but not being fully apprized of what that is only conjecturing from the disturbance upon the mind of the dearest lady in the world to me and the most sincere of friends to you that that is not altogether so happy as were to be wished and being moreover forbid to enter into the cruel subject i can only offer as i do my best and faithfullest services and wish you a happy deliverance from all your troubles for i am most excellent young lady your faithful and most obedient servant ch hickman letter xiii mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday may mercury as the fabulist tells us having the curiosity to know the estimation he stood in among mortals descended in disguise and in a statuarys shop cheapened a jupiter then a juno then one then another of the dii majores and at last asked what price that same statue of mercury bore o sir says the artist buy one of the others and ill throw you in that for nothing how sheepish must the god of thieves look upon this rebuff to his vanity so thou a thousand pounds wouldst thou give for the good opinion of this single lady to be only thought tolerably of and not quite unworthy of her conversation would make thee happy and at parting last night or rather this morning thou madest me promise a few lines to edgware to let thee know what she thinks of thee and of thy brethren thy thousand pounds jack is all thy own for most heartily does she dislike ye all thee as much as any of the rest i am sorry for it too as to thy part for two reasons one that i think thy motive for thy curiosity was fear of consciousness whereas that of the archthief was vanity intolerable vanity and he was therefore justly sent away with a blush upon his cheeks to heaven and could not brag the other that i am afraid if she dislikes thee she dislikes me for are we not birds of a feather i must never talk of reformation she told me having such companions and taking such delight as i seemed to take in their frothy conversation i no more than you jack imagined she could possibly like ye but then as my friends i thought a person of her education would have been more sparing of her censures i dont know how it is belford but women think themselves entitled to take any freedoms with us while we are unpolite forsooth and i cant tell what if we dont tell a pack of cursed lies and make black white in their favour teaching us to be hypocrites yet stigmatizing us at other times for deceivers i defended ye all as well as i could but you know there was no attempting aught but a palliative defence to one of her principles i will summarily give thee a few of my pleas to the pure every little deviation seemed offensive yet i saw not that there was any thing amiss the whole evening either in the words or behaviour of any of my friends some people could talk but upon one or two subjects she upon every one no wonder therefore they talked to what they understood best and to mere objects of sense had she honoured us with more of her conversation she would have been less disgusted with ours for she saw how every one was prepared to admire her whenever she opened her lips you in particular had said when she retired that virtue itself spoke when she spoke but that you had such an awe upon you after she had favoured us with an observation or two on a subject started that you should ever be afraid in her company to be found most exceptionable when you intended to be least so plainly she said she neither liked my companions nor the house she was in i liked not the house any more than she though the people were very obliging and she had owned they were less exceptionable to herself than at first and were we not about another of our own she did not like miss partington let her fortune be what it would and she had heard a great deal said of her fortune she should not choose an intimacy with her she thought it was a hardship to be put upon such a difficulty as she was put upon the preceding night when there were lodgers in the fronthouse whom they had reason to be freer with than upon so short an acquaintance with her i pretended to be an utter stranger as to this particular and when she explained herself upon it condemned mrs sinclairs request and called it a confident one she artfully made lighter of her denial of the girl for a bedfellow than she thought of it i could see that for it was plain she supposed there was room for me to think she had been either overnice or over cautious i offered to resent mrs sinclairs freedom no there was no great matter in it it was best to let it pass it might be thought more particular in her to deny such a request than in mrs sinclair to make it or in miss partington to expect it to be complied with but as the people below had a large acquaintance she did not know how often she might indeed have her retirements invaded if she gave way and indeed there were levities in the behaviour of that young lady which she could not so far pass over as to wish an intimacy with her i said i liked miss partington as little as she could miss partington was a silly young creature who seemed to justify the watchfulness of her guardians over her but nevertheless as to her own that i thought the girl for girl she was as to discretion not exceptionable only carrying herself like a free goodnatured creature who believed herself secure in the honour of her company it was very well said of me she replied but if that young lady were so well satisfied with her company she must needs say that i was very kind to suppose her such an innocent for her own part she had seen nothing of the london world but thought she must tell me plainly that she never was in such company in her life nor ever again wished to be in such there belford worse off than mercury art thou not i was nettled hard would be the lot of more discreet women as far as i knew that miss partington were they to be judged by so rigid a virtue as hers not so she said but if i really saw nothing exceptionable to a virtuous mind in that young persons behaviour my ignorance of better behaviour was she must needs tell me as pitiable as hers and it were to be wished that minds so paired for their own sakes should never be separated see jack what i get by my charity i thanked her heartily but said that i must take the liberty to observe that good folks were generally so uncharitable that devil take me if i would choose to be good were the consequence to be that i must think hardly of the whole world besides she congratulated me upon my charity but told me that to enlarge her own she hoped it would not be expected of her to approve of the low company i had brought her into last night no exception for thee belford safe is thy thousand pounds i saw not i said begging her pardon that she liked any body plain dealing for plain dealing jack why then did she abuse my friends however let me but know whom and what she did or did not like and if possible i would like and dislike the very same persons and things she bid me then in a pet dislike myself cursed severe does she think she must not pay for it one day or one night and if one many thats my comfort i was in such a train of being happy i said before my earnestness to procure her to favour my friends with her company that i wished the devil had had as well my friends as miss partington and yet i must say that i saw not how good people could answer half their end which is to reform the wicked by precept as well as example were they to accompany only with the good i had the like to have been blasted by two or three flashes of lightning from her indignant eyes and she turned scornfully from me and retired to her own apartment once more jack safe as thou seest is thy thousand pounds she says i am not a polite man but is she in the instance before us more polite for a woman and now dost thou not think that i owe my charmer some revenge for her cruelty in obliging such a fine young creature and so vast a fortune as miss partington to crowd into a pressbed with dorcas the maidservant of the proud refuser miss partington too with tears declared by mrs sinclair that would mrs lovelace do her the honour of a visit at barnet the best bed and best room in her guardians house should be at her service thinkest thou that i could not guess at her dishonourable fears of me that she apprehended that the supposed husband would endeavour to take possession of his own and that miss partington would be willing to contribute to such a piece of justice thus then thou both remindest and defiest me charmer and since thou reliest more on thy own precaution than upon my honour be it unto thee fair one as thou apprehendest and now jack let me know what thy opinion and the opinions of thy brother varlets are of my gloriana i have just now heard that hannah hopes to be soon well enough to attend her young lady when in london it seems the girl has had no physician i must send her one out of pure love and respect to her mistress who knows but medicine may weaken nature and strengthen the disease as her malady is not a fever very likely it may do so but perhaps the wenchs hopes are too forward blustering weather in this month yet and that is bad for rheumatic complaints letter xiv mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday may just as i had sealed up the enclosed comes a letter to my beloved in a cover to me directed to lord ms from whom thinkest thou from mrs howe and what the contents how should i know unless the dear creature had communicated them to me but a very cruel letter i believe it is by the effect it had upon her the tears ran down her cheeks as she read it and her colour changed several times no end of her persecutions i think what a cruelty in my fate said the sweet lamenter now the only comfort of my life must be given up miss howes correspondence no doubt but should she be so much grieved at this this correspondence was prohibited before and that to the daughter in the strongest terms but yet carried on by both although a brace of impeccables ant please ye could they expect that a mother would not vindicate her authority and finding her prohibition ineffectual with her perverse daughter was it not reasonable to suppose she would try what effect it would have upon her daughters friend and now i believe the end will be effectually answered for my beloved i dare say will make a point of conscience of it i hate cruelty especially in women and should have been more concerned for this instance of it mrs howe had i not had a stronger instance of the same in my beloved to miss partington for how did she know since she was so much afraid for herself whom dorcas might let in to that innocent and less watchful young lady but nevertheless i must needs own that i am not very sorry for this prohibition let it originally come from the harlowes or from whom it will because i make no doubt that it is owing to miss howe in a great measure that my beloved is so much upon her guard and thinks so hardly of me and who can tell as characters here are so tender and some disguises so flimsy what consequences might follow this undutiful correspondence i say therefore i am not sorry for it now will she not have any body to compare notes with any body to alarm her and i may be saved the guilt and disobligation of inspecting into a correspondence that has long made me uneasy how every ting works for me why will this charming creature make such contrivances necessary as will increase my trouble and my guilt too as some will account it but why rather i should ask will she fight against her stars letter xv mr belford to robert lovelace esq edgware tuesday night may without staying for the promised letter from you to inform us what the lady says of us i write to tell you that we are all of one opinion with regard to her which is that there is not of her age a finer woman in the world as to her understanding as for her person she is at the age of bloom and an admirable creature a perfect beauty but this poorer praise a man who has been honoured with her conversation can hardly descend to give and yet she was brought amongst us contrary to her will permit me dear lovelace to be a mean of saving this excellent creature from the dangers she hourly runs from the most plotting heart in the world in a former i pleaded your own family lord ms wishes particularly and then i had not seen her but now i join her sake honours sake motives of justice generosity gratitude and humanity which are all concerned in the preservation of so fine a woman thou knowest not the anguish i should have had whence arising i cannot devise had i not known before i set out this morning that the incomparable creature had disappointed thee in thy cursed view of getting her to admit the specious partington for a bedfellow i have done nothing but talk of this lady ever since i saw her there is something so awful and yet so sweet in her aspect that were i to have the virtues and the graces all drawn in one piece they should be taken every one of them from different airs and attributes in her she was born to adorn the age she was given to and would be an ornament to the first dignity what a piercing yet gentle eye every glance i thought mingled with love and fear of you what a sweet smile darting through the cloud that overspread her fair face demonstrating that she had more apprehensions and grief at her heart than she cared to express you may think what i am going to write too flighty but by my faith i have conceived such a profound reverence for her sense and judgment that far from thinking the man excusable who should treat her basely i am ready to regret that such an angel of a woman should even marry she is in my eye all mind and were she to meet with a man all mind likewise why should the charming qualities she is mistress of be endangered why should such an angel be plunged so low as into the vulgar offices of a domestic life were she mine i should hardly wish to see her a mother unless there were a kind of moral certainty that minds like hers could be propagated for why in short should not the work of bodies be left to mere bodies i know that you yourself have an opinion of her little less exalted belton mowbray tourville are all of my mind are full of her praises and swear it would be a million of pities to ruin a woman in whose fall none but devils can rejoice what must that merit and excellence be which can extort this from us freelivers like yourself and all of your just resentments against the rest of her family and offered our assistance to execute your vengeance on them but we cannot think it reasonable that you should punish an innocent creature who loves you so well and who is your protection and has suffered so much for you for the faults of her relations and here let me put a serious question or two thinkest thou truly admirable as this lady is that the end thou proposest to thyself if obtained is answerable to the means to the trouble thou givest thyself and to the perfidies tricks stratagems and contrivances thou has already been guilty of and still meditatest in every real excellence she surpasses all her sex but in the article thou seekest to subdue her for a mere sensualist a partington a horton a martin would make a sensualist a thousand times happier than she either will or can sweet are the joys that come with willingness and wouldst thou make her unhappy for her whole life and thyself not happy for a single moment hitherto it is not too late and that perhaps is as much as can be said if thou meanest to preserve her esteem and good opinion as well as person for i think it is impossible she can get out of thy hands now she is in this accursed house o that damned hypocritical sinclair as thou callest her how was it possible she should behave so speciously as she did all the time the lady staid with us be honest and marry and be thankful that she will condescend to have thee if thou dost not thou wilt be the worst of men and wilt be condemned in this world and the next as i am sure thou oughtest and shouldest too wert thou to be judged by one who never before was so much touched in a womans favour and whom thou knowest to be thy partial friend j belford our companions consented that i should withdraw to write to the above effect they can make nothing of the characters we write in and so i read this to them they approve of it and of their own motion each man would set his name to it i would not delay sending it for fear of some detestable scheme taking place thomas belton richard mowbray james tourville just now are brought me both yours i vary not my opinion nor forbear my earnest prayers to you in her behalf notwithstanding her dislike of me letter xvi mr lovelace to john belford esq wednesday may when i have already taken pains to acquaint thee in full with regard to my views designs and resolutions with regard to this admirable woman it is very extraordinary that thou shouldst vapour as thou dost in her behalf when i have made no trial no attempt and yet givest it as thy opinion in a former letter that advantage may be taken of the situation she is in and that she may be overcome most of thy reflections particularly that which respects the difference as to the joys to be given by the virtuous and libertine of her sex are fitter to come in as afterreflections than as antecedencies i own with thee and with the poet that sweet are the joys that come with willingness but is it to be expected that a woman of education and a lover of forms will yield before she is attacked and have i so much as summoned this to surrender i doubt not but i shall meet with difficulty i must therefore make my first effort by surprise there may possibly be some cruelty necessary but there may be consent in struggle there may be yielding in resistance but the first conflict over whether the following may not be weaker and weaker till willingness ensue is the point to be tried i will illustrate what i have said by the simile of a bird new caught we begin when boys with birds and when grown up go on to women and both perhaps in turn experience our sportive cruelty hast thou not observed the charming gradations by which the ensnared volatile has been brought to bear with its new condition how at first refusing all sustenance it beats and bruises itself against its wires till it makes its gay plumage fly about and overspread its wellsecured cage now it gets out its head sticking only at its beautiful shoulders then with difficulty drawing back its head it gasps for breath and erectly perched with meditating eyes first surveys and then attempts its wired canopy as it gets its pretty head and sides bites the wires and pecks at the fingers of its delighted tamer till at last finding its efforts ineffectual quite tired and breathless it lays itself down and pants at the bottom of the cage seeming to bemoan its cruel fate and forfeited liberty and after a few days its struggles to escape still diminishing as it finds it to no purpose to attempt it its new habitation becomes familiar and it hops about from perch to perch resumes its wonted cheerfulness and every day sings a song to amuse itself and reward its keeper now le me tell thee that i have known a bird actually starve itself and die with grief at its being caught and caged but never did i meet with a woman who was so silly yet have i heard the dear souls most vehemently threaten their own lives on such an occasion but it is saying nothing in a womans favour if we do not allow her to have more sense than a bird and yet we must all own that it is more difficult to catch a bird than a lady to pursue the comparison if the disappointment of the captivated lady be very great she will threaten indeed as i said she will even refuse her sustenance for some time especially if you entreat her much and she thinks she gives you concern by her refusal but then the stomach of the dear sullen one will soon return tis pretty to see how she comes to by degrees pressed by appetite she will first steal perhaps a weeping morsel by herself then be brought to piddle and sigh and sigh and piddle before you nowandthen if her viands be unsavoury swallowing with them a relishing tear or two then she comes to eat and drink to oblige you then resolves to live for your sake her exclamations will in the next place be turned into blandishments her vehement upbraidings into gentle murmuring how dare you traitor into how could you dearest she will draw you to her instead of pushing you from her no longer with unsheathed claws will she resist you but like a pretty playful wanton kitten with gentle paws and concealed talons tap your cheek and with intermingled smiles and tears and caresses implore your consideration for her and your constancy all the favour she then has to ask of you and this is the time were it given to man to confine himself to one object to be happier every day than another now belford were i to go no farther than i have gone with my beloved miss harlowe how shall i know the difference between her and another bird to let her fly now what a pretty jest would that be how do i know except i try whether she may not be brought to sing me a fine song and to be as well contented as i have brought other birds to be and very shy ones too but now let us reflect a little upon the confounded partiality of us human creatures i can give two or three familiar and if they were not familiar they would be shocking instances of the cruelty both of men and women with respect to other creatures perhaps as worthy as at least more innocent than themselves by my soul jack there is more of the savage on human nature than we are commonly aware of nor is it after all so much amiss that we sometimes avenge the more innocent animals upon our own species to particulars how usual a thing is it for women as well as men without the least remorse to ensnare to cage and torment and even with burning knittingneedles to put out the eyes of the poor featherd songster thou seest i have not yet done with birds which however in proportion to its bulk has more life than themselves for a bird is all soul and of consequence has as much feeling as the human creature when at the same time if an honest fellow by the gentlest persuasion and the softest arts has the good luck to prevail upon a mewdup lady to countenance her own escape and she consents to break cage and be set a flying into the allcheering air of liberty mercy on us what an outcry is generally raised against him just like what you and i once saw raised in a paltry village near chelmsford after a poor hungry fox who watching his opportunity had seized by the neck and shouldered a sleekfeathered goose at what time we beheld the whole vicinage of boys and girls old men and old women all the furrows and wrinkles of the latter filled up with malice for the time the old men armed with prongs pitchforks clubs and catsticks the old women with mops brooms fireshovels tongs and pokers and the younger fry with dirt stones and brickbats gathering as they ran like a snowball in pursuit of the windoutstripping prowler all the mongrel curs of the circumjacencies yelp yelp yelp at their heels completing the horrid chorus rememebrest thou not this scene surely thou must my imagination inflamed by a tender sympathy for the danger of the adventurous marauder represents it to my eye as if it were but yesterday and dost thou not recollect how generously glad we were as if our own case that honest reynard by the help of a lucky stile over which both old and young tumbled upon one another and a winding course escaped their brutal fury and flying catsticks and how in fancy we followed him to his undiscovered retreat and imagined we beheld the intrepid thief enjoying his dearearned purchase with a delight proportioned to his past danger i once made a charming little savage severely repent the delight she took in seeing her tabby favourite make cruel sport with a pretty sleek bead eyed mouse before she devoured it egad my love said i to myself as i sat meditating the scene i am determined to lie in wait for a fit opportunity to try how thou wilt like to be tost over my head and be caught again how thou wilt like to be parted from me and pulled to me yet will i rather give life than take it away as this barbarous quadruped has at last done by her prey and after all was over between my girl and me i reminded her of the incident to which my resolution was owing nor had i at another time any mercy upon the daughter of an old epicure who had taught the girl without the least remorse to roast lobsters alive to cause a poor pig to be whipt to death to scrape carp the contrary way of the scales making them leap in the stewpan and dressing them in their own blood for sauce and this for luxurysake and to provoke an appetite which i had without stimulation in my way and that i can tell thee a very ravenous one many more instances of the like nature could i give were i to leave nothing to thyself to shew that the best take the same liberties and perhaps worse with some sort of creatures that we take with others all creatures still and creatures too as i have observed above replete with strong life and sensible feeling if therefore people pretend to mercy let mercy go through all their actions i have heard somewhere that a merciful man is merciful to his beast so much at present for those parts of thy letter in which thou urgest to me motives of compassion for the lady but i guess at thy principal motive in this thy earnestness in behalf of this charming creature i know that thou correspondest with lord m who is impatient and has long been desirous to see me shackled and thou wantest to make a merit with the uncle with a view to one of his nieces but knowest thou not that my consent will be wanting to complete thy wishes and what a commendation will it be of thee to such a girl as charlotte when i shall acquaint her with the affront thou puttest upon the whole sex by asking whether i think my reward when i have subdued the most charming woman in the world will be equal to my trouble which thinkest thou will a woman of spirit soonest forgive the undervaluing varlet who can put such a question or him who prefers the pursuit and conquest of a fine woman to all the joys of life have i not known even a virtuous woman as she would be thought vow everlasting antipathy to a man who gave out that she was too old for him to attempt and did not essexs personal reflection on queen elizabeth that she was old and crooked contribute more to his ruin than his treason but another word or two as to thy objection relating to my trouble and reward does not the keen foxhunter endanger his neck and his bones in pursuit of a vermin which when killed is neither fit food for men nor dogs do not the hunters of the noble game value the venison less than the sport why then should i be reflected upon and the sex affronted for my patience and perseverance in the most noble of all chases and for not being a poacher in love as thy question be made to imply learn of thy master for the future to treat more respectfully a sex that yields us our principal diversions and delights proceed anon letter xvii mr lovelace in continuation well sayest thou that mine is the most plotting heart in the world thou dost me honour and i thank thee heartily thou art no bad judge how like boileaus parson i strut behind my double chin am i not obliged to deserve thy compliment and wouldst thou have me repent of a murder before i have committed it the virtues and graces are this ladys handmaids she was certainly born to adorn the age she was given to well said jack and would be an ornament to the first dignity but what praise is that unless the first dignity were adorned with the first merit dignity gewgaw first dignity thou idiot art thou who knowest me so taken with ermine and tinsel i who have won the gold am only fit to wear it for the future therefore correct thy style and proclaim her the ornament of the happiest man and respecting herself and sex the greatest conqueror in the world then that she loves me as thou imaginest by no means appears clear to me her conditional offers to renounce me the little confidence she places in me entitle me to ask what merit can she have with a man who won her in spite of herself and who fairly in set and obstinate battle took her prisoner as to what thou inferrest from her eye when with us thou knowest nothing of her heart from that if thou imaginest there was one glance of love shot from it well did i note her eye and plainly did i see that it was all but just civil disgust to me and to the company i had brought her into her early retiring that night against all entreaty might have convinced thee that there was very little of the gentle in her heart for me and her eye never knew what it was to contradict her heart she is thou sayest all mind so say i but why shouldst thou imagine that such a mind as hers meeting with such a one as mine and to dwell upon the word meeting with an inclination in hers should not propagate minds like her own were i to take thy stupid advice and marry what a figure should i make in rakish annals the lady in my power yet not have intended to put herself in my power declaring against love and a rebel to it so much openeyed caution no confidence in my honour her family expecting the worst hath passed herself seeming to expect that the worst will be attempted priscilla partington for that what wouldst thou not have me act in character but why callest thou the lady innocent and why sayest thou she loves me by innocent with regard to me and not taken as a general character i must insist upon it she is not innocent can she be innocent who by wishing to shackle me in the prime and glory of my youth with such a capacity as i have for noble mischief would make my perdition more certain were i to break as i doubt i should the most solemn vow i could make i say no man ought to take even a common oath who thinks he cannot keep it this is conscience this is honour and when i think i can keep the marriagevow then will it be time to marry see vol iii letter xxiii paragr no doubt of it as thou sayest the devils would rejoice in the fall of such a woman but this is my confidence that i shall have it in my power to marry when i will and if i do her this justice shall i not have a claim of her gratitude and will she not think herself the obliged rather than the obliger then let me tell thee belford it is impossible so far to hurt the morals of this lady as thou and thy brother varlets have hurt others of the sex who now are casting about the town firebrands and double death take ye that thistle to mumble upon a short interruption i now resume that the morals of this lady cannot fail is a consideration that will lessen the guilt on both sides and if when subdued she knows but how to middle the matter between virtue and love then will she be a wife for me for already i am convinced that there is not a woman in the world that is loveproof and plotproof if she be not the person and now imagine the charmer overcome thou seest me sitting supinely crosskneed reclining on my sofa the god of love dancing in my eyes and rejoicing in every mantling feature the sweet rogue late such a proud rogue wholly in my power moving up slowly to me at my beck with heaving sighs halfpronounced upbraidings from murmuring lips her finger in her eye and quickening her pace at my come hither dearest one hand stuck in my side the other extended to encourage her bashful approach kiss me love sweet as jack belford says are the joys that come with willingness she tenders her purple mouth her coral lips will be purple then jack sigh not so deeply my beloved happier hours await thy humble love than did thy proud resistance once more bent to my ardent lips the swanny glossiness of a neck late so stately theres my precious again obliging loveliness o my everblooming glory i have tried thee enough tomorrows sun then i rise and fold to my almosttalking heart the throbbingbosomd charmer and now shall thy humble pride confess its obligation to me tomorrows sun and then i disengage myself from the bashful passive and stalk about the room tomorrows sun shall gild the altar at which my vows shall be paid thee then jack the rapture then the darted sunbeams from her gladdened eye drinking up at one sip the precious distillation from the pearl dropt cheek then hands ardently folded eyes seeming to pronounce god bless my lovelace to supply the joylocked tongue her transports too strong and expression too weak to give utterance to her grateful meanings all all the studies all the studies of her future life vowed and devoted when she can speak to acknowledge and return the perpetual obligation if i could bring my charmer to this would it not be the eligible of eligibles is it not worth trying for as i said i can marry her when i will she can be nobodys but mine neither for shame nor by choice nor yet by address for who that knows my character believes that the worst she dreads is now to be dreaded i have the highest opinion that man can have thou knowest i have of the merit and perfections of this admirable woman of her virtue and honour too although thou in a former art of opinion that she may be overcome am i not therefore obliged to go further in order to contradict thee and as i have often urged to be sure that she is what i really think her to be and if i am ever to marry her hope to find her see vol iii letter li paragr then this lady is a mistress of our passions no one ever had to so much perfection the art of moving this all her family know and have equally feared and revered her for it this i know too and doubt not more and more to experience how charmingly must this divine creature warble forth if a proper occasion be given her melodious elegiacs infinite beauties are there in a weeping eye i first taught the two nymphs below to distinguish the several accents of the lamentable in a new subject and how admirably some more than others become their distresses but to return to thy objections thou wilt perhaps tell me in the names of thy brethren as well as in thy own name that among all the objects of your respective attempts there was not one of the rank and merit of my charming miss harlowe but let me ask has it not been a constant maxim with us that the greater the merit on the womans side the nobler the victory on the mans and as to rank sense of honour sense of shame pride of family may make rifled rank get up and shake itself to rights and if any thing come of it such a one may suffer only in her pride by being obliged to take up with a secondrate match instead of a first and as it may fall out be the happier as well as the more useful for the misadventure since taken off of her public gaddings and domesticated by her disgrace she will have reason to think herself obliged to the man who has saved her from further reproach while her fortune and alliance will lay an obligation upon him and her past fall if she have prudence and consciousness will be his present and future security but a poor girl such a one as my rosebud for instance having no recalls from education being driven out of every family that pretends to reputation persecuted most perhaps by such as have only kept their secret better and having no refuge to fly to the common the stews the street is the fate of such a poor wretch penury want and disease her sure attendants and an untimely end perhaps closes the miserable scene and will you not now all join to say that it is more manly to attach a lion than a sheep thou knowest that i always illustrated my eagleship by aiming at the noblest quarries and by disdaining to make a stoop at wrens phyltits and wagtails phyltits q d phyllistits in opposition to tomtits it needs not now be observed that mr lovelace in this wanton gaiety of his heart often takes liberties of coining words and phrases in his letters to this his familiar friend see his ludicrous reason for it in vol iii letter xxv paragr antepenult the worst respecting myself in the case before me is that my triumph when completed will be so glorious a one that i shall never be able to keep up to it all my future attempts must be poor to this i shall be as unhappy after a while from my reflections upon this conquest as don juan of austria was in his on the renowned victory of lepanto when he found that none of future achievements could keep pace with his early glory i am sensible that my pleas and my reasoning may be easily answered and perhaps justly censured but by whom censured not by any of the confraternity whose constant course of life even long before i became your general to this hour has justified what ye now in a fit of squeamishness and through envy condemn having therefore vindicated myself and my intentions to you that is all i am at present concerned for be convinced then that i according to our principles am right thou wrong or at least be silent but i command thee to be convinced and in thy next be sure to tell me that thou art letter xviii mr belford to robert lovelace esq edgeware thursday may i know that thou art so abandoned a man that to give thee the best reasons in the world against what thou hast once resolved upon will be but acting the madman whom once we saw trying to buffet down a hurricane with his hat i hope however that the ladys merit will still avail her with thee but if thou persistest if thou wilt avenge thyself on this sweet lamb which thou hast singled out from a flock thou hatest for the faults of the dogs who kept it if thou art not to be moved by beauty by learning by prudence by innocence all shining out in one charming object but she must fall fall by the man whom she has chosen for her protector i would not for a thousand worlds have thy crime to answer for upon my faith lovelace the subject sticks with me notwithstanding i find i have no the honour of the ladys good opinion and the more when i reflect upon her fathers brutal curse and the villainous hard heartedness of all her family but nevertheless i should be desirous to know if thou wilt proceed by what gradations arts and contrivances thou effectest thy ingrateful purpose and o lovelace i conjure thee if thou art a man let not the specious devils thou has brought her among be suffered to triumph over her yield to fair seductions if i may so express myself if thou canst raise a weakness in her by love or by arts not inhuman i shall the less pity her and shall then conclude that there is not a woman in the world who can resist a bold and resolute lover a messenger is just now arrived from my uncle the mortification it seems is got to his knee and the surgeons declare that he cannot live many days he therefore sends for me directly with these shocking words that i will come and close his eyes my servant or his must of necessity be in town every day on his case or other affairs and one of them shall regularly attend you for any letter or commands it will be charity to write to me as often as you can for although i am likely to be a considerable gainer by the poor mans death yet i cannot say that i at all love these scenes of death and the doctor so near me the doctor and death i should have said for that is the natural order and generally speaking the one is but the harbinger to the other if therefore you decline to oblige me i shall think you are displeased with my freedom but let me tell you at the same that no man has a right to be displeased at freedoms taken with him for faults he is not ashamed to be guilty of j belford letter xix miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe i thank you and mr hickman for his letter sent me with such kind expedition and proceed to obey my dear menacing tyranness she then gives the particulars of what passed between herself and mr lovelace on tuesday morning in relation to his four friends and to miss partington pretty much to the same effect as in mr lovelaces letter no xiii and then proceeds he is constantly accusing me of overscrupulousness he says i am always out of humour with him that i could not have behaved more reservedly to mr solmes and that it is contrary to all his hopes and notions that he should not in so long a time find himself able to inspire the person whom he hoped so soon to have the honour to call his with the least distinguishing tenderness for him beforehand silly and partial encroacher not to know to what to attribute the reserve i am forced to treat him with but his pride has eaten up his prudence it is indeed a dirty low pride that has swallowed up the true pride which should have set him above the vanity that has overrun him yet he pretends that he has no pride but in obliging me and is always talking of his reverence and humility and such sort of stuff but of this i am sure that he has as i observed the first time i saw him too much regard to his own person greatly to value that of his wife marry he whom he will and i must be blind if i did not see that he is exceedingly vain of his external advantages and of that address which if it has any merit in it to an outward eye is perhaps owing more to his confidence that sic to any thing else see vol i letter iii have you not beheld the man when i was your happy guest as he walked to his chariot looking about him as if to observe what eyes his specious person and air had attracted but indeed we had some homely coxcombs as proud as if they had persons to be proud of at the same time that it was apparent that the pains they took about themselves but the more exposed their defects the man who is fond of being thought more or better than he is as i have often observed but provokes a scrutiny into his pretensions and that generally produces contempt for pride as i believe i have heretofore said is an infallible sign of weakness of something wrong in the head or in both he that exalts himself insults his neighbour who is provoked to question in him even that merit which were he modest would perhaps be allowed to be his due you will say that i am very grave and so i am mr lovelace is extremely sunk in my opinion since monday night nor see i before me any thing that can afford me a pleasing hope for what with a mind so unequal as his can be my best hope i think i mentioned to you in my former that my clothes were brought me you fluttered me so that i am not sure i did but i know i designed to mention that they were they were brought me on thursday but neither my few guineas with them nor any of my books except a drexelius on eternity the good old practice of piety and a francis spira my brothers wit i suppose he thinks he does well to point out death and despair to me i wish for the one and every nowandthen am on the brink of the other you will the less wonder at my being so very solemn when added to the above and to my uncertain situation i tell you that they have sent me with these books a letter form my cousin morden it has set my heart against mr lovelace against myself too i send it enclosed if you please my dear you may read it here col morden to miss clarissa harlowe florence april i am extremely concerned to hear of a difference betwixt the rest of a family so near and dear to me and you still dearer to than any of the rest my cousin james has acquainted me with the offers you have had and with your refusals i wonder not at either such charming promises at so early an age as when i left england and those promises as i have often heard so greatly exceeded as well in your person as mind how much must you be admired how few must there be worthy of you your parents the most indulgent in the world to a child the most deserving have given way it seems to your refusal of several gentlemen they have contented themselves at last to name one with earnestness to you because of the address of another whom they cannot approve they had not reason it seems from your behaviour to think you greatly averse so they proceeded perhaps too hastily for a delicacy like yours but when all was fixed on their parts and most extraordinary terms concluded in your favour terms which abundantly show the gentlemans just value for you you flew off with a warmth and vehemence little suited to that sweetness which gave grace to all your actions i know very little of either of the gentlemen but of mr lovelace i know more than of mr solmes i wish i could say more to his advantage than i can as to every qualification but one your brother owns there is no comparison but that one outweighs all the rest together it cannot be thought that miss clarissa harlowe will dispense with morals in a husband what my dearest cousin shall i plead first to you on this occasion your duty your interest your temporal and your eternal welfare do and may all depend upon this single point the morality of a husband a woman who hath a wicked husband may find it difficult to be good and out of her power to do good and is therefore in a worse situation than the man can be in who hath a bad wife you preserve all your religious regards i understand i wonder not that you do i should have wondered had you not but what can you promise youself as to perseverance in them with an immoral husband if your parents and you differ in sentiment on this important occasion let me ask you my dear cousin who ought to give way i own to you that i should have thought there could not any where have been a more suitable match for you than mr lovelace had he been a moral man i should have very little to say against a man of whose actions i am not to set up myself as a judge did he not address my cousin but on this occasion let me tell you my dear clarissa that mr lovelace cannot possibly deserve you he may reform youll say but he may not habit is not soon or easily shaken off libertines who are libertines in defiance of talents of superior lights of conviction hardly ever reform but by miracle or by incapacity well do i know mine own sex well am i able to judge of the probability of the reformation of a licentious young man who has not been fastened upon by sickness by affliction by calamity who has a prosperous run of fortune before him his spirits high his will uncontroulable the company he keeps perhaps such as himself confirming him in all his courses assisting him in all his enterprises as to the other gentleman suppose my dear cousin you do not like him at present it is far from being unlikely that you will hereafter perhaps the more for not liking him now he can hardly sink lower in your opinion he may rise very seldom is it that high expectations are so much as tolerably answered how indeed can they when a fine and extensive imagination carries its expectation infinitely beyond reality in the highest of our sublunary enjoyments a woman adorned with such an imagination sees no defect in a favoured object the less if she be not conscious of any wilful fault in herself till it is too late to rectify the mistakes occasioned by her generous credulity but suppose a person of your talents were to marry a man of inferior talents who in this case can be so happy in herself as miss clarissa harlowe what delight do you take in doing good how happily do you devote the several portions of the day to your own improvement and to the advantage of all that move within your sphere and then such is your taste such are your acquirements in the politer studies and in the politer amusements such your excellence in all the different parts of economy fit for a young ladys inspection and practice that your friends would wish you to be taken off as little as possible by regards that may be called merely personal but as to what may be the consequence respecting yourself respecting a young lady of your talents from the preference you are suspected to give to a libertine i would have you my dear cousin consider what that may be a mind so pure to mingle with a mind impure and will not such a man as this engross all your solitudes will he not perpetually fill you with anxieties for him and for yourself the divine and civil powers defied and their sanctions broken through by him on every not merely accidental but meditated occasion to be agreeable to him and to hope to preserve an interest in his affections you must probably be obliged to abandon all your own laudable pursuits you must enter into his pleasures and distastes you must give up your virtuous companions for his profligate ones perhaps be forsaken by yours because of the scandal he daily gives can you hope cousin with such a man as this to be long so good as you now are if not consider which of your present laudable delights you would choose to give up which of his culpable ones to follow him in how could you brook to go backward instead of forward in those duties which you now so exemplarily perform and how do you know if you once give way where you shall be suffered where you shall be able to stop your brother acknowledges that mr solmes is not near so agreeable in person as mr lovelace but what is person with such a lady as i have the honour to be now writing to he owns likewise that he has not the address of mr lovelace but what a mere personal advantage is a plausible address without morals a woman had better take a husband whose manners she were to fashion than to find them readyfashioned to her hand at the price of her morality a price that is often paid for travelling accomplishments o my dear cousin were you but with us here at florence or at rome or at paris where also i resided for many months to see the gentlemen whose supposed rough english manners at setting out are to be polished and what their improvement are in their return through the same places you would infinitely prefer the man in his first stage to the same man in his last you find the difference on their return a fondness for foreign fashions an attachment to foreign vices a supercilious contempt of his own country and countrymen himself more despicable than the most despicable of those he despises these with an unblushing effrontery are too generally the attainments that concur to finish the travelled gentleman mr lovelace i know deserves to have an exception made in his favour for he really is a man of parts and learning he was esteemed so both here and at rome and a fine person and a generous turn of mind gave him great advantages but you need not be told that a libertine of weak parts is able to do and this i will tell you further that it was mr lovelaces own fault that he was not still more respected than he was among the literati here there were in short some liberties in which he indulged himself that endangered his person and his liberty and made the best and most worthy of those who honoured him with their notice give him up and his stay both at florence and at rome shorter than he designed this is all i choose to say of mr lovelace i had much rather have had reason to give him a quite contrary character but as to rakes or libertines in general i who know them well must be allowed because of the mischiefs they have always in their hearts and too often in their power to do your sex to add still a few more words upon this topic a libertine my dear cousin a plotting an intriguing libertine must be generally remorseless unjust he must always be the noble rule of doing to others what he would have done to himself is the first rule he breaks and every day he breaks it the oftener the greater his triumph he has great contempt for your sex he believes no woman chaste because he is a profligate every woman who favours him confirms him in his wicked incredulity he is always plotting to extend the mischiefs he delights in if a woman loves such a man how can she bear the thought of dividing her interest in his affections with half the town and that perhaps the dregs of it then so sensual how will a young lady of your delicacy bear with so sensual a man a man who makes a jest of his vows and who perhaps will break your spirit by the most unmanly insults to be a libertine is to continue to be every thing vile and inhuman prayers tears and the most abject submission are but fuel to his pride wagering perhaps with lewd companions and not improbably with lewder women upon instances which he boast of to them of your patient sufferings and broken spirit and bringing them home to witness both i write what i know has been i mention not fortunes squandered estates mortgaged or sold and posterity robbed nor yet a multitude of other evils too gross too shocking to be mentioned to a person of your delicacy all these my dear cousin to be shunned all the evils i have named to be avoided the power of doing all the good you have been accustomed to preserved nay increased by the separate provision that will be made for you your charming diversions and exemplary employments all maintained and every good habit perpetuated and all by one sacrifice the fading pleasure of the eye who would not since every thing is not to be met with in one man who would not to preserve so many essentials give up to light so unpermanent a pleasure weigh all these things which i might insist upon to more advantage did i think it needful to one of your prudence weigh them well my beloved cousin and if it be not the will of your parents that you should continue single resolve to oblige them and let it not be said that the powers of fancy shall as in many others of your sex be too hard for your duty and your prudence the less agreeable the man the more obliging the compliance remember that he is a sober man a man who has reputation to lose and whose reputation therefore is a security for his good behaviour to you you have an opportunity offered you to give the highest instance that can be given of filial duty embrace it it is worthy of you it is expected from you however for your inclinationsake we may be sorry that you are called upon to give it let it be said that you have been able to lay an obligation upon your parents a proud word my cousin which you could not do were it not laid against your inclination upon parents who have laid a thousand upon you who are set upon this point who will not give it up who have given up many points to you even of this very nature and in their turn for the sake of their own authority as well as judgment expect to be obliged i hope i shall soon in person congratulate you upon this your meritorious compliance to settle and give up my trusteeship is one of the principal motives of my leaving these parts i shall be glad to settle it to every ones satisfaction to yours particularly if on my arrival i find a happy union as formerly reign in a family so dear to me it will be an unspeakable pleasure to me and i shall perhaps so dispose my affairs as to be near you for ever i have written a very long letter and will add no more than that i am with the greatest respect my dearest cousin your most affectionate and faithful servant wm morden i will suppose my dear miss howe that you have read my cousins letter it is now in vain to wish it had come sooner but if it had i might perhaps have been so rash as to give mr lovelace the fatal meeting as i little thought of going away with him but i should hardly have given him the expectation of so doing previous to the meeting which made him come prepared and the revocation of which he so artfully made ineffectual persecuted as i was and little expecting so much condescension as my aunt to my great mortification has told me and you confirm i should have met with it is however hard to say what i should or should not have done as to meeting him had it come in time but this effect i verily believe it would have had to have made me insist with all my might on going over out of all their ways to the kind writer of the instructive letter and on making a father a protector as well as a friend of a kinsman who is one of my trustees this circumstanced as i was would have been a natural at least an unexceptionable protection but i was to be unhappy and how it cuts me to the heart to think that i can already subscribe to my cousins character of a libertine so well drawn in the letter which i suppose you now to have read that a man of a character which ever was my abhorrence should fall to my lot but depending on my own strength having no reason to apprehend danger from headstrong and disgraceful impulses i too little perhaps cast up my eyes to the supreme director in whom mistrusting myself i ought to have placed my whole confidence and the more when i saw myself so perserveringly addressed by a man of this character inexperience and presumption with the help of a brother and sister who have low ends to answer in my disgrace have been my ruin a hard word my dear but i repeat it upon deliberation since let the best happen which now can happen my reputation is destroyed a rake is my portion and what that portion is my cousin mordens letter has acquainted you pray keep it by you till called for i saw it not myself having not the heart to inspect my trunks till this morning i would not for the world this man should see it because it might occasion mischief between the most violent spirit and the most settled brave one in the world as my cousins is said to be this letter was enclosed opened in a blank cover scorn and detest me as they will i wonder that one line was not sent with it were it but to have more particularly pointed the design of it in the same generous spirit that sent me the spira the sealing of the cover was with black wax i hope there is no new occasion in the family to give reason for black wax but if there were it would to be sure have been mentioned and laid at my door perhaps too justly i had begun a letter to my cousin but laid it by because of the uncertainty of my situation and expecting every day for several days past to be at a greater certainty you bid me write to him some time ago you know then it was i began it for i have great pleasure in obeying you in all i may so i ought to have for you are the only friend left me and moreover you generally honour me with your own observance of the advice i take the liberty to offer you for i pretend to say i give better advice than i have taken and so i had need for i know not how it comes about but i am in my own opinion a poor lost creature and yet cannot charge myself with one criminal or faulty inclination do you know my dear how this can be yet i can tell you how i believe one devious step at setting out that must be it which pursued has led me so far out of my path that i am in a wilderness of doubt and error and never never shall find my way out of it for although but one pace awry at first it has led me hundreds and hundreds of miles out of my path and the poor estray has not one kind friend nor has met with one direct passenger to help her to recover it but i presumptuous creature must rely so much upon my own knowledge of the right path little apprehending that an ignus fatuus with its false fires and ye i had heard enough of such would arise to mislead me and now in the midst of fens and quagmires it plays around me and around me throwing me back again whenever i think myself in the right track but there is one common point in which all shall meet err widely as they may in that i shall be laid quietly down at last and then will all my calamities be at an end but how i stray again stray from my intention i would only have said that i had begun a letter to my cousin morden some time ago but that now i can never end it you will believe i cannot for how shall i tell him that all his compliments are misbestowed that all his advice is thrown away all his warnings vain and that even my highest expectation is to be the wife of that freeliver whom he so pathetically warns me to shun let me own however have your prayers joined with my own my fate depending as it seems upon the lips of such a man that whatever shall be my destiny that dreadful part of my fathers malediction that i may be punished by the man in whom he supposes i put my confidence may not take place that this for mr lovelaces own sake and for the sake of human nature may not be or if it be necessary in support of the parental authority that i should be punished by him that it may not be by his premeditated or wilful baseness but that i may be able to acquit his intention if not his action otherwise my fault will appear to be doubled in the eye of the eventjudging world and yet methinks i would be glad that the unkindness of my father and uncles whose hearts have already been too much wounded by my error may be justified in every article excepting in this heavy curse and that my father will be pleased to withdraw that before it be generally known at least the most dreadful part of it which regards futurity i must lay down my pen i must brood over these reflections once more before i close my cousins letter i will peruse it and then i shall have it by heart letter xx miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe sunday night may when you reflect upon my unhappy situation which is attended with so many indelicate and even shocking circumstances some of which my pride will not let me think of with patience all aggravated by the contents of my cousins affecting letter you will not wonder that the vapourishness which has laid hold of my heart should rise to my pen and yet it would be more kind more friendly in me to conceal from you who take such a generous interest in my concerns that worst part of my griefs which communication and complaint cannot relieve but to whom can i unbosom myself but to you when the man who ought to be my protector as he has brought upon me all my distresses adds to my apprehensions when i have not even a servant on whose fidelity i can rely or to whom i can break my griefs as they arise and when his bountiful temper and gay heart attach every one to him and i am but a cipher to give him significance and myself pain these griefs therefore do what i can will sometimes burst into tears and these mingling with my ink will blot my paper and i know you will not grudge me the temporary relief but i shall go on in the strain i left off with in my last when i intended rather to apologize for my melancholy but let what i have above written once for all be my apology my misfortunes have given you a call to discharge the noblest offices of the friendship we have vowed to each other in advice and consolation and it would be an injury to it and to you to suppose it needed even that call she then tells miss howe that now her clothes are come mr lovelace is continually teasing her to go abroad with him in a coach attended by whom she pleases of her own sex either for the air or to the public diversions she gives the particulars of a conversation that has passed between them on that subject and his several proposals but takes notice that he says not the least word of the solemnity which he so much pressed for before they came to town and which as she observes was necessary to give propriety to his proposals now my dear she says i cannot bear the life i live i would be glad at my heart to be out of his reach if i were he should soon find the difference if i must be humbled it had better be by those to whom i owe duty than by him my aunt writes in her letter that she dare not propose any thing in my favour you tell me that upon inquiry you find that had i not been unhappily seduced away a change of measures was actually resolved upon and that my mother particularly was determined to exert herself for the restoration of the family peace and in order to succeed the better had thoughts of trying to engage my uncle harlowe in her party see vol iii letter lii ibid letter viii let me build on these foundations i can but try my dear it is my duty to try all probably methods to restore the poor outcast to favour and who knows but that once indulgent uncle who has very great weight in the family may be induced to interpose in my behalf i will give up all right and title to my grandfathers devises and bequests with all my heart and soul to whom they please in order to make my proposal palatable to my brother and that my surrender may be effectual i will engage never to marry what think you my dear of this expedient surely they cannot resolve to renounce me for ever if they look with impartial eyes upon what has happened they will have something to blame themselves for as well as me i presume that you will be of opinion that this expedient is worth trying but here is my difficulty if i should write my hardhearted brother has so strongly confederated them all against me that my letter would be handed about from one to another till he had hardened every one to refuse my request whereas could my uncle be engaged to espouse my cause as from himself i should have some hope as i presume to think he would soon have my mother and my aunt of his party what therefore i am thinking of is this suppose mr hickman whose good character has gained him every bodys respect should put himself in my uncle harlowes way and as if from your knowledge of the state of things between mr lovelace and me assure him not only of the above particulars but that i am under no obligations that shall hinder me from taking his directions i submit the whole to your consideration whether to pursue it at all or in what manner but if it be pursued and if my uncle refuses to interest himself in my favour upon mr hickmans application as from you for so for obvious reasons it must be put i can then have no hope and my next step in the mind i am in shall be to throw myself into the protection of the ladies of his family it were an impiety to adopt the following lines because it would be throwing upon the decrees of providence a fault too much my own but often do i revolve them for the sake of the general similitude which they bear to my unhappy yet undersigned error to you great gods i make my last appeal or clear my virtue or my crimes reveal if wandring in the maze of life i run and backward tread the steps i sought to shun impute my error to your own decree my feet are guilty but my heart is free the lady dates again on monday to let miss howe know that mr lovelace on observing her uneasiness had introduced to her mr mennell mrs fretchvilles kinsman who managed all her affairs she calls him a young officer of sense and politeness who gave her an account of the house and furniture to the same effect that mr lovelace had done before as also of the melancholy way mrs fretchville is in see letter iv of this volume she tells miss howe how extremely urgent mr lovelace was with the gentleman to get his spouse as he now always calls her before company a sight of the house and that mr mennell undertook that very afternoon to show her all of it except the apartment mrs fretchville should be in when she went but that she chose not to take another step till she knew how she approved of her scheme to have her uncle sounded and with what success if tried it would be attended mr lovelace in his humourous way gives his friend an account of the ladys peevishness and dejection on receiving a letter with her clothes he regrets that he has lost her confidence which he attributes to his bringing her into the company of his four companions yet he thinks he must excuse them and censure her for overniceness for that he never saw men behave better at least not them mentioning his introducing mr mennell to her now jack says he was it not very kind of mr mennell captain mennell i sometimes called him for among the military there is no such officer thou knowest as a lieutenant or an ensign was it not very kind in him to come along with me so readily as he did to satisfy my beloved about the vapourish lady and the house but who is capt mennell methinks thou askest i never heard of such a man as captain mennell very likely but knowest thou not young newcomb honest dolemans newphew oho is it he it is and i have changed his name by virtue of my own single authority knowest thou not that i am a great namefather preferment i bestow both military and civil i give estates and take them away at my pleasure quality too i create and by a still more valuable prerogative i degrade by virtue of my own imperial will without any other act of forfeiture than my own convenience what a poor thing is a monarch to me but mennell now he has seen this angel of a woman has qualms thats the devil i shall have enough to do to keep him right but it is the less wonder that he should stagger when a few hours conversation with the same lady could make four much more hardened varlets find hearts only that i am confident that i shall at least reward her virtue if her virtue overcome me or i should find it impossible to persevere for at times i have confounded qualms myself but say not a word of them to the confraternity nor laugh at me for them thyself in another letter dated monday night he writes as follows this perverse lady keeps me at such a distance that i am sure something is going on between her and miss howe notwithstanding the prohibition from mrs howe to both and as i have thought it some degree of merit in myself to punish others for their transgressions i am of opinion that both these girls are punishable for their breach of parental injunctions and as to their lettercarrier i have been inquiring into his way of living and finding him to be a common poacher a deerstealer and warrenrobber who under pretence of haggling deals with a set of customers who constantly take all he brings whether fish fowl or venison i hold myself justified since wilsons conveyance must at present be sacred to have him stripped and robbed and what money he has about him given to the poor since if i take not money as well as letters i shall be suspected to serve ones self and punish a villain at the same time is serving public and private the law was not made for such a man as me and i must come at correspondences so disobediently carried on but on second thoughts if i could find out that the dear creature carried any of her letters in her pockets i can get her to a play or to a concert and she may have the misfortune to lose her pockets but how shall i find this out since her dorcas knows no more of her dressing and undressing than her lovelace for she is dressed for the day before she appears even to her servant vilely suspicious upon my soul jack a suspicious temper is a punishable temper if a woman suspects a rogue in an honest man is it not enough to make the honest man who knows it a rogue but as to her pockets i think my mind hankers after them as the less mischievous attempt but they cannot hold all the letters i should wish to see and yet a womans pockets are half as deep as she is high tied round the sweet levities i presume as ballastbags lest the wind as they move with full sail from whaleribbed canvass should blow away the gypsies he then in apprehension that something is meditating between the two ladies or that something may be set on foot to get miss harlowe out of his hands relates several of his contrivances and boasts of his instructions given in writing to dorcas and to his servant will summers and says that he has provided against every possible accident even to bring her back if she should escape or in case she should go abroad and then refuse to return and hopes so to manage as that should he make an attempt whether he succeeded in it or not he may have a pretence to detain her he then proceeds as follows i have ordered dorcas to cultivate by all means her ladys favour to lament her incapacity as to writing and reading to shew letters to her lady as from pretended country relations to beg her advice how to answer them and to get them answered and to be always aiming at scrawling with a pen lest inky fingers should give suspicion i have moreover given the wench an ivoryleafed pocketbook with a silver pencil that she may make memoranda on occasion and let me tell thee that the lady has already at mrs sinclairs motion removed her clothes out of the trunks they came in into an ample mahogany repository where they will lie at full length and which has drawers in it for linen a repository that used to hold the riches suits which some of the nymphs put on when they are to be dressed out to captivate or to ape quality for many a countess thou knowest has our mother equipped nay two or three duchesses who live upon quality terms with their lords but this to such as will come up to her price and can make an appearance like quality themselves on the occasion for the reputation of persons of birth must not lie at the mercy of every underdegreed sinner a masterkey which will open every lock in this chest is put into dorcass hands and she is to take care when she searches for papers before she removes any thing to observe how it lies that she may replace all to a hair sally and polly can occasionally help to transcribe slow and sure with such an arguseyed charmer must be all my movements it is impossible that one so young and so inexperienced as she is can have all her caution from herself the behaviour of the women so unexceptionable no revellings no company ever admitted into this inner house all genteel quiet and easy in it the nymphs wellbred and wellread her first disgusts to the old one got over it must be miss howe therefore who once was in danger of being taken in by one of our class by honest sir george colmar as thou hast heard that makes my progress difficult thou seest belford by the above precautionaries that i forget nothing as the song says it is not to be imagined on what slight strings depend these things on which men build their glory so far so good i shall never rest till i have discovered in the first place where the dear creature puts her letters and in the next till i have got her to a play to a concert or to take an airing with me out of town for a day or two i gave thee just now some of my contrivances dorcas who is ever attentive to all her ladys motions has given me some instances of her mistresss precautions she wafers her letters it seems in two places pricks the wafers and then seals upon them no doubt but the same care is taken with regard to those brought to her for she always examines the seals of the latter before she opens them i must i must come at them this difficulty augments my curiosity strange so much as she writes and at all hours that not one sleepy or forgetful moment has offered in our favour a fair contention thou seest nor plead thou in her favour her youth her beauty her family her fortune credulity she has none and with regard to her tender years am i not a young fellow myself as to beauty prythee jack do thou to spare my modesty make a comparison between my clarissa for a woman and thy lovelace for a man for her family that was not known to its country a century ago and i hate them all but her have i not cause for her fortune fortune thou knowest was ever a stimulus with me and this for reasons not ignoble do not girls of fortune adorn themselves on purpose to engage our attention seek they not to draw us into their snares depend they not generally upon their fortunes in the views they have upon us more than on their merits shall we deprive them of the benefit of their principal dependence can i in particular marry every girl who wishes to obtain my notice if therefore in support of the libertine principles for which none of the sweet rogues hate us a woman of fortune is brought to yield homage to her emperor and any consequences attend the subjugation is not such a one shielded by her fortune as well from insult and contempt as from indigence all then that admits of debate between my beloved and me is only this which of the two has more wit more circumspection and that remains to be tried a sad life however this life of doubt and suspense for the poor lady to live as well as for me that is to say if she be not naturally jealous if she be her uneasiness is constitutional and she cannot help it nor will it in that case hurt her for a suspicious temper will make occasion for doubt if none were to offer to its hand my fair one therefore if naturally suspicious is obliged to me for saving her the trouble of studying for these occasions but after all the plainest paths in our journeys through life are the safest and best i believe although it is not given me to choose them i am not however singular in the pursuit of the more intricate paths since there are thousands and ten thousands who had rather fish in troubled waters than in smooth letter xxi mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday may i am a very unhappy man this lady is said to be one of the sweetest tempered creatures in the world and so i thought her but to me she is one of the most perverse i never was supposed to be an illnatured mortal neither how can it be i imagined for a long while that we were born to make each other happy but quite the contrary we really seem to be sent to plague each other i will write a comedy i think i have a title already and thats half the work the quarrelsome lovers twill do theres something new and striking in it yet more or less all lovers quarrel old terence has taken notice of that and observes upon it that lovers falling out occasions lovers falling in and a better understanding of course tis natural that it should be so but with us we fall out so often without falling in once and a second quarrel so generally happens before a first is made up that it is hard to guess what event our loves will be attended with but perseverance is my glory and patience my handmaid when i have in view an object worthy of my attempts what is there in an easy conquest hudibras questions well what mad lover ever dyd to gain a soft and easy bride or for a lady tenderhearted in purling streams or hemp departed but i will lead to the occasion of this preamble i had been out on my return meeting dorcas on the stairs your lady in her chamber dorcas in the diningroom sir and if ever you hope for an opportunity to come at a letter it must be now for at her feet i saw one lie which as may be seen by its open fold she had been reading with a little parcel of others she is now busied with all pulled out of her pocket as i believe so sir youll know where to find them another time i was ready to leap for joy and instantly resolved to bring forward an expedient which i had held in petto and entering the diningroom with an air of transport i boldly clasped my arms about her as she sat she huddling up her papers in her handkerchief all the time the dropped paper unseen o my dearest life a lucky expedient have mr mennell and i hit upon just now in order to hasten mrs fretchville to quit the house i have agreed if you approve of it to entertain her cook her housemaid and two menservants about whom she was very solicitous till you are provided to your mind and that no accommodations may be wanted i have consented to take the household linen at an appraisement i am to pay down five hundred pounds and the remainder as soon as the bills can be looked up and the amount of them adjusted thus will you have a charming house entirely ready to receive you some of the ladies of my family will soon be with you they will not permit you long to suspend my happy day and that nothing may be wanting to gratify your utmost punctilio i will till then consent to stay here at mrs sinclairs while you reside at your new house and leave the rest to your own generosity o my beloved creature will not this be agreeable to you i am sure it will it must and clasping her closer to me i gave her a more fervent kiss than ever i had dared to give her before i permitted not my ardour to overcome my discretion however for i took care to set my foot upon the letter and scraped it farther from her as it were behind her chair she was in a passion at the liberty i took bowing low i begged her pardon and stooping still lower in the same motion took up the letter and whipt it into my bosom pox on me for a puppy a fool a blockhead a clumsy varlet a mere jack belford i thought myself a much cleverer fellow than i am why could i not have been followed in by dorcas who might have taken it up while i addressed her lady for here the letter being unfolded i could not put it in my bosom without alarming her ears as my sudden motion did her eyes up she flew in a moment traitor judas her eyes flashing lightning and a perturbation in her eager countenance so charming what have you taken up and then what for both my ears i durst not have done to her she made no scruple to seize the stolen letter though in my bosom what was to be done on so palpable a detection i clasped her hand which had hold of the ravished paper between mine o my beloved creature said i can you think i have not some curiosity is it possible you can be thus for ever employed and i loving narrative letterwriting above every other species of writing and admiring your talent that way should not thus upon the dawn of my happiness as i presume to hope burn with a desire to be admitted into so sweet a correspondence let go my hand stamping with her pretty foot how dare you sir at this rate i see too plainly i see and more she could not say but gasping was ready to faint with passion and affright the devil a bit of her accustomed gentleness to be seen in her charming face or to be heard in her musical voice having gone thus far loth very loth was i to lose my prize once more i got hold of the rumpledup letter impudent man were her words stamping again for gods sake then it was i let go my prize lest she should faint away but had the pleasure first to find my hand within both hers she trying to open my reluctant fingers how near was my heart at that moment to my hand throbbing to my fingers ends to be thus familiarly although angrily treated by the charmer of my soul when she had got it in her possession she flew to the door i threw myself in her way shut it and in the humblest manner besought her to forgive me and yet do you think the harlowehearted charmer notwithstanding the agreeable annunciation i came in with would forgive me no truly but pushing me rudely from the door as if i had been nothing yet do i love to try so innocently to try her strength too she gained that force through passion which i had lost through fear out she shot to her own apartment thank my stars she could fly no farther and as soon as she entered it in a passion still she doublelocked and doublebolted herself in this my comfort on reflection that upon a greater offence it cannot be worse i retreated to my own apartment with my heart full and my man will not being near me gave myself a plaguy knock on the forehead with my double fist and now is my charmer shut up from me refusing to see me refusing her meals she resolves not to see me thats more never again if she can help it and in the mind she is in i hope she has said the dear creatures whenever they quarrel with their humble servants should always remember this saving clause that they may not be forsworn but thinkest thou that i will not make it the subject of one of my first plots to inform myself of the reason why all this commotion was necessary on so slight an occasion as this would have been were not the letters that pass between these ladies of a treasonable nature wednesday morning no admission to breakfast any more than to supper i wish this lady is not a simpleton after all i have sent up in captain mennells name a message from captain mennell madam it wont do she is of baby age she cannot be a solomon i was going to say in every thing solomon jack was the wisest man but didst ever hear who was the wisest woman i want a comparison for this lady cunning women and witches we read of without number but i fancy wisdom never entered into the character of a woman it is not a requisite of the sex women indeed make better sovereigns than men but why is that because the womensovereigns are governed by men the men sovereigns by women charming by my soul for hence we guess at the rudder by which both are steered but to putting wisdom out of the question and to take cunning in that is to say to consider woman as a woman what shall we do if this lady has something extraordinary in her head repeated charges has she given to wilson by a particular messenger to send any letter directed for her the moment it comes i must keep a good lookout she is not now afraid of her brothers plot i shant be at all surprised if singleton calls upon miss howe as the only person who knows or is likely to know where miss harlowe is pretending to have affairs of importance and of particular service to her if he can but be admitted to her speech of compromise who knows from her brother then will miss howe warn her to keep close then will my protection be again necessary this will do i believe any thing from miss howe must joseph leman is a vile fellow with her and my implement joseph honest joseph as i call him may hang himself i have played him off enough and have very little further use for him no need to wear one plot to the stumps when i can find new ones every hour nor blame me for the use i make of my talents who that hath such will let em be idle well then i will find a singleton thats all i have to do instantly find one will sir this moment call me hither thy cousin paul wheatly just come from sea whom thou wert recommending to my service if i were to marry and keep a pleasureboat presto wills gone paul will be here presently presently to mrs howes if paul be singletons mate coming from his captain it will do as well as if it were singleton himself sally a little devil often reproaches me with the slowness of my proceedings but in a play does not the principal entertainment lie in the first four acts is not all in a manner over when you come to the fifth and what a vulture of a man must he be who souses upon his prey and in the same moment trusses and devours but to own the truth i have overplotted myself to my make my work secure as i thought i have frighted the dear creature with the sight of my four hottentots and i shall be a long time i doubt before i can recover my lost ground and then this cursed family at harloweplace have made her out of humour with me with herself and with all the world but miss howe who no doubt is continually adding difficulties to my other difficulties i am very unwilling to have recourse to measures which these demons below are continually urging me to take because i am sure that at last i shall be brought to make her legally mine one complete trial over and i think i will do her noble justice well pauls gone gone already has all his lessons a notable fellow lord ws necessaryman was paul before he went to sea a more sensible rogue paul than joseph not such a pretender to piety neither as the other at what a price have i bought that joseph i believe i must punish the rascal at last but must let him marry first then though that may be punishment enough i shall punish two at once in the man and his wife and how richly does betty deserve punishment for her behaviour to my goddess but now i hear the rusty hinges of my beloveds door give me creaking invitation my heart creaks and throbs with respondent trepidations whimsical enough though for what relation has a lovers heart to a rusty pair of hinges but they are the hinges that open and shut the door of my beloveds bedchamber relation enough in that i hear not the door shut again i shall receive her commands i hope anon what signifies her keeping me thus at a distance she must be mine let me do or offer what i will courage whenever i assume all is over for should she think of escaping from hence whither can she fly to avoid me her parents will not receive her her uncles will not entertain her her beloved norton is in their direction and cannot miss howe dare not she has not one friend in town but me is entirely a stranger to the town and what then is the matter with me that i should be thus unaccountably overawed and tyrannized over by a dear creature who want sonly to know how impossible it is that she should escape me in order to be as humble to me as she is to her persecuting relations should i ever make the grand attempt and fail and should she hate me for it her hatred can be but temporary she has already incurred the censure of the world she must therefore choose to be mine for the sake of soldering up her reputation in the eye of that impudent world for who that knows me and knows that she has been in my power though but for twentyfour hours will think her spotless as to fact let her inclination be what it will and then human nature is such a wellknown rogue that every man and woman judges by what each knows of him or herself that inclination is no more to be trusted where an opportunity is given than i am especially where a woman young and blooming loves a man well enough to go off with him for such will be the worlds construction in the present case she calls her maid dorcas no doubt that i may hear her harmonious voice and to give me an opportunity to pour out my soul at her feet to renew all my vows and to receive her pardon for the past offence and then with what pleasure shall i begin upon a new score and afterwards wipe out that and begin another and another till the last offence passes and there can be no other and once after that to be forgiven will be to be forgiven for ever the door is again shut dorcas tells me that her lady denies to admit me to dine with her a favour i had ordered the wench to beseech her to grant me the next time she saw her not uncivilly however denies comingto by degrees nothing but the last offence the honest wench tells me in the language of her principals below will do with her the last offence is meditating yet this vile recreant heart of mine plays me booty but here i conclude though the tyranness leaves me nothing to do but to read write and fret subscription is formal between us besides i am so much hers that i cannot say how much i am thine or any other persons letter xxii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe tuesday may if my dear you approve of the application to my uncle harlowe i wish it to be made as soon as possible we are quite out again i have shut myself up from him the offence indeed not so very great and yet it is too he had like to have got a letter one of yours but never will i write again or reperuse my papers in an apartment where he thinks himself entitled to come he did not read a line of it indeed he did not so dont be uneasy and depend upon future caution thus it was the sun being upon my closet and mr lovelace abroad she then gives miss howe an account of his coming by surprise upon her of his fluttering speech of his bold address of her struggle with him for the letter c and now my dear proceeds she i am more and more convinced that i am too much in his power to make it prudent to stay with him and if my friends will but give me hope i will resolve to abandon him for ever o my dear he is a fierce a foolish an insolent creature and in truth i hardly expect that we can accommodate how much unhappier am i already with him than my mother ever was with my father after marriage since and that without any reason any pretence in the world for it he is for breaking my spirit before i am his and while i am or ought to be o my folly that i am not in my own power till i can know whether my friends will give me hope or not i must do what i never studied to do before in any case that is try to keep this difference open and yet it will make me look little in my own eyes because i shall mean by it more than i can own but this is one of the consequences of all engagements where the minds are unpaired dispaired in my case i must say let this evermore be my caution to individuals of my sex guard your eye twill ever be in a combination against your judgment if there are two parts to be taken it will be for ever traitor as it is take the wrong one if you ask me my dear how this caution befits me let me tell you a secret which i have but very lately found out upon selfexamination although you seem to have made the discovery long ago that had not my foolish eye been too much attached i had not taken the pains to attempt so officiously as i did the prevention of mischief between him and some of my family which first induced the correspondence between us and was the occasion of bringing the apprehended mischief with double weight upon himself my vanity and conceit as far as i know might have part in the inconsiderate measure for does it not look as if i thought myself more capable of obviating difficulties than anybody else of my family but you must not my dear suppose my heart to be still a confederate with my eye that deluded eye now clearly sees its fault and the misled heart despises it for it hence the application i am making to my uncle hence it is that i can say i think truly that i would atone for my fault at any rate even by the sacrifice of a limb or two if that would do adieu my dearest friend may your heart never know the hundredth part of the pain mine at present feels prays your clarissa harlowe letter xxiii miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe wednesday may i will write no man shall write for me no woman shall hinder me from writing surely i am of age to distinguish between reason and caprice i am not writing to a man am i if i were carrying on a correspondence with a fellow of whom my mother disapproved and whom it might be improper for me to encourage my own honour and my duty would engage my obedience but as the case is so widely different not a word more on this subject i beseech you clarissa proposes mr hickman to write for miss howe see letter xi of this volume paragr ult i much approve of your resolution to leave this wretch if you can make it up with your uncle i hate the man most heartily do i hate him for his teasing ways the very reading of your account of them teases me almost as much as they can you may you have encouragement to fly the foolish wretch i have other reasons to wish you may for i have just made an acquaintance with one who knows a vast deal of his private history the man is really a villain my dear an execrable one if all be true that i have heard and yet i am promised other particulars i do assure you my dear friend that had he a dozen lives he might have forfeited them all and been dead twenty crimes ago if ever you condescend to talk familiarly with him again ask him after miss betterton and what became of her and if he shuffle and prevaricate as to her question him about miss lockyer o my dear the mans a villain i will have your uncle sounded as you desire and that out of hand but yet i am afraid of the success and this for several reasons tis hard to say what the sacrifice of your estate would do with some people and yet i must not when it comes to the test permit you to make it as your hannah continues ill i would advise you to try to attach dorcas to your interest have you not been impoliticly shy of her i wish you could come at some of his letters surely a man of his negligent character cannot be always guarded if he be and if you cannot engage your servant i shall suspect them both let him be called upon at a short warning when he is writing or when he has papers lying about and so surprise him into negligence such inquiries i know are of the same nature with those we make at an inn in traveling when we look into every corner and closet for fear of a villain yet should be frighted out of our wits were we to find one but tis better to detect such a one when awake and up than to be attacked by him when in bed and asleep i am glad you have your clothes but no money no books but a spira a drexelius and a practice of piety those who sent the latter ought to have kept it for themselves but i must hurry myself from this subject you have exceedingly alarmed me by what you hint of his attempt to get one of my letters i am assured by my new informant that he is the head of a gang of wretched those he brought you among no doubt were some of them who join together to betray innocent creatures and to support one another afterwards by violence and were he to come at the knowledge of the freedoms i take with him i should be afraid to stir out without a guard i am sorry to tell you that i have reason to think that your brother has not laid aside his foolish plot a sunburnt sailorlooking fellow was with me just now pretending great service to you from captain singleton could he be admitted to your speech i pleaded ignorance as to the place of your abode the fellow was too well instructed for me to get any thing out of him i wept for two hours incessantly on reading yours which enclosed that from your cousin morden my dearest creature do not desert yourself let your anna howe obey the call of that friendship which has united us as one soul and endeavour to give you consolation see letter xix of this volume i wonder not at the melancholy reflections you so often cast upon yourself in your letters for the step you have been forced upon one hand and tricked into on the other a strange fatality as if it were designed to show the vanity of all human prudence i wish my dear as you hint that both you and i have not too much prided ourselves in a perhaps too conscious superiority over others but i will stop how apt are weak minds to look out for judgments in any extraordinary event tis so far right that it is better and safer and juster to arraign ourselves or our dearest friends than providence which must always have wise ends to answer its dispensations but do not talk as if one of your former of being a warning only you will be as excellent an example as ever you hoped to be as well as a warning and that will make your story to all that shall come to know it of double efficacy for were it that such a merit as yours could not ensure to herself noble and generous usage from a libertine heart who will expect any tolerable behaviour from men of his character see vol iii letter xxviii if you think yourself inexcusable for taking a step that put you into the way of delusion without any intention to go off with him what must those giddy creatures think of themselves who without half your provocations and inducements and without any regard to decorum leap walls drop from windows and steal away from their parents house to the seducers bed in the same day again if you are so ready to accuse yourself for dispensing with the prohibitions of the most unreasonable parents which yet were but half prohibitions at first what ought those to do who wilfully shut their ears to the advice of the most reasonable and that perhaps where apparent ruin or undoubted inconvenience is the consequence of the predetermined rashness and lastly to all who will know your story you will be an excellent example of watchfulness and of that caution and reserve by which a prudent person who has been supposed to be a little misled endeavours to mend her error and never once losing sight of her duty does all in her power to recover the path she has been rather driven out of than chosen to swerve from come come my dearest friend consider but these things and steadily without desponding pursue your earnest purposes to amend what you think has been amiss and it may not be a misfortune in the end that you have erred especially as so little of your will was in your error and indeed i must say that i use the words misled and error and such like only in compliment to your own tooready selfaccusations and to the opinion of one to whom i owe duty for i think in my conscience that every part of your conduct is defensible and that those only are blamable who have no other way to clear themselves but by condemning you i expect however that such melancholy reflections as drop from your pen but too often will mingle with all your future pleasures were you to marry lovelace and were he to make the best of husbands you was immensely happy above the happiness of a mortal creature before you knew him every body almost worshipped you envy itself which has of late reared up its venomous head against you was awed by your superior worthiness into silence and admiration you was the soul of every company where you visited your elders have i seen declining to offer their opinions upon a subject till you had delivered yours often to save themselves the mortification of retracting theirs when they heard yours yet in all this your sweetness of manners your humility and affability caused the subscription every one made to your sentiments and to your superiority to be equally unfeigned and unhesitating for they saw that their applause and the preference they gave you to themselves subjected not themselves to insults nor exalted you into any visible triumph over them for you had always something to say on every point you carried that raised the yielding heart and left every one pleased and satisfied with themselves though they carried not off the palm your works were showed or referred to wherever fine works were talked of nobody had any but an inferior and secondhand praise for diligence for economy for reading for writing for memory for facility in learning every thing laudable and even for the more envied graces of person and dress and an allsurpassing elegance in both where you were known and those subjects talked of the poor blessed you every step you trod the rich thought you their honour and took a pride that they were not obliged to descend from their own class for an example that did credit to it though all men wished for you and sought you young as you were yet had not those who were brought to address you been encouraged out of sordid and spiteful views not one of them would have dared to lift up his eyes to you thus happy in all about you thus making happy all within your circle could you think that nothing would happen to you to convince you that you were not to be exempted from the common lot to convinced you that you were not absolutely perfect and that you must not expect to pass through life without trial temptation and misfortune indeed it must be owned that no trial no temptation worthy of your virtue and of your prudence could well have attacked you sooner because of your tender years and more effectually than those heavy ones under which you struggle since it must be allowed that you equanimity and foresight made you superior to common accidents for are not most of the troubles that fall to the lot of common mortals brought upon themselves either by their too large desires or too little deserts cases both from which you stood exempt it was therefore to be some man or some worse spirit in the shape of one that formed on purpose was to be sent to invade you while as many other such spirits as there are persons in your family were permitted to take possession severally in one dark hour of the heart of every one of it there to sit perching perhaps and directing every motion to the motions of the seducer without in order to irritate to provoke to push you forward to meet him upon the whole there seems as i have often said to have been a kind of fate in your error if it were an error and this perhaps admitted for the sake of a better example to be collected from your sufferings than could have been given had you never erred for my dear the time of adversity is your shiningtime i see it evidently that adversity must call forth graces and beauties which could not have been brought to light in a run of that prosperous fortune which attended you from your cradle till now admirably as you became and as we all thought greatly as you deserved that prosperity all the matter is the trial must be grievous to you it is to me it is to all who love you and looked upon you as one set aloft to be admired and imitated and not as a mark as you have lately found for envy to shoot its shafts at let what i have written above have its due weight with you my dear and then as warm imaginations are not without a mixture of enthusiasm your anna howe who on reperusal of it imagines it to be in a style superior to her usual style will be ready to flatter herself that she has been in a manner inspired with the hints that have comforted and raised the dejected heart of her suffering friend who from such hard trials in a bloom so tender may find at times her spirits sunk too low to enable her to pervade the surrounding darkness which conceals from her the hopeful dawning of the better day which awaits her i will add no more at present than that i am your ever faithful and affectionate anna howe letter xxiv miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe friday may i must be silent my exalted friend under praises that oppress my heart with a consciousness of not deserving them at the same time that the generous design of those praises raises and comforts it for it is a charming thing to stand high in the opinion of those we love and to find that there are souls that can carry their friendships beyond accidents beyond body and ties of blood whatever my dearest creature is my shiningtime the time of a friends adversity is yours and it would be almost a fault in me to regret those afflictions which give you an opportunity so gloriously to exert those qualities which not only ennoble our sex but dignify human nature but let me proceed to subjects less agreeable i am sorry you have reason to think singletons projects are not at an end but who knows what the sailor had to propose yet had any good been intended me this method would hardly have been fallen upon depend upon it my dear your letters shall be safe i have made a handle of mr lovelaces bold attempt and freedom as i told you i would to keep him ever since at a distance that i may have an opportunity to see the success of the application to my uncle and to be at liberty to embrace any favourable overtures that may arise from it yet he has been very importunate and twice brought mr mennell from mrs fretchvill to talk about the house if i should be obliged to make up with him again i shall think i am always doing myself a spite as to what you mention of his newlydetected crimes and your advice to attach dorcas to my interest and to come at some of his letters these things will require more or less of my attention as i may hope favour or not from my uncle harlowe i am sorry that my poor hannah continues ill pray my dear inform yourself and let me know whether she wants any thing that befits her case i will not close this letter till tomorrow is over for i am resolved to go to church and this as well for the sake of my duty as to see if i am at liberty to go out when i please without being attended or accompanied sunday may i have not been able to avoid a short debate with mr lovelace i had ordered a coach to the door when i had noticed that it was come i went out of my chamber to go to it but met him dressed on the stairs head with a book in his hand but without his hat and sword he asked with an air very solemn yet respectful if i were going abroad i told him i was he desired leave to attend me if i were going to church i refused him and then he complained heavily of my treatment of him and declared that he would not live such another week as the past for the world i owned to him very frankly that i had made an application to my friends and that i was resolved to keep myself to myself till i knew the issue of it he coloured and seemed surprised but checking himself in something he was going to say he pleaded my danger from singleton and again desired to attend me and then he told me that mrs fretchville had desired to continue a fortnight longer in the house she found said he that i was unable to determine about entering upon it and now who knows when such a vapourish creature will come to a resolution this madam has been an unhappy week for had i not stood upon such bad terms with you you might have been new mistress of that house and probably had my cousin montague if not lady betty actually with you and so sir taking all you say for granted your cousin montague cannot come to mrs sinclairs what pray is her objection to mrs sinclairs is this house fit for me to live in a month or two and not fit for any of your relations for a few days and mrs fretchville has taken more time too then pushing by him i hurried down stairs he called to dorcas to bring him his sword and hat and following me down into the passage placed himself between me and the door and again desired leave to attend me mrs sinclair came out at that instant and asked me if i did not choose a dish of chocolate i wish mrs sinclair said i you would take this man in with you to your chocolate i dont know whether i am at liberty to stir out without his leave or not then turning to him i asked if he kept me there his prisoner dorcas just then bringing him his sword and hat he opened the street door and taking my reluctant hand led me in a very obsequious manner to the coach people passing by stopped stared and whispered but he is so graceful in his person and dress that he generally takes every eye i was uneasy to be so gazed at and he stepped in after me and the coachman drove to st pauls he was very full of assiduities all the way while i was as reserved as possible and when i returned dined as i had done the greatest part of the week by myself he told me upon my resolving to do so that although he would continue his passive observance till i knew the issue of my application yet i must expect that then i should not rest one moment till i had fixed his happy day for that his very soul was fretted with my slights resentments and delays a wretch when can i say to my infinite regret on a double account that all he complains of is owing to himself o that i may have good tidings from my uncle adieu my dearest friend this shall lie ready for an exchange as i hope for one tomorrow from you that will decide as i may say the destiny of your clarissa harlowe letter xxv miss howe to mrs judith norton thursday may good mrs norton cannot you without naming me as an adviser who am hated by the family contrive a way to let mrs harlowe know that in an accidental conversation with me you had been assured that my beloved friend pines after a reconciliation with her relations that she has hitherto in hopes of it refused to enter into any obligation that shall be in the least a hinderance sic to it that she would fain avoid giving mr lovelace a right to make her family uneasy in relation to her grandfathers estate that all she wishes for still is to be indulged in her choice of a single life and on that condition would make her fathers pleasure hers with regard to that estate that mr lovelace is continually pressing her to marry him and all his friends likewise but that i am sure she has so little liking to the man because of his faulty morals and of the antipathy of her relations to him that if she had any hope given her of a reconciliation she would forego all thoughts of him and put herself into her fathers protection but that their resolution must be speedy for otherwise she would find herself obliged to give way to his pressing entreaties and it might then be out of her power to prevent disagreeable litigations i do assure you mrs norton upon my honour that our dearest friend knows nothing of this procedure of mine and therefore it is proper to acquaint you in confidence with my grounds for it these are they she had desired me to let mr hickman drop hints to the above effect to her uncle harlowe but indirectly as from himself lest if the application should not be attended with success and mr lovelace who already takes it ill that he has so little of her favour come to know it she may be deprived of every protection and be perhaps subjected to great inconveniencies from so haughty a spirit having this authority from her and being very solicitous about the success of the application i thought that if the weight of so good a wife mother and sister as mrs harlowe is known to be were thrown into the same scale with that of mr john harlowe supposing he could be engaged it could hardly fail of making a due impression mr hickman will see mr john harlowe tomorrow by that time you may see mrs harlowe if mr hickman finds the old gentleman favourable he will tell him that you will have seen mrs harlowe upon the same account and will advise him to join in consultation with her how best to proceed to melt the most obdurate heart in the world this is the fair state of the matter and my true motive for writing to you i leave all therefore to your discretion and most heartily wish success to it being of opinion that mr lovelace cannot possibly deserve our admirable friend nor indeed know i the man who does pray acquaint me by a line of the result of your interposition if it prove not such as may be reasonably hoped for our dear friend shall know nothing of this step from me and pray let her not from you for in that case it would only give deeper grief to a heart already too much afflicted i am dear and worthy mrs norton your true friend anna howe letter xxvi mrs norton to miss howe saturday may dear madam my heart is almost broken to be obliged to let you know that such is the situation of things in the family of my everdear miss harlowe that there can be at present no success expected from any application in her favour her poor mother is to be pitied i have a most affecting letter from her but must not communicate it to you and she forbids me to let it be known that she writes upon the subject although she is compelled as it were to do it for the ease of her own heart i mention it therefore in confidence i hope in god that my beloved young lady has preserved her honour inviolate i hope there is not a man breathing who could attempt a sacrilege so detestable i have no apprehension of a failure in a virtue so established god for ever keep so pure a heart out of the reach of surprises and violence ease dear madam i beseech you my overanxious heart by one line by the bearer although but one line to acquaint me as surely you can that her honour is unsullied if it be not adieu to all the comforts this life can give since none will it be able to afford to the poor judith norton letter xxvii miss howe to mrs judith norton saturday evening may dear good woman your beloveds honour is inviolate must be inviolate and will be so in spite of men and devils could i have had hope of a reconciliation all my view was that she should not have had this man all that can be said now is she must run the risk of a bad husband she of whom no man living is worthy you pity her mother so do not i i pity no mother that puts it out of her power to show maternal love and humanity in order to patch up for herself a precarious and sorry quiet which every blast of wind shall disturb i hate tyrants in ever form and shape but paternal and maternal tyrants are the worst of all for they can have no bowels i repeat that i pity none of them our beloved friend only deserves pity she had never been in the hands of this man but for them she is quite blameless you dont know all her story were i to tell you that she had no intention to go off with this man it would avail her nothing it would only deserve to condemn with those who drove her to extremities him who now must be her refuge i am your sincere friend and servant anna howe letter xxviii mrs harlowe to mrs norton not communicated till the letters came to be collected saturday may i return an answer in writing as i promised to your communication but take no notice either to my bellas betty who i understand sometimes visits you or to the poor wretch herself nor to any body that i do write i charge you dont my heart is full writing may give some vent to my griefs and perhaps i may write what lies most upon my heart without confining myself strictly to the present subject you know how dear this ungrateful creature ever was to us all you know how sincerely we joined with every one of those who ever had seen her or conversed with her to praise and admire her and exceeded in our praise even the bounds of that modesty which because she was our own should have restrained us being of opinion that to have been silent in the praise of so apparent a merit must rather have argued blindness or affectation in us than that we should incur the censure of vain partiality to our own when therefore any body congratulated us on such a daughter we received their congratulations without any diminution if it was said you are happy in this child we owned that no parents ever were happier in a child if more particularly they praised her dutiful behaviour to us we said she knew not how to offend if it were said miss clarissa harlowe has a wit and penetration beyond her years we instead of disallowing it would add and a judgment no less extraordinary than her wit if her prudence was praised and a forethought which every one saw supplied what only years and experience gave to others nobody need to scruple taking lessons from clarissa harlowe was our proud answer forgive me o forgive me my dear norton but i know you will for yours when good was this child and your glory as well as mine but have you not heard strangers as she passed to and from church stop to praise the angel of a creature as they called her when it was enough for those who knew who she was to cry why it is miss clarissa harlowe as if every body were obliged to know or to have heard of clarissa harlowe and of her excellencies while accustomed to praise it was too familiar to her to cause her to alter either her look or her pace for my own part i could not stifle a pleasure that had perhaps a faulty vanity for its foundation whenever i was spoken of or addressed to as the mother of so sweet a child mr harlowe and i all the time loving each other the better for the share each had in such a daughter still still indulge the fond the overflowing heart of a mother i could dwell for ever upon the remembrance of what she was would but that remembrance banish from my mind what she is in her bosom young as she was could i repose all my griefs sure of receiving from her prudence and advice as well as comfort and both insinuated in so dutiful a manner that it was impossible to take those exceptions which the distance of years and character between a mother and a daughter would have made one apprehensive of from any other daughter she was our glory when abroad our delight when at home every body was even covetous of her company and we grudged her to our brothers harlowe and to our sister and brother hervey no other contention among us then but who should be next favoured by her no chiding ever knew she from us but the chiding of lovers when she was for shutting herself up too long together from us in pursuit of those charming amusements and useful employments for which however the whole family was the better our other children had reason good children as they always were to think themselves neglected but they likewise were so sensible of their sisters superiority and of the honour she reflected upon the whole family that they confessed themselves eclipsed without envying the eclipser indeed there was not any body so equal with her in their own opinions as to envy what all aspired but to emulate the dear creature you know my norton gave an eminence to us all then her acquirements her skill in music her fine needleworks her elegance in dress for which she was so much admired that the neighbouring ladies used to say that they need not fetch fashions from london since whatever miss clarissa harlowe wore was the best fashion because her choice of natural beauties set those of art far behind them her genteel ease and fine turn of person her deep reading and these joined to her open manners and her cheerful modesty o my good norton what a sweet child was once my clary harlowe this and more you knew her to be for many of her excellencies were owing to yourself and with the milk you gave her you gave her what no other nurse in the world could give her and do you think my worthy woman do you think that the wilful lapse of such a child is to be forgiven can she herself think that she deserves not the severest punishment for the abuse of such talents as were intrusted to her her fault was a fault of premeditation of cunning of contrivance she had deceived every bodys expectations her whole sex as well as the family she sprung from is disgraced by it would any body ever have believed that such a young creature as this who had by her advice saved even her overlively friend from marrying a fop and a libertine would herself have gone off with one of the vilest and most notorious of libertines a man whose character she knew and knew it to be worse than the character of him from whom she saved her friend a man against whom she was warned one who had her brothers life in her hands and who constantly set our whole family at defiance think for me my good norton think what my unhappiness must be both as a wife and a mother what restless days what sleepless nights yet my own rankling anguish endeavoured to be smoothed over to soften the anguish of fiercer spirits and to keep them from blazing out to further mischief o this naughty naughty girl who knew so well what she did and who could look so far into consequences that we thought she would have died rather than have done as she had done her known character for prudence leaves her absolutely without excuse how then can i offer to plead for her if through motherly indulgence i would forgive her myself and have we not moreover suffered all the disgrace that can befall us has not she if now she has so little liking to his morals has she not reason before to have as little or has she suffered by them in her own person o my good woman i doubt i doubt will not the character of the man make one doubt an angel if once in his power the world will think the worst i am told it does so likewise her father fears her brother hears and what can i do our antipathy to him she knew before as well as his character these therefore cannot be new motives without a new reason o my dear mrs norton how shall i how can you support ourselves under the apprehensions to which these thoughts lead he continually pressing her you say to marry him his friends likewise she has reason no doubt she has reason for this application to us and her crime is glossed over to bring her to us with new disgrace whither whither does one guilty step lead the misguided heart and now truly to save a stubborn spirit we are only to be sounded that the application may be occasionally retracted or denied upon the whole were i inclined to plead for her it is now the most improper of all times now that my brother harlowe has discouraged as he last night came hither on purpose to tell us mr hickmans insinuated application and been applauded for it now that my brother antony is intending to carry his great fortune through her fault into another family she expecting no doubt herself to be put into her grandfathers estate in consequence of a reconciliation and as a reward for her fault and insisting still upon the same terms which she offered before and which were rejected not through my fault i am sure rejected from all these things you will return such an answer as the case requires it might cost me the peace of my whole life at this time to move for her god forgive her if i do nobody else will and let it for your own sake as well as mine be a secret that you and i have entered upon this subject and i desire you not to touch upon it again but by particular permission for o my dear good woman it sets my heart a bleeding in as many streams as there are veins in it yet think me not impenetrable by a proper contrition and remorse but what a torment is it to have a will without a power adieu adieu god give us both comfort and to the once dear the ever dear creature for can a mother forget her child repentance deep repentance and as little suffering as may befit his blessed will and her grievous fault prays your real friend charlotte harlowe letter xxix miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe sunday may how it is now my dear between you and mr lovelace i cannot tell but wicked as the man is i am afraid he must be your lord and master i called him by several very hard names in my last i had but just heard of some of his vilenesses when i sat down to write so my indignation was raised but on inquiry and recollection i find that the facts laid to his charge were all of them committed some time ago not since he has had strong hopes of your favour this is saying something for him his generous behaviour to the innkeepers daughter is a more recent instance to his credit to say nothing of the universal good character he has as a kind landlord and then i approve much of the motion he made to put you in possession of mrs fretchvilles house while he continues at the other widows till you agree that one house shall hold you i wish this were done be sure you embrace this offer if you do not soon meet at the altar and get one of his cousins with you were you once married i should think you cannot be very unhappy though you may not be so happy with him as you deserve to be the stake he has in his country and his reversions the care he takes of his affairs his freedom from obligation nay his pride with your merit must be a tolerable security for you i should think though particulars of his wickedness as they come to my knowledge hurt and incense me yet after all when i give myself time to reflect all that i have heard of him to his disadvantage was comprehended in the general character given of him long ago by lord ms and his own dismissed bailiff and which was confirmed to me by mrs fortescue as i heretofore told you and to you by mrs greme see vol i letter iv ibid letter xii see vol iii letter vi you can have nothing therefore i think to be deeply concerned about but his future good and the bad example he may hereafter set to his own family these indeed are very just concerns but were you to leave him now either with or without his consent his fortunes and alliances so considerable his person and address so engaging every one excusing you now on those accounts and because of your relations follies it would have a very ill appearance for your reputation i cannot therefore on the most deliberate consideration advise you to think of that while you have no reason to doubt his honour may eternal vengeance pursue the villain if he give room for an apprehension of this nature yet his teasing ways are intolerable his acquiescence with your slight delays and his resignedness to the distance you now keep him at for a fault so much slighter as he must think than the punishment are unaccountable he doubts your love of him that is very probable but you have reason to be surprised at his want of ardour a blessing so great within his reach as i may say by the time you have read to this place you will have no doubt of what has been the issue of the conference between the two gentlemen i am equally shocked and enraged against them all against them all i say for i have tried your good nortons weight with your mother though at first i did not intend to tell you so to the same purpose as the gentleman sounded your uncle never were there such determined brutes in the world why should i mince the matter yet would i fain methinks make an exception for your mother your uncle will have it that you are ruined he can believe every thing bad of a creature he says who could run away with a man with such a one especially as lovelace they expected applications from you when some heavy distress had fallen upon you but they are all resolved not to stir an inch in your favour no not to save your life my dearest soul resolve to assert your right claim your own and go and live upon it as you ought then if you marry not how will the wretches creep to you for your reversionary dispositions you were accused as in your aunts letter of premeditation and contrivance in your escape instead of pitying you the mediating person was called upon to pity them who once your uncle said doated upon you who took no joy but in your presence who devoured your words as you spoke them who trod over again your footsteps as you walked before them and i know not what of this sort upon the whole it is now evident to me and so it must be to you when you read this letter that you must be his and the sooner you are so the better shall we suppose that marriage is not in your power i cannot have patience to suppose that i am concerned methinks to know how you will do to condescend now you see you must be his after you have kept him at such a distance and for the revenge his pride may put him upon taking for it but let me tell you that if my going up and sharing fortunes with you will prevent such a noble creature from stooping too low much more were it likely to prevent your ruin i would not hesitate a moment about it what is the whole world to me weighed against such a friend as you are think you that any of the enjoyments of this life could be enjoyments to me were you involved in calamities from which i could either alleviate or relieve you by giving up those enjoyments and what in saying this and acting up to it do i offer you but the frits of a friendship your worth has created excuse my warmth of expression the warmth of my heart wants none i am enraged at your relations for bad as what i have mentioned is i have not told you all nor now perhaps ever will i am angry at my own mothers narrowness of mind and at her indiscriminate adherence to old notions and i am exasperated against your foolish your lowvanityd lovelace but let us stoop to take the wretch as he is and make the best of him since you are destined to stoop to keep grovellers and worldlings in countenance he had not been guilty of a direct indecency to you nor dare he not so much of a devil as that comes to neither had he such villainous intentions so much in his power as you are they would have shewn themselves before now to such a penetrating and vigilant eye and to such a pure heart as yours let us save the wretch then if we can though we soil our fingers in lifting him up his dirt there is yet to a person of your fortune and independence a good deal to do if you enter upon those terms which ought to be entered upon i dont find that he has once talked of settlements nor yet of the license a foolish wretch but as your evil destiny has thrown you out of all other protection and mediation you must be father mother uncle to yourself and enter upon the requisite points for yourself it is hard upon you but indeed you must your situation requires it what room for delicacy now or would you have me write to him yet that would be the same thing as if you were to write yourself yet write you should i think if you cannot speak but speaking is certainly best for words leave no traces they pass as breath and mingle with air and may be explained with latitude but the pen is a witness on record i know the gentleness of your spirit i know the laudable pride of your heart and the just notion you have of the dignity of our sex in these delicate points but once more all this in nothing now your honour is concerned that the dignity i speak of should not be stood upon mr lovelace would i say yet hate the foolish fellow for his low his stupid pride in wishing to triumph over the dignity of his own wife i am by your means deprived of every friend i have in the world in what light am i to look upon you i have well considered every thing you have made some people much against my liking think me a wife others know i am not married nor do i desire any body should believe i am do you think your being here in the same house with me can be to my reputation you talked to me of mrs fretchvilles house this will bring him to renew his last discourse on the subject if he does not revive it of himlsef if mrs fretchville knows not her own mind what is her house to me you talked of bringing up your cousin montague to bear me company if my brothers schemes be your pretence for not going yourself to fetch her you can write to her i insist upon bringing these two points to an issue off or on ought to be indifferent to me if so to them such a declaration must bring all forward there are twenty ways my dear that you would find out for another in your circumstances he will disdain from his native insolence to have it thought he has any body to consult well then will he not be obliged to declare himself and if he does no delays on your side i beseech you give him the day let it be a short one it would be derogating from your own merit not to be so explicit as he ought to be to seem but to doubt his meaning and to wait for that explanation for which i should ever despise him if he makes it necessary twice already have you my dear if not oftener modestyd away such opportunities as you ought not to have slipped as to settlements if they come not in naturally een leave them to his own justice and to the justice of his family and theres an end of the matter this is my advice mend it as circumstances offer and follow your own but indeed my dear this or something like it would i do and let him tell me afterwards if he dared or would that he humbled down to his shoebuckles the person it would have been his glory to exalt support yourself mean time with reflections worthy of yourself though tricked into this mans power you are not meanly subjugated to it all his reverence you command or rather as i may say inspire since it was never known that he had any reverence for aught that was good till you was with him and he professes now and then to be so awed and charmed by your example as that the force of it shall reclaim him i believe you will have a difficult task to keep him to it but the more will be your honour if you effect his reformation and it is my belief that if you can reclaim this great this specious deceiver who has morally speaking such a number of years before him you will save from ruin a multitude of innocents for those seem to me to have been the prey for which he has spread his wicked snares and who knows but for this very purpose principally a person may have been permitted to swerve whose heart or will never was in her error and who has so much remorse upon her for having as she thinks erred at all adieu my dearest friend anna howe enclosed in the above i must trouble you with my concerns though you own are so heavy upon you a piece of news i have to tell you your uncle antony is disposed to marry with whom think you with my mother true indeed your family knows it all is laid with redoubled malice at your door and there the old soul himself lays it take no notice of this intelligence not so much as in your letters to me for fear of accidents i think it cant do but were i to provoke my mother that might afford a pretence else i should have been with you before now i fancy the first likelihood that appears to me of encouragement i dismiss hickman thats certain if my mother disoblige me in so important an article i shant think of obliging her in such another it is impossible surely that the desire of popping me off to that honest man can be with such a view i repeat that it cannot come to any thing but these widows then such a love in us all both old and young of being courted and admired and so irresistible to their elderships to be flattered that all power is not over with them but that they may still class and prank it with their daughters it vexed me heartily to have her tell me of this proposal with selfcomplaisant simperings and yet she affected to speak of it as if she had no intention to encourage it these antiquated bachelors old before they believe themselves to be so imagine that when they have once persuaded themselves to think of the state they have nothing more to do than to make their minds known to the woman your uncles overgrown fortune is indeed a bait a tempting one a saucy daughter to be got rid of the memory of the father of that daughter not precious enough to weigh much but let him advance if he dare let her encourage but i hope she wont excuse me my dear i am nettled they have fearfully rumpled my gorget youll think me faulty so i wont put my name to this separate paper other hands may resemble mine you did not see me write it letter xxx miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe monday afternoon may now indeed it is evident my best my only friend that i have but one choice to make and now i do find that i have carried my resentment against this man too far since now i am to appear as if under an obligation to his patience with me for a conduct which perhaps he will think if not humoursome and childish plainly demonstrative of my little esteem of him of but a secondary esteem at least where before his pride rather than his merit had made him expect a first o my dear to be cast upon a man that is not a generous man that is indeed a cruel man a man that is capable of creating a distress to a young creature who by her evil destiny is thrown into his power and then of enjoying it as i may say i verily think i may say so of this savage what a fate is mine you give me my dear good advice as to the peremptory manner in which i ought to treat him but do you consider to whom it is that you give it and then should i take it and should he be capable of delay i unprotected desolate nobody to fly to in what a wretched light must i stand in his eyes and what is still as bad in my own o my dear see you not as i do that the occasion for this my indelicate my shocking situation should never have been given by me of all creatures since i am unequal utterly unequal to the circumstances to which my inconsideration has reduced me what i to challenge a man for a husband i to exert myself to quicken the delayer in his resolutions and having as you think lost an opportunity to begin to try to recall it as from myself and for myself to threaten him as i may say into the marriage state o my dear if this be right to be done how difficult is it where modesty and self or where pride if you please is concerned to do that right or to express myself in your words to be father mother uncle to myself especially where one thinks a triumph over one is intended you say you have tried mrs nortons weight with my mother bad as the returns are which my application by mr hickman has met with you tell me that you have not acquainted me with all the bad nor now perhaps ever will but why so my dear what is the bad what can be the bad which now you will never tell me of what worse than renounce me and for ever my uncle you say believes me ruined he declares that he can believe every thing bad of a creature who could run away with a man and they have all made a resolution not to stir an inch in my favour no not to save my life have you worse than this my dear behind surely my father has not renewed his dreadful malediction surely if so my mother has not joined in it have my uncles given their sanction and made it a family act and themselves thereby more really faulty than ever they suppose me to be though i the cause of that greater fault in them what my dear is the worst that you will leave for ever unrevealed o lovelace why comest thou not just now while these black prospects are before me for now couldst thou look into my heart wouldst thou see a distress worthy of thy barbarous triumph i was forced to quit my pen and you say you have tried mrs nortons weight with my mother what is done cannot be remedied but i wish you had not taken a step of this importance to me without first consulting me forgive me my dear but i must tell you that that highsould and noble friendship which you have ever avowed with so obliging and so uncommon a warmth although it has been always the subject of my grateful admiration has been often the ground of my apprehension because of its unbridled fervour well but now to look forward you are of opinion that i must be his and that i cannot leave him with reputation to myself whether with or without his consent i must if so make the best of the bad matter he went out in the morning intending not to return to dinner unless as he sent me word i would admit him to dine with me i excused myself the man whose anger is now to be of such high importance to me was it seems displeased as he as well as i expected that i should receive a letter from you this day by collins i suppose he will not be long before he returns and then possibly he is to be mighty stately mighty mannish mighty coy if you please and then must i be very humble very submissive and try to insinuate myself into his good graces with downcast eye if not by speech beg his forgiveness for the distance i have so perversely kept him at yes i warrant but i shall see how this behaviour will sit upon me you have always rallied me upon my meekness i think well then i will try if i can be still meeker shall i o my dear but let me sit with my hands before me all patience all resignation for i think i hear him coming up or shall i roundly accost him in the words in the form which you my dear prescribed he is come in he has sent to me all impatience as dorcas says by his aspect but i cannot cannot see him monday night the contents of your letter and my own heavy reflections rendered me incapable of seeing this expecting man the first word he asked dorcas was if i had received a letter since he had been out she told me this and her answer that i had and was fasting and had been in tears ever since he sent to desire an interview with me i answered by her that i was not very well in the morning if better i would see him as soon as he pleased very humble was it not my dear yet he was too royal to take it for humility for dorcas told me he rubbed one side of his face impatiently and said a rash word and was out of humour stalking about the room half an hour later he sent again desiring very earnestly that i should admit him to supper with me he would enter upon no subjects of conversation but what i should lead to so i should have been at liberty you see to court him i again desired to be excused indeed my dear my eyes were swelled i was very low spirited and could not think of entering all at once after the distance i had kept him at for several days into the freedom of conversation which the utter rejection i have met with from my relations as well as your advice has made necessary he sent up to tell me that as he heard i was fasting if i would promise to eat some chicken which mrs sinclair had ordered for supper he would acquiesce very kind in his anger is he not i promised that i would can i be more preparatively condescending how happy ill warrant if i may meet him in a kind and forgiving humour i hate myself but i wont be insulted indeed i wont for all this letter xxxi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe tuesday may i think once more we seem to be in a kind of train but through a storm i will give you the particulars i heard him in the diningroom at five in the morning i had rested very ill and was up too but opened not my door till six when dorcas brought me his request for my company he approached me and taking my hand as i entered the diningroom i went not to bed madam till two said he yet slept not a wink for gods sake torment me not as you have done for a week past he paused i was silent at first proceeded he i thought your resentment of a curiosity in which i had been disappointed could not be deep and that it would go off of itself but when i found it was to be kept up till you knew the success of some new overtures which you had made and which complied with might have deprived me of you for ever how madam could i support myself under the thoughts of having with such an union of interests made so little impression upon your mind in my favour he paused again i was still silent he went on i acknowledge that i have a proud heart madam i cannot but hope for some instances of previous and preferable favour from the lady i am ambitious to call mine and that her choice of me should not appear not flagrantly appear directed by the perverseness of her selfish persecutors who are my irreconcilable enemies more to the same purpose he said you know my dear the room he had given me to recriminate upon him in twenty instances i did not spare him every one of these instances said i after i had enumerated them convinces me of your pride indeed sir but not of your merit i confess that i have as much pride as you can have although i hope it is of another kind than that you so readily avow but if sir you have the least mixture in yours of that pride which may be expected and thought laudable in a man of your birth alliances and fortune you should rather wish i will presume to say to promote what you call my pride than either to suppress it or to regret that i have it it is this my acknowledged pride proceeded i that induces me to tell you sir that i think it beneath me to disown what have been my motives for declining for some days past any conversation with you or visit from mr mennell that might lead to points out of my power to determine upon until i heard from my uncle harlowe whom i confess i have caused to be sounded whether i might be favoured with his interest to obtain for me a reconciliation with my friends upon terms which i had caused to be proposed i know not said he and suppose must not presume to ask what those terms were but i can but too well guess at them and that i was to have been the preliminary sacrifice but you must allow me madam to say that as much as i admire the nobleness of your sentiments in general and in particular that laudable pride which you have spoken of i wish that i could compliment you with such an uniformity in it as had set you as much above all submission to minds implacable and unreasonable i hope i may without offence say that your brothers and sisters are such as it has above all favour and condescension to me duty and nature sir call upon me to make the submissions you speak of there is a father there is a mother there are uncles in the one case to justify and demand those submissions what pray sir can be pleaded for the condescension as you call it will you say your merits either with regard to them or to myself may this madam to be said after the persecutions of those relations after what you have suffered after what you have made me hope let me my dearest creature ask you we have been talking of pride what sort of pride must his be which can dispense with inclination and preference in the lady whom he adores what must that love love sir who talks of love was not merit the thing we were talking of have i ever professed have i ever required of you professions of a passion of that nature but there is no end of these debatings each so faultless each so full of self i do not think myself faultless madam but but what sir would you ever more argue with me as if you were a child seeking palliations and making promises promises of what sir of being in future the man it is a shame a gentleman is not of being the man good god interrupted he with eyes lifted up if thou wert to be thus severe well well sir impatiently i need only to observe that all this vast difference in sentiment shows how unpaired our minds are so let us let us what madam my soul is rising into tumults and he looked so wildly that i was a good deal terrified let us what madam i was however resolved not to desert myself why sir let us resolve to quit every regard for each other nay flame not out i am a poor weakminded creature in some things but where what i should be or not deserve to live if i am not is in the question i have a great and invincible spirit or my own conceit betrays me let us resolve to quit every regard for each other that is more than civil this you may depend upon i will never marry any other man i have seen enough of your sex at least of you a single life shall ever be my choice while i will leave you at liberty to pursue your own indifference worse than indifference said he in a passion interrupting him indifference let it be you have not in my opinion at least deserved that it should be other if you have in your own you have cause at least your pride has to hate me for misjudging you dearest dearest creature snatching my hand with fierceness let me beseech you to be uniformly noble civil regards madam civil regards can you so expect to narrow and confine such a passion as mine such a passion as yours mr lovelace deserves to be narrowed and confined it is either the passion you do not think it or i do not i question whether your mind is capable of being so narrowed and so widened as is necessary to make it be what i wish it to be lift up your hands and your eyes sir in silent wonder if you please but what does that wonder express what does it convince me of but that we are not born for one another by my soul said he and grasped my hand with an eagerness that hurt it we were born for one another you must be mine you shall be mine and put his other hand round me although my damnation were to be the purchase i was still more terrified let me leave you mr lovelace said i or do you be gone from me is the passion you boast of to be thus shockingly demonstrated you must not go madam you must not leave me in anger i will return i will return when you can be less violent less shocking and he let me go the man quite frighted me insomuch that when i got into my chamber i found a sudden flow of tears a great relief to me in half an hour he sent a little billet expressing his concern for the vehemence of his behaviour and prayed to see me i went because i could not help myself i went he was full of excuses o my dear what would you even you do with such a man as this and in my situation it was very possible for him now he said to account for the workings of a beginning phrensy for his part he was near distraction all last week to suffer as he had suffered and now to talk of civil regards only when he had hoped from the nobleness of my mind hope what you will interrupted i i must insist upon it that our minds are by no means suited to each other you have brought me into difficulties i am deserted by every friend but miss howe my true sentiments i will not conceal it is against my will that i must submit to owe protection from a brothers projects which miss howe thinks are not given over to you who have brought me into these straights not with my own concurrence brought me into them remember that i do remember that madam so often reminded how can i forget it yet i will owe to you this protection if it be necessary in the earnest hope that you will shun rather than seek mischief if any further inquiry after me be made but what hinders you from leaving me cannot i send to you the widow fretchville it is plain knows not her own mind the people here are more civil to me every day than other but i had rather have lodgings more agreeable to my circumstances i best know what will suit them and am resolved not to be obliged to any body if you leave me i will privately retire to some one of the neighbouring villages and there wait my cousin mordens arrival with patience i presume madam replied he from what you have said that your application to harloweplace has proved unsuccessful i therefore hope that you will now give me leave to mention the terms in the nature of settlements which i have long intended to propose to you and which having till now delayed to do through accidents not proceeding from myself i had thoughts of urging to you the moment you entered upon your new house and upon your finding yourself as independent in appearance as you are in fact permit me madam to propose these matters to you not with an expectation of your immediate answer but for your consideration were not hesitation a selffelt glow a downcast eye encouragement more than enough and yet you will observe as i now do on recollection that he was in no great hurry to solicit for a day since he had no thoughts of proposing settlements till i had got into my new house and now in his great complaisance to me he desired leave to propose his terms not with an expectation of my immediate answer but for my consideration only yet my dear your advice was too much in my head at this time i hesitated he urged on upon my silence he would call god to witness to the justice nay to the generosity of his intentions to me if i would be so good as to hear what he had to propose to me as to settlements could not the man have fallen into the subject without this parade many a point you know is refused and ought to be refused if leave be asked to introduce it and when once refused the refusal must in honour be adhered to whereas had it been slid in upon one as i may say it might have merited further consideration if such a man as mr lovelace knows not this who should but he seemed to think it enough that he had asked my leave to propose his settlements he took no advantage of my silence as i presume men as modest as mr lovelace would have done in a like case yet gazing in my face very confidently and seeming to expect my answer i thought myself obliged to give the subject a more diffuse turn in order to save myself the mortification of appearing too ready in my compliance after such a distance as had been between us and yet in pursuance of your advice i was willing to avoid the necessity of giving him such a repulse as might again throw us out of the course a cruel alternative to be reduced to you talk of generosity mr lovelace said i and you talk of justice perhaps without having considered the force of the words in the sense you use them on this occasion let me tell you what generosity is in my sense of the word true generosity is not confined to pecuniary instances it is more than politeness it is more than good faith it is more than honour it is more than justice since all of these are but duties and what a worthy mind cannot dispense with but true generosity is greatness of soul it incites us to do more by a fellowcreature than can be strictly required of us it obliges us to hasten to the relief of an object that wants relief anticipating even such a ones hope or expectation generosity sir will not surely permit a worthy mind to doubt of its honourable and beneficent intentions much less will it allow itself to shock to offend any one and least of all a person thrown by adversity mishap or accident into its protection what an opportunity had he to clear his intentions had he been so disposed from the latter part of this home observation but he ran away with the first and kept to that admirably defined he said but who at this rate madam can be said to be generous to you your generosity i implore while justice as it must be my sole merit shall be my aim never was there a woman of such nice and delicate sentiments it is a reflection upon yourself sir and upon the company you have kept if you think these notions either nice or delicate thousands of my sex are more nice than i for they would have avoided the devious path i have been surprised into the consequences of which surprise have laid me under the sad necessity of telling a man who has not delicacy enough to enter into those parts of the female character which are its glory and distinction what true generosity is his divine monitress he called me he would endeavour to form his manners as he had often promised by my example but he hoped i would now permit him to mention briefly the justice he proposed to do me in the terms of the settlements a subject so proper before now to have entered upon and which would have been entered upon long ago had not my frequent displeasure i am ever in fault my dear taken from him the opportunity he had often wished for but now having ventured to lay hold of this nothing should divert him from improving it i have no spirits just now sir to attend such weighty points what you have a mind to propose write to me and i shall know what answer to return only one thing let me remind you of that if you touch upon a subject in which my father has a concern i shall judge by your treatment of the father what value you have for the daughter he looked as if he would choose rather to speak than write but had he said so i had a severe return to have made upon him as possibly he might see by my looks in this way are we now a sort of calm as i said succeeding a storm what may happen next whether a storm or a calm with such a spirit as i have to deal with who can tell but be that as it will i think my dear i am not meanly off and that is a great point with me and which i know you will be glad to hear if it were only that i can see this man without losing any of that dignity what other word can i use speaking of myself that betokens decency and not arrogance which is so necessary to enable me to look up or rather with the minds eye i may say to look down upon a man of this mans cast although circumstance have so offered that i could not take your advice as to the manner of dealing with him yet you gave me so much courage by it as has enabled me to conduct things to this issue as well as determined me against leaving him which before i was thinking to do at all adventures whether when it came to the point i should have done so or not i cannot say because it would have depended upon his behaviour at the time but let his behaviour be what it will i am afraid with you that should any thing offer at last to oblige me to leave him i shall not mend my situation in the worlds eye but the contrary and yet i will not be treated by him with indignity while i have any power to help myself you my dear have accused me of having modestyd away as you phrase it several opportunities of being being what my dear why the wife of a libertine and what a libertine and his wife are my cousin mordens letter tells us let me here once for all endeavour to account for the motives of behavior to this man and for the principles i have proceeded upon as they appear to me upon a close selfexamination be pleased to allow me to think that my motives on this occasion rise not altogether from maidenly niceness nor yet from the apprehension of what my present tormenter and future husband may think of a precipitate compliance on such a disagreeable behaviour as his but they arise principally from what offers to my own heart respecting as i may say its own rectitude its own judgment of the fit and the unfit as i would without study answer for myself to myself in the first place to him and to the world in the second only principles that are in my mind that i found there implanted no doubt by the first gracious planter which therefore impel me as i may say to act up to them that thereby i may to the best of my judgment be enabled to comport myself worthily in both states the single and the married let others act as they will by me i hope my dear i do not deceive myself and instead of setting about rectifying what is amiss in my heart endeavour to find excuses for habits and peculiarities which i am unwilling to cast off or overcome the heart is very deceitful do you my dear friend lay mine open but surely it is always open before you and spare me not if you think it culpable this observation once for all as i said i thought proper to make to convince you that to the best of my judgment my errors in matters as well of lesser moment as of greater shall rather be the fault of my judgment than of my will i am my dearest friend your ever obliged clarissa harlowe letter xxxii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe tuesday night may mr lovelace has sent me by dorcas his proposals as follow to spare a delicacy so extreme and to obey you i write and the rather that you may communicate this paper to miss howe who may consult any of her friends you shall think proper to have intrusted on this occasion i say intrusted because as you know i have given it out to several persons that we are actually married in the first place madam i offer to settle upon you by way of jointure your whole estate and moreover to vest in trustees such a part of mine in lancashire as shall produce a clear four hundred pounds a year to be paid to your sole and separate use quarterly my own estate is a clear not nominnal l per annum lord m proposes to give me possession either of that which he has in lancashire to which by the way i think i have a better title than he has himself or that we call the lawn in hertfordshire upon my nuptials with a lady whom he so greatly admires and to make that i shall choose a clear l per annum my too great contempt of censure has subjected me to much slander it may not therefore be improper to assure you on the word of a gentleman that no part of my estate was ever mortgaged and that although i lived very expensively abroad and made large draughts yet that midsummerday next will discharge all that i owe in the world my notions are not all bad ones i have been thought in pecuniary cases generous it would have deserved another name had i not first been just if as your own estate is at present in your fathers hands you rather choose that i should make a jointure out of mine tantamount to yours be it what it will it shall be done i will engage lord m to write to you what he proposes to do on the happy occasion not as your desire or expectation but to demonstrate that no advantage is intended to be taken of the situation you are in with your own family to shew the beloved daughter the consideration i have for her i will consent that she shall prescribe the terms of agreement in relation to the large sums which must be in her fathers hands arising from her grandfathers estate i have no doubt but he will be put upon making large demands upon you all those it shall be in your power to comply with for the sake of your own peace and the remainder shall be paid into your hands and be entirely at your disposal as a fund to support those charitable donations which i have heard you so famed for our of your family and for which you have been so greatly reflected upon in it as to clothes jewels and the like against the time you shall choose to make your appearance it will be my pride that you shall not be beholden for such of these as shall be answerable to the rank of both to those who have had the stupid folly to renounce a daughter they deserved not you must excuse me madam you would mistrust my sincerity in the rest could i speak of these people without asperity though so nearly related to you these madam are my proposals they are such as i always designed to make whenever you would permit me to enter into the delightful subject but you have been so determined to try every method for reconciling yourself to your relations even by giving me absolutely up for ever that you seemed to think it but justice to keep me at a distance till the event of that your predominant hope could be seen it is now seen and although i have been and perhaps still am ready to regret the want of that preference i wished for from you as miss clarissa harlowe yet i am sure as the husband of mrs lovelace i shall be more ready to adore than to blame you for the pangs you have given to a heart the generosity or rather the justice of which my implacable enemies have taught you to doubt and this still the readier as i am persuaded that those pangs never would have been given by a mind so noble had not the doubt been entertained perhaps with too great an appearance of reason and as i hope i shall have it to reflect that the moment the doubt shall be overcome the indifference will cease i will only add that if i have omitted any thing that would have given you farther satisfaction or if the above terms be short of what you would wish you will be pleased to supply them as you think fit and when i know your pleasure i will instantly order articles to be drawn up comformably that nothing in my power may be wanting to make you happy you will now dearest madam judge how far all the rest depends upon yourself you see my dear what he offers you see it is all my fault that he has not made these offers before i am a strange creature to be to blame in every thing and to every body yet neither intend the ill at the time nor know it to be the ill too late or so nearly too late that i must give up all the delicacy he talks of to compound for my fault i shall now judge how far the rest depends upon myself so coldly concludes he such warm and in the main unobjectionably proposals would you not as you read have supposed that the paper would conclude with the most earnest demand of a day i own i had that expectation so strong resulting naturally as i may say from the premises that without studying for dissatisfaction i could not help being dissatisfied when i came to the conclusion but you say there is no help i must perhaps make further sacrifices all delicacy it seems is to be at an end with me but if so this man knows not what every wise man knows that prudence and virtue and delicacy of mind in a wife do the husband more real honour in the eye of the world than the same qualities were she destitute of them in himself do him as the want of them in her does him more dishonour for are not the wifes errors the husbands reproach how justly his reproach is another thing i will consider this paper and write to it if i am able for it seems now all the rest depends upon myself letter xxxiii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe wednesday morning may mr lovelace would fain have engaged me last night but as i was not prepared to enter upon the subject of his proposals intending to consider them maturely and was not highly pleased with his conclusion i desired to be excused seeing him till morning and the rather as there is hardly any getting from him in tolerable time overnight accordingly about seven oclock we met in the diningroom i find he was full of expectation that i should meet him with a very favourable who knows but with a thankful aspect and i immediately found by his sullen countenance that he was under no small disappointment that i did not my dearest love are you well why look you so solemn upon me will your indifference never be over if i have proposed terms in any respect short of your expectation i told him that he had very considerately mentioned my shewing his proposals to miss howe and as i should have a speedy opportunity to send them to her by collins i desired to suspend any talk upon that subject till i had her opinion upon them good god if there was but the least loophole the least room for delay but he was writing a letter to lord m to give him an account of his situation with me and could not finish it so satisfactorily either to my lord or to himself as if i would condescend to say whether the terms he had proposed were acceptable or not thus far i told him i could say that my principal point was peace and reconciliation with my relations as to other matters the gentleness of his own spirit would put him upon doing more for me than i should ask or expect wherefore if all he had to write about was to know what lord m would do on my account he might spare himself the trouble for that my utmost wishes as to myself were much more easily gratified than he perhaps imagined he asked me then if i would so far permit him to touch upon the happy day as to request the presence of lord m on the occasion and to be my father father had a sweet and venerable sound with it i said i should be glad to have a father who would own me was not this plain speaking think you my dear yet it rather i must own appears so to me on reflection than was designed freely at the time for i then with a sigh from the bottom of my heart thought of my own father bitterly regretting that i am an outcast from him and from my mother mr lovelace i thought seemed a little affected at the manner of my speaking and perhaps at the sad reflection i am but a very young creature mr lovelace said i and wiped my eyes as i turned away my face although you have kindly and in love to me introduced so much sorry to me already so you must not wonder that the word father strikes so sensibly upon the heart of a child ever dutiful till she knew you and whose tender years still require the paternal wing he turned towards the window rejoice with me my dear since i seem to be devoted to him that the man is not absolutely impenetrable his emotion was visible yet he endeavoured to suppress it approaching me again again he was obliged to turn from me angelic something he said but then obtaining a heart more suitable to his wish he once more approached me for his own part he said as lord m was so subject to gout he was afraid that the compliment he had just proposed to make him might if made occasion a larger suspension than he could bear to think of and if it did it would vex him to the heart that he had made it i could not say a single word to this you know my dear but you will guess at my thoughts of what he said so much passionate love lipdeep so prudent and so dutifully patient at heart to a relation he had till now so undutifully despised why why am i thrown upon such a man thought i he hesitated as if contending with himself and after taking a turn or two about the room he was at a great loss what to determine upon he said because he had not the honour of knowing when he was to be made the happiest of men would to god it might that very instant be resolved upon he stopped a moment or two staring in his usual confident way in my downcast face did i not o my beloved friend think you want a father or a mother just then but if he could not so soon as he wished procure my consent to a day in that case he thought the compliment might as well be made to lord m as not see my dear since the settlements might be drawn and engrossed in the intervenient time which would pacify his impatience as no time would be lost you will suppose how i was affected by this speech by repeating the substance of what he said upon it as follows but by his soul he knew not so much was i upon the reserve and so much latent meaning did my eye import whether when he most hoped to please me he was not farthest from doing so would i vouchsafe to say whether i approved of his compliment to lord m or not to leave it to me to choose whether the speedy day he ought to have urged for with earnestness should be accelerated or suspended miss howe thought i at that moment says i must not run away from this man to be sure mr lovelace if this matter be ever to be it must be agreeable to me to have the full approbation of one side since i cannot have that of the other if this matter be ever to be good god what words are these at this time of day and full approbation of one side why that word approbation when the greatest pride of all my family is that of having the honour of so dear a creature for their relation would to heaven my dearest life added he that without complimenting any body tomorrow might be the happiest day of my life what say you my angel with a trembling impatience that seemed not affected what say you for tomorrow it was likely my dear i could say much to it or name another day had i been disposed to the latter with such an hinted delay from him i was silent next day madam if not tomorrow had he given me time to answer it could not have been in the affirmative you must think but in the same breath he went on or the day after that and taking both my hands in his he stared me into a halfconfusion would you have had patience with him my dear no no said i as calmly as possible you cannot think that i should imagine there can be reason for such a hurry it will be most agreeable to be sure for my lord to be present i am all obedience and resignation returned the wretch with a self pluming air as if he had acquiesced to a proposal made by me and had complimented me with a great piece of self denial is it not plain my dear that he designs to vex and tease me proud yet mean and foolish man if so but you say all punctilio is at an end with me why why will he take pains to make a heart wrap itself up in reserve that wishes only and that for his sake as well as my own to observe due decorum modesty i think required of me that it should pass as he had put it did it not i think it did would to heaven but what signifies wishing but when he would have rewarded himself as he had heretofore called it for this selfsupposed concession with a kiss i repulsed him with a just and very sincere disdain he seemed both vexed and surprised as one who had made the most agreeable proposals and concessions and thought them ungratefully returned he plainly said that he thought our situation would entitle him to such an innocent freedom and he was both amazed and grieved to be thus scornfully repulsed no reply could be made be me on such a subject i abruptly broke from him i recollect as i passed by one of the pier glasses that i saw in it his clenched hand offered in wrath to his forehead the words indifference by his soul next to hatred i heard him speak and something of ice he mentioned i heard not what whether he intends to write to my lord or miss montague i cannot tell but as all delicacy ought to be over with me now perhaps i am to blame to expect it from a man who may not know what it is if he does not and yet thinks himself very polite and intends not to be otherwise i am rather to be pitied than he to be censured and after all since i must take him as i find him i must that is to say as a man so vain and so accustomed to be admired that not being conscious of internal defect he has taken no pains to polish more than his outside and as his proposals are higher than my expectations and as in his own opinion he has a great deal to bear from me i will no new offence preventing sit down to answer them and if possible in terms as unobjectionable to him as his are to me but after all see you not my dear more and more the mismatch that there is in our minds however i am willing to compound for my fault by giving up if that may be all my punishment the expectation of what is deemed happiness in this life with such a husband as i fear he will make in short i will content myself to be a suffering person through the state to the end of my life a long one it cannot be this may qualify him as it may prove from stings of conscience from misbehaviour to a first wife to be a more tolerable one to a second though not perhaps a better deserving one while my story to all who shall know it will afford these instructions that the eye is a traitor and ought ever to be mistrusted that form is deceitful in other words that a fine person is seldom paired by a fine mind and that sound principle and a good heart are the only bases on which the hopes of a happy future either with respect to this world or the other can be built and so much at present for mr lovelaces proposals of which i desire your opinion we cannot forbear observing in this place that the lady has been particularly censured even by some of her own sex as overnice in her part of the above conversations but surely this must be owing to want of attention to the circumstances she was in and to her character as well as to the character of the man she had to deal with for although she could not be supposed to know so much of his designs as the reader does by means of his letters to belford yet she was but too well convinced of his faulty morals and of the necessity there was from the whole of his behaviour to her to keep such an encroacher as she frequently calls him at a distance in letter xxxiii of vol iii the reader will see that upon some favourable appearances she blames herself for her readiness to suspect him but his character his principles said she are so faulty he is so light so vain so variousthen my dear i have no guardian to depend upon in letter ix of vol iii must i not with such a man says she be wanting to myself were i not jealous and vigilant by this time the reader will see that she had still greater reason for her jealousy and vigilance and lovelace will tell the sex as he does in letter xi of vol v that the woman who resents not initiatory freedoms must be lost love is an encroacher says he loves never goes backward nothing but the highest act of love can satisfy an indulged love but the reader perhaps is too apt to form a judgment of clarissas conduct in critical cases by lovelaces complaints of her coldness not considering his views upon her and that she is proposed as an example and therefore in her trials and distresses must not be allowed to dispense with those rules which perhaps some others of the sex in her delicate situation would not have thought themselves so strictly bound to observe although if she had not observed them a lovelace would have carried all his points four letters are written by mr lovelace from the date of his last giving the state of affairs between him and the lady pretty much the same as in hers in the same period allowing for the humour in his and for his resentments expressed with vehemence on her resolution to leave him if her friends could be brought to be reconciled to her a few extracts from them will be only given what says he might have become of me and of my projects had not her father and the rest of the implacables stood my friends after violent threatenings of revenge he says tis plain she would have given me up for ever nor should i have been able to prevent her abandoning of me unless i had torn up the tree by the roots to come at the fruit which i hope still to bring down by a gentle shake or two if i can but have patience to stay the ripening seasoning thus triumphing in his unpolite cruelty he says after her haughty treatment of me i am resolved she shall speak out there are a thousand beauties to be discovered in the face in the accent in the bushbeating hesitations of a woman who is earnest about a subject she wants to introduce yet knows not how silly fellows calling themselves generous ones would value themselves for sparing a ladys confusion but they are silly fellows indeed and rob themselves of prodigious pleasure by their forwardness and at the same time deprive her of displaying a world of charms which can only be manifested on these occasions ill tell thee beforehand how it will be with my charmer in this case she will be about it and about it several times but i will not understand her at least after half a dozen hem ings she will be obliged to speak out i think mr lovelace i think sir i think you were saying some days ago still i will be all silence her eyes fixed upon my shoebuckles as i sit overagainst her ladies when put to it thus always admire a mans shoebuckles or perhaps some particular beauties in the carpet i think you said that mrs fretchville then a crystal tear trickles down each crimson cheek vexed to have her virgin pride so little assisted but come my meaning dear cry i to myself remember what i have suffered for thee and what i have suffered by thee thy tearful pausings shall not be helped out by me speak out love o the sweet confusion can i rob myself of so many conflicting beauties by the precipitate charmerpitying folly by which a politer man thou knowest lovely that i am no polite man betrayed by his own tenderness and unused to female tears would have been overcome i will feign an irresolution of mind on the occasion that she may not quite abhor me that her reflections on the scene in my absence may bring to her remembrance some beauties in my part of it an irresolution that will be owing to awe to reverence to profound veneration and that will have more eloquence in it than words can have speak out then love and spare not hardheartedness as it is called is an essential of the libertines character familiarized to the distresses he occasions he is seldom betrayed by tenderness into a complaisant weakness unworthy of himself mentioning the settlements he says i am in earnest as to the terms if i marry her and i have no doubt that i shall after my pride my ambition my revenge if thou wilt is gratified i will do her noble justice the more i do for such a prudent such an excellent economist the more shall i do for myself but by my soul belford her haughtiness shall be brought down to own both love and obligation to me nor will this sketch of settlements bring us forwarder than i would have it modesty of sex will stand my friend at any time at the very altar our hands joined i will engage to make this proud beauty leave the parson and me and all my friends who should be present though twenty in number to look like fools upon one another while she took wing and flew out of the church door or window if that were open and the door shut and this only by a single word he mentions his rash expression that she should be his although his damnation was to be the purchase at that instant says he i was upon the point of making a violent attempt but was checked in the very moment and but just in time to save myself by the awe i was struck with on again casting my eye upon her terrified but lovely face and seeing as i thought her spotless heart in every line of it o virtue virtue proceeds he what is there in thee that can thus against his will affect the heart of a lovelace whence these involuntary tremors and fear of giving mortal offence what art thou that acting in the breast of a feeble woman which never before no not in my first attempt young as i then was and frightened at my own boldness till i found myself forgiven had such an effect upon me he paints in lively colours that part of the scene between him and the lady where she says the word father has a sweet and venerable sound with it i was exceedingly affected says he upon the occasion but was ashamed to be surprised into such a fit of unmanly weakness so ashamed that i was resolved to subdue it at the instant and to guard against the like for the future yet at that moment i more than half regretted that i could not permit her to enjoy a triumph which she so well deserved to glory in her youth her beauty her artless innocence and her manner equally beyond comparison or description but her indifference belford that she could resolve to sacrifice me to the malice of my enemies and carry on the design in so clandestine a manner and yet love her as i do to phrensy revere her as i do to adoration these were the recollections with which i fortified my recreant heart against her yet after all if she persevere she must conquer coward as she has made me that never was a coward before he concludes his fourth letter in a vehement rage upon her repulsing him when he offered to salute her having supposed as he owns that she would have been all condescension on his proposals to her this says he i will for ever remember against her in order to steel my heart that i may cut through a rock of ice to hers and repay her for the disdain the scorn which glowed in her countenance and was apparent in her air at her abrupt departure for me after such obliging behaviour on my side and after i had so earnestly pressed her for an early day the women below say she hates me she despises me and tis true she does she must and why cannot i take their advice i will not long my fairone be despised by thee and laughed at by them let me acquaint thee jack adds he by way of postscript that this effort of hers to leave me if she could have been received her sending for a coach on sunday no doubt resolving not to return if she had gone out without me for did she not declare that she had thoughts to retire to some of the villages about town where she could be safe and private have all together so much alarmed me that i have been adding to the written instructions for my fellow and the people below how to act in case she should elope in my absence particularly letting will know what he shall report to strangers in case she shall throw herself upon any such with a resolution to abandon me to these instructions i shall further add as circumstances offer letter xxxiv miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe thursday may i have neither time nor patience my dear friend to answer every material article in your last letters just now received mr lovelaces proposals are all i like of him and yet as you do i think that he concludes them not with the warmth and earnestness which we might naturally have expected from him never in my life did i hear or read of so patient a man with such a blessing in his reach but wretches of his cast between you and me my dear have not i fancy the ardors that honest men have who knows as your bell once spitefully said but he may have half a dozen creatures to quit his hands of before he engages for life yet i believe you must not expect him to be honest on this side of his grand climacteric he to suggest delay from a compliment to be made to lord m and to give time for settlements he a part of whose character it is not to know what complaisance to his relations is i have no patience with him you did indeed want an interposing friend on the affecting occasion which you mention in yours of yesterday morning but upon my word were i to have been that moment in your situation and been so treated i would have torn his eyes out and left it to his own heart when i had done to furnish the reason for it would to heaven tomorrow without complimenting any body might be his happy day villain after he had himself suggested the compliment and i think he accuses you of delaying fellow that he is how my heart is wrung but as matters now stand betwixt you i am very unseasonable in expressing my resentments against him yet i dont know whether i am or not neither since it is the most cruel of fates for a woman to be forced to have a man whom her heart despises you must at least despise him at times however his clenched fist offered to his forehead on your leaving him in just displeasure i wish it had been a poleaxe and in the hand of his worst enemy i will endeavour to think of some method of some scheme to get you from him and to fix you safely somewhere till your cousin morden arrives a scheme to lie by you and to be pursued as occasion may be given you are sure that you can go abroad when you please and that our correspondence is safe i cannot however for the reasons heretofore mentioned respecting your own reputation wish you to leave him while he gives you not cause to suspect his honour but your heart i know would be the easier if you were sure of some asylum in case of necessity yet once more i say i can have no notion that he can or dare mean your dishonour but then the man is a fool my dear thats all however since you are thrown upon a fool marry the fool at the first opportunity and though i doubt that this man will be the most ungovernable of fools as all witty and vain fools are take him as a punishment since you cannot as a reward in short as one given to convince you that there is nothing but imperfection in this life and what is the result of all i have written but this either marry my dear or get from them all and from him too you intend the latter youll say as soon as you have opportunity that as above hinted i hope quickly to furnish you with and then comes on a trial between you and yourself these are the very fellows that we women do not naturally hate we dont always know what is and what is not in our power to do when some principal point we have long had in view becomes so critical that we must of necessity choose or refuse then perhaps we look about us are affrighted at the wild and uncertain prospect before us and after a few struggles and heartaches reject the untried new draw in your horns and resolve to snailon as we did before in a track we are acquainted with i shall be impatient till i have your next i am my dearest friend your ever affectionate and faithful anna howe letter xxxv mr belford to robert lovelace esq wednesday may i cannot conceal from you any thing that relates to yourself so much as the enclosed does you will see what the noble writer apprehends from you and wishes of you with regard to miss harlowe and how much at heart all your relations have it that you do honourably by her they compliment me with an influence over you which i wish with all my soul you would let me have in this article let me once more entreat thee lovelace to reflect before it be too late before the mortal offence be given upon the graces and merits of this lady let thy frequent remorses at last end in one effectual remorse let not pride and wantonness of heart ruin the fairer prospects by my faith lovelace there is nothing but vanity conceit and nonsense in our wild schemes as we grow older we shall be wiser and looking back upon our foolish notions of the present hour our youth dissipated shall certainly despise ourselves when we think of the honourable engagements we might have made thou more especially if thou lettest such a matchless creature slide through thy fingers a creature pure from her cradle in all her actions and sentiments uniformly noble strict in the performance of all her even unrewarded duties to the most unreasonable of fathers what a wife will she make the man who shall have the honour to call her his what apprehensions wouldst thou have had reason for had she been prevailed upon by giddy or frail motives for which one man by importunity might prevail as well as another we all know what an inventive genius thou art master of we are all sensible that thou hast a head to contrive and a heart to execute have i not called thine the plottingst heart in the universe i called it so upon knowledge what wouldst thou more why should it be the most villainous as well as the most able marry the lady and when married let her know what a number of contrivances thou hadst in readiness to play off beg of her not to hate thee for the communication and assure her that thou gavest them up for remorse and in justice to her extraordinary merit and let her have the opportunity of congratulating herself for subduing a heart so capable of what thou callest glorious mischief this will give her room for triumph and even thee no less she for hers over thee thou for thine over thyself reflect likewise upon her sufferings for thee actually at the time thou art forming schemes to ruin her at least in her sense of the word is she not labouring under a fathers curse laid upon her by thy means and for thy sake and wouldst thou give operation and completion to that curse which otherwise cannot have effect and what lovelace all the time is thy pride thou that vainly imaginest that the whole family of the harlowes and that of the howes too are but thy machines unknown to themselves to bring about thy purposes and thy revenge what art thou more or better than the instrument even of her implacable brother and envious sister to perpetuate the disgrace of the most excellent of sisters to which they are moved by vilely low and sordid motives canst thou bear lovelace to be thought the machine of thy inveterate enemy james harlowe nay art thou not the cully of that still viler joseph leman who serves himself as much by thy money as he does thee by the double part he acts by thy direction and further still art thou not the devils agent who only can and who certainly will suitably reward thee if thou proceedest and if thou effectest thy wicked purpose could any man but thee put together upon paper the following questions with so much unconcern as thou seemest to have written them give them a reperusal o heart of adamant whither can she fly to avoid me her parents will not receive her her uncles will not entertain her her beloved norton is in their direction and cannot miss howe dare not she has not one friend in town but me is entirely a stranger to the town what must that heart be that can triumph in a distress so deep into which she has been plunged by thy elaborate arts and contrivances and what a sweet yet sad reflection was that which had like to have had its due effect upon thee arising from thy naming lord m for her nuptial father her tender years inclining her to wish for a father and to hope a friend o my dear lovelace canst thou resolve to be instead of the father thou hast robbed her of a devil see letter xxi of this volume thou knowest that i have no interest that i can have no view in wishing thee to do justice to this admirable creature for thy own sake once more i conjure thee for thy familys sake and for the sake of our common humanity let me beseech thee to be just to miss clarissa harlowe no matter whether these expostulations are in character from me or not i have been and am bad enough if thou takest my advice which is as the enclosed will shew thee the advice of all thy family thou wilt perhaps have it to reproach me and but perhaps neither that thou art not a worse man than myself but if thou dost not and if thou ruinest such a virtue all the complicated wickedness of ten devils let loose among the innocent with full power over them will not do so much vile and base mischief as thou wilt be guilty of it is said that the prince on his throne is not safe if a mind so desperate can be found as values not its own life so may it be said that the most immaculate virtue is not safe if a man can be met with who has no regard to his own honour and makes a jest of the most solemn vows and protestations thou mayest by trick chicane and false colours thou who art worse than a pickeroon in love overcome a poor lady so entangled as thou hast entangled her so unprotected as thou hast made her but consider how much more generous and just to her and noble to thyself it is to overcome thyself once more it is no matter whether my past or future actions countenance my preachment as perhaps thoult call what i have written but this i promise thee that whenever i meet with a woman of but one half of miss harlowes perfections who will favour me with her acceptance i will take the advice i give and marry nor will i offer to try her honour at the hazard of my own in other words i will not degrade an excellent creature in her own eyes by trials when i have no cause for suspicion and let me add with respect to thy eagleships manifestation of which thou boastest in thy attempts upon the innocent and uncorrupted rather than upon those whom thou humourously comparest to wrens wagtails and phyltits as thou callest them that i hope i have it not once to reproach myself that i ruined the morals of any one creature who otherwise would have been uncorrupted guilt enough in contributing to the continued guilt of other poor wretches if i am one of those who take care she shall never rise again when she has once fallen see letter xvii of this volume whatever the capital devil under whose banner thou hast listed will let thee do with regard to this incomparable woman i hope thou wilt act with honour in relation to the enclosed between lord m and me since his lordship as thou wilt see desires that thou mayest not know he wrote on the subject for reasons i think very far from being creditable to thyself and that thou wilt take as meant the honest zeal for thy service of thy real friend j belford letter xxxvi lord m to john belford esq enclosed in the preceding m hall monday may sir if any man in the world has power over my nephew it is you i therefore write this to beg you to interfere in the affair depending between him and the most accomplished of women as every one says and what every one says must be true i dont know that he has any bad designs upon her but i know his temper too well not to be apprehensive upon such long delays and the ladies here have been for some time in fear for her lady sarah in particular who as you must know is a wise woman says that these delays in the present case must be from him rather than from the lady he had always indeed a strong antipathy to marriage and may think of playing his dogs tricks by her as he has by so many others if theres any danger of this tis best to prevent it in time for when a thing is done advice comes too late he has always had the folly and impertinence to make a jest of me for using proverbs but as they are the wisdom of whole nations and ages collected into a small compass i am not to be shamed out of sentences that often contain more wisdom in them than the tedious harangues of most of our parsons and moralists let him laugh at them if he pleases you and i know better things mr belford though you have kept company with a wolf you have not learnt to howl of him but nevertheless you must let him know that i have written to you on this subject i am ashamed to say it but he has ever treated me as if i were a man of very common understanding and would perhaps think never the better of the best advice in the world for coming from me those mr belford who most love are least set by but who would expect velvet to be made out of a sows ear i am sure he has no reason however to slight me as he does he may and will be the better for me if he outlives me though he once told me to my face that i might do as i would with my estate for that he for his part loved his liberty as much as he despised money and at another time twitting me with my phrases that the man was above controul who wanted not either to borrow or flatter he thought i suppose that i could not cover him with my wings without pecking at him with my bill though i never used to be pecking at him without very great occasion and god knows he might have my very heart if he would but endeavour to oblige me by studying his own good for that is all i desire of him indeed it was his poor mother that first spoiled him and i have been but too indulgent to him since a fine grateful disposition youll say to return evil for good but that was always his way it is a good saying and which was verified by him with a witness children when little make their parents fools when great mad had his parents lived to see what i have seen of him they would have been mad indeed this match however as the lady has such an extraordinary share of wisdom and goodness might set all to rights and if you can forward it i would enable him to make whatever settlements he could wish and should not be unwilling to put him in possession of another pretty estate besides i am no covetous man he knows and indeed what is a covetous man to be likened to so fitly as to a dog in a wheel which roasts meat for others and what do i live for as i have often said but to see him and my two nieces well married and settled may heaven settle him down to a better mind and turn his heart to more of goodness and consideration if the delays are on his side i tremble for the lady and if on hers as he tells my niece charlotte i could wish she were apprized that delays are dangerous excellent as she is she ought not to depend on her merits with such a changeable fellow and such a profest marriage hater as he has been desert and reward i can assure her seldom keep company together but let him remember that vengeance though it comes with leaden feet strikes with iron hands if he behaves ill in this case he may find it so what a pity it is that a man of his talents and learning should be so vile a rake alas alas une poigne de bonne vie vaut mieux que plein muy de clerge a handful of good life is better than a whole bushel of learning you may throw in too as a friend that should he provoke me it may not be too late for me to marry my old friend wycherly did so when he was older than i am on purpose to plague his nephew and in spite of this gout i might have a child or two still i have not been without some thoughts that way when he has angered me more than ordinary but these thoughts have gone off again hitherto upon my considering that the children of very young and very old men though i am not so very old neither last not long and that old men when they marry young women are said to make much of death yet who knows but that matrimony might be good against the gouty humours i am troubled with no man is every thing you mr belford are a learned man i am a peer and do you as you best know how inculcate upon him the force of these wise sayings which follow as well as those which went before but yet so indiscreetly as that he may not know that you borrow your darts from my quiver these be they happy is the man who knows his follies in his youth he that lives well lives long again he that lives ill one year will sorrow for it seven and again as the spaniards have it who lives well sees afar off far off indeed for he sees into eternity as a man may say then that other fine saying he who perishes in needless dangers is the devils martyr another proverb i picked up at madrid when i accompanied lord lexington in his embassy to spain which might teach my nephew more mercy and compassion than is in his nature i doubt to shew which is this that he who pities another remembers himself and this that is going to follow i am sure he has proved the truth of a hundred times that he who does what he will seldom does what he ought nor is that unworthy of his notice young mens frolics old men feel my devilish gout god help me but i will not say what i was going to say i remember that you yourself complimenting me for my taste in pithy and wise sentences said a thing that gave me a high opinion of you and it was this men of talents said you are sooner to be convinced by short sentences than by long preachments because the short sentences drive themselves into the heart and stay there while long discourses though ever so good tire the attention and one good thing drives out another and so on till all is forgotten may your good counsel mr belford founded upon these hints which i have given pierce his heart and incite him to do what will be so happy for himself and so necessary for the honour of that admirable lady whom i long to see his wife and if i may i will not think of one for myself should he abuse the confidence she has placed in him i myself shall pray that vengeance may fall upon his head raro i quite forget all my latin but i think it is raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede paean claudo where vice goes before vengeance sooner or later will follow but why do i translate these things for you i shall make no apologies for this trouble i know how well you love him and me and there is nothing in which you could serve us both more importantly than in forwarding this match to the utmost of your power when it is done how shall i rejoice to see you at m hall mean time i shall long to hear that you are likely to be successful with him and am dear sir your most faithful friend and servant m mr lovelace having not returned an answer to mr belfords expostulary letter so soon as mr belford expected he wrote to him expressing his apprehension that he had disobliged him by his honest freedom among other things he says i pass my time here at watford attending my dying uncle very heavily i cannot therefore by any means dispense with thy correspondence and why shouldst thou punish me for having more conscience and more remorse than thyself thou who never thoughtest either conscience or remorse an honour to thee and i have besides a melancholy story to tell thee in relation to belton and his thomasine and which may afford a lesson to all the keepingclass i have a letter from each of our three companions in the time they have all the wickedness that thou hast but not the wit some new rogueries do two of them boast of which i think if completed deserve the gallows i am far from hating intrigue upon principle but to have awkward fellows plot and commit their plots to paper destitute of the seasonings of the acumen which is thy talent how extremely shocking must their letters be but do thou lovelace whether thou art or art not determined upon thy measures with regard to the fine lady in thy power enliven my heavy heart by thy communications and thou wilt oblige thy melancholy friend j belford letter xxxvii mr lovelace to john belford esq friday night may when i have opened my view to thee so amply as i have done in my former letters and have told thee that my principal design is but to bring virtue to a trial that if virtue it need not be afraid of and that the reward of it will be marriage that is to say if after i have carried my point i cannot prevail upon her to live with me the life of honour for that thou knowest is the wish of my heart i am amazed at the repetition of thy wambling nonsense see vol iii letter xviii i am of opinion with thee that some time hence when i am grown wiser i shall conclude that there is nothing but vanity conceit and nonsense in my present wild schemes but what is this saying but that i must be first wiser i do not intend to let this matchless creature slide through my fingers art thou able to say half the things in her praise that i have said and am continually saying or writing her gloomy father cursed the sweet creature because she put it out of his wicked power to compel her to have the man she hated thou knowest how little merit she has with me on this score and shall i not try the virtue i intended upon full proof to reward because her father is a tyrant why art thou thus eternally reflecting upon so excellent a woman as if thou wert assured she would fail in the trial nay thou declarest every time thou writest on the subject that she will that she must yield entangled as she is and yet makest her virtue the pretence of thy solicitude for her an instrument of the vile james harlowe dost thou call me o jack how could i curse thee i am instrument of that brother of that sister but mark the end and thou shalt see what will become of that brother and of that sister play not against me my own acknowledged sensibilities i desire thee sensibilities which at the same time that they contradict thy charge of an adamantine heart in thy friend thou hadst known nothing of had i not communicated them to thee if i ruin such a virtue sayest thou eternal monotonist again the most immaculate virtue may be ruined by men who have no regard to their honour and who make a jest of the most solemn oaths c what must be the virtue that will be ruined without oaths is not the world full of these deceptions and are not lovers oaths a jest of hundreds of years standing and are not cautions against the perfidy of our sex a necessary part of the female education i do intend to endeavour to overcome myself but i must first try if i cannot overcome this lady have i not said that the honour of her sex is concerned that i should try whenever thou meetest with a woman of but half her perfections thou wilt marry do jack can a girl be degraded by trials who is not overcome i am glad that thou takest crime to thyself for not endeavouring to convert the poor wretches whom others have ruined i will not recriminate upon thee belford as i might when thou flatterest thyself that thou never ruinedst the morals of any young creature who otherwise would not have been corrupted the palliating consolation of an hottentot heart determined rather to gluttonize on the garbage of other foul feeders than to reform but tell me jack wouldst thou have spared such a girl as my rosebud had i not by my example engaged thy generosity nor was my rosebud the only girl i spared when my power was acknowledged who more merciful than thy friend it is resistance that inflames desire sharpens the darts of love and blows its fire love is disarmd that meets with too much ease he languishes and does not care to please the women know this as well as the men they love to be addressed with spirit and therefore tis their golden fruit they guard with so much care to make profession hard whence for a byreflection the ardent the complaisant gallant is so often preferred to the cold the unadoring husband and yet the sex do not consider that variety and novelty give the ardour and the obsequiousness and that were the rake as much used to them as the husband is he would be and is to his own wife if married as indifferent to their favours as their husbands are and the husband in his turn would to another woman be the rake let the women upon the whole take this lesson from a lovelace always to endeavour to make themselves as new to a husband and to appear as elegant and as obliging to him as they are desirous to appear to a lover and actually were to him as such and then the rake which all women love will last longer in the husband than it generally does but to return if i have not sufficiently cleared my conduct to thee in the above i refer thee once more to mine of the th of last month and prythee jack lay me not under a necessity to repeat the same things so often i hope thou readest what i write more than once see vol ii letter xiv i am not displeased that thou art so apprehensive of my resentment that i cannot miss a day without making thee uneasy thy conscience tis plain tells thee that thou has deserved my displeasure and if it has convinced thee of that it will make thee afraid of repeating thy fault see that this be the consequence else now that thou hast told me how i can punish thee it is very likely that i do punish thee by my silence although i have as much pleasure in writing on this charming subject as thou canst have in reading what i write when a boy if a dog ran away from me through fear i generally looked about for a stone or a stick and if neither offered to my hand i skinned my hat after him to make him afraid for something what signifies power if we do not exert it let my lord know that thou hast scribbled to me but give him not the contents of thy epistle though a parcel of crude stuff he would think there was something in it poor arguments will do when brought in favour of what we like but the stupid peer little thinks that this lady is a rebel to love on the contrary not only he but all the world believe her to be a volunteer in his service so i shall incur blame and she will be pitied if any thing happen amiss since my lords heart is set upon this match i have written already to let him know that my unhappy character had given my beloved an ungenerous diffidence of me that she is so mothersick and fatherfond that she had rather return to harloweplace than marry that she is even apprehensive that the step she has taken of going off with me will make the ladies of a family of such rank and honour as ours think slightly of her that therefore i desire his lordship though this hint i tell him must be very delicately touched to write me such a letter as i can shew her let him treat me in it ever so freely i shall not take it amiss i tell him because i know his lordship takes pleasure in writing to me in a corrective style that he may make what offers he pleases on the marriage that i desire his presence at the ceremony that i may take from his hand the greatest blessing that mortal man can give me i have not absolutely told the lady that i would write to his lordship to this effect yet have given her reason to think i will so that without the last necessity i shall not produce the answer i expect from him for i am very loth i own to make use of any of my familys names for the furthering of my designs and yet i must make all secure before i pull off the mask was not this my motive for bringing her hither thus thou seest that the old peers letter came very seasonably i thank thee for that but as to his sentences they cannot possibly do me good i was early suffocated with his wisdom of nations when a boy i never asked anything of him but out flew a proverb and if the tendency of that was to deny me i never could obtain the least favour this gave me so great an aversion to the very word that when a child i made it a condition with my tutor who was an honest parson that i would not read my bible at all if he would not excuse me one of the wisest books in it to which however i had no other objection than that it was called the proverbs and as for solomon he was then a hated character with me not because of his polygamy but because i had conceived him to be such another musty old fellow as my uncle well but let us leave old saws to old me what signifies thy tedious whining over thy departing relation is it not generally agreed that he cannot recover will it not be kind in thee to put him out of his misery i hear that he is pestered still with visits from doctors and apothecaries and surgeons that they cannot cut so deep as the mortification has gone and that in every visit in every scarification inevitable death is pronounced upon him why then do they keep tormenting him is it not to take away more of his living fleece than of his dead flesh when a man is given over the fee should surely be refused are they not now robbing his heirs what has thou to do if the will be as thoudst have it he sent for thee did he not to close his eyes he is but an uncle is he let me see if i mistake not it is in the bible or some other good book can it be in herodotus o i believe it is in josephus a half sacred and halfprofane author he tells us of a king of syria put out of his pain by his prime minister or one who deserved to be so for his contrivance the story says if i am right that he spread a wet cloth over his face which killing him he reigned in his place a notable fellow perhaps this wet cloth in the original is what we now call laudanum a potion that overspreads the faculties as the wet cloth did the face of the royal patient and the translator knew not how to render it but how like forlorn varlet thou subscribest thy melancholy friend j belford melancholy for what to stand by and see fair play between an old man and death i thought thou hadst been more of a man that thou art not afraid of an acute death a swords point to be so plaugily hipd at the consequences of a chronical one what though the scarificators work upon him day by day its only upon a caput mortuum and prythee go to to use the stylum veterum and learn of the royal butchers who for sport an hundred times worse men than thy lovelace widow ten thousand at a brush and make twice as many fatherless learn of them i say how to support a single death but art thou sure jack it is a mortification my uncle once gave promises of such a rootandbranch distemper but alas it turned to a smart goutfit and i had the mortification instead of him i have heard that bark in proper doses will arrest a mortification in its progress and at last cure it let thy uncles surgeon know that it is worth more than his ears if he prescribe one grain of the bark i wish my uncle had given me the opportunity of setting thee a better example thou shouldst have seen what a brave fellow i had been and had i had occasion to write my conclusion would have been this i hope the old trojans happy in that hope i am so and thy rejoicing friend r lovelace dwell not always jack upon one subject let me have poor beltons story the sooner the better if i can be of service to him tell him he may command me either in purse or person yet the former with a freer will than the latter for how can i leave my goddess but ill issue my commands to my other vassals to attend thy summons if ye want head let me know if not my quota on this occasion is money letter xxxviii mr belford to robert lovelace esq saturday may not one word will i reply to such an abandoned wretch as thou hast shewn thyself to be in thine of last night i will leave the lady to the protection of that power who only can work miracles and to her own merits still i have hopes that these will save her i will proceed as thou desirest to poor beltons case and the rather as it has thrown me into such a train of thinking upon our past lives our present courses and our future views as may be of service to us both if i can give due weight to the reflections that arise from it the poor man made me a visit on thursday in this my melancholy attendance he began with complaints of his ill health and spirits his hectic cough and his increased malady of spitting blood and then led to his story a confounded one it is and which highly aggravates his other maladies for it has come out that his thomasine who truly would be new christened you know that her name might be nearer in sound to the christian name of the man whom she pretended to doat upon has for many years carried on an intrigue with a fellow who had been hostler to her father an innkeeper at darking of whom at the expense of poor belton she has made a gentleman and managed it so that having the art to make herself his cashier she has been unable to account for large sums which he thought forthcoming at demand and had trusted to her custody in order to pay off a mortgage upon his parental estate in kent which his heart has run upon leaving clear but which now cannot be done and will soon be foreclosed and yet she has so long passed for his wife that he knows not what to resolve upon about her nor about the two boys he was so fond of supposing them to be his whereas now he begins to doubt his share in them so keeping dont do lovelace tis not the eligible wife a man must keep a woman said the poor fellow to me but not his estate two interests then my tottering fabric pointing to his emaciated carcass we do well to value ourselves upon our liberty or to speak more properly upon the liberties we take we had need to run down matrimony as we do and to make that state the subject of our frothy jests when we frequently render ourselves for this of toms is not a singular case the dupes and tools of women who generally govern us by arts our wise heads penetrate not more absolutely than a wife would attempt to do let us consider this point a little and that upon our own principles as libertines setting aside what is exacted from us by the laws of our country and its customs which nevertheless we cannot get over till we have got over almost all moral obligations as members of society in the first place let us consider we who are in possession of estates by legal descent how we should have liked to have been such naked destitute varlets as we must have been had our fathers been as wise as ourselves and despised matrimony as we do and then let us ask ourselves if we ought not to have the same regard for our posterity as we are glad our fathers had for theirs but this perhaps is too moral a consideration to proceed therefore to those considerations which will be more striking to us how can we reasonably expect economy or frugality or anything indeed but riot and waste from creatures who have an interest and must therefore have views different from our own they know the uncertain tenure our fickle humours by which they hold and is it to be wondered at supposing them to be provident harlots that they should endeavour if they have the power to lay up against a rainy day or if they have not the power that they should squander all they can come at when they are sure of nothing but the present hour and when the life they live and the sacrifices they have made put conscience and honour out of the question whereas a wife having the same familyinterest with her husband lies not under either the same apprehensions or temptations and has not broken through of necessity at least has not those restraints which education has fastened upon her and if she makes a private purse which we are told by antimatrimonialists all wives love to do and has children it goes all into the same family at the longrun then as to the great article of fidelity to your bed are not women of family who are welleducated under greater restraints than creatures who if they ever had reputation sacrifice it to sordid interest or to more sordid appetite the moment they give it up to you does not the example you furnish of having succeeded with her give encouragement for others to attempt her likewise for with all her blandishments can any man be so credulous or so vain as to believe that the woman he could persuade another may not prevail upon adultery is so capital a guilt that even rakes and libertines if not wholly abandoned and as i may say invited by a womans levity disavow and condemn it but here in a state of keeping a woman is in no danger of incurring legally at least that guilt and you yourself have broken through and overthrown in her all the fences and boundaries of moral honesty and the modesty and reserves of her sex and what tie shall hold her against inclination or interest and what shall deter an attempter while a husband has this security from legal sanctions that if his wife be detected in a criminal conversation with a man of fortune the most likely by bribes to seduce her he may recover very great damages and procure a divorce besides which to say nothing of the ignominy is a consideration that must have some force upon both parties and a wife must be vicious indeed and a reflection upon a mans own choice who for the sake of change and where there are no qualities to seduce nor affluence to corrupt will run so many hazards to injure her husband in the tenderest of all points but there are difficulties in procuring a divorce and so there ought and none says the rake in parting with a mistress whenever you suspect her or whenever you are weary of her and have a mind to change her for another but must not the man be a brute indeed who can cast off a woman whom he has seduced if he take her from the town thats another thing without some flagrant reason something that will better justify him to himself as well as to her and to the world than mere power and novelty but i dont see if we judge by fact and by the practice of all we have been acquainted with of the keepingclass that we know how to part with them when we have them that we know we can if we will is all we have for it and this leads us to bear many things from a mistress which we would not from a wife but if we are goodnatured and humane if the woman has art and what woman wants it who has fallen by art and to whose precarious situation art is so necessary if you have given her the credit of being called by your name if you have a settled place of abode and have received and paid visits in her company as your wife if she has brought you children you will allow that these are strong obligations upon you in the worlds eye as well as to your own heart against tearing yourself from such close connections she will stick to you as your skin and it will be next to flaying yourself to cast her off even if there be cause for it by infidelity she will have managed ill if she have not her defenders nor did i ever know a cause or a person so bad as to want advocates either from illwill to the one or pity to the other and you will then be thought a hardhearted miscreant and even were she to go off without credit to herself she will leave you as little especially with all those whose good opinion a man would wish to cultivate well then shall this poor privilege that we may part with a woman if we will be deemed a balance for the other inconveniencies shall it be thought by us who are men of family and fortune an equivalent for giving up equality of degree and taking for the partner of our bed and very probably more than the partner in our estates to the breach of all familyrule and order a lowborn a loweducated creature who has not brought any thing into the common stock and can possibly make no returns for the solid benefits she receives but those libidinous ones which a man cannot boast of but to his disgrace nor think of but to the shame of both moreover as the man advances in years the fury of his libertinism will go off he will have different aims and pursuits which will diminish his appetite to ranging and make such a regular life as the matrimonial and family life palatable to him and every day more palatable if he has children and has reason to think them his and if his lewd courses have left him any estate he will have cause to regret the restraint his boasted liberty has laid him under and the valuable privilege it has deprived him of when he finds that it must descend to some relation for whom whether near or distant he cares not one farthing and who perhaps if a man of virtue has held him in the utmost contempt for his dissolute life and were we to suppose his estate in his power to bequeath as he pleases why should a man resolve for the gratifying of his foolish humour only to bastardize his race why should he wish to expose his children to the scorn and insults of the rest of the world why should he whether they are sons or daughters lay them under the necessity of complying with proposals of marriage either inferior as to fortune or unequal as to age why should he deprive the children he loves who themselves may be guilty of no fault of the respect they would wish to have and to deserve and of the opportunity of associating themselves with proper that is to say with reputable company and why should he make them think themselves under obligation to every person of character who will vouchsafe to visit them what little reason in a word would such children have to bless their fathers obstinate defiance of the laws and customs of his country and for giving them a mother of whom they could not think with honour to whose crime it was that they owed their very beings and whose example it was their duty to shun if the education and morals of these children are left to chance as too generally they are for the man who has humanity and a feeling heart and who is capable of fondness for his offspring i take it for granted will marry the case is still worse his crime is perpetuated as i may say by his children and the sea the army perhaps the highway for the boys the common for the girls too often point out the way to a worse catastrophe what therefore upon the whole do we get by treading in these crooked paths but danger disgrace and a toolate repentance and after all do we not frequently become the cullies of our own libertinism sliding into the very state with those halfwornout doxies which perhaps we might have entered into with their ladies at least with their superiors both in degree and fortune and all the time lived handsomely like ourselves not sneaking into holes and corners and when we crept abroad with our women looking about us and at ever one that passed us as if we were confessedly accountable to the censures of all honest people my cousin tony jenyns thou knewest he had not the actively mischievous spirit that thou belton mowbray tourville and myself have but he imbibed the same notions we do and carried them into practice how did he prate against wedlock how did he strut about as a wit and a smart and what a wit and a smart did all the boys and girls of our family myself among the rest then an urchin think him for the airs he gave himself marry no not for the world what man of sense would bear the insolences the petulances the expensiveness of a wife he could not for the heart of him think it tolerable that a woman of equal rank and fortune and as it might happen superior talents to his own should look upon herself to have a right to share the benefit of that fortune which she brought him so after he had fluttered about the town for two or three years in all which time he had a better opinion of himself than any body else had what does he do but enter upon an affair with his fencingmasters daughter he succeeds takes private lodgings for her at hackney visits her by stealth both of them tender of reputations that were extremely tender but which neither had quite given up for rakes of either sex are always the last to condemn or cry down themselves visited by nobody nor visiting the life of a thief or of a man bested by creditors afraid to look out of his own house or to be seen abroad with her and thus went on for twelve years and though he had a good estate hardly making both ends meet for though no glare there was no economy and beside he had ever year a child and very fond of his children was he but none of them lived above three years and being now on the death of the dozenth grown as dully sober as if he had been a real husband his good mrs thomas for he had not permitted her to take his own name prevailed upon him to think the loss of their children a judgment upon the parents for their wicked way of life a time will come lovelace if we live to advanced years in which reflection will take hold of the enfeebled mind and then it was not difficult for his woman to induce him by way of compounding with heaven to marry her when this was done he had leisure to sit down and contemplate an to recollect the many offers of persons of family and fortune to which he had declined in the prime of life his expenses equal at least his reputation not only less but lost his enjoyments stolen his partnership unequal and such as he had always been ashamed of but the woman said that after twelve or thirteen years cohabitation tony did an honest thing by her and that was all my poor cousin got by making his old mistress his new wife not a drum not a trumpet not a fife not a tabret nor the expectation of a new joy to animate him on what belton will do with his thomasine i know not nor care i to advise him for i see the poor fellow does not like that any body should curse her but himself this he does very heartily and so low is he reduced that he blubbers over the reflection upon his past fondness for her cubs and upon his present doubts of their being his what a damnd thing is it belford if tom and hal should be the hostler dogs puppies and not mine very true and i think the strong health of the chubbyfaced muscular whelps confirms the too great probability but i say not so to him you he says are such a gay lively mortal that this sad tale would make no impression upon you especially now that your whole heart is engaged as it is mowbray would be too violent upon it he has not he says a feeling heart tourville has no discretion and a pretty jest although he and his thomasine lived without reputation in the world people guessing that they were not married notwithstanding she went by his name yet he would not too much discredit the cursed ingrate neither could a man act a weaker part had he been really married and were he sure he was going to separate from the mother of his own children i leave this as a lesson upon thy heart without making any application only with this remark that after we libertines have indulged our licentious appetites reflecting in the conceit of our vain hearts both with our lips and by our lives upon our ancestors and the good old ways we find out when we come to years of discretion if we live till then what all who knew us found out before that is to say we found out our own despicable folly that those good old ways would have been best for us as well as for the rest of the world and that in every step we have deviated from them we have only exposed our vanity and our ignorance at the same time j belford letter xxxix mr lovelace to john belford esq saturday may i am pleased with the sober reflection with which thou concludest thy last and i thank thee for it poor belton i did not think his thomasine would have proved so very a devil but this must everlastingly be the risk of a keeper who takes up with a lowbred girl this i never did nor had i occasion to do it such a one as i jack needed only till now to shake the stateliest tree and the mellowed fruit dropt into my mouth always of montaignes taste thou knowest thought it a glory to subdue a girl of family more truly delightful to me the seduction progress than the crowned act for thats a vapour a bubble and most cordially do i thank thee for thy indirect hint that i am right in my pursuit from such a woman as miss harlowe a man is secured from all the inconveniencies thou expatiatest upon once more therefore do i thank thee belford for thy approbation a man need not as thou sayest sneak into holes and corners and shun the day in the company of such a woman as this how friendly in thee thus to abet the favourite purpose of my heart nor can it be a disgrace to me to permit such a lady to be called by my name nor shall i be at all concerned about the worlds censure if i live to the years of discretion which thou mentionest should i be taken in and prevailed upon to tread with her the good old path of my ancestors a blessing on thy heart thou honest fellow i thought thou wert in jest and but acquitting thyself of an engagement to lord m when thou wert pleading for matrimony in behalf of this lady it could not be principle i knew in thee it could not be compassion a little envy indeed i suspected but now i see thee once more thyself and once more say i a blessing on thy heart thou true friend and very honest fellow now will i proceed with courage in all my schemes and oblige thee with the continued narrative of my progressions towards bringing them to effect but i could not forbear to interrupt my story to show my gratitude letter xl mr lovelace to john belford esq and now will i favour thee with a brief account of our present situation from the highest to the lowest we are all extremely happy dorcas stands well in her ladys graces polly has asked her advice in relation to a courtshipaffair of her own no oracle ever gave better sally has had a quarrel with her woollendraper and made my charmer ladychancellor in it she blamed sally for behaving tyrannically to a man who loves her dear creature to stand against a glass and to shut her eyes because she will not see her face in it mrs sinclair has paid her court to so unerring a judge by requesting her advice with regard to both nieces this the way we have been in for several days with the people below yet sola generally at her meals and seldom at other times in their company they now used to her ways perseverance must conquer never press her so when they meet all is civility on both sides even married people i believe jack prevent abundance of quarrels by seeing one another but seldom but how stands it between thyself and the lady methinks thou askest since her abrupt departure from thee and undutiful repulse of wednesday morning why pretty well in the main nay very well for why the dear saucy face knows not how to help herself can fly to no other protection and has besides overheard a conversation who would have thought she had been so near which passed between mrs sinclair miss martin and myself that very wednesday afternoon which has set her heart at ease with respect to several doubtful points such as particularly mrs fretchvilles unhappy state of mind most humanely pitied by miss martin who knows her very well the husband she has lost and herself as sally says lovers from their cradles pity from one begets pity from another be the occasion for it either strong or weak and so many circumstances were given to poor mrs fretchvilles distress that it was impossible but my beloved must extremely pity her whom the less tenderhearted miss martin greatly pitied my lord ms gout his only hindrance from visiting my spouse lady betty and miss montague soon expected in town my earnest desire signified to have my spouse receive those ladies in her own hose if mrs fretchville would but know her own mind and i pathetically lamented the delay occasioned by her not knowing it my intention to stay at mrs sinclairs as i said i had told them before while my spouse resides in her own hose when mrs fretchville could be brought to quit it in order to gratify her utmost punctilio my passion for my beloved which as i told them in a high and fervent accent was the truest that man could have for woman i boasted of it was in short i said of the true platonic kind or i had no notion of what platonic love was so it is jack and must end as platonic love generally does end sally and mrs sinclair next praised but not grossly my beloved sally particularly admired her purity called it exemplary yet to avoid suspicion expressed her thoughts that she was rather overnice if she might presume to say so before me but nevertheless she applauded me for the strict observation i made of my vow i more freely blamed her reserves to me called her cruel inveighed against her relations doubted her love every favour i asked of her denied me yet my behaviour to her as pure and delicate when alone as when before them hinted at something that had passed between us that very day that shewed her indifference to me in so strong a light that i could not bear it but that i would ask her for her company to the play of venice preserved given out for sunday night as a benefitplay the prime actors to be in it and this to see if i were to be denied every favour yet for my own part i loved not tragedies though she did for the sake of the instruction the warning and the example generally given in them i had too much feeling i said there was enough in the world to make our hearts sad without carrying grief in our diversions and making the distresses of others our own true enough belford and i believe generally speaking that all the men of our cast are of my mind they love not any tragedies but those in which they themselves act the parts of tyrants and executioners and afraid to trust themselves with serious and solemn reflections run to comedies in order to laugh away compunction on the distresses they have occasioned and to find examples of men as immoral as themselves for very few of our comic performances as thou knowest give us good ones i answer however for myself yet thou i think on recollection lovest to deal in the lamentable sally answered for polly who was absent mrs sinclair for herself and for all her acquaintance even for miss partington in preferring the comic to the tragic scenes and i believe they are right for the devils in it if a confidedin rake does not give a girl enough of tragedy in his comedy i asked sally to oblige my fairone with her company she was engaged that was right thoult suppose i asked mrs sinclairs leave for polly to be sure she answered polly would think it an honour to attend mrs lovelace but the poor thing was tenderhearted and as the tragedy was deep would weep herself blind sally meantime objected singleton that i might answer the objection and save my beloved the trouble of making it or debating the point with me and on this occasion i regretted that her brothers projects were not laid aside since if they had been given up i would have gone in person to bring up the ladies of my family to attend my spouse i then from a letter just before received from one in her fathers family warned them of a person who had undertaken to find us out and whom i thus in writing having called for pen and ink described that they might arm all the family against him a sunburnt pockfretten sailor illlooking bigboned his stature about six foot an heavy eye an overhanging brow a decktreading stride in his walk a couteau generally by his side lips parched from his gums as if by staring at the sun in hot climates a brown coat a coloured handkerchief about his neck an oaken plant in his hand near as long as himself and proportionately thick no questions asked by this fellow must be answered they should call me to him but not let my beloved know a tittle of this so long as it could be helped and i added that if her brother or singleton came and if they behaved civilly i would for her sake be civil to them and in this case she had nothing to do but to own her marriage and there could be no pretence for violence on either side but most fervently i swore that if she was conveyed away either by persuasion or force i would directly on missing her but one day go to demand her at harloweplace whether she were there or not and if i recovered not a sister i would have a brother and should find out a captain of a ship as well as he and now jack dost thou think shell attempt to get from me do what i will mrs sinclair began to be afraid of mischief in her house i was apprehensive that she would overdo the matter and be out of character i therefore winked at her she primed nodded to show she took me twanged out a highho through her nose lapped one horselip over the other and was silent heres preparation belford dost think i will throw it all away for any thing thou canst say or lord m write no indeed as my charmer says when she bridles and what must necessarily be the consequence of all this with regard to my beloveds behaviour to me canst thou doubt that it was all complaisance next time she admitted me into her presence thursday we were very happy all the morning extremely happy i kissed her charming hand i need not describe to thee her hand and arm when thou sawest her i took notice that thy eyes dwelt upon them whenever thou couldst spare them from that beauty spot of wonders her face fifty times kissed her hand i believe once her cheek intending her lip but so rapturously that she could not help seeming angry had she not thus kept me at armslength had she not denied me those innocent liberties which our sex from step to step aspire to could i but have gained access to her in her hours of heedlessness and dishabille for full dress creates dignity augments consciousness and compels distance we had familiarized to each other long ago but keep her up ever so late meet her ever so early by breakfasttime she is dressed for the day and at her earliest hour as nice as others dressed all her forms thus kept up wonder not that i have made so little progress in the proposed trial but how must all this distance stimulate thursday morning as i said we were extremely happy about noon she numbered the hours she had been with me all of them to be but as one minute and desired to be left to herself i was loth to comply but observing the sunshine began to shut in i yielded i dined out returning i talked of the house and of mrs fretchville had seen mennell had pressed him to get the widow to quit she pitied mrs fretchville another good effect of the overheard conversation had written to lord m expected an answer soon from him i was admitted to sup with her i urged for her approbation or correction of my written terms she again promised an answer as soon as she had heard from miss howe then i pressed for her company to the play on saturday night she made objections as i had foreseen her brothers projects warmth of the weather c but in such a manner as if half afraid to disoblige me another happy effect of the overheard conversation i soon got over these therefore and she consented to favour me friday passed as the day before here were two happy days to both why cannot i make every day equally happy it looks as if it were in my power to do so strange i should thus delight in teasing a woman i so dearly love i must i doubt have something in my temper like miss howe who loves to plague the man who puts himself in her power but i could not do thus by such an angel as this did i not believe that after her probation time shall be expired and if she be not to be brought to cohabitation my darling view i shall reward her as she wishes saturday is half over we are equally happy preparing for the play polly has offered her company and is accepted i have directed her where to weep and this not only to show her humanity a weeping eye indicates a gentle heart but to have a pretence to hide her face with a fan or handkerchief yet polly is far from being every mans girl and we shall sit in the gallery greenbox the woes of others so well represented as those of belvidera particularly will be must i hope unlock and open my charmers heart whenever i have been able to prevail upon a girl to permit me to attend her to a play i have thought myself sure of her the female heart all gentleness and harmony by nature expands and forgets its forms when its attention is carried out of itself at an agreeable or affecting entertainment music and perhaps a collation afterwards cooperating indeed i have no hope of such an effect here but i have more than one end to answer by getting her to a play to name but one dorcas has a masterkey as i have told thee but it were worth while to carry her to the play of venice preserved were it but to show her that there have been and may be much deeper distresses than she can possibly know thus exceedingly happy are we at present i hope we shall not find any of nat lees lefthanded gods at work to dash our bowl of joy with wormwood r lovelace letter xli miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe friday may i would not if i could help it be so continually brooding over the dark and gloomy face of my condition all nature you know my dear and every thing in it has a bright and a gloomy side as to be thought unable to enjoy a more hopeful prospect and this not only for my own sake but for yours who take such generous concern in all that befalls me let me tell you then my dear that i have known fourandtwenty hours together not unhappy ones my situation considered she then gives the particulars of the conversation which she had overheard between mr lovelace mrs sinclair and miss martin but accounts more minutely than he had done for the opportunity she had of overhearing it unknown to them she gives the reasons she has to be pleased with what she heard from each but is shocked at the measure he is resolved to take if he misses her but for one day yet is pleased that he proposes to avoid aggressive violence if her brother and he meet in town even dorcas says she appears less exceptionable to me than before and i cannot but pity her for her neglected education as it is matter of so much regret to herself else there would not be much in it as the low and illiterate are the most useful people in the commonwealth since such constitute the labouring part of the public and as a lettered education but too generally sets people above those servile offices by which the businesses of the world is carried on nor have i any doubt but there are take the world through twenty happy people among the unlettered to one among those who have had a schooleducation this however concludes not against learning or letters since one would wish to lift to some little distinction and more genteel usefulness those who have capacity and whose parentage one respects or whose services one would wish to reward were my mind quite at ease i could enlarge perhaps not unusefully upon this subject for i have considered it with as much attention as my years and little experience and observation will permit but the extreme illiterateness and indocility of this maid are surprising considering that she wants not inquisitiveness appears willing to learn and in other respects has quick parts this confirms to me what i have heard remarked that there is a docible season a learningtime as i may say for every person in which the mind may be led step by step from the lower to the higher year by year to improvement how industriously ought these seasons as they offer to be taken hold of by tutors parents and other friends to whom the cultivation of the genius of children and youth is committed since one elapsed and no foundation laid they hardly ever return and yet it must be confessed that there are some geniuses which like some fruits ripen not till late and industry and perseverance will do prodigious things but for a learner to have those first rudiments to master at twenty years of age suppose which others are taught and they themselves might have attained at ten what an uphill labour these kind of observations you have always wished me to intersperse as they arise to my thoughts but it is a sign that my prospects are a little mended or i should not among so many more interesting ones that my mind has been of late filled with have had hearts ease enough to make them let me give you my reflections on my more hopeful prospects i am now in the first place better able to account for the delays about the house than i was before poor mrs fretchville though i know her not i pity her next it looks well that he had apprized the women before this conversation with them of his intention to stay in this house after i was removed to the other by the tone of his voice he seemed concerned for the appearance of this new delay would have with me so handsomely did miss martin express herself of me that i am sorry methinks that i judged so hardly of her when i first came hither free people may go a great way but not all the way and as such are generally unguarded precipitate and thoughtless the same quickness changeableness and suddenness of spirit as i may call it may intervene if the heart be not corrupted to recover them to thought and duty his reason for declining to go in person to bring up the ladies of his family while my brother and singleton continue their machinations carries no bad face with it and one may the rather allow for their expectations that so proud a spirit as his should attend them for this purpose as he speaks of them sometimes as persons of punctilio other reasons i will mention for my being easier in my mind than i was before i overheard this conversation such as the advice he had received in relation to singletons mate which agrees but too well with what you my dear wrote to me in yours of may the th see letter xxiii of this volume his not intending to acquaint me with it his cautions to the servants about the sailor if he should come and make inquiries about us his resolution to avoid violence were he to fall in either with my brother or this singleton and the easy method he has chalked out in this case to prevent mischief since i need only not to deny my being his but yet i should be driven into such a tacit acknowledgement to any new persons till i am so although i have been led so much against my liking to give countenance to the belief of the persons below that we are married i think myself obliged from what passed between mr lovelace and me on wednesday and from what i overheard him say to consent to go with him to the play and the rather as he had the discretion to propose one of the nieces to accompany me i cannot but acknowledge that i am pleased to find that he has actually written to lord m i have promised to give mr lovelace an answer to his proposals as soon as i have heard from you my dear on the subject i hope that in my next letter i shall have reason to confirm these favourable appearances favourable i must think them in the wreck i have suffered i hope that in the trial which you hint may happen between me and myself as you express it if he should so behave as to oblige me to leave him i shall be able to act in such a manner as to bring no discredit upon myself in your eye and that is all now that i have to wish for but if i value him so much as you are pleased to suppose i do the trial which you imagine will be so difficult to me will not i conceive be upon getting from him when the means to affect my escape are lent me but how i shall behave when got from him and if like the israelites of old i shall be so weak as to wish to return to my egyptian bondage see letter xxxiv of this volume i think it will not be amiss notwithstanding the present favourable appearances that you should perfect the scheme whatever it be which you tell me you have thought of in order to procure for me an asylum in case of necessity mr lovelace is certainly a deep and dangerous man and it is therefore but prudence to be watchful and to be provided against the worst lord bless me my dear how i am reduced could i ever have thought to be in such a situation as to be obliged to stay with a man of whose honour by me i could have but the shadow of a doubt but i will look forward and hope the best ibid i am certain that your letters are safe be perfectly easy therefore on that head mr lovelace will never be out of my company by his good will otherwise i have no doubt that i am mistress of my goingsout and comingsin and did i think it needful and were i not afraid of my brother and captain singleton i would oftener put it to trial letter xlii miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe saturday may i did not know my dear that you deferred giving an answer to mr lovelaces proposals till you had my opinion of them a particular hand occasionally going to town will leave this at wilsons that no delay may be made on that account i never had any doubt of the mans justice and generosity in matters of settlement and all his relations are as noble in their spirits as in their descent but now it may not be amiss for you to wait to see what returns my lord makes to his letter of invitation the scheme i think of is this there is a person whom i believe you have seen with me her name townsend who is a great dealer in indian silks brussels and french laces cambricks linen and other valuable goods which she has a way of coming at dutyfree and has a great vend for them and for other curiosities which she imports in the private families of the gentry round us she has her days of being in town and then is at a chamber she rents at an inn in southwark where she keeps patters of all her silks and much of her portable goods for the conveniency of her london customers but her place of residence and where she has her principal warehouse is at depford for the opportunity of getting her goods on shore she was first brought to me by my mother to whom she was recommended on the supposal of my speedy marriage that i might have an opportunity to be as fine as a princess was my mothers expression at a moderate expense now my dear i must own that i do not love to encourage these contraband traders what is it but bidding defiance to the laws of our country when we do and hurting fair traders and at the same time robbing our prince of his legal due to the diminution of those duties which possibly must be made good by new levities upon the public but however mrs townsend and i though i have not yet had dealings with her are upon a very good foot of understanding she is a sensible woman she has been abroad and often goes abroad in the way of her business and gives very entertaining accounts of all she has seen and having applied to me to recommend her to you as it is her view to be known to young ladies who are likely to change their condition i am sure i can engage her to give you protection at her house at deptford which she says is a populous village and one of the last i should think in which you would be sought for she is not much there you will believe by the course of her dealings but no doubt must have somebody on the spot in whom she can confide and there perhaps you might be safe till your cousin comes and i should not think it amiss that you write to him out of hand i cannot suggest to you what you should write that must be left to your own discretion for you will be afraid no doubt of the consequence of a variance between the two men but notwithstanding all this and were i sure of getting you safely out of his hands i will nevertheless forgive you were you to make all up with him and marry tomorrow yet i will proceed with my projected scheme in relation to mrs townsend though i hope there will be no occasion to prosecute it since your prospects seem to be changed and since you have had twentyfour not unhappy hours together how my indignation rises for this poor consolation in the courtship courtship must i call it of such a woman let me tell you my dear that were you once your own absolute and independent mistress i should be tempted notwithstanding all i have written to wish you to be the wife of any man in the world rather than the wife either of lovelace or of solmes mrs townsend as i have recollected has two brothers each a master of a vessel and who knows as she and they have concerns together but that in case of need you may have a whole ships crew at your devotion if lovelace give you cause to leave him take no thought for the people at harloweplace let them take care of one another it is a care they are used to the law will help to secure them the wretch is no assassin no nightmurderer he is an open because a fearless enemy and should he attempt any thing that would make him obnoxious to the laws of society you might have a fair riddance of him either by flight or the gallows no matter which had you not been so minute in your account of the circumstances that attended the opportunity you had of overhearing the dialogue between mr lovelace and two of the women i should have thought the conference contrived on purpose for your ear i showed mr lovelaces proposals to mr hickman who had chambers once in lincolnsinn being designed for the law had his elder brother lived he looked so wise so proud and so important upon the occasion and wanted to take so much consideration about them would take them home if i pleased and weigh them well and so forth and the like and all that that i had no patience with him and snatched them back with anger o dear to be so angry ant please me for his zeal yes zeal without knowledge i said like most other zeals if there were no objections that struck him at once there were none so hasty dearest madam and so slow undearest sir i could have said but surely said i with a look that implied would you rebel sir he begged my pardon saw no objection indeed but might he be allowed once more no matter no matter i would have shown them to my mother i said who though of no inn of court knew more of these things than half the lounging lubbers of them and that at first sight only that she would have been angry at the confession of our continued correspondence but my dear let the articles be drawn up and engrossed and solemnize upon them and theres no more to be said let me add that the sailorfellow has been tampering with my kitty and offered a bribe to find where to direct to you next time he comes i will have him laid hold of and if i can get nothing out of him will have him drawn through one of our deepest fishponds his attempt to corrupt a servant of mine will justify my orders i send this letter away directly but will follow it by another which shall have for its subject only my mother myself and your uncle antony and as your prospects are more promising than they have been i will endeavour to make you smile upon the occasion for you will be pleased to know that my mother has had a formal tender from that grey goose which may make her skill in settlements useful to herself were she to encourage it may your prospects be still more and more happy prays your own anna howe letter xliii miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe sat sunday may now my dear for the promised subject you must not ask me how i came by the originals such they really are that i am going to present you with for my mother would not read to me those parts of your uncles letter which bore hard upon myself and which leave him without any title to mercy from me nor would she let me hear but what she pleased of hers in answer for she has condescended to answer him with a denial however but such a denial as no one but an old bachelor would take from a widow any body except myself who could have been acquainted with such a fallal courtship as this must have been had it proceeded would have been glad it had gone on and i dare say but for the saucy daughter it had my good mamma in that case would have been ten years the younger for it perhaps and could i but have approved of it i should have been considered by her as if ten years older than i am since very likely it would have been we widows my dear know not how to keep men at a distance so as to give them pain in order to try their love you must advise me child you must teach me to be cruel yet not too cruel neither so as to make a man heartless who has no time god wot to throw away then would my behaviour to mr hickman have been better liked and my mother would have bridled like her daughter o my dear how might we have been diverted by the practisings for the recovery of the long forgottens could i have been sure that it would have been in my power to have put them asunder in the irish style before they had come together but theres no trusting to the widow whose goods and chattels are in her own hands addressed by an old bachelor who has fine things and offers to leave her ten thousand pounds better than he found her and sole mistress besides of all her notables for these as you will see byandby are his proposals the old tritons address carries the writers marks upon the very subscription to the equally amiable and worthy admired theres for you mrs anabella howe widow the last word added i suppose as esquire to a man as a word of honour or for fear the bella to anna should not enough distinguish the person meant from the spinster vain hussy youll call me i know and then follows these humbly present put down as a memorandum i presume to make a leg and behave handsomely at presenting it he intending very probably to deliver it himself and now stand by to see enter old neptune his head adorned with seaweed and a crown of cockleshells as we see him decked out in mrs robinsons grotto monday may madam i did make a sort of resolution ten years ago never to marry i saw in other families where they lived best you will be pleased to mark that queernesses i could not away with then liked well enough to live single for the sake of my brothers family and for one child in it more than the rest but that girl has turned us all off the hinges and why should i deny myself any comforts for them as will not thank me for so doing i dont know so much for my motives as from self and family but the dear mrs howe makes me go farther i have a very great fortune i bless god for it all of my own getting or most of it you will be pleased to mark that for i was the youngest brother of three you have also god be thanked a great estate which you have improved by your own frugality and wise management frugality let me stop to say is one of the greatest virtues in this mortal life because it enables us to do justice to all and puts it in our power to benefit some by it as we see they deserve you have but one child and i am a bachelor and have never a one all bachelors cannot say so wherefore your daughter may be the better for me if she will keep up with my humour which was never thought bad especially to my equals servants indeed i dont matter being angry with when i please they are paid for bearing it and tootoo often deserve it as we have frequently taken notice of to one another and moreover if we keep not servants at distance they will be familiar i always made it a rule to find fault whether reasonable or not that so i might have no reason to find fault young women and servants in general as worthy mr solmes observes are better governed by fear than love but this my humour as to servants will not effect either you or miss you know i will make very advantageous settlements such as any common friend shall judge to be so but must have all in my own power while i live because you know madam it is as creditable to the wife as to the husband that it should be so i am not at fine words we are not children though it is hoped we may have some for i am a very healthy sound man i bless god for it and never brought home from my voyages and travels a worser constitution than i took out with me i was none of those i will assure you but this i will undertake that if you are the survivor you shall be at the least ten thousand pounds the better for me what in the contrary case i shall be the better for you i leave to you as you shall think my kindness to you shall deserve but one thing madam i shall be glad of that miss howe might not live with us then she need not know i write thus but go home to mr hickman as she is upon the point of marriage i hear and if she behaves dutifully as she should do to us both she shall be the better for i said so before you shall manage all things both mine and your own for i know but little of landmatters all my opposition to you shall be out of love when i think you take too much upon you for your health it will be very pretty for you i should think to have a man of experience in a long winters evening to sit down by you and tell you stories of foreign parts and the customs of the nations he has consorted with and i have fine curiosities of the indian growth such as ladies love and some that even my niece clary when she was good never saw these one by one as you are kind to me which i make no question of because i shall be kind to you shall be all yours prettier entertainment by much than sitting with a too smartish daughter sometimes out of humour and thwarting and vexing as daughters will when womengrown especially as i have heard you often observe and thinking their parents old without paying them the reverence due to years when as in your case i make no sort of doubt they are young enough to wipe their noses you understand me madam as for me myself it will be very happy and i am delighted with the thinking of it to have after a pleasant ride or so a lady of like experience with myself to come home to and but one interest betwixt us to reckon up our comingsin together and what this day and this week has produced o how this will increase love most mightily will it increase it and i believe i shall never love you enough or be able to show you all my love i hope madam there need not be such maiden niceties and hangingsoff as i may call them between us for hangingoff sake as that you will deny me a line or two to this proposal written down although you would not answer me so readily when i spoke to you your daughter being i suppose hard by for you looked round you as if not willing to be overheard so i resolved to write that my writing may stand as upon record for my upright meaning being none of your lovelaces you will mark that madam but a downright true honest faithful englishman so hope you will not disdain to write a line or two to this my proposal and i shall look upon it as a great honour i will assure you and be proud thereof what can i say more for you are your own mistress as i am my own master and you shall always be your own mistress be pleased to mark that for so a lady of your prudence and experience ought to be this is a long letter but the subject requires it because i would not write twice where once would do so would explain my sense and meaning at one time i have had writing in my head two whole months very near but hardly knew how being unpracticed in these matters to begin to write and now good lady be favourable to your most humble lover and obedient servant ant harlowe heres a letter of courtship my dear and let me subjoin to it that if now or hereafter i should treat this hideous lover who is so free with me to my mother with asperity and you should be disgusted at it i shall think you dont give me that preference in your love which you have in mine and now which shall i first give you the answer of my good mamma or the dialogue that passed between the widow mother and the pert daughter upon her letting the latter know that she had a loveletter i think you shall have the dialogue but let me promise one thing that if you think me too free you must not let it run in your head that i am writing of your uncle or of my mother but of a couple of old lovers no matter whom reverence is too apt to be forgotten by children where the reverends forget first what belongs to their own characters a grave remark and therefore at your service my dear well then suppose my mamma after twice coming into my closet to me and as often going out with very meaning features and lips ready to burst open but still closed as if by compulsion a speech going off in a slight cough that never went near the lungs grown more resolute the third time of entrance and sitting down by me thus begin mother i have a very serious matter to talk with you upon nancy when you are disposed to attend to matters within ourselves and not let matters without ourselves wholly engross you a good selveish speech but i thought that friendship gratitude and humanity were matters that ought to be deemed of the most intimate concern to us but not to dwell upon words daughter i am now disposed to attend to ever thing my manna is disposed to say to me m why then child why then my dear and the good ladys face looked so plump so smooth and so shining i see you are all attention nancy but dont be surprised dont be uneasy but i have i have where is it and yet it lay next her heart never another near it so no difficulty to have found it i have a letter my dear and out from her bosom it came but she still held it in her hand i have a letter child it is it is it is from from a gentleman i assure you lifting up her head and smiling there is no delight to a daughter thought i in such surprises as seem to be collecting i will deprive my mother of the satisfaction of making a gradual discovery d from mr antony harlowe i suppose madam m lips drawn closer eye raised why my dear i cannot but own but how i wonder could you think of mr anthony harlowe d how madam could i think of any body else m how could you think of any body else angry and drawing back her face but do you know the subject nancy d you have told it madam by your manner of breaking it to me but indeed i question not that he had two motives in his visits both equally agreeable to me for all that family love me dearly m no love lost if so between you and them but this rising is what i get so like your papa i never could open my heart to him d dear madam excuse me be so good as to open your heart to me i dont love the harlowes but pray excuse me m you have put me quite out with your forward temper angrily sitting down again d i will be all patience and attention may i be allowed to read his letter m i wanted to advise with you upon it but you are such a strange creature you are always for answering one before one speaks d youll be so good as to forgive me madam but i thought every body he among the rest knew that you had always declared against a second marriage m and so i have but then it was in the mind i was in things may offer i stared m nay dont be surprised i dont intend i dont intend d not perhaps in the mind you are in madam m pert creature rising againwe shall quarrel i see theres no d once more dear madam i beg your excuse i will attend in silence pray madam sit down again pray do she sat down may i see the letter no there are some things in it you wont like your temper is known i find to be unhappy but nothing bad against you intimations on the contrary that you shall be the better for him if you oblige him not a living soul but the harlowes i said thought me illtempered and i was contented that they should who could do as they had done by the most universally acknowledged sweetness in the world here we broke out a little but at last she read me some of the passages in the letter but not the most mightily ridiculous yet i could hardly keep my countenance neither especially when she came to that passage which mentions his sound health and at which she stopped she best knew why but soon resuming m well now nancy tell me what you think of it d nay pray madam tell me what you think of it m i expect to be answered by an answer not by a question you dont use to be so shy to speak your mind d not when my mamma commands me to do so m then speak it now d without hearing the whole of the letter m speak to what you have heard d why then madamyou wont be my mamma howe if you give way to it m i am surprised at your assurance nancy d i mean madam you will then be my mamma harlowe m o dear heart but i am not a fool and her colour went and came d dear madam but indeed i dont love a harlowe thats what i mean i am your child and must be your child do what you will m a very pert one i am sure as ever mother bore and you must be my child do what i will as much as to say you would not if you could help it if i d how could i have such a thought it would be forward indeed if i had when i dont know what your mind is as to the proposal when the proposal is so very advantageous a one too m looking a little less discomposed why indeed ten thousand pounds d and to be sure of outliving him madam m sure nobody can be sure but it is very likely that d not at all madam you was going to read something but stopped about his constitution his sobriety is well known why madam these gentlemen who have used the sea and been in different climates and come home to relax from cares in a temperate one and are sober are the likeliest to live long of any men in the world dont you see that his very skin is a fortification of buff m strange creature d god forbid that any body i love and honour should marry a man in hopes to bury him but suppose madam at your time of life m my time of life dear heart what is my time of life pray d not old madam and that you are not may be your danger as i hope to live my dear my mother smiled and looked not displeased with me m why indeed child why indeed i must needs say and then i should choose to do nothing forward as you are sometimes to hurt you d why as to that madam i cant expect that you should deprive yourself of any satisfaction m satisfaction my dear i dont say it would be a satisfaction but could i do any thing that would benefit you it would perhaps be an inducement to hold one conference upon the subject d my fortune already will be more considerable than my match if i am to have mr hickman m why so mr hickman has fortune enough to entitle him to yours d if you think so thats enough m not but i should thin the worse of myself if i desired any bodys death but i think as you say mr antony harlowe is a healthy man and bids fair for a long life bless me thought i how shall i do to know whether this be an objection or a recommendation d will you forgive me madam m what would the girl say looking as if she was half afraid to hear what d only that if you marry a man of his time of life you stand two chances instead of one to be a nurse at your time of life m saucebox d dear madam what i mean is only that these healthy old men sometimes fall into lingering disorders all at once and i humbly conceive that the infirmities of age are uneasily borne with where the remembrance of the pleasanter season comes not in to relieve the healthier of the two m a strange girl yet his healthy constitution an objection just now but i have always told you that you know either too much to be argued with or too little for me to have patience with you d i cant but say i should be glad of your commands madam how to behave myself to mr antony harlowe next time he comes m how to behave yourself why if you retire with contempt of him when he comes next it will be but as you have been used to do of late d then he is to come again madam m and suppose he be d i cant help it if it be your pleasure madam he desires a line in answer to his fine letter if he come it will be in pursuance of that line i presume m none of your arch and pert leers girl you know i wont bear them i had a mind to hear what you would say to this matter i have not written but i shall presently d it is mighty good of you madam i hope the man will think so to answer his first application by letter pity he should write twice if once will do m that fetch wont let you into my intention as to what i shall write it is too saucily put d perhaps i can guess at your intention madam were it to become me so to do m perhaps i would not make mr hickman of any man using him the worse for respecting me d nor perhaps would i madam if i liked his respects m i understand you but perhaps it is in your power to make me hearken or not to mr harlowe d young men who have probably a good deal of time before them need not be in haste for a wife mr hickman poor man must stay his time or take his remedy m he bears more from you than a man ought d then i doubt he gives a reason for the treatment he meets with m provoking creature d i have but one request to make to you madam m a dutiful one i suppose what is it pray d that if you marry i may be permitted to live single m perverse creature im sure d how can i expect madam that you should refuse such terms ten thousand pounds at the least ten thousand pounds a very handsome proposal so many fine things too to give you one by one dearest madam forgive me i hope it is not yet so far gone that rallying this man will be thought want of duty to you m your rallying of him and your reverence to me it is plain have one source d i hope not madam but ten thousand pounds m is no unhandsome proposal d indeed i think so i hope madam you will not be behindhand with him in generosity m he wont be ten thousand pounds the better for me if he survive me d no madam he cant expect that as you have a daughter and as he is a bachelor and has not a child poor old soul m old soul nancy and thus to call him for being a bachelor not having a child does this become you d not old soul for that madam but half the sum five thousand pounds you cant engage for less madam m that sum has your approbation then looking as if shed be even with me d as he leaves it to your generosity madam to reward his kindness to you it cant be less do dear madam permit me without incurring your displeasure to call him poor old soul again m never was such a whimsical creature turning away to hide her involuntary smile for i believe i looked very archly at least i intended to do so i hate that wicked sly look you give yourself very free airs dont you d i snatched her hand and kissed it my dear mamma be not angry with your girl you have told me that you was very lively formerly m formerly good lack but were i to encourage his proposals you may be sure that for mr hickmans sake as well as yours i should make a wise agreement d you have both lived to years of prudence madam m yes i suppose i am an old soul too d he also is for making a wise agreement or hinting at one at least m well the short and the long i suppose is this i have not your consent to marry d indeed madam you have not my wishes to marry m let me tell you that if prudence consists in wishing well to ones self i see not but the young flirts are as prudent as the old souls d dear madam would you blame me if to wish you not to marry mr antony harlowe is to wish well to myself m you are mighty witty i wish you were as dutiful d i am more dutiful i hope than witty or i should be a fool as well as a saucebox m let me be judge of both parents are only to live for their children let them deserve it or not thats their dutiful notion d heaven forbid that i should wish if there be two interests between my mother and me that my mother postpone her own for mine or give up any thing that would add to the real comforts of her life to oblige me tell me my dear mamma if you think the closing with this proposal will m i say that ten thousand pounds is such an acquisition to ones family that the offer of it deserves a civil return d not the offer madam the chance only if indeed you have a view to an increase of family the money may provide m you cant keep within tolerable bounds that saucy fleer i cannot away with d dearest dearest madam forgive me but old soul ran in my head again nay indeed and upon my word i will not be robbed of that charming smile and again i kissed her hand m away bold creature nothing can be so provoking as to be made to smile when one would choose and ought to be angry d but dear madam if it be to be i presume you wont think of it before next winter m what now would the pert one be at d because he only proposes to entertain you with pretty stories of foreign nations in a winters evening dearest dearest madam let me have all the reading of his letter through i will forgive him all he says about me m it may be a very difficult thing perhaps for a man of the best sense to write a loveletter that may not be cavilled at d thats because lovers in their letters hit not the medium they either write too much nonsense or too little but do you call this odd souls letter no more will i call him old soul if i can help it a loveletter m well well i see you are averse to this matter i am not to be your mother you will live single if i marry i had a mind to see if generosity govern you in your views i shall pursue my own inclinations and if they should happen to be suitable to yours pray let me for the future be better rewarded by you than hitherto i have been and away she flung without staying for a reply vexed i dare say that i did not better approve of the proposal were it only that the merit of denying might have been all her own and to lay the stronger obligation upon her saucy daughter she wrote such a widowlike refusal when she went from me as might not exclude hope in any other wooer whatever it may do in mr tony harlowe it will be my part to take care to beat her off the visit she half promises to make him as you will see in her answer upon condition that he will withdraw his suit for who knows what effect the old bachelors exotics farfetched and dearbought you know is a proverb might otherwise have upon a womans mind wanting nothing but unnecessaries gewgaws and fineries and offered such as are not easily to be met with or purchased well but now i give you leave to read here in this place the copy of my mothers answer to your uncles letter not one comment will i make upon it i know my duty better and here therefore taking the liberty to hope that i may in your present less disagreeable though not wholly agreeable situation provoke a smile from you i conclude myself your ever affectionate and faithful anna howe mrs annabella howe to antony harly esq mr antony harlowe friday may sir it is not usual i believe for our sex to answer by pen and ink the first letter on these occasions the first letter how odd is that as if i expected another which i do not but then i think as i do not judge proper to encourage your proposal there is no reason why i should not answer in civility where so great a civility is intended indeed i was always of opinion that a person was entitled to that and not to ill usage because he had a respect for me and so i have often and often told my daughter a woman i think makes but a poor figure in a mans eye afterwards and does no reputation to her sex neither when she behaves like a tyrant to him beforehand to be sure sir if i were to change my condition i know not a gentleman whose proposal could be more agreeable your nephew and your nieces have enough without you my daughter has a fine fortune without me and i should take care to double it living or dying were i to do such a thing so nobody need to be the worse for it but nancy would not think so all the comfort i know of in children is that when young they do with us what they will and all is pretty in them to their very faults and when they are grown up they think their parents must live for them only and deny themselves every thing for their sakes i know nancy could not bear a fatherinlaw she would fly at the very thought of my being in earnest to give her one not that i stand in fear of my daughter neither it is not fit i should but she has her poor papas spirit a very violent one that was and one would not choose you know sir to enter into any affair that one knows one must renounce a daughter for or she a mother except indeed ones heart were much in it which i bless god mine is not i have now been a widow these ten years nobody to controul me and i am said not to bear controul so sir you and i are best as we are i believe nay i am sure of it for we want not what either has having both more than we know what to do with and i know i could not be in the least accountable for any of my ways my daughter indeed though she is a fine girl as girls go she has too much sense indeed for one of her sex and knows she has it is more a check to me than one would wish a daughter to be for who would choose to be always snapping at each other but she will soon be married and then not living together we shall only come together when we are pleased and stay away when we are not and so like other lovers never see any thing but the best sides of each other i own for all this that i love her dearly and she me i dare say so would not wish to provoke her to do otherwise besides the girl is so much regarded every where that having lived so much of my prime a widow i would not lay myself open to her censures or even to her indifference you know your generous proposal requires all this explicitness i thank you for your good opinion of me when i know you acquiesce with this my civil refusal and indeed sir i am as much in earnest in it as if i had spoken broader i dont know but nancy and i may with your permission come to see your fine things for i am a great admirer of rarities that come from abroad so sir let us only converse occasionally as we meet as we used to do without any other view to each other than good wishes which i hope may not be lessened for this declining and then i shall always think myself your obliged servant annabella howe ps i sent word by mrs lorimer that i would write an answer but would take time for consideration so hope sir you wont think it a slight i did not write sooner letter xliv mr lovelace to john belford esq sunday may i am too much disturbed in my mind to think of any thing but revenge or i did intend to give thee an account of miss harlowes observations on the play miss harlowes i say thou knowest that i hate the name of harlowe and i am exceedingly out of humour with her and with her saucy friend whats the matter now thoult ask matter enough for while we were at the play dorcas who had her orders and a key to her ladys chamber as well as a masterkey to her drawers and mahogany chest closetkey and all found means to come at some of miss howes lastwritten letters the vigilant wench was directed to them by seeing her lady take a letter out of her stays and put it to the others before she went out with me afraid as the women upbraidingly tell me that i should find it there dorcas no sooner found them than she assembled three ready writers of the nonapparents and sally and she and they employed themselves with the utmost diligence in making extracts according to former directions from these cursed letters for my use cursed may i well call them such abuses such virulence o this little fury miss howe well might her saucy friend who has been equally free with me or the occasion could not have been given be so violent as she lately was at my endeavouring to come at one of these letters i was sure that this fairone at so early an age with a constitution so firm health so blooming eyes so sparkling expectations therefore so lively and hope so predominating could not be absolutely and from her own vigilance so guarded and so apprehensive as i have found her to be sparkling eyes jack when the poetical tribe have said all they can for them are an infallible sign of a rogue or room for a rogue in the heart thou mayest go on with thy preachments and lord m with his wisdom of nations i am now more assured of her than ever and now my revenge is up and joined with my love all resistance must fall before it and most solemnly do i swear that miss howe shall come in for her snack and here just now is another letter brought from the same little virulent devil i hope to procure scripts from that too very speedily if it be put to the test for the saucy fairone is resolved to go to church this morning no so much from a spirit of devotion i have reason to think as to try whether she can go out without check controul or my attention i have been denied breakfasting with her indeed she was a little displeased with me last night because on our return from the play i obliged her to pass the rest of the night with the women and me in their parlour and to stay till near one she told me at parting that she expected to have the whole next day to herself i had not read the extracts then so i had resolved to begin a new course and if possible to banish all jealousy and suspicion from her heart and yet i had no reason to be much troubled at her past suspicions since if a woman will continue with a man whom she suspects when she can get from him or thinks she can i am sure it is a very hopeful sign she is gone slipt down before i was aware she had ordered a chair on purpose to exclude my personal attendance but i had taken proper precautions will attended her by consent peter the houseservant was within wills call i had by dorcas represented her danger from singleton in order to dissuade her from going at all unless she allowed me to attend her but i was answered with her usual saucy smartness that if there were no cause of fear of being met with at the playhouse when there were but two playhouses surely there was less at church when there were so many churches the chairmen were ordered to carry her to st jamess church but she would not be so careless of obliging me if she knew what i have already come at and how the women urge me on for they are continually complaining of the restraint they lie under in their behaviour in their attendance neglecting all their concerns in the front house and keeping this elegant back one entirely free from company that she may have no suspicion of them they doubt not my generosity they say but why for my own sake in lord ms style should i make so long a harvest of so little corn women ye reason well i think i will begin my operations the moment she comes in i have come at the letter brought her from miss howe today plot conjuration sorcery witchcraft all going forward i shall not be able to see this miss harlowe with patience as the nymphs below ask so do i why is night necessary and sally and polly upbraidingly remind me of my first attempts upon themselves yet force answers not my end and yet it may if there be truth in that part of the libertines creed that once subdued is always subdued and what woman answers affirmatively to the question she is returned but refuses to admit me and insists upon having the day to herself dorcas tells me that she believes her denial is from motives of piety oons jack is there impiety in seeing me would it not be the highest act of piety to reclaim me and is this to be done by her refusing to see me when she is in a devouter frame than usual but i hate her hate her heartily she is old ugly and deformed but o the blasphemy yet she is a harlowe and i do and can hate her for that but since i must not see her she will be mistress of her own will and of her time truly let me fill up my time by telling thee what i have come at the first letter the women met with is dated april where can she have put the preceding ones it mentions mr hickman as a busy fellow between them hickman had best take care of himself she says in it i hope you have no cause to repent returning my norris it is forthcoming on demand now what the devil can this mean her norris forthcoming on demand the devil take me if i am outnorrisd if such innocents can allow themselves to plot to norris well may i see vol iv letter ii she is sorry that her hannah cant be with her and what if she could what could hannah do for her in such a house as this the women in the house are to be found out in one breakfasting the women are enraged at both the correspondents for this and more than ever make a point of my subduing her i had a good mind to give miss howe to them in full property say but the word jack and it shall be done she is glad that miss harlowe had thoughts of taking me at my word she wondered i did not offer again advises her if i dont soon not to stay with me cautions her to keep me at a distance not to permit the least familiarity see jack see belford exactly as i thought her vigilance all owing to a cool friend who can sit down quietly and give that advice which in her own case she could not take what an encouragement to me to proceed in my devices when i have reason to think that my beloveds reserves are owing more to miss howes cautions than to her own inclinations but it is my interest to be honest miss howe tells her interest fools i thought these girls knew that my interest was ever subservient to my pleasure what would i give to come at the copies of the letters to which those of miss howe are answers the next letter is dated may in this the little termagant expresses her astonishment that her mother should write to miss harlowe to forbid her to correspond with her daughter mr hickman she says is of opinion that she ought not to obey her mother how the creeping fellow trims between both i am afraid that i must punish him as well as this virago and i have a scheme rumbling in my head that wants but half an hours musing to bring into form that will do my business upon both i cannot bear that the parental authority should be thus despised thus trampled under foot but observe the vixen tis well he is of her opinion for her mother having set her up she must have somebody to quarrel with could a lovelace have allowed himself a greater license this girls a devilish rake in her heart had she been a man and one of us shed have outdone us all in enterprise and spirit see vol iv letter x she wants but very little farther provocation she says to fly privately to london and if she does she will not leave her till she sees her either honourably married or quit of the wretch here jack the transcriber sally has added a prayer for the lords sake dear mr lovealce get this fury to london her fate i can tell thee jack if we had her among us should not be so long deciding as her friends what a gantelope would she run when i had done with her among a dozen of her own pitiless sex whom my charmer shall never see but more of this anon i find by this letter that my saucy captive has been drawing the characters of every varlet of ye nor am i spared in it more than you the mans a fool to be sure my dear let me perish if they either of them find me one a silly fellow at least cursed contemptible i see not but they are a set of infernals theres one for thee lovelace and yet she would have her friend marry a beelzebub and what have any of us done within the knowledge of miss harlowe that she should give such an account of us as should excuse so much abuse from miss howe but the occasion that shall warrant this abuse is to come she blames her for not admitting miss partington to her bed watchful as you are what could have happened if violence were intended he would not stay for the night i am ashamed to have this hinted to me by this virago sally writes upon this hint see sir what is expected from you an hundred and an hundred times have we told you of this and so they have but to be sure the advice from them was not half the efficacy as it will be from miss howe you might have sat up after her or not gone to bed proceeds she but can there be such apprehensions between them yet the one advise her to stay and the other resolve to wait my imperial motion for marriage i am glad i know that she approves of my proposal of mrs fretchvilles house she puts her upon expecting settlements upon naming a day and concludes with insisting upon her writing notwithstanding her mothers prohibitions or bids her take the consequence undutiful wretches how i long to vindicate against them both the insulted parental character thou wilt say to thyself by this time and can this proud and insolent girl be the same miss howe who sighed for an honest sir george colmar and who but for this her beloved friend would have followed him in all his broken fortunes when he was obliged to quit the kingdom yes she is the very same and i always found in others as well as in myself that a first passion thoroughly subdued made the conqueror of it a rover the conqueress a tyrant well but now comes mincing in a letter from one who has the honour of dear miss howes commands to acquaint miss harlowe that miss howe is excessively concerned for the concern she has given her see vol iv letter xii i have great temptations on this occasion says the prim gothamite to express my own resentments upon your present state my own resentmentsand why did he not fall into this temptation why truly because he knew not what that state was which gave him so tempting a subject only by a conjecture and so forth he then dances in his style as he does in his gait to be sure to be sure he must have made the grand tour and come home by way of tipperary and being moreover forbid says the prancer to enter into the cruel subject this prohibition was a mercy to thee friend hickman but why cruel subject if thou knowest not what it is but conjecturest only from the disturbance it gives to a girl that is her mothers disturbance will be thy disturbance and the disturbance in turn of every body with whom she is intimately acquainted unless i have the humbling of her in another letter the little fury professes that she will write and that no man shall write for her as if some medium of that kind had been proposed she approves of her fair friends intention to leave me if she can be received by her relations i am a wretch a foolish wretch she hates me for my teasing ways she has just made an acquaintance with one who knows a vast deal of my private history a curse upon her and upon her historiographer the man is really a villain an execrable one devil take her had i a dozen lives i might have forfeited them all twenty crimes ago an odd way of reckoning jack see letter xxiii of this volume miss betterton miss lockyer are named the man she irreverently repeats she again calls a villain let me perish i repeat if i am called a villain for nothing she will have her uncle as miss harlowe requests sounded about receiving her dorcas is to be attached to her interest my letters are to be come at by surprise or trick what thinkest thou of this jack miss howe is alarmed at my attempt to come at a letter of hers were i to come at the knowledge of her freedoms with my character she says she should be afraid to stir out without a guard i would advise the vixen to get her guard ready i am at the head of a gang of wretches thee jack and thy brother varlets she owns she means who join together to betray innocent creatures and to support one another in their villanies what sayest thou to this belford she wonders not at her melancholy reflections for meeting me for being forced upon me and tricked by me i hope jack thoult have done preaching after this but she comforts her that she will be both a warning and an example to all her sex i hope the sex will thank me for this the nymphs had not time they say to transcribe all that was worthy of my resentment in this letter so i must find an opportunity to come at it myself noble rant they say it contains but i am a seducer and a hundred vile fellows in it and the devil it seems took possession of my heart and of the hearts of all her friends in the same dark hour in order to provoke her to meet me again there is a fate in her error she says why then should she grieve adversity is her shining time and i cant tell what yet never to thank the man to whom she owes the shine in the next letter wicked as i am she fears i must be her lord and master see letter xxix of this volume i hope so she retracts what she said against me in her last my behaviour to my rosebud miss harlowe to take possession of mrs fretchvilles house i to stay at mrs sinclairs the stake i have in my country my reversions my economy my person my address something like in all this are brought in my favour to induce her now not to leave me how do i love to puzzle these longsighted girls yet my teasing ways it seems are intolerable are women only to tease i trow the sex may thank themselves for teaching me to outtease them so the headstrong charles xii of sweden taught the czar peter to beat him by continuing a war with the muscovites against the ancient maxims of his kingdom may eternal vengeance pursue the villain thank heaven she does not say overtake if he give room to doubt his honour women cant swear jack sweet souls they can only curse i am said to doubt her love have i not reason and she to doubt my ardour ardour jack why tis very right women as miss howe says and as every rake knows love ardours she apprizes her of the ill success of the application made to her uncle by hickman no doubt i must have this fellows ears in my pocket very quickly i believe she says she is equally shocked and enraged against all her family mrs nortons weight has been tried upon mrs harlowe as well as mr hickmans upon the uncle but never were there says the vixen such determined brutes in the world her uncle concludes her ruined already is not that a call upon me as well as a reproach they all expected applications from her when in distress but were resolved not to stir an inch to save her life miss howe is concerned she tells her for the revenge my pride may put me upon taking for the distance she has kept me at and well she may it is now evident to her that she must be mine for her cousin morden it seems is set against her too an act of necessity of convenience thy friend jack to be already made a womans convenience is this to be borne by a lovelace i shall make great use of this letter from miss howes hints of what passed between her uncle harlowe and hickman it must be hickman i can give room for my invention to play for she tells her that she will not reveal all i must endeavour to come at this letter myself i must have the very words extracts will not do this letter when i have it must be my compass to steer by the fire of friendship then blazes and crackles i never before imagined that so fervent a friendship could subsist between two sisterbeauties both toasts but even here it may be inflamed by opposition and by that contradiction which gives vigour to female spirits of a warm and romantic turn she raves about coming up if by doing so she could prevent so noble a creature from stooping too low or save her from ruin one reed to support another i think i will contrive to bring her up how comes it to pass that i cannot help being pleased with this viragos spirit though i suffer by it had i her but here id engage in a weeks time to teach her submission without reserve what pleasure should i have in breaking such a spirit i should wish for her but for one month i think she would be too tame and spiritless for me after that how sweetly pretty to see the two lovely friends when humbled and tame both sitting in the darkest corner of a room arm in arm weeping and sobbing for each other and i their emperor their then acknowledged emperor reclined at my ease in the same room uncertain to which i should first grand signor like throw out my handkerchief again mind the girl she is enraged at the harlowes she is angry at her own mother she is exasperated against her foolish and lowvanityd lovelace foolish a little toad god forgive me for calling such a virtuous girl a toad let us stoop to lift the wretch out of his dirt though we soil our fingers in doing it he has not been guilty of direct indecency to you it seems extraordinary to miss howe that i have not nor dare he she should be sure of that if women have such things in their heads why should not i in my heart not so much of a devil as that comes to neither such villainous intentions would have shown themselves before now if i had them lord help them she then puts her friend upon urging for settlements license and so forth no room for delicacy now she says and tells her what she shall say to bring all forward from me is it not as clear to thee jack as it is to me that i should have carried my point long ago but for this vixen she reproaches her for having modestyd away as she calls it more than one opportunity that she ought not to have slipt thus thou seest that the noblest of the sex mean nothing in the world by their shyness and distance but to pound the poor fellow they dislike not when he comes into their purlieus though tricked into this mans power she tells her she is not meanly subjugated to it there are hopes of my reformation it seems from my reverence for her since before her i never had any reverence for what was good i am a great a specious deceiver i thank her for this however a good moral use she says may be made of my having prevailed upon her to swerve i am glad that any good may flow from my actions annexed to this letter is a paper the most saucy that ever was written of a mother by a daughter there are in it such free reflections upon widows and bachelors that i cannot but wonder how miss howe came by her learning sir george colmar i can tell thee was a greater fool than thy friend if she had it all for nothing the contents of this paper acquaint miss harlowe that her uncle antony has been making proposals of marriage to her mother the old fellows heart ought to be a tough one if he succeed or she who broke that of a much worthier man the late mr howe will soon get rid of him but be this as it may the stupid family is made more irreconcilable than ever to their goddessdaughter for old antonys thoughts of marrying so i am more secure of her than ever and yet i believe at last that my tender heart will be moved in her favour for i did not wish that she should have nothing but persecution and distress but why loves she the brutes as miss howe justly calls them so much me so little i have still more unpardonable transcripts from other letters letter xlv mr lovelace to john belford esq the next letter is of such a nature that i dare say these proud rouges would not have had it fall into my hands for the world see letter xxxiv of this volume i see by it to what her displeasure with me in relation to my proposals was owing they were not summed up it seems with the warmth with the ardour which she had expected this whole letter was transcribed by dorcas to whose lot it fell thou shalt have copies of them all at full length shortly men of our cast this little devil says she fancies cannot have the ardours that honest men have miss howe has vey pretty fancies jack charming girl would to heaven i knew whether my fairone answers her as freely as she writes twould vex a mans heart that this virago should have come honestly by her fancies who knows but i may have half a dozen creatures to get off my hands before i engage for life yet lest this should mean me a compliment as if i would reform she adds her belief that she must not expect me to be honest on this side my grand climacteric she has an high opinion of her sex to think they can charm so long a man so well acquainted with their identicalness he to suggest delays she says from a compliment to be made to lord m yes i my dear because a man has not been accustomed to be dutiful must he never be dutiful in so important a case as this too the hearts of his whole family are engaged in it you did indeed says she want an interposing friend but were i to have been in your situation i would have torn his eyes out and left it to his heart to furnish the reason for it see see what sayest thou to this jack villain fellow that he is follow and for what only for wishing that the next day were to be my happy one and for being dutiful to my nearest relation it is the cruelest of fates she says for a woman to be forced to have a man whom her heart despises that is what i wanted to be sure of i was afraid that my beloved was too conscious of her talents of her superiority i was afraid that she indeed despises me and i cannot bear to think that she does but belford i do not intend that this lady shall be bound down to so cruel a fate let me perish if i marry a woman who has given her most intimate friend reason to say she despises me a lovelace to be despised jack his clenched fist to his forehead on your leaving him in just displeasure that is when she was not satisfied with my ardours if it please ye i remember the motion but her back was towards me at the time are these watchful ladies all eye but observe what follows i wish it had been a pollaxe and in the hands of his worst enemy she tells miss howe that she saw this motion in the pierglass see letter xxxiii of this volume i will have patience jack i will have patience my day is at hand then will i steel my heart with these remembrances but here is a scheme to be thought of in order to get my fair prize out of my hands in case i give her reason to suspect me this indeed alarms me now the contention becomes arduous now wilt thou not wonder if i let loose my plotting genius upon them both i will not be outnorrisd belford but once more she has no notion she says that i can or dare to mean her dishonour but then the man is a fool thats all i should indeed be a fool to proceed as i do and mean matrimony however since you are thrown upon a fool says she marry the fool at the first opportunity and though i doubt that this man will be the most unmanageable of fools as all witty and vain fools are take him as a punishment since you cannot as a reward is there any bearing this belford but such men as myself are the men that women do not naturally hate true as the gospel jack the truth is out at last have i not always told thee so sweet creatures and true christians these young girls they love their enemies but rakes in their hearts all of them like turns to like thats the thing were i not well assured of the truth of this observation of the vixen i should have thought it worth while if not to be a good man to be more of an hypocrite than i found it needful to be but in the letter i came at today while she was at church her scheme is further opened and a cursed one it is mr lovelace then transcribes from his shorthand notes that part of miss howes letter which relates to the design of engaging mrs townsend in case of necessity to give her protection till colonel morden come and repeats his vows of revenge especially for these words that should he attempt any thing that would make him obnoxious to the laws of society she might have a fair riddance of him either by flight or the gallows no matter which he then adds see letter xlii of this volume tis my pride to subdue girls who know too much to doubt their knowledge and to convince them that they know too little to defend themselves from the inconveniencies of knowing too much how passion drives a man on proceeds he i have written a prodigious quantity in a very few hours now my resentments are warm i will see and perhaps will punish this proud this doublearmed beauty i have sent to tell her that i must be admitted to sup with her we have neither of us dined she refused to drink tea in the afternoon and i believe neither of us will have much stomach to our supper letter xlvi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe sunday morning seven oclock i was at the play last night with mr lovelace and miss horton it is you know a deep and most affecting tragedy in the reading you have my remarks upon it in the little book you made me write upon the principal actingplays you will not wonder that miss horton as well as i was greatly moved at the representation when i tell you and have some pleasure in telling you that mr lovelace himself was very sensibly touched with some of the most affecting scenes i mention this in praise of the authors performance for i take mr lovelace to be one of the most hardhearted men in the world upon my word my dear i do his behaviour however on this occasion and on our return was unexceptionable only that he would oblige me to stay to supper with the women below when we came back and to sit up with him and them till near one oclock this morning i was resolved to be even with him and indeed i am not very sorry to have the pretence for i love to pass the sundays by myself to have the better excuse to avoid his teasing i am ready dressed to go to church this morning i will go only to st jamess church and in a chair that i may be sure i can go out and come in when i please without being intruded upon by him as i was twice before near nine oclock i have your kind letter of yesterday he knows i have and i shall expect that he will be inquisitive next time i see him after your opinions of his proposals i doubted not your approbation of them and had written an answer on that presumption which is ready for him he must study for occasions of procrastination and to disoblige me if now any thing happens to set us at variance again he is very importunate to see me he has desired to attend me to church he is angry that i have declined to breakfast with him i am sure that i should not have been at my own liberty if i had i bid dorcas tell him that i desired to have this day to myself i would see him in the morning as early as he pleased she says she knows not what ails him but that he is out of humour with every body he has sent again in a peremptory manner he warns me of singleton i sent him word that if he was not afraid of singleton at the playhouse last night i need not at church today so many churches to one playhouse i have accepted of his servants proposed attendance but he is quite displeased it seems i dont care i will not be perpetually at his insolent beck adieu my dear till i return the chair waits he wont stop me sure as i go down to it i did not see him as i went down he is it seems excessively out of humour dorcas says not with me neither she believes but something has vexed him this is perhaps to make me dine with him but i will not if i can help it i shant get rid of him for the rest of the day if i do he was very earnest to dine with me but i was resolved to carry this one small point and so denied to dine myself and indeed i was endeavouring to write to my cousin morden and had begun three different times without being able to please myself he was very busy in writing dorcas says and pursued it without dining because i denied him my company h afterwards demanded as i may say to be admitted to afternoontea with me and appealed by dorcas to his behaviour to me last night as if i sent him word by her he thought he had a merit in being unexceptionable however i repeated my promise to meet him as early as he pleased in the morning or to breakfast with him dorcas says he raved i heard him loud and i heard his servant fly from him as i thought you my dearest friend say in one of yours that you must have somebody to be angry at when your mother sets you up i should be very loth to draw comparisons but the workings of passion when indulged are but too much alike whether in man or woman see letter x of this volume parag he has just sent me word that he insists upon supping with me as we had been in a good train for several days past i thought it not prudent to break with him for little matters yet to be in a manner threatened into his will i know not how to bear that while i was considering he came up and tapping at my door told me in a very angry tone he must see me this night he could not rest till he had been told what he had done to deserve the treatment i gave him treatment i gave him a wretch yet perhaps he has nothing new to say to me i shall be very angry with him as the lady could not know what mr lovelaces designs were nor the cause of his ill humour it will not be improper to pursue the subject from his lette having described his angry manner of demanding in person her company at supper he proceeds as follows tis hard answered the fair perverse that i am to be so little my own mistress i will meet you in the diningroom half an hour hence i went down to wait the half hour all the women set me hard to give her cause for this tyranny they demonstrated as well from the nature of the sex as of the case that i had nothing to hope for from my tameness and could meet with no worse treatment were i to be guilty of the last offence they urge me vehemently to try at least what effect some greater familiarities than i had ever taken with her would have and their arguments being strengthened by my just resentments on the discoveries i had made i was resolved to take some liberties as they were received to take still greater and lay all the fault upon her tyranny in this humour i went up and never had paralytic so little command of his joints as i had while i walked about the diningroom attending her motions with an erect mien she entered her face averted her lovely bosom swelling and the more charmingly protuberant for the erectness of her mien o jack that sullenness and reserve should add to the charms of this haughty maid but in every attitude in every humour in every gesture is beauty beautiful by her averted face and indignant aspect i saw the dear insolent was disposed to be angry but by the fierceness of mine as my trembling hand seized hers i soon made fear her predominant passion and yet the moment i beheld her my heart was dastardized and my reverence for the virgin purity so visible in her whole deportment again took place surely belford this is an angel and yet had she not been known to be a female they would not from babyhood have dressed her as such nor would she but upon that conviction have continued the dress let me ask you madam i beseech you tell me what i have done to deserve this distant treatment and let me ask you mr lovelace why are my retirements to be thus invaded what can you have to say to me since last night that i went with you so much against my will to the play and after sitting up with you equally against my will till a very late hour this i have to say madam that i cannot bear to be kept at this distance from you under the same roof under the same roof sir how came you hear me out madam letting go her trembling hands and snatching them back again with an eagerness that made her start i have a thousand things to say to talk of relating to our present and future prospects but when i want to open my whole soul to you you are always contriving to keep me at a distance you make me inconsistent with myself your heart is set upon delays you must have views that you will not own tell me madam i conjure you to tell me this moment without subterfuge or reserve in what light am i to appear to you in future i cannot bear this distance the suspense you hold me in i cannot bear in what light mr lovelace visibly terrified in no bad light i hope pray mr lovelace do not grasp my hands so hard endeavouring to withdraw them pray let me go you hate me madam i hate nobody sir you hate me madam repeated i instigated and resolved as i came up i wanted some new provocation the devil indeed as soon as my angel made her appearance crept out of my heart but he had left the door open and was no farther off than my elbow you come up in no good temper i see mr lovelace but pray be not violent i have done you no hurt pray be not violent sweet creature and i clasped one arm about her holding one hand in my other you have done me no hurt i could have devoured her but restraining myself you have done me the greatest hurt in what have i deserved the distance you keep me at i knew not what to say she struggled to disengage herself pray mr lovelace let me withdraw i know not why this is i know not what i have done to offend you i see you are come with a design to quarrel with me if you would not terrify me by the ill humour you are in permit me to withdraw i will hear all you have to say another time tomorrow morning as i sent you word but indeed you frighten me i beseech you if you have any value for me permit me to withdraw night midnight is necessary belford surprise terror must be necessary to the ultimate trial of this charming creature say the women below what they will i could not hold my purposes this was not the first time that i had intended to try if she could forgive i kissed her hand with a fervour as if i would have left my lips upon it withdraw then dearest and everdear creature indeed i entered in a very ill humour i cannot bear the distance at which you so causelessly keep me withdraw madam since it is your will to withdraw and judge me generously judge me but as i deserve to be judged and let me hope to meet you tomorrow morning early in such a temper as becomes our present situation and my future hopes and so saying i conducted her to the door and left her there but instead of going down to the women i went into my own chamber and locked myself in ashamed of being awed by her majestic loveliness and apprehensive virtue into so great a change of purpose notwithstanding i had such just provocations from the letters of her saucy friend formed on her own representations of facts and situations between herself and me the lady dated sunday night thus describes her terrors and mr lovelaces behaviour on the occasion on my entering the diningroom he took my hand in his in such a humour i saw plainly he was resolved to quarrel with me and for what what had i done to him i never in my life beheld in any body such wild such angry such impatient airs i was terrified and instead of being as angry as i intended to be i was forced to be all mildness i can hardly remember what were his first words i was so frighted but you hate me madam you hate me madam were some of them with such a fierceness i wished myself a thousand miles distant from him i hate nobody said i i thank god i hate nobody you terrify me mr lovelace let me leave you the man my dear looked quite ugly i never saw a man look so ugly as passion made him look and for what and so he grasped my hands fierce creature he so grasped my hands in short he seemed by his looks and by his words once putting his arms about me to wish me to provoke him so that i had nothing to do but to beg of him which i did repeatedly to permit me to withdraw and to promise to meet him at his own time in the morning it was with a very ill grace that he complied on that condition and at parting he kissed my hand with such a savageness that a redness remains upon it still do you not think my dear that i have reason to be incensed at him my situation considered am i not under a necessity as it were of quarrelling with him at least every other time i see him no prudery no coquetry no tyranny in my heart or in my behaviour to him that i know of no affected procrastination aiming at nothing but decorum he as much concerned and so he ought to think as i to have that observed too much in his power cast upon him by the cruelty of my relations no other protection to fly to but his one plain path before us yet such embarrasses such difficulties such subjects for doubt for cavil for uneasiness as fast as one is obviated another to be introduced and not by myself know not how introduced what pleasure can i propose to myself in meeting such a wretch perfect for me my dearest miss howe perfect for me i beseech you your kind scheme with mrs townsend and i will then leave this man my temper i believe is changed no wonder if it be i question whether ever it will be what it was but i cannot make him half so uneasy by the change as i am myself see you not how from step to step he grows upon me i tremble to look back upon his encroachments and now to give me cause to apprehend more evil from him than indignation will permit me to express o my dear perfect your scheme and let me fly from so strange a wretch yet to be first an eloper from my friends to him as the world supposes and now to be so from him to whom i know not how hard to one who ever endeavoured to shun intricate paths but he must certainly have views in quarrelling with me thus which he dare not own yet what can they be i am terrified but to think of what they may be let me but get from him as to my reputation if i leave him that is already too much wounded for me now to be careful about any thing but how to act so as that my own heart shall not reproach me as to the worlds censure i must be content to suffer that an unhappy composition however what a wreck have my fortunes suffered to be obliged to throw overboard so many valuables to preserve indeed the only valuable a composition that once it would have half broken my heart to think there would have been the least danger that i should be obliged to submit to you my dear could not be a stranger to my most secret failings although you would not tell me of them what a pride did i take in the applause of every one what a pride even in supposing i had not that pride which concealed itself from my unexamining heart under the specious veil of humility doubling the merit to myself by the supposed and indeed imputed gracefulness in the manner of conferring benefits when i had not a single merit in what i did vastly overpaid by the pleasure of doing some little good and impelled as i may say by talents given me for what not to be proud of so desirous in short to be considered as an example a vanity which my partial admirers put into my head and so secure in my own virtue i am punished enough enough mortified for this my vanity i hope enough if it so please the allgracious inflictor since now i verily think i more despise myself for my presumptuous selfsecurity as well as vanity than ever i secretly vaunted myself on my good inclinations secretly i say however for indeed i had not given myself leisure to reflect till i was thus mortified how very imperfect i was nor how much truth there is in what divines tell us that we sin in our best performances but i was very young but here let me watch over myself again for in those four words i was very young is there not a palliation couched that were enough to take all efficacy from the discovery and confession what strange imperfect beings but self here which is at the bottom of all we do and of all we wish is the grand misleader i will not apologize to you my dear for these grave reflections is it not enough to make the unhappy creature look into herself and endeavour to detect herself who from such a high reputation left to proud and presumptuous self should by one thoughtless step be brought to the dreadful situation i am in let me however look forward to despond would be to add sin to sin and whom have i to raise me up whom to comfort me if i desert myself thou o father who i hope hast not yet deserted hast not yet cursed me for i am thine it is fit that mediation should supply the rest i was so disgusted with him as well as frighted by him that on my return to my chamber in a fit of passionate despair i tore almost in two the answer i had written to his proposals i will see him in the morning because i promised i would but i will go out and that without him or any attendant if he account not tolerably for his sudden change of behaviour and a proper opportunity offer of a private lodging in some creditable house i will not any more return to this at present i think so and there will i either attend the perfecting of your scheme or by your epistolary mediation make my own terms with the wretch since it is your opinion that i must be his and cannot help myself or perhaps take a resolution to throw myself at once into lady bettys protection and this will hinder him from making his insolentlythreatened visit to harloweplace the lady writes again on monday evening and gives her friend an account of all that passed between herself and mr lovelace that day and of her being terrified out of her purpose of going out but mr lovelaces next letters giving a more ample account of all hers are omitted it is proper however to mention that she reurges miss howe from the dissatisfaction she has reason for from what passed between mr lovelace and herself to perfect her scheme in relation to mrs townsend she concludes this letter in these words i should say something of your last favour but a few hours ago received and of your dialogue with your mother are you not very whimsical my dear i have but two things to wish for on this occasion the one that your charming pleasantry had a better subject than that you find for it in this dialogue the other that my situation were not such as must too often damp that pleasantry in you and will not permit me to enjoy it as i used to do be however happy in yourself though you cannot in your clarissa harlowe letter xlvii mr lovelace to john belford esq monday morning may no generosity in this lady none at all wouldst thou not have thought that after i had permitted her to withdraw primed for mischief as i was she would meet me next morning early and that with a smile making me one of her best courtesies i was in the diningroom before six expecting her she opened not her door i went up stairs and down and hemmd and called will called dorcas threw the doors hard to but still she opened not her door thus till half an hour after eight fooled i away my time and then breakfast ready i sent dorcas to request her company but i was astonished when following the wench as she did at the first invitation i saw her enter dressed all but her gloves and those and her fan in her hand in the same moment bidding dorcas direct will to get her a chair to the door cruel creature thought i to expose me thus to the derision of the women below going abroad madam i am sir i looked cursed silly i am sure you will breakfast first i hope madam and a very humble strain yet with an hundred tender looks in my heart had she given me more notice of her intention i had perhaps wrought myself up to the frame i was in the day before and begun my vengeance and immediately came into my head all the virulence that had been transcribed for me from miss howes letters and in that letter which i had transcribed myself yes she would drink one dish and then laid her gloves and fan in the window just by i was perfectly disconcerted i hemmd and was going to speak several times but i knew not in what key whos modest now thought i whos insolent now how a tyrant of a woman confounds a bashful man she was acting miss howe i thought and i the spiritless hickman at last i will begin thought i she a dish i a dish sip her eyes her own she like a haughty and imperious sovereign conscious of dignity every look a favour sip like her vassal i lips and hands trembling and not knowing that i sippd or tasted i was i was i sippd drawing in my breath and the liquor together though i scalded my mouth with it i was in hopes madam dorcas came in just then dorcas said she is a chair gone for damnd impertinence thought i thus to put me out in my speech and i was forced to wait for the servants answer to the insolent mistresss question william is gone for one madam this cost me a minutes silence before i could begin again and then it was with my hopes and my hopes and my hopes that i should have been early admitted to what weather is it dorcas said she as regardless of me as if i had not been present a little lowering madam the sun is gone in it was very fine half an hour ago i had no patience up i rose down went the teacup saucer and all confound the weather the sunshine and the wench begone for a devil when i am speaking to your lady and have so little opportunity given me up rose the saucyface halffrighted and snatched from the window her gloves and fan you must not go madam seizing her hand by my soul you must not must not sir but i must you can curse your maid in my absence as well as if i were presentexcept except you intend for me what you direct to her dearest creature you must not go you must not leave me such determined scorn such contempts questions asked your servant of no meaning but to break in upon me i cannot bear it detain me not struggling i will not be withheld i like you not nor your ways you sought to quarrel with me yesterday for no reason in the world that i can think of but because i was too obliging you are an ungrateful man and i hate you with my whole heart mr lovelace do not make me desperate madam permit me to say that you shall not leave me in this humour wherever you go i will attend you had miss howe been my friend i had not been thus treated it is but too plain to whom my difficulties are owing i have long observed that every letter you received from her makes an alteration in your behaviour to me she would have you treat me as she treats mr hickman i suppose but neither does that treatment become your admirable temper to offer nor me to receive this startled her she did not care to have me think hardly of miss howe but recollecting herself miss howe said she is a friend to virtue and to good men if she like not you it is because you are not one of those yes madam and therefore to speak of mr hickman and myself as you both i suppose think of each she treats him as she would not treat a lovelace i challenge you madam to shew me but one of the many letters you have received from her where i am mentioned miss howe is just miss howe is good replied she she writes she speaks of every body as they deserve if you point me out but any one occasion upon which you have reason to build a merit to yourself as either just or good or even generous i will look out for her letter on that occasion if such an occasion there be i have certainly acquainted her with it and will engage it shall be in your favour devilish severe and as indelicate as severe to put a modish man upon hunting backward after his own merits she would have flung from me i will not be detained mr lovelace i will go out indeed you must not madam in this humour and i placed myself between her and the doorand then fanning she threw herself into a chair her sweet face all crimsoned over with passion i cast myself at her feet begone mr lovelace said she with a rejecting motion her fan in her hand for your own sake leave me my soul is above thee man with both her hands pushing me from her urge me not to tell thee how sincerely i think my soul above thee thou hast in mine a proud a too proud heart to contend with leave me and leave me for ever thou has a proud heart to contend with her air her manner her voice were bewitchingly noble though her words were so severe let me worship an angel said i no woman forgive me dearest creature creature if you be forgive me forgive my inadvertencies forgive my inequalities pity my infirmities who is equal to my clarissa i trembled between admiration and love and wrapt my arms about her knees as she sat she tried to rise at the moment but my clasping round her thus ardently drew her down again and never was woman more affrighted but free as my clasping emotion might appear to her apprehensive heart i had not at the instant any thought but what reverence inspired and till she had actually withdrawn which i permitted under promise of a speedy return and on her consent to dismiss the chair all the motions of my heart were as pure as her own she kept not her word an hour i waited before i sent to claim her promise she could not possibly see me yet was her answer as soon as she could she would dorcas says she still excessively trembled and ordered her to give her hartshorn and water a strange apprehensive creature her terror is too great for the occasion evils are often greater in apprehension than in reality hast thou never observed that the terrors of a bird caught and actually in the hand bear no comparison to what we might have supposed those terrors would be were we to have formed a judgment of the same bird by its shyness before it was taken dear creature did she never romp did she never from girlhood to now hoyden the innocent kinds of freedom taken and allowed on these occasions would have familiarized her to greater sacrilege but to touch the hem of her garment excess of delicacy o the consecrated beauty how can she think to be a wife but how do i know till i try whether she may not by a less alarming treatment be prevailed upon or whether day i have done with thee she may not yield to nightly surprises this is still the burden of my song i can marry her when i will and if i do after prevailing whether by surprise or by reluctant consent whom but myself shall i have injured it is now eleven oclock she will see me as soon as she can she tells polly horton who made her a tender visit and to whom she is less reserved than to any body else her emotion she assures her was not owing to perverseness to nicety to ill humour but to weakness of heart she has not strength of mind sufficient she says to enable her to support her condition yet what a contradiction weakness of heart says she with such a strength of will o belford she is a lionhearted lady in every case where her honour her punctilio rather calls for spirit but i have had reason more than once in her case to conclude that the passions of the gentle slower to be moved than those of the quick are the most flaming the most irresistible when raised yet her charming body is not equally organized the unequal partners pull two ways and the divinity within her tears her silken frame but had the same soul informed a masculine body never would there have been a truer hero monday two oclock not yet visible my beloved is not well what expectations had she from my ardent admiration of her more rudeness than revenge apprehended yet how my soul thirsts for revenge upon both these ladies i must have recourse to my masterstrokes this cursed project of miss howe and her mrs townsend if i cannot contrive t render it abortive will be always a sword hanging over my head upon every little disobligations my beloved will be for taking wing and the pains i have taken to deprive her of every other refuge or protection in order to make her absolutely dependent upon me will be all thrown away but perhaps i shall find out a smuggler to counterplot miss howe thou remembrest the contention between the sun and the northwind in the fable which should first make an honest traveller throw off his cloak boreas began first he puffed away most vehemently and often made the poor fellow curve and stagger but with no other effect than to cause him to wrap his surtout the closer about him but when it came to phoebuss turn he so played upon the traveller with his beams that he made him first unbutton and then throw it quite off nor left he till he obliged him to take to the friendly shade of a spreading beech where prostrating himself on the thrownoff cloak he took a comfortable nap the victorgod then laughed outright both at boreas and the traveller and pursued his radiant course shining upon and warming and cherishing a thousand new objects as he danced along and at night when he put up his fiery coursers he diverted his thetis with the relation of his pranks in the passed day i in like manner will discard all my boisterous inventions and if i can oblige my sweet traveller to throw aside but for one moment the cloak of her rigid virtue i shall have nothing to do but like the sun to bless new objects with my rays but my chosen hours of conversation and repose after all my peregrinations will be devoted to my goddess and now belford according to my new system i think this house of mrs fretchville an embarrass upon me i will get rid of it for some time at least mennell when i am out shall come to her inquiring for me what for thoult ask what for hast thou not heard what has befallen poor mrs fretchville then ill tell thee one of her maids about a week ago was taken with the smallpox the rest kept their mistress ignorant of it till friday and then she came to know of it by accident the greater half of the plagues poor mortals of condition are tormented with proceed from the servants they take partly for show partly for use and with a view to lessen their cares this has so terrified the widow that she is taken with all the symptoms that threaten an attack from that dreadful enemy of fair faces so must not think of removing yet cannot expect that we should be further delayed on her account she now wishes with all her heart that she had known her own mind and gone into the country at first when i treated about the house this evil then had not happened a cursed cross accident for us too heighho nothing else i think in this mortal life people need not study to bring crosses upon themselves by their petulancies so this affair of the house will be over at least for one while but then i can fall upon an expedient which will make amends for this disappointment i must move slow in order to be sure i have a charming contrivance or two in my head even supposing my beloved should get away to bring her back again but what is become of lord m i trow that he writes not to me in answer to my invitation if he would send me such a letter as i could show it might go a great way towards a perfect reconciliation i have written to charlotte about it he shall soon hear from me and that in a way he wont like if he writes not quickly he has sometimes threatened to disinherit me but if i should renounce him it would be but justice and would vex him ten times more than any thing he can do will vex me then the settlements unavoidably delayed by his neglect how shall i bear such a life of procrastination i who as to my will and impatience and so forth am of the true ladymake and can as little bear controul and disappointment as the best of them another letter from miss howe i suppose it is that which she promises in her last to send her relating to the courtship between old tony the uncle and annabella the mother i should be extremely rejoiced to see it no more of the smugglerplot in it surely this letter it seems she has put in her pocket but i hope i shall soon find it deposited with the rest monday morning at my repeated request she condescended to meet me in the diningroom to afternoontea and not before she entered with bashfulness as i thought in a pretty confusion for having carried her apprehensions too far sullen and slow moved she towards the teatable dorcas present busy in teacup preparations i took her reluctant hand and pressed it to my lips dearest loveliest of creatures why this distance why this displeasure how can you thus torture the faithfullest heart in the world she disengaged her hand again i would have snatched it be quiet peevishly withdrawing it and down she sat a gentle palpitation in the beauty of beauties indicating a mingled sullenness and resentment her snowy handkerchief rising and falling and a sweet flush overspreading her charming cheeks for gods sake madam and a third time i would have taken her repulsing hand and for the same sake sir no more teasing dorcas retired i drew my chair nearer hers and with the most respectful tenderness took her hand and told her that i could not forbear to express my apprehensions from the distance she was so desirous to keep me at that if any man in the world was more indifferent to her to use no harsher word than another it was the unhappy wretch before her she looked steadily upon me for a moment and with her other hand not withdrawing that i held pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket and by a twinkling motion urged forward a tear or two which having arisen in each sweet eye it was plain by that motion she would rather have dissipated but answered me only with a sigh and an averted face i urged her to speak to look up at me to bless me with an eye more favourable i had reason she told me for my complaint of her indifference she saw nothing in my mind that was generous i was not a man to be obliged or favoured my strange behaviour to her since saturday night for no cause at all that she knew of convinced her of this whatever hopes she had conceived of me were utterly dissipated all my ways were disgustful to her this cut me to the heart the guilty i believe in every case less patiently bear the detecting truth than the innocent do the degrading falshood i bespoke her patience while i took the liberty to account for this change on my part i reacknowledged the pride of my heart which could not bear the thought of that want of preference in the heart of a lady whom i hoped to call mine which she had always manifested marriage i said was a state that was not to be entered upon with indifference on either side it is insolence interrupted she it is a presumption sir to expect tokens of value without resolving to deserve them you have no whining creature before you mr lovelace overcome by weak motives to love where there is no merit miss howe can tell you sir that i never loved the faults of my friend nor ever wished her to love me for mine it was a rule with us not to spare each other and would a man who has nothing but faults for pray sir what are your virtues expect that i should show a value for him indeed if i did i should not deserve even his value but ought to be despised by him well have you madam kept up to this noble manner of thinking you are in no danger of being despised for any marks of tenderness or favour shown to the man before you you have been perhaps youll think laudably studious of making and taking occasions to declare that it was far from being owing to your choice that you had any thoughts of me my whole soul madam in all its errors in all its wishes in all its views had been laid open and naked before you had i been encouraged by such a share in your confidence and esteem as would have secured me against your apprehended worst constructions of what i should from time to time have revealed to you and consulted you upon for never was there a franker heart nor a man so ready to accuse himself this belford is true but you know madam how much otherwise it has been between us doubt distance reserve on your part begat doubt fear awe on mine how little confidence as if we apprehended each other to be a plotter rather than a lover how have i dreaded every letter that has been brought you from wilsons and with reason since the last from which i expected so much on account of the proposals i had made you in writing has if i may judge by the effects and by your denial of seeing me yesterday though you could go abroad and in a chair too to avoid my attendance on you set you against me more than ever i was guilty it seems of going to church said the indignant charmer and without the company of a man whose choice it would not have been to go had i not gone i was guilty of desiring to have the whole sunday to myself after i had obliged you against my will at a play and after you had detained me equally to my dislike to a very late hour over night these were my faults for these i was to be punished i was to be compelled to see you and to be terrified when i did see you by the most shocking ill humour that was ever shown to a creature in my circumstances and not bound to bear it you have pretended to find free fault with my fathers temper mr lovelace but the worst that he ever showed after marriage was not in the least to be compared to what you have shown twenty times beforehand and what are my prospects with you at the very best my indignation rises against you mr lovelace while i speak to you when i recollect the many instances equally ungenerous and unpolite of your behaviour to one whom you have brought into distress and i can hardly bear you in my sight she turned from me standing up and lifting up her folded hands and charming eyes swimming in tears o my father said the inimitable creature you might have spared your heavy curse had you known how i have been punished ever since my swerving feet led me out of your gardendoors to meet this man then sinking into her chair a burst of passionate tears forced their way down her glowing cheeks my dearest life taking her still folded hands in mine who can bear an invocation so affecting though so passionate and as i hope to live my nose tingled as i once when a boy remember it did and indeed once more very lately just before some tears came into my eyes and i durst hardly trust my face in view of hers what have i done to deserve this impatient exclamation have i at any time by word by deeds by looks given you cause to doubt my honour my reverence my adoration i may call it of your virtues all is owing to misapprehension i hope on both sides condescend to clear up but your part as i will mine and all must speedily be happy would to heaven i loved that heaven as i love you and yet if i doubted a return in love let me perish if i should know how to wish you mine give me hope dearest creature give me but hope that i am your preferable choice give me but hope that you hate me not that you do not despise me o mr lovelace we have been long enough together to be tired of each others humours and ways ways and humours so different that perhaps you ought to dislike me as much as i do you i think i think that i cannot make an answerable return to the value you profess for me my temper is utterly ruined you have given me an ill opinion of all mankind of yourself in particular and withal so bad a one of myself that i shall never be able to look up having utterly and for ever lost all that selfcomplacency and conscious pride which are so necessary to carry a woman through this life with tolerable satisfaction to herself she paused i was silent by my soul thought i this sweet creature will at last undo me she proceeded what now remains but that you pronounce me free of all obligation to you and that you hinder me not from pursuing the destiny that shall be allotted me again she paused i was still silent meditating whether to renounce all further designs upon her whether i had not received sufficient evidence of a virtue and of a greatness of soul that could not be questioned or impeached she went on propitious to me be your silence mr lovelace tell me that i am free of all obligation to you you know i never made you promises you know that you are not under any to me my broken fortunes i matter not she was proceeding my dearest life said i i have been all this time though you fill me with doubts of your favour busy in the nuptial preparations i am actually in treaty for equipage equipage sir trappings tinsel what is equipage what is life what is any thing to a creature sunk so low as i am in my own opinion labouring under a fathers curse unable to look backward without self reproach or forward without terror these reflections strengthened by every cross accident and what but cross accidents befal me all my darling schemes dashed in pieces all my hopes at an end deny me not the liberty to refuge myself in some obscure corner where neither the enemies you have made me nor the few friends you have left me may ever hear of the supposed rashone till those happy moments are at hand which shall expiate for all i had not a word to say for myself such a war in my mind had i never known gratitude and admiration of the excellent creature before me combating with villanous habit with resolutions so premeditatedly made and with view so much gloried in an hundred new contrivances in my head and in my heart that to be honest as it is called must all be given up by a heart delighting in intrigue and difficulty miss howes virulences endeavoured to be recollected yet recollection refusing to bring them forward with the requisite efficacy i had certainly been a lost man had not dorcas come seasonably in with a letter on the superscription written be pleased sir to open it now i retired to the window opened it it was from dorcas herself these the contents be pleased to detain my lady a paper of importance to transcribe i will cough when i have done i put the paper in my pocket and turned to my charmer less disconcerted as she by that time had also a little recovered herself one favour dearest creature let me but know whether miss howe approves or disapproves of my proposals i know her to be my enemy i was intending to account to you for the change of behaviour you accused me of at the beginning of the conversation but was diverted from it by your vehemence indeed my beloved creature you were very vehement do you think it must not be matter of high regret to me to find my wishes so often delayed and postponed in favour of your predominant view to a reconciliation with relations who will not be reconciled to you to this was owing your declining to celebrate our nuptials before we came to town though you were so atrociously treated by your sister and your whole family and though so ardently pressed to celebrate by me to this was owing the ready offence you took at my four friends and at the unavailing attempt i made to see a dropt letter little imagining from what two such ladies could write to each other that there could be room for mortal displeasure to this was owing the weeks distance you held me at till you knew the issue of another application but when they had rejected that when you had sent my coldreceived proposals to miss howe for her approbation or advice as indeed i advised and had honoured me with your company at the play on saturday night my whole behaviour unobjectionable to the last hour must not madam the sudden change in your conduct the very next morning astonish and distress me and this persisted in with still stronger declarations after you had received the impatientlyexpected letter from miss howe must i not conclude that all was owing to her influence and that some other application or project was meditating that made it necessary to keep me again at a distance till the result were known and which was to deprive me of you for ever for was not that your constantlyproposed preliminary well madam might i be wrought up to a halfphrensy by this apprehension and well might i charge you with hating me and now dearest creature let me know i once more ask you what is miss howes opinion of my proposals were i disposed to debate with you mr lovelace i could very easily answer your fine harangue but at present i shall only say that your ways have been very unaccountable you seem to me if your meanings were always just to have taken great pains to embarrass them whether owing in you to the want of a clear head or a sound heart i cannot determine but it is to the want of one of them i verily think that i am to ascribe the greatest part of your strange conduct curse upon the heart of the little devil said i who instigates you to think so hardly of the faithfullest heart in the world how dare you sir and there she stopt having almost overshot herself as i designed she should how dare i what madam and i looked with meaning how dare i what vile man and do you and there again she stopt do i what madam and why vile man how dare you curse any body in my presence o the sweet receder but that was not to go off so with a lovelace why then dearest creature is there any body that instigates you if there be again i curse them be they whom they will she was in a charming pretty passion and this was the first time that i had the odds in my favour well madam it is just as i thought and now i know how to account for a temper that i hope is not natural to you artful wretch and is it thus you would entrap me but know sir that i received letters from nobody but miss howe miss howe likes some of your ways as little as i do for i have set every thing before her yet she is thus far your enemy as she is mine she thinks i could not refuse your offers but endeavour to make the best of my lot and now you have the truth would to heaven you were capable of dealing with equal sincerity i am madam and here on my knee i renew my vows and my supplication that you will make me yours yours for ever and let me have cause to bless you and miss howe in the same breath to say the truth belford i had before begun to think that the vixen of a girl who certainly likes not hickman was in love with me rise sir from your tooready knees and mock me not tooready knees thought i though this humble posture so little affects this proud beauty she knows not how much i have obtained of others of her sex nor how often i have been forgiven for the last attempts by kneeling mock you madam and i arose and reurged her for the day i blamed myself at the same time for the invitation i had given to lord m as it might subject me to delay from his infirmities but told her that i would write to him to excuse me if she had no objection or to give him the day she would give me and not wait for him if he could not come in time my day sir said she is never be not surprised a person of politeness judging between us would not be surprised that i say so but indeed mr lovelace and wept through impatience you either know not how to treat with a mind of the least degree of delicacy notwithstanding your birth and education or you are an ungrateful man and after a pause a worse than ungrateful one but i will retire i will see you again tomorrow i cannot before i think i hate you and if upon a reexamination of my own heart i find i do i would not for the world that matters should go on farther between us but i see i see she does not hate me how it would mortify my vanity if i thought there was a woman in the world much more this that could hate me tis evident villain as she thinks me that i should not be an odious villain if i could but at last in one instance cease to be a villain she could not hold it determined as she had thought herself i saw by her eyes the moment i endeavoured to dissipate her apprehensions on my tooready knees as she calls them the moment the rough covering my teasing behaviour has thrown over her affections is quite removed i doubt not to find all silk and silver at the bottom all soft bright and charming i was however too much vexed disconcerted mortified to hinder her from retiring and yet she had not gone if dorcas had not coughed the wench came in as soon as her lady had retired and gave me the copy she had taken and what should it be but of the answer the truly admirable creature had intended to give to my written proposals in relation to settlements i have but just dipt my pen into this affecting paper were i to read it attentively not a wink should i sleep this night tomorrow it shall obtain my serious consideration letter xlviii mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday morning may the dear creature desires to be excused seeing me till evening she is not very well as dorcas tells me read here if thou wilt the paper transcribed by dorcas it is impossible that i should proceed with my projects against this admirable woman were it not that i am resolved after a few trials more if as nobly sustained as those she has passed through to make her if she really hate me not legally mine to mr lovelace when a woman is married that supreme earthly obligation requires that in all instances where her husbands real honour is concerned she should yield her own will to his but beforehand i could be glad conformably to what i have always signified to have the most explicit assurances that every possible way should be tried to avoid litigation with my father time and patience will subdue all things my prospects of happiness are extremely contracted a husbands right will be always the same in my lifetime i could wish nothing to be done of this sort your circumstances sir will not oblige you to extort violently from him what is in his hands all that depends upon me either with regard to my person to my diversions or to the economy that no married woman of whatever rank or quality should be above inspecting shall be done to prevent a necessity for such measures being taken and if there will be no necessity for them it is to be hoped that motives less excusable will not have force motives which must be founded in a littleness of mind which a woman who has not that littleness of mind will be under such temptations as her duty will hardly be able at all times to check to despise her husband for having especially in cases where her own family so much a part of herself and which will have obligations upon her though then but secondary ones from which she can never be freed is intimately concerned this article then i urge to your most serious consideration as what lies next my heart i enter not here minutely into the fatal misunderstanding between them and you the fault may be in both but sir yours was the foundationfault at least you gave a tooplausible pretence for my brothers antipathy to work upon condescension was no part of your study you chose to bear the imputations laid to your charge rather than to make it your endeavour to obviate them but this may lead into hateful recrimination let it be remembered i will only say in this place that in their eye you have robbed them of a daughter they doated upon and that their resentments on this occasion rise but in proportion to their love and their disappointment if they were faulty in some of the measures they took while they themselves did not think so who shall judge for them you sir who will judge every body as you please and will let nobody judge you in your own particular must not be their judge it may therefore be expected that they will stand out as for myself sir i must leave it so seems it to be destined to your justice to treat me as you shall think i deserve but if your future behaviour to them is not governed by that harshsounding implacableness which you charge upon some of their tempers the splendour of your family and the excellent character of some of them of all indeed unless your own conscience furnishes you with one only exception will on better consideration do every thing with them for they may be overcome perhaps however with the more difficulty as the greatly prosperous less bear controul and disappointment than others for i will own to you that i have often in secret lamented that their great acquirements have been a snare to them perhaps as great a snare as some other accidentals have been to you which being less immediately your own gifts you have still less reason than they to value yourself upon them let me only on this subject further observe that condescension is not meanness there is a glory in yielding that hardly any violent spirit can judge of my brother perhaps is no more sensible of this than you but as you have talents which he has not who however has as i hope that regard for morals the want of which makes one of his objections to you i could wish it may not be owing to you that your mutual dislikes to each other do not subside for it is my earnest hope that in time you may see each other without exciting the fears of a wife and a sister for the consequence not that i should wish you to yield in points that truly concerned your honour no sir i would be as delicate in such as you yourself more delicate i will venture to say because more uniformly so how vain how contemptible is that pride which shows itself in standing upon diminutive observances and gives up and makes a jest of the most important duties this article being considered as i wish all the rest will be easy were i to accept of the handsome separate provision you seem to intend me added to the considerate sums arisen from my grandfathers estate since his death more considerable than perhaps you may suppose from your offer i should think it my duty to lay up for the family good and for unforseen events out of it for as to my donations i would generally confine myself in them to the tenth of my income be it what it would i aim at no glare in what i do of that sort all i wish for is the power of relieving the lame the blind the sick and the industrious poor and those whom accident has made so or sudden distress reduced the common or bred beggars i leave to others and to the public provision they cannot be lower perhaps they wish not to be higher and not able to do for every one i aim not at works of supererogation two hundred pounds a year would do all i wish to do of the separate sort for all above i would content myself to ask you except mistrusting your own economy you would give up to my management and keeping in order to provide for future contingencies a larger portion for which as your steward i would regularly account as to clothes i have particularly two suits which having been only in a manner tried on would answer for any present occasion jewels i have of my grandmothers which want only newsetting another set i have which on particular days i used to wear although these are not sent me i have no doubt being merely personals but they will when i should send for them in another name till when i should not choose to wear any as to your complaints of my diffidences and the like i appeal to your own heart if it be possible for you to make my case your own for one moment and to retrospect some parts of your behaviour words and actions whether i am not rather to be justified than censured and whether of all the men in the world avowing what you avow you ought not to think so if you do not let me admonish you sir from the very great mismatch that then must appear to be in our minds never to seek nor so much as to wish to bring about the most intimate union of interests between yourself and clarissa harlowe may the original of this charming paper as dorcas tells me was torn almost in two in one of her pets i suppose what business have the sex whose principal glory is meekness and patience and resignation to be in a passion i trow will not she who allows herself such liberties as a maiden take greater when married and a wife to be in a passion let me tell the ladies it is an impudent thing begging their pardon and as imprudent as impudent for a wife to be in a passion if she mean not eternal separation or wicked defiance by it for is it not rejecting at once all that expostulatory meekness and gentle reasoning mingled with sighs as gentle and graced with bent knees supplicating hands and eyes lifted up to your imperial countenance just running over that you should make a reconciliation speedy and as lasting as speedy even suppose the husband is in the wrong will not this being so give the greater force to her expostulation now i think of it a man should be in the wrong nowandthen to make his wife shine miss howe tells my charmer that adversity is her shining time tis a generous thing in a man to make his wife shine at his own expense to give her leave to triumph over him by patient reasoning for were he to be too imperial to acknowledge his fault on the spot she will find the benefit of her duty and submission in future and in the high opinion he will conceive of her prudence and obligingness and so by degrees she will become her masters master but for a wife to come up with kemboed arm the other hand thrown out perhaps with a pointing finger look ye here sir take notice if you are wrong ill be wrong if you are in a passion ill be in a passion rebuff for rebuff sir if you fly ill tear if you swear ill curse and the same room and the same bed shall not hold us sir for remember i am married sir i am a wife sir you cant help yourself sir your honour as well as your peace is in my keeping and if you like not this treatment you may have worse sir ah jack jack what man who has observed these things either implied or expressed in other families would wish to be a husband dorcas found this paper in one of the drawers of her ladys dressing table she was reperusing it as she supposes when the honest wench carried my message to desire her to favour me at the teatable for she saw her pop a paper into the drawer as she came in and there on her mistresss going to meet me in the diningroom she found it and to be this but i had better not to have had a copy of it as far as i know for determined as i was before upon my operations it instantly turned all my resolutions in her favour yet i would give something to be convinced that she did not pop it into her drawer before the wench in order for me to see it and perhaps if i were to take notice of it to discover whether dorcas according to miss howes advice were most my friend or hers the very suspicion of this will do her no good for i cannot bear to be artfully dealt with people love to enjoy their own peculiar talents in monopoly as arguments against me in her behalf but i know ever tittle thou canst say upon it spare therefore thy wambling nonsense i desire thee and leave this sweet excellence and me to our fate that will determine for us as it shall please itself for as cowley says an unseen hand makes all our moves and some are great and some are small some climb to good some from great fortunes fall some wise men and some fools we call figures alas of speech for destiny plays us all but after all i am sorry almost sorry for how shall i do to be quite sorry when it is not given to me to be so that i cannot until i have made further trials resolve upon wedlock i have just read over again this intended answer to my proposals and how i adore her for it but yet another yet she has not given it or sent it to me it is not therefore her answer it is not written for me though to me nay she has not intended to send it to me she has even torn it perhaps with indignation as thinking it too good for me by this action she absolutely retracts it why then does my foolish fondness seek to establish for her the same merit in my heart as if she avowed it prythee dear belford once more leave us to our fate and do not thou interpose with thy nonsense to weaken a spirit already too squeamish and strengthen a conscience that has declared itself of her party then again remember thy recent discoveries lovelace remember her indifference attended with all the appearance of contempt and hatred view her even now wrapt up in reserve and mystery meditating plots as far as thou knowest against the sovereignty thou hast by right of conquest obtained over her remember in short all thou hast threatened to remember against this insolent beauty who is a rebel to the power she has listed under but yet how dost thou propose to subdue thy sweet enemy abhorred be force be the necessity of force if that can be avoided there is no triumph in force no conquest over the will no prevailing by gentle degrees over the gentle passions force is the devil my cursed character as i have often said was against me at setting out yet is she not a woman cannot i find one yielding or but half yielding moment if she do not absolutely hate me but with what can i tempt her riches she was born to and despises knowing what they are jewels and ornaments to a mind so much a jewel and so richly set her worthy consciousness will not let her value love if she be susceptible of love it seems to be so much under the direction of prudence that one unguarded moment i fear cannot be reasonably hoped for and so much vigilance so much apprehensiveness that her fears are ever aforehand with her dangers then her love or virtue seems to be principle native principle or if not native so deeply rooted that its fibres have struck into her heart and as she grew up so blended and twisted themselves with the strings of life that i doubt there is no separating of the one without cutting the others asunder what then can be done to make such a matchless creature get over the first tests in order to put her to the grand proof whether once overcome she will not be always overcome our mother and her nymphs say i am a perfect craven and no lovelace and so i think but this is no simpering smiling charmer as i have found others to be when i have touched upon affecting subjects at a distance as once or twice i have tried to her the mother introducing them to make sex palliate the freedom to sex when only we three together she is above the affectation of not seeming to understand you she shows by her displeasure and a fierceness not natural to her eye that she judges of an impure heart by an impure mouth and darts dead at once even the embryo hopes of an encroaching lover however distantly insinuated before the meaning hint can dawn into double entendre by my faith jack as i sit gazing upon her my whole soul in my eyes contemplating her perfections and thinking when i have seen her easy and serene what would be her thoughts did she know my heart as well as i know it when i behold her disturbed and jealous and think of the justness of her apprehensions and that she cannot fear so much as there is room for her to fear my heart often misgives me and must think i o creature so divinely excellent and so beloved of my soul those arms those encircling arms that would make a monarch happy be used to repel brutal force all their strength unavailingly perhaps exerted to repel it and to defend a person so delicately framed can violence enter into the heart of a wretch who might entitle himself to all her willing yet virtuous love and make the blessings he aspireth after her duty to confer begone villainpurposes sink ye all to the hell that could only inspire ye and i am then ready to throw myself at her feet to confess my villainous designs to avow my repentance and put it out of my power to act unworthily by such an excellence how then comes it that all these compassionate and as some would call them honest sensibilities go off why miss howe will tell thee she says i am the devil by my conscience i think he has at present a great share in me theres ingenuousness how i lay myself open to thee but seest thou not that the more i say against myself the less room there is for thee to take me to task o belford belford i cannot cannot at least at present i cannot marry then her family my bitter enemies to supple to them or if i do not to make her as unhappy as she can be from my attempts then does she not love them too much me too little she now seems to despise me miss howe declares that she really does despise me to be despised by a wife what a thought is that to be excelled by a wife too in every part of praiseworthy knowledge to take lessons to take instructions from a wife more than despise me she herself has taken time to consider whether she does not hate me i hate you lovelace with my whole heart said she to me but yesterday my soul is above thee man urge me not to tell thee how sincerely i think my soul above thee how poor indeed was i then even in my own heart so visible a superiority to so proud a spirit as mine and here from below from below indeed from these women i am so goaded on yet tis poor too to think myself a machine in the hands of such wretches i am no machine lovelace thou art base to thyself but to suppose thyself a machine but having gone thus far i should be unhappy if after marriage in the petulance of ill humour i had it to reproach myself that i did not try her to the utmost and yet i dont know how it is but this lady the moment i come into her presence halfassimilates me to her own virtue once or twice to say nothing of her triumph over me on sunday night i was prevailed upon to fluster myself with an intention to make some advances which if obliged to recede i might lay upon raised spirits but the instant i beheld her i was soberized into awe and reverence and the majesty of her even visible purity first damped and then extinguished my double flame what a surprisingly powerful effect so much and so long in my power she so instigated by some of her own sex and so stimulated by passion i how can this be accounted for in a lovelace but what a heap of stuff have i written how have i been run away with by what canst thou say by what o thou lurking varletess conscience is it thou that hast thus made me of party against myself how camest thou in in what disguise thou egregious haunter of my more agreeable hours stand thou with fate but neuter in this controversy and if i cannot do credit to human nature and to the female sex by bringing down such an angel as this to class with and adorn it for adorn it she does in her very foibles then i am all yours and never will resist you more here i arose i shook myself the window was open always the troublesome bosomvisiter the intruder is flown i see it yet and now it lessens to my aching eye and now the cleft air is closed after it and it is out of sight and once more i am robert lovelace letter xlix mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday may well did i and but just in time to conclude to have done with mrs fretchville and the house for here mennell has declared that he cannot in conscience and honour go any farther he would not for the world be accessory to the deceiving of such a lady i was a fool to let either you or him see her for ever since ye have both had scruples which neither would have had were a woman to have been in the question well i cant help it mennell has however though with some reluctance consented to write me a letter provided i will allow it to be the last step he shall take in this affair i presumed i told him that if i could cause mrs fretchvilles woman to supply his place he would have no objection to that none he says but is it not pity a pitiful fellow such a ridiculous kind of pity his as those silly souls have who would not kill an innocent chicken for the world but when killed to their hands are always the most greedy devourers of it now this letter gives the servant the smallpox and she has given it to her unhappy vapourish lady vapourish people are perpetual subjects for diseases to work upon name but the malady and it is theirs in a moment ever fitted for inoculation the physical tribes milchcows a vapourish or splenetic patient is a fiddle for the doctors and they are eternally playing upon it sweet music does it make them all their difficulty except a case extraordinary happens as poor mrs fretchvilles who has realized her apprehensions is but to hold their countenance while their patient is drawing up a bill of indictment against himself and when they have heard it proceed to punish the right word for prescribe why should they not when the criminal has confessed his guilt and punish they generally do with a vengeance yet silly toads too now i think of it for why when they know they cannot do good may they not as well endeavour to gratify as to nauseate the patients palate were i a physician id get all the trade to myself for malmsey and cyprus and the generous product of the cape a little disguised should be my principal doses as these would create new spirits how would the revived patient covet the physic and adore the doctor give all the paraders of the faculty whom thou knowest this hint there could but one inconvenience arise from it the apothecaries would find their medicines cost them something but the demand for quantities would answer that since the honest nurse would be the patients taster perpetually requiring repetitions of the last cordial julap well but to the letter yet what need of further explanation after the hints in my former the widow cant be removed and thats enough and mennells work is over and his conscience left to plague him for his own sins and not another mans and very possibly plague enough will give him for those this letter is directed to robert lovelace esq or in his absence to his lady she has refused dining with me or seeing me and i was out when it came she opened it so is my lady by her own consent proud and saucy as she is i am glad at my heart that it came before we entirely make up she would else perhaps have concluded it to be contrived for a delay and now moreover we can accommodate our old and new quarrels together and thats contrivance you know but how is her dear haughty heart humbled to what it was when i knew her first that she can apprehend any delays from me and have nothing to do but to vex at them i came in to dinner she sent me down the letter desiring my excuse for opening it did it before she was aware ladypride belford recollection then retrogradation i requested to see her upon it that moment but she desires to suspend our interview till morning i will bring her to own before i have done with her that she cant see me too often my impatience was so great on an occasion so unexpected that i could not help writing to tell her how much vexed i was at the accident but that it need not delay my happy day as that did not depend upon the house she knew that before shell think and so did i and as mrs fretchville by mr mennell so handsomely expressed her concern upon it and her wishes that it could suit us to bear with the unavoidable delay i hoped that going down to the lawn for two or three of the summer months when i was made the happiest of men would be favourable to all round the dear creature takes this incident to heart i believe she has sent word to my repeated request to see her notwithstanding her denial that she cannot till the morning it shall be then at six oclock if i please to be sure i do please can see her but once a day now jack did i tell thee that i wrote a letter to my cousin montague wondering that i heard not from lord m as the subject was so very interesting in it i acquainted her with the house i was about taking and with mrs fretchvilles vapourish delays i was very loth to engage my own family either man or woman in this affair but i must take my measures securely and already they all think as bad of me as they well can you observe by my lord ms letter to yourself that the wellmannerd peer is afraid i should play this admirable creature one of my usual dogs tricks i have received just now an answer from charlotte charlot int well a stomach disorder no wonder a girls stomach should plague her a single woman thats it when she has a man to plague it will have something besides itself to prey upon knowest thou not moreover that man is the womans sun woman is the mans earth how dreary how desolate the earth that the suns shines not upon poor charlotte but i heard she was not well that encouraged me to write to her and to express myself a little concerned that she had not of her own accord thought of a visit in town to my charmer here follows a copy of her letter thou wilt see by it that every little monkey is to catechise me they all depend upon my goodnature m hall may dear cousin we have been in daily hope for a long time i must call it of hearing that the happy knot was tied my lord has been very much out of order and yet nothing would serve him but he would himself write an answer to your letter it was the only opportunity he should ever have perhaps to throw in a little good advice to you with the hope of its being of any signification and he has been several hours in a day as his gout would let him busied in it it wants now only his last revisal he hopes it will have the greater weight with you as it appear all in his own handwriting indeed mr lovelace his worthy heart is wrapt up in you i wish you loved yourself but half as well but i believe too that if all the family loved you less you would love yourself more his lordship has been very busy at the times he could not write in consulting pritchard about those estates which he proposes to transfer to you on the happy occasion that he may answer your letter in the most acceptable manner and show by effects how kindly he takes your invitation i assure you he is mighty proud of it as for myself i am not at all well and have not been for some weeks past with my old stomachdisorder i had certainly else before now have done myself the honour you wonder i have not done myself lady betty who would have accompanied me for we have laid it all out has been exceedingly busy in her lawaffair her antagonist who is actually on the spot having been making proposals for an accommodation but you may assure yourself that when our dear relationelect shall be entered upon the new habitation you tell me of we will do ourselves the honour of visiting her and if any delay arises from the dear ladys want of courage which considering her man let me tell you may very well be we will endeavour to inspire her with it and be sponsors for you for cousin i believe you have need to be christened over again before you are entitled to so great a blessing what think you just now my lord tells me he will dispatch a man on purpose with his letter tomorrow so i needed not to have written but now i have let it go and by empson who sets out directly on his return to town my best compliments and sisters to the most deserving lady in the world you will need no other direction to the person meant conclude me your affectionate cousin and servant charl montague thou seest how seasonably this letter comes i hope my lord will write nothing but what i may show to my beloved i have actually sent her up this letter of charlottes and hope for happy effects from it rl the lady in her next letter gives miss howe an account of what passed between mr lovelace and herself she resents his behaviour with her usual dignity but when she comes to mention mr mennells letter she reurges miss howe to perfect her scheme for her deliverance being resolved to leave him but dating again on his sending up to her miss montagues letter she alters her mind and desires her to suspend for the present her application to mrs townsend i had begun says she to suspect all he had said of mrs fretchville and her house and even mr mennell himself though so wellappearing a man but now that i find mr lovelace has apprized his relations of his intent to take it and had engaged some of the ladies to visit me there i could hardly forbear blaming myself for censuring him as capable of so vile an imposture but may he not thank himself for acting so very unaccountably and taking such needlesslyawry steps as he had done embarrassing as i told him his own meanings if they were good letter l mr lovelace to john belford esq wednesday may he gives his friend an account of their interview that morning and of the happy effects of his cousin montagues letter in his favour her reserves however he tells him are not absolutely banished but this he imputes to form it is not in the power of woman says he to be altogether sincere on these occasions but why do they think it so great a disgrace to be found out to be really what they are i regretted the illness of mrs fretchville as the intention i had to fix her dear self in the house before the happy knot was tied would have set her in that independence in appearance as well as fact which was necessary to show to all the world that her choice was free and as the ladies of my family would have been proud to make their court to her there while the settlements and our equipages were preparing but on any other account there was no great matter in it since when my happy day was over we could with so much convenience go down to the lawn to my lord ms and to lady sarahs or lady bettys in turn which would give full time to provide ourselves with servants and other accommodations how sweetly the charmer listened i asked her if she had had the smallpox ten thousand pounds the worse in my estimation thought i if she has not for no one of her charming graces can i dispense with twas always a doubtful point with her mother and mrs norton she owned but although she was not afraid of it she chose not unnecessarily to rush into places where it was right thought i else i said it would not have been amiss for her to see the house before she went into the country for if she liked it not i was not obliged to have it she asked if she might take a copy of miss montagues letter i said she might keep the letter itself and send it to miss howe if she pleased for that i suppose was her intention she bowed her head to me there jack i shall have her courtesy to me byandby i question not what adevil had i to do to terrify the sweet creature by my termagant projects yet it was not amiss i believe to make her afraid of me she says i am an unpolite man and every polite instance from such a one is deemed a favour talking of the settlements i told her i had rather that pritchard mentioned by my cousin charlotte had not been consulted on this occasion pritchard indeed was a very honest man and had been for a generation in the family and knew of the estates and the condition of them better than either my lord or myself but pritchard like other old men was diffident and slow and valued himself upon his skill as a draughtsman and for the sake of the paltry reputation must have all his forms preserved were an imperial crown to depend upon his dispatch i kissed her unrepulsing hand no less than five times during this conversation lord jack how my generous heart ran over she was quite obliging at parting she in a manner asked me leave to retire to reperuse charlottes letter i think she bent her knees to me but i wont be sure how happy might we both have been long ago had the dear creature been always as complaisant to me for i do love respect and whether i deserve it or not always had it till i knew this proud beauty and now belford are we in a train or the deuce is in it every fortified town has its strong and its weak place i have carried on my attacks against the impregnable parts i have not doubt but i shall either shine or smuggle her out of her cloke since she and miss howe have intended to employ a smuggler against me all we wait for now is my lords letter but i had like to have forgot to tell thee that we have been not a little alarmed by some inquiries that have been made after me and my beloved by a man of good appearance who yesterday procured a tradesman in the neighbourhood to send for dorcas of whom he asked several questions relating to us particularly as we boarded and lodged in one house whether we were married this has given my beloved great uneasiness and i could not help observing upon it to her how right a thing it was that we had given out below that we were married the inquiry most probably i said was from her brothers quarter and now perhaps that our marriage was owned we should hear no more of his machinations the person it seems was curious to know the day that the ceremony was performed but dorcas refused to give him any other particulars than that we were married and she was the more reserved as he declined to tell her the motives of his inquiry letter li mr lovelace to john belford esq may the devil take this uncle of mine he has at last sent me a letter which i cannot show without exposing the head of our family for a fool a confounded parcel of popguns has he let off upon me i was in hopes he had exhausted his whole stock of this sort in his letter to you to keep it back to delay sending it till he had recollected all this farrago of nonsense confound his wisdom of nations if so much of it is to be scraped together in disgrace of itself to make one egregious simpleton but i am glad i am fortified with this piece of flagrant folly however since in all human affairs the convenient are so mingled that there is no having the one without the other i have already offered the bill enclosed in it to my beloved and read to her part of the letter but she refused the bill and as i am in cash myself i shall return it she seemed very desirous to peruse the whole letter and when i told her that were it not for exposing the writer i would oblige her she said it would not be exposing his lordship to show it to her and that she always preferred the heart to the head i knew her meaning but did not thank her for it all that makes for me in it i will transcribe for her yet hang it she shall have the letter and my soul with it for one consenting kiss she has got the letter from me without the reward deuce take me if i had the courage to propose the condition a new character this of bashfulness in thy friend i see that a truly modest woman may make even a confident man keep his distance by my soul belford i believe that nine women in ten who fall fall either from their own vanity or levity or for want of circumspection and proper reserves i did intend to take my reward on her returning a letter so favourable to us both but she sent it to me sealed up by dorcas i might have thought that there were two or three hints in it that she would be too nice immediately to appear to i send it to thee and here will stop to give thee time to read it return it as soon as thou hast perused it letter lii lord m to robert lovelace esq tuesday may it is a long lane that has no turning do not despise me for my proverbs you know i was always fond of them and if you had been so too it would have been the better for you let me tell you i dare swear the fine lady you are so likely to be soon happy with will be far from despising them for i am told that she writes well and that all her letters are full of sentences god convert you for nobody but he and this lady can i have no manner of doubt but that you will marry as your father and all your ancestors did before you else you would have had no title to be my heir nor can your descendants have any title to be yours unless they are legitimate thats worth your remembrance sir no man is always a fool every man is sometimes but your follies i hope are now at an end i know you have vowed revenge against this fine ladys family but no more of that now you must look upon them all as your relations and forgive and forget and when they see you make a good husband and a good father which god send for all our sakes they will wonder at their nonsensical antipathy and beg your pardon but while they think you a vile fellow and a rake how can they either love you or excuse their daughter and methinks i could wish to give a word of comfort to the lady who doubtless must be under great fears how she shall be able to hold in such a wild creature as you have hitherto been i would hint to her that by strong arguments and gentle words she may do any thing with you for though you are apt to be hot gentle words will cool you and bring you into the temper that is necessary for your cure would to god my poor lady your aunt who is dead and gone had been a proper patient for the same remedy god rest her soul no reflections upon her memory worth is best known by want i know hers now and if i had went first she would by this time have known mine there is great wisdom in that saying god send me a friend that may tell me of my faults if not an enemy and he will not that i am your enemy and that you well know the more noble any one is the more humble so bear with me if you would be thought noble am i not your uncle and do i not design to be better to you than your father could be nay i will be your father too when the happy day comes since you desire it and pray make my compliments to my dear niece and tell her i wonder much that she has so long deferred your happiness pray let her know as that i will present her not you either my lancashire seat or the lawn in hertfordshire and settle upon her a thousand pounds a year pennyrents to show her that we are not a family to take base advantages and you may have writings drawn and settle as you will honest pritchard has the rentroll of both these estates and as he has been a good old servant i recommend him to your ladys favour i have already consulted him he will tell you what is best for you and most pleasing to me i am still very bad with my gout but will come in a litter as soon as the day is fixed it would be the joy of my heart to join your hands and let me tell you if you do not make the best of husbands to so good a young lady and one who has had so much courage for your sake i will renounce you and settle all i can upon her and hers by you and leave you out of the question if any thing be wanting for your further security i am ready to give it though you know that my word has always been looked upon as my bond and when the harlowes know all this let us see whether they are able to blush and take shame to themselves lady sarah and lady betty want only to know the day to make all the country round them blaze and all their tenants mad and if any one of mine be sober upon the occasion pritchard shall eject him and on the birth of the first child if a son i will do something more for you and repeat all our rejoicings i ought indeed to have written sooner but i knew that if you thought me long and were in haste as to your nuptials you would write and tell me so but my gout was very troublesome and i am but a slow writer you know at best for composing is a thing that though formerly i was very ready at it as my lord lexington used to say yet having left it off a great while i am not so now and i chose on this occasion to write all out of my own hand and memory and to give you my best advice for i may never have such an opportunity again you have had god mend you a strange way of turning your back upon all i have said this once i hope you will be more attentive to the advice i give you for your own good i have still another end nay two other ends the one was that now you are upon the borders of wedlock as i may say and all your wild oats will be sown i would give you some instructions as to your public as well as private behaviour in life which intending you so much good as i do you ought to hear and perhaps would never have listened to on any less extraordinary occasion the second is that your dear ladyelect who is it seems herself so fine and so sententious a writer will see by this that it is not our faults nor for want of the best advice that you was not a better man than you have hitherto been and now in a few words for the conduct i would wish you to follow in public as well as in private if you would think me worthy of advising it shall be short so be not uneasy as to the private life love your lady as she deserves let your actions praise you be a good husband and so give the lie to all your enemies and make them ashamed of their scandals and let us have pride in saying that miss harlowe has not done either herself or family any discredit by coming among us do this and i and lady sarah and lady betty will love you for ever as to your public conduct this as follows is what i could wish but i reckon your ladys wisdom will put us both right no disparagement sir since with all your wit you have not hitherto shown much wisdom you know get into parliament as soon as you can for you have talons to make a great figure there who so proper to assist in making new holding laws as those whom no law in being could hold then for so long as you will give attendance in st stephens chapel its being called a chapel i hope will not disgust you i am sure i have known many a riot there a speaker has a hard time of it but we peers have more decorum but what was i going to say i must go back for so long as you will give your attendance in parliament for so long will you be out of mischief out of private mischief at least and may st stephens fate be yours if you wilfully do public mischief when a new election comes you will have two or three boroughs you know to choose out of but if you stay till then i had rather you were for the shire you will have interest enough i am sure and being so handsome a man the women will make their husbands vote for you i shall long to read your speeches i expect you will speak if occasion offer the very first day you want no courage and think highly enough of yourself and lowly enough of every body else to speak on all occasions as to the methods of the house you have spirit enough i fear to be too much above them take care of that i dont so much fear your want of goodmanners to men you want no decency if they dont provoke you as to that i wish you would only learn to be as patient of contradiction from others as you would have other people be to you although i would not have you to be a courtier neither would i have you to be a malcontent i remember for i have it down what my old friend archibald hutcheson said and it was a very good saying to mr secretary craggs i think it was i look upon an administration as entitled to every vote i can with good conscience give it for a house of commons should not needlessly put drags upon the wheels of government and when i have not given it my vote it was with regret and for my countrys sake i wished with all my heart the measure had been such as i could have approved and another saying he had which was this neither can an opposition neither can a ministry be always wrong to be a plumb man therefore with either is an infallible mark that that man must mean more and worse than he will own he does mean are these sayings bad sir are they to be despised well then why should i be despised for remembering them and quoting them as i love to do let me tell you if you loved my company more than you do you would not be the worse for it i may say so without any vanity since it is other mens wisdom and not my own that i am so fond of but to add a word or two more on this occasion and i may never have such another for you must read this through love honest men and herd with them in the house and out of the house by whatever names they be dignified or distinguished keep good men company and you shall be out of their number but did i or did i not write this before writing at so many different times and such a quantity one may forget you may come in for the title when i am dead and gone god help me so i would have you keep an equilibrium if once you get the name of being a fine speaker you may have any thing and to be sure you have naturally a great deal of elocution a tongue that would delude an angel as the women say to their sorrow some of them poor creatures a leading man in the house of commons is a very important character because that house has the giving of money and money makes the mare to go ay and queens and kings too sometimes to go in a manner very different from what they might otherwise choose to go let me tell you however methinks i would not have you take a place neither it will double your value and your interest if it be believed that you will not for as you will then stand in no mans way you will have no envy but pure sterling respect and both sides will court you for your part you will not want a place as some others do to piece up their broken fortunes if you can now live reputably upon two thousand pounds a year it will be hard if you cannot hereafter live upon seven or eight less you will not have if you oblige me as now by marrying so fine a lady very much you will and all this and above lady bettys and lady sarahs favours what in the name of wonder could possibly possess the proud harlowes that son that son of theirs but for his dear sisters sake i will say no more of him i never was offered a place myself and the only one i would have taken had i been offered it was master of the buckhounds for i loved hunting when i was young and it carries a good sound with it for us who live in the country often have i thought of that excellent old adage he that eats the kings goose shall be choked with his feathers i wish to the lord this was thoroughly considered by placehunters it would be better for them and for their poor families i could say a great deal more and all equally to the purpose but really i am tired and so i doubt are you and besides i would reserve something for conversation my nieces montague and lady sarah and lady betty join in compliments to my niece that is to be if she would choose to have the knot tied among us pray tell her that we shall all see it securely done and we will make all the country ring and blaze for a week together but so i believe i said before if any thing further may be needful toward promoting your reciprocal felicity let me know it and how you order about the day and all that the enclosed bill is very much at your service tis payable at sight as whatever else you may have occasion for shall be so god bless you both and make things as convenient to my gout as you can though be it whenever it will i will hobble to you for i long to see you and still more to see my niece and am in expectation of that happy opportunity your most affectionate uncle m letter liii mr lovelace to john belford esq thursday may thou seest belford how we now drive before the wind the dear creature now comes almost at the first word whenever i desire the honour of her company i told her last night that apprehending delay from pritchards slowness i was determined to leave it to my lord to make his compliments in his own way and had actually that afternoon put my writings into the hands of a very eminent lawyer counsellor willians with directions for him to draw up settlements from my own estate and conformably to those of my mother which i put into his hands at the same time it had been i assured her no small part of my concern that her frequent displeasure and our mutual misapprehensions had hindered me from advising with her before on this subject indeed indeed my dearest life said i you have hitherto afforded me but a very thorny courtship she was silent kindly silent for well know i that she could have recriminated upon me with a vengeance but i was willing to see if she were not loth to disoblige me now i comforted myself i said with the hopes that all my difficulties were now over and that every past disobligations would be buried in oblivion now belford i have actually deposited these writings with counsellor williams and i expect the draughts in a week at farthest so shall be doubly armed for if i attempt and fail these shall be ready to throw in to make her have patience with me till i can try again i have more contrivances still in embryo i could tell thee of an hundred and yet hold another hundred in petto to pop in as i go along to excite thy surprize and to keep up thy attention nor rave thou at me but if thou art my friend think of miss howes letters and of her smuggling scheme all owing to my fair captives informations incitements am i not a villain a fool a beelzebub with them already yet no harm done by me nor so much as attempted every thing of this nature the dear creature answered with a downcast eye and a blushing cheek she left to me i proposed my lords chapel for the celebration where we might have the presence of lady betty lady sarah and my two cousins montague she seemed not to favour a public celebration and waved this subject for the present i doubted not but she would be as willing as i to decline a public wedding so i pressed not this matter farther just then but patterns i actually produced and a jeweller was to bring as this day several sets of jewels for her choice but the patterns she would not open she sighed at the mention of them the second patterns she said that had been offered to her and very peremptorily forbid the jewellers coming as well as declined my offer of causing my mothers to be newset at least for the present see vol i letter xli i do assure thee belford i was in earnest in all this my whole estate is nothing to me put in competition with her hopedfor favour she then told me that she had put into writing her opinion of my general proposals and there had expressed her mind as to clothes and jewels but on my strange behaviour to her for no cause that she knew of on sunday night she had torn the paper in two i earnestly pressed her to let me be favoured with a sight of this paper torn as it was and after some hesitation she withdrew and sent it to me by dorcas i perused it again it was in a manner new to me though i had read it so lately and by my soul i could hardly stand it an hundred admirable creatures i called her to myself but i charge thee write not a word to me in her favour if thou meanest her well for if i spare her it must be all ex mero motu you may easily suppose when i was readmitted to her presence that i ran over in her praises and in vows of gratitude and everlasting love but heres the devil she still receives all i say with reserve or if it be not with reserve she receives it so much as her due that she is not at all raised by it some women are undone by praise by flattery i myself a man am proud of praise perhaps thou wilt say that those are most proud of it who least deserve it as those are of riches and grandeur who are not born to either i own that to be superior to these foibles it requires a soul have i not then a soul surely i have let me then be considered as an exception to the rule now have i foundation to go upon in my terms my lord in the exuberance of his generosity mentions a thousand pounds a year pennyrents this i know that were i to marry this lady he would rather settle upon her all he has a mind to settle than upon me he has event threatened that if i prove not a good husband to her he will leave all he can at his death from me to her yet considers not that a woman so perfect can never be displeased with her husband but to his disgrace for who will blame her another reason why a lovelace should not wish to marry a clarissa but what a pretty fellow of an uncle is this foolish peer to think of making a wife independent of her emperor and a rebel of course yet smarted himself for an error of this kind my beloved in her torn paper mentions but two hundred pounds a year for her separate use i insisted upon her naming a larger sum she said it might be three and i for fear she should suspect very large offers named only five but added the entire disposal of all arrears in her fathers hands for the benefit of mrs norton or whom she pleased she said that the good woman would be uneasy if any thing more than a competency were done for her she was more for suiting all her dispositions of this kind she said to the usual way of life of the person to go beyond it was but to put the benefited upon projects or to make them awkward in a new state when they might shine in that to which they were accustomed and to put it into so good a mothers power to give her son a beginning in his business at a proper time yet to leave her something for herself to set her above want or above the necessity of taking back from her child what she had been enabled to bestow upon him would be the height of such a worthy parents ambition heres prudence heres judgment in so young a creature how do i hate the harlowes for producing such an angel o why why did she refuse my sincere address to tie the knot before we came to this house but yet what mortifies my pride is that this exalted creature if i were to marry her would not be governed in her behaviour to me by love but by generosity merely or by blind duty and had rather live single than be mine i cannot bear this i would have the woman whom i honour with my name if ever i confer this honour upon any forego even her superior duties for me i would have her look after me when i go out as far as she can see me as my rosebud after her johnny and meet me at my return with rapture i would be the subject of her dreams as well as of her waking thoughts i would have her think every moment lost that is not passed with me sing to me read to me play to me when i pleased no joy so great as in obeying me when i should be inclined to love overwhelm me with it when to be serious or solitary if apprehensive of intrusion retiring at a nod approaching me only if i smiled encouragement steal into my presence with silence out of it if not noticed on tiptoe be a lady easy to all my pleasures and valuing those most who most contributed to them only sighing in private that it was not herself at the time thus of old did the contending wives of the honest patriarchs each recommending her handmaid to her lord as she thought it would oblige him and looking upon the genial product as her own the gentle waller says women are born to be controuled gentle as he was he knew that a tyrant husband makes a dutiful wife and why do the sex love rakes but because they know how to direct their uncertain wills and manage them another agreeable conversation the day of days the subject as to fixing a particular one that need not be done my charmer says till the settlements are completed as to marrying at my lords chapel the ladies of my family present that would be making a public affair of it and the dear creature observed with regret that it seemed to be my lords intention to make it so it could not be imagined i said but that his lordships setting out in a litter and coming to town as well as his taste for glare and the joy he would take to see me married at last and to her dear self would give it as much the air of a public marriage as if the ceremony were performed at his own chapel all the ladies present i cannot said she endure the thoughts of a public day it will carry with it an air of insult upon my whole family and for my part if my lord will not take it amiss and perhaps he will not as the motion came not from himself but from you mr lovelace i will very willingly dispense with his lordships presence the rather as dress and appearance will then be unnecessary for i cannot bear to think of decking my person while my parents are in tears how excellent this yet do not her parents richly deserve to be in tears see belford with so charming a niceness we might have been a long time ago upon the verge of the state and yet found a great deal to do before we entered into it all obedience all resignation no will but hers i withdrew and wrote directly to my lord and she not disapproving of it i sent it away the purport as follows for i took no copy that i was much obliged to his lordship for his intended goodness to me on an occasion the most solemn of my life that the admirable lady whom he so justly praised thought his lordships proposals in her favour too high that she chose not to make a public appearance if without disobliging my friends she could avoid it till a reconciliation with her own could be effected that although she expressed a grateful sense of his lordships consent to give her to me with his own hand yet presuming that the motive to this kind intention was rather to do her honour than it otherwise would have been his own choice especially as travelling would be at this time so inconvenient to him she thought it advisable to save his lordship trouble on this occasion and hoped he would take as meant her declining the favour that the lawn will be most acceptable to us both to retire to and the rather as it is so to his lordship but if he pleases the jointure may be made from my own estate leaving to his lordships goodness the alternative i conclude with telling him that i had offered to present the lady his lordships bill but on her declining to accept of it having myself no present occasion for it i return it enclosed with my thanks c and is not this going a plaguy length what a figure should i make in rakish annals if at last i should be caught in my own gin the sex may say what they will but a poor innocent fellow had need to take great care of himself when he dances upon the edge of the matrimonial precipice many a fainthearted man when he began to jest or only designed to ape gallantry has been forced into earnest by being overprompt and taken at his word not knowing how to own that he meant less than the lady supposed he meant i am the better enabled to judge that this must have been the case of many a sneaking varlet because i who know the female world as well as any man in it of my standing am so frequently in doubt of myself and know not what to make of the matter then these little sly rogues how they lie couchant ready to spring upon us harmless fellows the moment we are in their reach when the ice is once broken for them how swiftly can they make to port mean time the subject they can least speak to they most think of nor can you talk of the ceremony before they have laid out in their minds how it is all to be little saucyfaced designers how first they draw themselves in then us but be all these things as they will lord m never in his life received so handsome a letter as this from his nephew lovelace the lady after having given to miss howe on the particulars contained in mr lovelaces last letter thus expresses herself a principal consolation arising from these favourable appearances is that i who have now but one only friend shall most probably and if it be not my own fault have as many new ones as there are persons in mr lovelaces family and this whether mr lovelace treat me kindly or not and who knows but that by degrees those new friends by their rank and merit may have weight enough to get me restored to the favour of my relations till which can be effected i shall not be tolerably easy happy i never expect to be mr lovelaces mind and mine are vastly different different in essentials but as matters are at present circumstanced i pray you my dear friend to keep to yourself every thing that might bring discredit to him if revealed better any body expose a man than a wife if i am to be his and what is said by you will be thought to come from me it shall be my constant prayer that all the felicities which this world can afford may be yours and that the almighty will never suffer you nor yours to the remotest posterity to want such a friend as my anna howe has been to her clarissa harlowe letter liv mr lovelace to john belford esq and now that my beloved seems secure in my net for my project upon the vixen miss howe and upon her mother in which the officious prancer hickman is to come in for a dash but why upon her mother methinks thou askest who unknown to herself has only acted by the impulse through thy agent joseph leman upon the folly of old tony the uncle no matter for that she believes she acts upon her own judgment and deserves to be punished for pretending to judgment when she has none every living soul but myself i can tell thee shall be punished that treats either cruelly or disrespectfully so adored a lady what a plague is it not enough that she is teased and tormented in person by me i have already broken the matter to our three confederates as a supposed not a resolvedon case indeed and yet they know that with me in a piece of mischief execution with its swiftest feel is seldom three paces behind projection which hardly ever limps neither mowbray is not against it it is a scheme he says worthy of us and we have not done any thing for a good while that has made a noise belton indeed hesitates a little because matters go wrong between him and his thomasine and the poor fellow has not the courage to have his sore place probed to the bottom tourville has started a fresh game and shrugs his shoulders and should not choose to go abroad at present if i please for i apprehend that from the nature of the project there will be a kind of necessity to travel till all is blown over to me one country is as good as another and i shall soon i suppose choose to quit this paltry island except the mistress of my fate will consent to cohabit at home and so lay me under no necessity of surprising her into foreign parts travelling thou knowest gives the sexes charming opportunities of being familiar with one another a very few days and nights must now decide all matters betwixt me and my fair inimitable doleman who can act in these causes only as chambercounsel will inform us by pen and ink his right hand and right side having not yet been struck and the other side beginning to be sensible of all that shall occur in our absence as for thee we had rather have thy company than not for although thou art a wretched fellow at contrivance yet art thou intrepid at execution but as thy present engagements make thy attendance uncertain i am not for making thy part necessary to our scheme but for leaving thee to come after us when abroad i know thou canst not long live without us the project in short is this mrs howe has an elder sister in the isle of wight who is lately a widow and i am well informed that the mother and daughter have engaged before the latter is married to pay a visit to this lady who is rich and intends miss for her heiress and in the interim will make her some valuable presents on her approaching nuptials which as mrs howe who loves money more than any thing but herself told one of my acquaintance would be worth fetching now jack nothing more need be done than to hire a little trim vessel which shall sail a pleasuring backward and forward to portsmouth spithead and the isle of wight for a week or fortnight before we enter upon our parts of the plot and as mrs howe will be for making the best bargain she can for her passage the master of the vessel may have orders as a perquisite allowed him by his owners to take what she will give and the masters name be it what it will shall be ganmore on the occasion for i know a rogue of that name who is not obliged to be of any country any more than we well then we will imagine them on board i will be there in disguise they know not any of ye four supposing the scheme so inviting that thou canst be one tis plaguy hard if we cannot find or make a storm perhaps they will be seasick but whether they be or not no doubt they will keep their cabin here will be mrs howe miss howe mr hickman a maid and a footman i suppose and thus we will order it i know it will be hard weather i know it will and before there can be the least suspicion of the matter we shall be in sight of guernsey jersey dieppe cherbourg or any where on the french coast that it shall please us to agree with the winds to blow us and then securing the footman and the women being separated one of us according to lots that may be cast shall overcome either by persuasion or force the maid servant that will be no hard task and she is a likely wench i have seen her often one mrs howe nor can there be much difficulty there for she is full of health and life and has been long a widow another that says the princely lion must be i the saucy daughter who will be much too frightened to make great resistance violent spirits in that sex are seldom true spirits tis but where they can and after beating about the coast for three or four days for recreations sake and to make sure work till we see our sullen birds begin to eat and sip we will set them all ashore where it will be most convenient sell the vessel to mrs townsends agents with all my heart or to some other smugglers or give it to ganmore and pursue our travels and tarry abroad till all is hushed up now i know thou wilt make difficulties as it is thy way while it is mine to conquer them my other vassals made theirs and i condescended to obviate them as thus i will thine first stating them for thee according to what i know of thy phlegm what in the first place wilt thou ask shall be done with hickman who will be in full parade of dress and primness in order to show the old aunt what a devilish clever fellow of a nephew she is to have what ill tell thee hickman in good manners will leave the women in their cabin and to show his courage with his breeding be upon deck well and suppose he is why then i hope it is easy for ganmore or any body else myself suppose in my peajacket and great watch coat if any other make scruple to do it while he stands in the way gaping and staring like a novice to stumble against him and push him overboard a rich thought is it not belford he is certainly plaguy officious in the ladies correspondence and i am informed plays double between mother and daughter in fear of both dost not see him jack i do popping up and down his wig and hat floating by him and paddling pawing and dashing like a frighted mongrel i am afraid he never ventured to learn to swim but thou wilt not drown the poor fellow wilt thou no no that is not necessary to the project i hate to do mischiefs supererogatory the skiff shall be ready to save him while the vessel keeps its course he shall be set on shore with the loss of wig and hat only and of half his little wits at the place where he embarked or any where else well but shall we not be in danger of being hanged for three such enormous rapes although hickman should escape with only a bellyful of seawater yes to be sure when caught but is there any likelihood of that besides have we not been in danger before now for worse facts and what is there in being only in danger if we actually were to appear in open day in england before matters are made up there will be greater likelihood that these women will not prosecute that they will for my own part i should wish they may would not a brave fellow choose to appear in court to such an arraignment confronting women who would do credit to his attempt the country is more merciful in these cases than in any others i should therefore like to put myself upon my country let me indulge in a few reflections upon what thou mayest think the worst that can happen i will suppose that thou art one of us and that all five are actually brought to trial on this occasion how bravely shall we enter a court i at the head of you dressed out each man as if to his wedding appearance you are sure of all the women old and young of your side what brave fellows what fine gentlemen there goes a charming handsome man meaning me to be sure who could find in their hearts to hang such a gentleman as that whispers one lady sitting perhaps on the right hand of the recorder i suppose the scene to be in london while another disbelieves that any woman could fairly swear against me all will crowd after me it will be each mans happiness if ye shall chance to be bashful to be neglected i shall be found to be the greatest criminal and my safety for which the general voice will be engaged will be yours but then comes the triumph of triumphs that will make the accused look up while the accusers are covered with confusion make room there stand by give back one receiving a rap another an elbow half a score a push a piece enter the slowmoving hoodedfaced downlooking plaintiffs and first the widow with a sorrowful countenance though halfveiled pitying her daughter more than herself the people the women especially who on this occasion will be fivesixths of the spectators reproaching her youd have the conscience would you to have five such brave gentlemen as these hanged for you know not what next comes the poor maid who perhaps has been ravished twenty times before and had not appeared now but for companysake mincing simpering weeping by turns not knowing whether she should be sorry or glad but every eye dwells upon miss see see the handsome gentleman bows to her to the very ground to be sure i shall bow and kiss my hand see her confusion see she turns from him ay thats because it is in open court cries an arch one while others admire her ay thats a girl worth venturing ones neck for then we shall be praised even the judges and the whole crowded bench will acquit us in their hearts and every single man wish he had been me the women all the time disclaiming prosecution were the case to be their own to be sure belford the sufferers cannot put half so good a face upon the matter as we then what a noise will this matter make is it not enough suppose us moving from the prison to the sessionshouse to make a noble heart thump it away most gloriously when such an one finds himself attended to his trial by a parade of guards and officers of miens and aspects warlike and unwarlike himself of their whole care and their business weapons in their hands some bright some rusty equally venerable for their antiquity and inoffensiveness others of more authoritative demeanour strutting before with fine painted staves shoals of people following with a which is he whom the young lady appears against then let us look down look up look round which way we will we shall see all the doors the shops the windows the signirons and balconies garrets gutters and chimneytops included all whitecapt black hooded and periwiggd or cropeard up by the immobile vulgus while the floating streetswarmers who have seen us pass by at one place run with stretchedout necks and strained eyeballs a roundabout way and elbow and shoulder themselves into places by which we have not passed in order to obtain another sight of us every street continuing to pour out its swarms of latecomers to add to the gathering snowball who are content to take descriptions of our persons behaviour and countenances from those who had the good fortune to have been in time to see us within these few years past a passage has been made from the prison to the sessionshouse whereby malefactors are carried into court without going through the street lovelaces triumph on their supposed march shows the wisdom of this alteration let me tell thee jack i see not why to judge according to our principles and practices we should not be as much elated in our march were this to happen to us as others may be upon any other the most mob attracting occasion suppose a lordmayor on his gawdy suppose a victorious general or ambassador on his public entry suppose as i began with the lowest the grandest parade that can be supposed a coronation for in all these do not the royal guard the heroic trainedbands the pendent clinging throngs of spectators with their waving heads rolling toandfro from housetops to housebottoms and streetways as i have above described make the principal part of the rareeshow and let me ask thee if thou dost not think that either the mayor the ambassador or the general would not make very pitiful figures on their galas did not the trumpets and tabrets call together the canaille to gaze at them nor perhaps should we be the most guilty heroes neither for who knows how the magistrate may have obtained his gold chain while the general probably returns from cutting of throats and from murders sanctified by custom only caesar we are told had won at the age of fiftysix when he was assassinated fifty pitched battles had taken by assault above a thousand towns and slain near men i suppose exclusive of those who fell on his own side in slaying them are not you and i jack innocent men and babes in swaddlingclothes compared to caesar and to his predecessor in heroism alexander dubbed for murders and depredation magnus pliny gives this account putting the number of men slain at see also lipsius de constandia the principal difference that strikes me in the comparison between us and the mayor the ambassador the general on their gawdies is that the mob make a greater noise a louder huzzaing in the one case than the other which is called acclamation and ends frequently in higher taste by throwing dead animals at one another before they disperse in which they have as much joy as in the former part of the triumph while they will attend us with all the marks of an awful or silent at most only a whispering respect their mouths distended as if set open with gags and their voices generally lost in goggleeyd admiration well but suppose after all we are convicted what have we to do but in time make over our estates that the sheriffs may not revel in our spoils there is no fear of being hanged for such a crime as this while we have money or friends and suppose even the worst that two or three were to die have we not a chance each man of us to escape the devils in them if theyll hang five for ravishing three i know i shall get off for one were it but for family sake and being a handsome fellow i shall have a dozen or two young maidens all dressed in white go to court to beg my life and what a pretty show they will make with their white hoods white gowns white petticoats white scarves white gloves kneeling for me with their white handkerchiefs at their eyes in two pretty rows as his majesty walks through them and nods my pardon for their sakes and if once pardoned all is over for jack in a crime of this nature there lies no appeal as in a murder so thou seest the worst that can happen should we not make the grand tour upon this occasion but stay and take our trials but it is most likely that they will not prosecute at all if not no risque on our side will be run only taking our pleasure abroad at the worst leaving friends tired of us in order after a time to return to the same friends endeared to us as we to them by absence this jack is my scheme at the first running i know it is capable of improvement for example i can land these ladies in france whip over before they can get a passage back or before hickman can have recovered his fright and so find means to entrap my beloved on board and then all will be right and i need not care if i were never to return to england memorandum to be considered of whether in order to complete my vengeance i cannot contrive to kidnap away either james harlowe or solmes or both a man jack would not go into exile for nothing letter lv mr lovelace to john belford esq if belford thou likest not my plot upon miss howe i have three or four more as good in my own opinion better perhaps they will be in thine and so tis but getting loose from thy present engagement and thou shalt pick and choose but as for thy three brethren they must do as i would have them and so indeed must thou else why am i your general but i will refer this subject to its proper season thou knowest that i never absolutely conclude upon a project till tis time for execution and then lightning strikes not quicker than i and now to the subject next my heart wilt thou believe me when i tell thee that i have so many contrivances rising up and crowding upon me for preference with regard to my gloriana that i hardly know which to choose i could tell thee of no less than six princely ones any of which must do but as the dear creature has not grudged giving me trouble i think i ought not in gratitude to spare combustibles for her but on the contrary to make her stare and stand aghast by springing three or four mines at once thou remembrest what shakespeare in his troilus and cressida makes hector who however is not used to boast say to achilles in an interview between them and which applied to this watchful lady and to the vexation she has given me and to the certainty i now think i have of subduing her will run thus supposing the charmer before me and i meditating her sweet person from head to foot henceforth o watchful fairone guard thee well for ill not kill thee there nor there nor there but by the zone that circles venus waist ill kill thee evry where yea oer and oer thou wisest belford pardon me this brag her watchfulness draws folly from my lips but ill endeavour deeds to match the words or i may never then i imagine thee interposing to qualify my impatience as ajax did to achilles do not chafe thee cousin and let these threats alone till accident or purpose bring thee to it all that vexes me in the midst of my gloriedin devices is that there is a sorry fellow in the world who has presumed to question whether the prize when obtained is worthy of the pains it costs me yet knows with what patience and trouble a birdman will spread an acre of ground with gins and snares set up his stalking horse his glasses plant his decoy birds and invite the feathered throng by his whistle and all his prize at last the reward of early hours and of a whole mornings pains only a simple linnet to be serious belford i must acknowledge that all our pursuits from childhood to manhood are only trifles of different sort and sizes proportioned to our years and views but then is not a fine woman the noblest trifle that ever was or could be obtained by man and to what purpose do we say obtained if it be not in the way we wish for if a man is rather to be her prize than she his and now belford what dost think that thou art a cursed fellow if if no ifs but i shall be very sick tomorrow i shall faith sick why sick what adevil shouldst thou be sick for for more good reasons than one jack i should be glad to hear but one sick quotha of all thy roguish inventions i should not have thought of this perhaps thou thinkest my view to be to draw the lady to my bedside thats a trick of three or four thousand years old and i should find it much more to my purpose if i could get to hers however ill condescend to make thee as wise as myself i am excessively disturbed about this smuggling scheme of miss howe i have no doubt that my fairone were i to make an attempt and miscarry will fly from me if she can i once believed she loved me but now i doubt whether she does or not at least that it is with such an ardour as miss howe calls it as will make her overlook a premeditated fault should i be guilty of one and what will being sick do for thee have patience i dont intend to be so very bad as dorcas shall represent me to be but yet i know i shall reach confoundedly and bring up some clotted blood to be sure i shall break a vessel theres no doubt of that and a bottle of eatons styptic shall be sent for but no doctor if she has humanity she will be concerned but if she has love let it have been pushed ever so far back it will on this occasion come forward and show itself not only in her eye but in every line of her sweet face i will be very intrepid i will not fear death or any thing else i will be sure of being well in an hour or two having formerly found great benefit by this astringent medicine on occasion of an inward bruise by a fall from my horse in hunting of which perhaps this malady may be the remains and this will show her that though those about me may make the most of it i do not and so can have no design in it well methinks thou sayest i begin to think tolerably of this device i knew thou wouldst when i explained myself another time prepare to wonder and banish doubt now belford i shall expect that she will show some concern at the broken vessel as it may be attended with fatal effects especially to one so fiery in his temper as i have the reputation to be thought to be and the rather as i shall calmly attribute the accident to the harasses and doubts under which i have laboured for some time past and this will be a further proof of my love and will demand a grateful return and what then thou egregious contriver why then i shall have the less remorse if i am to use a little violence for can she deserve compassion who shows none and what if she shows a great deal of concern then shall i be in hopes of building on a good foundation love hides a multitude of faults and diminishes those it cannot hide love when acknowledged authorizes freedom and freedom begets freedom and i shall then see how far i can go well but lovelace how the deuce wilt thou with that full health and vigour of constitution and with that bloom in thy face make any body believe thou art sick how why take a few grains of ipecacuanha enough to make me reach like a fury good but how wilt thou manage to bring up blood and not hurt thyself foolish fellow are there no pigeons and chickens in every poulterers shop cry thy mercy but then i will be persuaded by mrs sinclair that i have of late confined myself too much and so will have a chair called and be carried to the park where i will try to walk half the length of the mall or so and in my return amuse myself at whites or the cocoa and what will this do questioning again i am afraid thourt an infidel belford why then shall i not know if my beloved offers to go out in my absence and shall i not see whether she receives me with tenderness at my return but this is not all i have a foreboding that something affecting will happen while i am out but of this more in its place and now belford wilt thou or wilt thou not allow that it is a right thing to be sick lord jack so much delight do i take in my contrivances that i shall be half sorry when the occasion for them is over for never never shall i again have such charming exercise for my invention mean time these plaguy women are so impertinent so full of reproaches that i know not how to do any thing but curse them and then truly they are for helping me out with some of their trite and vulgar artifices sally particularly who pretends to be a mighty contriver has just now in an insolent manner told me on my rejecting her proffered aids that i had no mind to conquer and that i was so wicked as to intend to marry though i would not own it to her because this little devil made her first sacrifice at my altar she thinks she may take any liberty with me and what makes her outrageous at times is that i have for a long time studiously as she says slighted her tooreadilyoffered favours but is it not very impudent in her to think that i will be any mans successor it is not come to that neither this thou knowest was always my rule once any other mans and i know it and never more mine it is for such as thou and thy brethren to take up with harlots i have been always aiming at the merit of a first discoverer the more devil i perhaps thou wilt say to endeavour to corrupt the uncorrupted but i say not since hence i have but very few adulteries to answer for one affair indeed at paris with a married lady i believe i never told thee of it touched my conscience a little yet brought on by the spirit of intrigue more than by sheer wickedness ill give it thee in brief a french marquis somewhat in years employed by his court in a public function at that of madrid had put his charming young newmarried wife under the controul and wardship as i may say of his insolent sister an old prude i saw the lady at the opera i liked her at first sight and better at second when i knew the situation she was in so pretending to make my addresses to the prude got admittance to both the first thing i had to do was to compliment the prude into shyness by complaints of shyness next to take advantage of the marquises situation between her husbands jealousy and his sisters arrogance and to inspire her with resentment and as i hoped with a regard to my person the french ladies have no dislike to intrigue the sister began to suspect me the lady had no mind to part with the company of the only man who had been permitted to visit her and told me of her sisters suspicions i put her upon concealing the prude as if unknown to me in a closet in one of her own apartments locking her in and putting the key in her own pocket and she was to question me on the sincerity of my professions to her sister in her sisters hearing she complied my mistress was locked up the lady and i took our seats i owned fervent love and made high professions for the marquise put it home to me the prude was delighted with what she heard and how dost thou think it ended i took my advantage of the lady herself who durst not for her life cry out and drew her after me to the next apartment on pretence of going to seek her sister who all the time was locked up in the closet no woman ever gave me a private meeting for nothing my dearest miss harlowe excepted my ingenuity obtained my pardon the lady being unable to forbear laughing throughout the whole affair to find both so uncommonly tricked her gaoleress her prisoner safe locked up and as much pleased as either of us the english jack do not often outwit the french we had contrivances afterwards equally ingenious in which the lady the ice once broken once subdued always subdued cooperated but a more tender telltale revealed the secret revealed it before the marquise could cover the disgrace the sister was inveterate the husband irreconcilable in every respect unfit for a husband even for a french one made perhaps more delicate to these particulars by the customs of a people among whom he was then resident so contrary to those of his own countrymen she was obliged to throw herself into my protection nor thought herself unhappy in it till childbed pangs seized her then penitence and death overtook her the same hour excuse a tear belford she deserved a better fate what hath such a vile inexorable husband to answer for the sister was punished effectually that pleases me on reflection the sister effectually punished but perhaps i have told thee this story before end of vol
