after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of i was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum in company with my friend c auguste dupin in his little back library or bookcloset au troisiкme no rue dunфt faubourg st germain for one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence while each to any casual observer might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber for myself however i was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening i mean the affair of the rue morgue and the mystery attending the murder of marie rogкt i looked upon it therefore as something of a coincidence when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance monsieur g the prefect of the parisian police we gave him a hearty welcome for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man and we had not seen him for several years we had been sitting in the dark and dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp but sat down again without doing so upon gs saying that he had called to consult us or rather to ask the opinion of my friend about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble if it is any point requiring reflection observed dupin as he forebore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark that is another of your odd notions said the prefect who had a fashion of calling every thing odd that was beyond his comprehension and thus lived amid an absolute legion of oddities very true said dupin as he supplied his visiter with a pipe and rolled towards him a comfortable chair and what is the difficulty now i asked nothing more in the assassination way i hope oh no nothing of that nature the fact is the business is very simple indeed and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves but then i thought dupin would like to hear the details of it because it is so excessively odd simple and odd said dupin why yes and not exactly that either the fact is we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet baffles us altogether perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault said my friend what nonsense you do talk replied the prefect laughing heartily perhaps the mystery is a little too plain said dupin oh good heavens who ever heard of such an idea a little too selfevident ha ha haha ha haho ho ho roared our visiter profoundly amused oh dupin you will be the death of me yet and what after all is the matter on hand i asked why i will tell you replied the prefect as he gave a long steady and contemplative puff and settled himself in his chair i will tell you in a few words but before i begin let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that i should most probably lose the position i now hold were it known that i confided it to any one proceed said i or not said dupin well then i have received personal information from a very high quarter that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments the individual who purloined it is known this beyond a doubt he was seen to take it it is known also that it still remains in his possession how is this known asked dupin it is clearly inferred replied the prefect from the nature of the document and from the nonappearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robbers possession that is to say from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it be a little more explicit i said well i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy still i do not quite understand said dupin no well the disclosure of the document to a third person who shall be nameless would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized but this ascendancy i interposed would depend upon the robbers knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber who would dare the thief said g is the minister d who dares all things those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man the method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold the document in questiona letter to be frankhad been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer she was forced to place it open as it was upon a table the address however was uppermost and the contents thus unexposed the letter escaped notice at this juncture enters the minister d his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper recognises the handwriting of the address observes the confusion of the personage addressed and fathoms her secret after some business transactions hurried through in his ordinary manner he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question opens it pretends to read it and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other again he converses for some fifteen minutes upon the public affairs at length in taking leave he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim its rightful owner saw but of course dared not call attention to the act in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow the minister decamped leaving his own letterone of no importanceupon the table here then said dupin to me you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy completethe robbers knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber yes replied the prefect and the power thus attained has for some months past been wielded for political purposes to a very dangerous extent the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced every day of the necessity of reclaiming her letter but this of course cannot be done openly in fine driven to despair she has committed the matter to me than whom said dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no more sagacious agent could i suppose be desired or even imagined you flatter me replied the prefect but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained it is clear said i as you observe that the letter is still in possession of the minister since it is this possession and not any employment of the letter which bestows the power with the employment the power departs true said g and upon this conviction i proceeded my first care was to make thorough search of the ministers hotel and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge beyond all things i have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design but said i you are quite au fait in these investigations the parisian police have done this thing often before o yes and for this reason i did not despair the habits of the minister gave me too a great advantage he is frequently absent from home all night his servants are by no means numerous they sleep at a distance from their masters apartment and being chiefly neapolitans are readily made drunk i have keys as you know with which i can open any chamber or cabinet in paris for three months a night has not passed during the greater part of which i have not been engaged personally in ransacking the d hotel my honor is interested and to mention a great secret the reward is enormous so i did not abandon the search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself i fancy that i have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed but is it not possible i suggested that although the letter may be in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises this is barely possible said dupin the present peculiar condition of affairs at court and especially of those intrigues in which d is known to be involved would render the instant availability of the documentits susceptibility of being produced at a moments noticea point of nearly equal importance with its possession its susceptibility of being produced said i that is to say of being destroyed said dupin true i observed the paper is clearly then upon the premises as for its being upon the person of the minister we may consider that as out of the question entirely said the prefect he has been twice waylaid as if by footpads and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection you might have spared yourself this trouble said dupin d i presume is not altogether a fool and if not must have anticipated these waylayings as a matter of course not altogether a fool said g but then hes a poet which i take to be only one remove from a fool true said dupin after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum although i have been guilty of certain doggrel myself suppose you detail said i the particulars of your search why the fact is we took our time and we searched every where i have had long experience in these affairs i took the entire building room by room devoting the nights of a whole week to each we examined first the furniture of each apartment we opened every possible drawer and i presume you know that to a properly trained police agent such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible any man is a dolt who permits a secret drawer to escape him in a search of this kind the thing is so plain there is a certain amount of bulkof spaceto be accounted for in every cabinet then we have accurate rules the fiftieth part of a line could not escape us after the cabinets we took the chairs the cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ from the tables we removed the tops why so sometimes the top of a table or other similarly arranged piece of furniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article then the leg is excavated the article deposited within the cavity and the top replaced the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way but could not the cavity be detected by sounding i asked by no means if when the article is deposited a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it besides in our case we were obliged to proceed without noise but you could not have removedyou could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention a letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knittingneedle and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair for example you did not take to pieces all the chairs certainly not but we did betterwe examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every description of furniture by the aid of a most powerful microscope had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly a single grain of gimletdust for example would have been as obvious as an apple any disorder in the glueingany unusual gaping in the jointswould have sufficed to insure detection i presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the plates and you probed the beds and the bedclothes as well as the curtains and carpets that of course and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way then we examined the house itself we divided its entire surface into compartments which we numbered so that none might be missed then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises including the two houses immediately adjoining with the microscope as before the two houses adjoining i exclaimed you must have had a great deal of trouble we had but the reward offered is prodigious you include the grounds about the houses all the grounds are paved with brick they gave us comparatively little trouble we examined the moss between the bricks and found it undisturbed you looked among d s papers of course and into the books of the library certainly we opened every package and parcel we not only opened every book but we turned over every leaf in each volume not contenting ourselves with a mere shake according to the fashion of some of our police officers we also measured the thickness of every bookcover with the most accurate admeasurement and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope had any of the bindings been recently meddled with it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation some five or six volumes just from the hands of the binder we carefully probed longitudinally with the needles you explored the floors beneath the carpets beyond doubt we removed every carpet and examined the boards with the microscope and the paper on the walls yes you looked into the cellars we did then i said you have been making a miscalculation and the letter is not upon the premises as you suppose i fear you are right there said the prefect and now dupin what would you advise me to do to make a thorough research of the premises that is absolutely needless replied g i am not more sure that i breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel i have no better advice to give you said dupin you have of course an accurate description of the letter oh yesand here the prefect producing a memorandumbook proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal and especially of the external appearance of the missing document soon after finishing the perusal of this description he took his departure more entirely depressed in spirits than i had ever known the good gentleman before in about a month afterwards he paid us another visit and found us occupied very nearly as before he took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation at length i said well but g what of the purloined letter i presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the minister confound him say iyes i made the reexamination however as dupin suggestedbut it was all labor lost as i knew it would be how much was the reward offered did you say asked dupin why a very great deala very liberal rewardi dont like to say how much precisely but one thing i will say that i wouldnt mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter the fact is it is becoming of more and more importance every day and the reward has been lately doubled if it were trebled however i could do no more than i have done why yes said dupin drawlingly between the whiffs of his meerschaum i reallythink g you have not exerted yourselfto the utmost in this matter you mightdo a little more i think eh howin what way whypuff puffyou mightpuff puffemploy counsel in the matter ehpuff puff puff do you remember the story they tell of abernethy no hang abernethy to be sure hang him and welcome but once upon a time a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this abernethy for a medical opinion getting up for this purpose an ordinary conversation in a private company he insinuated his case to the physician as that of an imaginary individual we will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such and such now doctor what would you have directed him to take take said abernethy why take advice to be sure but said the prefect a little discomposed i am perfectly willing to take advice and to pay for it i would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter in that case replied dupin opening a drawer and producing a checkbook you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned when you have signed it i will hand you the letter i was astounded the prefect appeared absolutely thunderstricken for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets then apparently recovering himself in some measure he seized a pen and after several pauses and vacant stares finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs and handed it across the table to dupin the latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocketbook then unlocking an escritoire took thence a letter and gave it to the prefect this functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy opened it with a trembling hand cast a rapid glance at its contents and then scrambling and struggling to the door rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house without having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill up the check when he had gone my friend entered into some explanations the parisian police he said are exceedingly able in their way they are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand thus when g detailed to us his made of searching the premises at the hotel d i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigationso far as his labors extended so far as his labors extended said i yes said dupin the measures adopted were not only the best of their kind but carried out to absolute perfection had the letter been deposited within the range of their search these fellows would beyond a question have found it i merely laughedbut he seemed quite serious in all that he said the measures then he continued were good in their kind and well executed their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and to the man a certain set of highly ingenious resources are with the prefect a sort of procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts his designs but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he i knew one about eight years of age whose success at guessing in the game of even and odd attracted universal admiration this game is simple and is played with marbles one player holds in his hand a number of these toys and demands of another whether that number is even or odd if the guess is right the guesser wins one if wrong he loses one the boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the school of course he had some principle of guessing and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents for example an arrant simpleton is his opponent and holding up his closed hand asks are they even or odd our schoolboy replies odd and loses but upon the second trial he wins for he then says to himself the simpleton had them even upon the first trial and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second i will therefore guess oddhe guesses odd and wins now with a simpleton a degree above the first he would have reasoned thus this fellow finds that in the first instance i guessed odd and in the second he will propose to himself upon the first impulse a simple variation from even to odd as did the first simpleton but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before i will therefore guess evenhe guesses even and wins now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy whom his fellows termed luckywhat in its last analysis is it it is merely i said an identification of the reasoners intellect with that of his opponent it is said dupin and upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted i received answer as follows when i wish to find out how wise or how stupid or how good or how wicked is any one or what are his thoughts at the moment i fashion the expression of my face as accurately as possible in accordance with the expression of his and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart as if to match or correspond with the expression this response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to rochefoucault to la bougive to machiavelli and to campanella and the identification i said of the reasoners intellect with that of his opponent depends if i understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the opponents intellect is admeasured for its practical value it depends upon this replied dupin and the prefect and his cohort fail so frequently first by default of this identification and secondly by illadmeasurement or rather through nonadmeasurement of the intellect with which they are engaged they consider only their own ideas of ingenuity and in searching for anything hidden advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it they are right in this muchthat their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own the felon foils them of course this always happens when it is above their own and very usually when it is below they have no variation of principle in their investigations at best when urged by some unusual emergencyby some extraordinary rewardthey extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice without touching their principles what for example in this case of d has been done to vary the principle of action what is all this boring and probing and sounding and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square incheswhat is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity to which the prefect in the long routine of his duty has been accustomed do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter not exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chairlegbut at least in some outoftheway hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlethole bored in a chairleg and do you not see also that such recherchйs nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects for in all cases of concealment a disposal of the article concealeda disposal of it in this recherchй manner is in the very first instance presumable and presumed and thus its discovery depends not at all upon the acumen but altogether upon the mere care patience and determination of the seekers and where the case is of importanceor what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes when the reward is of magnitude the qualities in question have never been known to fail you will now understand what i meant in suggesting that had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits of the prefects examinationin other words had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the prefectits discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question this functionary however has been thoroughly mystified and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the minister is a fool because he has acquired renown as a poet all fools are poets this the prefect feels and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools but is this really the poet i asked there are two brothers i know and both have attained reputation in letters the minister i believe has written learnedly on the differential calculus he is a mathematician and no poet you are mistaken i know him well he is both as poet and mathematician he would reason well as mere mathematician he could not have reasoned at all and thus would have been at the mercy of the prefect you surprise me i said by these opinions which have been contradicted by the voice of the world you do not mean to set at naught the welldigested idea of centuries the mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence il y a а pariиr replied dupin quoting from chamfort que toute idйe publique toute convention reзue est une sottise car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre the mathematicians i grant you have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth with an art worthy a better cause for example they have insinuated the term analysis into application to algebra the french are the originators of this particular deception but if a term is of any importanceif words derive any value from applicabilitythen analysis conveys algebra about as much as in latin ambitus implies ambition religio religion or homines honesti a set of honorablemen you have a quarrel on hand i see said i with some of the algebraists of paris but proceed i dispute the availability and thus the value of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical i dispute in particular the reason educed by mathematical study the mathematics are the science of form and quantity mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity the great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra are abstract or general truths and this error is so egregious that i am confounded at the universality with which it has been received mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth what is true of relationof form and quantityis often grossly false in regard to morals for example in this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole in chemistry also the axiom fails in the consideration of motive it fails for two motives each of a given value have not necessarily a value when united equal to the sum of their values apart there are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation but the mathematician argues from his finite truths through habit as if they were of an absolutely general applicabilityas the world indeed imagines them to be bryant in his very learned mythology mentions an analogous source of error when he says that although the pagan fables are not believed yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as existing realities with the algebraists however who are pagans themselves the pagan fables are believed and the inferences are made not so much through lapse of memory as through an unaccountable addling of the brains in short i never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that xpx was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q say to one of these gentlemen by way of experiment if you please that you believe occasions may occur where xpx is not altogether equal to q and having made him understand what you mean get out of his reach as speedily as convenient for beyond doubt he will endeavor to knock you down i mean to say continued dupin while i merely laughed at his last observations that if the minister had been no more than a mathematician the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check i know him however as both mathematician and poet and my measures were adapted to his capacity with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded i knew him as a courtier too and as a bold intriguant such a man i considered could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action he could not have failed to anticipateand events have proved that he did not fail to anticipatethe waylayings to which he was subjected he must have foreseen i reflected the secret investigations of his premises his frequent absences from home at night which were hailed by the prefect as certain aids to his success i regarded only as ruses to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g in fact did finally arrivethe conviction that the letter was not upon the premises i felt also that the whole train of thought which i was at some pains in detailing to you just now concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealedi felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment he could not i reflected be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes to the probes to the gimlets and to the microscopes of the prefect i saw in fine that he would be driven as a matter of course to simplicity if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice you will remember perhaps how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested upon our first interview that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very selfevident yes said i i remember his merriment well i really thought he would have fallen into convulsions the material world continued dupin abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor or simile may be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description the principle of the vis inertiж for example seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics it is not more true in the former that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty than it is in the latter that intellects of the vaster capacity while more forcible more constant and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade are yet the less readily moved and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress again have you ever noticed which of the street signs over the shopdoors are the most attractive of attention i have never given the matter a thought i said there is a game of puzzles he resumed which is played upon a map one party playing requires another to find a given wordthe name of town river state or empireany word in short upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart a novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names but the adept selects such words as stretch in large characters from one end of the chart to the other these like the overlargely lettered signs and placards of the street escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably selfevident but this is a point it appears somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the prefect he never once thought it probable or possible that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it but the more i reflected upon the daring dashing and discriminating ingenuity of d upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand if he intended to use it to good purpose and upon the decisive evidence obtained by the prefect that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitarys ordinary searchthe more satisfied i became that to conceal this letter the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all full of these ideas i prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles and called one fine morning quite by accident at the ministerial hotel i found d at home yawning lounging and dawdling as usual and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui he is perhaps the most really energetic human being now alivebut that is only when nobody sees him to be even with him i complained of my weak eyes and lamented the necessity of the spectacles under cover of which i cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host i paid especial attention to a large writingtable near which he sat and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other papers with one or two musical instruments and a few books here however after a long and very deliberate scrutiny i saw nothing to excite particular suspicion at length my eyes in going the circuit of the room fell upon a trumpery fillagree cardrack of pasteboard that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece in this rack which had three or four compartments were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter this last was much soiled and crumpled it was torn nearly in two across the middleas if a design in the first instance to tear it entirely up as worthless had been altered or stayed in the second it had a large black seal bearing the d cipher very conspicuously and was addressed in a diminutive female hand to d the minister himself it was thrust carelessly and even as it seemed contemptuously into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack no sooner had i glanced at this letter than i concluded it to be that of which i was in search to be sure it was to all appearance radically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so minute a description here the seal was large and black with the d cipher there it was small and red with the ducal arms of the s family here the address to the minister diminutive and feminine there the superscription to a certain royal personage was markedly bold and decided the size alone formed a point of correspondence but then the radicalness of these differences which was excessive the dirt the soiled and torn condition of the paper so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of d and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document these things together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document full in the view of every visiter and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which i had previously arrived these things i say were strongly corroborative of suspicion in one who came with the intention to suspect i protracted my visit as long as possible and while i maintained a most animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which i knew well had never failed to interest and excite him i kept my attention really riveted upon the letter in this examination i committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack and also fell at length upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt i might have entertained in scrutinizing the edges of the paper i observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary they presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper having been once folded and pressed with a folder is refolded in a reversed direction in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold this discovery was sufficient it was clear to me that the letter had been turned as a glove inside out redirected and resealed i bade the minister good morning and took my departure at once leaving a gold snuffbox upon the table the next morning i called for the snuffbox when we resumed quite eagerly the conversation of the preceding day while thus engaged however a loud report as if of a pistol was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams and the shoutings of a terrified mob d rushed to a casement threw it open and looked out in the meantime i stepped to the cardrack took the letter put it in my pocket and replaced it by a facsimile so far as regards externals which i had carefully prepared at my lodgingsimitating the d cipher very readily by means of a seal formed of bread the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket he had fired it among a crowd of women and children it proved however to have been without ball and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard when he had gone d came from the window whither i had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view soon afterwards i bade him farewell the pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay but what purpose had you i asked in replacing the letter by a facsimile would it not have been better at the first visit to have seized it openly and departed d replied dupin is a desperate man and a man of nerve his hotel too is not without attendants devoted to his interests had i made the wild attempt you suggest i might never have left the ministerial presence alive the good people of paris might have heard of me no more but i had an object apart from these considerations you know my political prepossessions in this matter i act as a partisan of the lady concerned for eighteen months the minister has had her in his power she has now him in herssince being unaware that the letter is not in his possession he will proceed with his exactions as if it was thus will he inevitably commit himself at once to his political destruction his downfall too will not be more precipitate than awkward it is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus averni but in all kinds of climbing as catalani said of singing it is far more easy to get up than to come down in the present instance i have no sympathyat least no pityfor him who descends he is that monstrum horrendum an unprincipled man of genius i confess however that i should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts when being defied by her whom the prefect terms a certain personage he is reduced to opening the letter which i left for him in the cardrack how did you put any thing particular in it whyit did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blankthat would have been insulting d at vienna once did me an evil turn which i told him quite goodhumoredly that i should remember so as i knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him i thought it a pity not to give him a clue he is well acquainted with my ms and i just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words un dessein si funeste sil nest digne datrйe est digne de thyeste they are to be found in crebillons atrйe end of text the thousandandsecond tale of scheherazade truth is stranger than fiction old saying having had occasion lately in the course of some oriental investigations to consult the tellmenow isitsoornot a work which like the zohar of simeon jochaides is scarcely known at all even in europe and which has never been quoted to my knowledge by any american if we except perhaps the author of the curiosities of american literature having had occasion i say to turn over some pages of the first mentioned very remarkable work i was not a little astonished to discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error respecting the fate of the viziers daughter scheherazade as that fate is depicted in the arabian nights and that the denouement there given if not altogether inaccurate as far as it goes is at least to blame in not having gone very much farther for full information on this interesting topic i must refer the inquisitive reader to the isitsoornot itself but in the meantime i shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what i there discovered it will be remembered that in the usual version of the tales a certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen not only puts her to death but makes a vow by his beard and the prophet to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions and the next morning to deliver her up to the executioner having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter and with a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense he was interrupted one afternoon no doubt at his prayers by a visit from his grand vizier to whose daughter it appears there had occurred an idea her name was scheherazade and her idea was that she would either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty or perish after the approved fashion of all heroines in the attempt accordingly and although we do not find it to be leapyear which makes the sacrifice more meritorious she deputes her father the grand vizier to make an offer to the king of her hand this hand the king eagerly accepts he had intended to take it at all events and had put off the matter from day to day only through fear of the vizier but in accepting it now he gives all parties very distinctly to understand that grand vizier or no grand vizier he has not the slightest design of giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges when therefore the fair scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king and did actually marry him despite her fathers excellent advice not to do any thing of the kind when she would and did marry him i say will i nill i it was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow it seems however that this politic damsel who had been reading machiavelli beyond doubt had a very ingenious little plot in her mind on the night of the wedding she contrived upon i forget what specious pretence to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed and a little before cockcrowing she took care to awaken the good monarch her husband who bore her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on the morrow she managed to awaken him i say although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion he slept well by the profound interest of a story about a rat and a black cat i think which she was narrating all in an undertone of course to her sister when the day broke it so happened that this history was not altogether finished and that scheherazade in the nature of things could not finish it just then since it was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung a thing very little more pleasant than hanging only a trifle more genteel the kings curiosity however prevailing i am sorry to say even over his sound religious principles induced him for this once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black cat a black cat i think it was and the rat the night having arrived however the lady scheherazade not only put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat the rat was blue but before she well knew what she was about found herself deep in the intricacies of a narration having reference if i am not altogether mistaken to a pink horse with green wings that went in a violent manner by clockwork and was wound up with an indigo key with this history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the other and as the day broke before its conclusion notwithstanding all the queens endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as before for twentyfour hours the next night there happened a similar accident with a similar result and then the next and then again the next so that in the end the good monarch having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time or gets himself absolved of it in the regular way or what is more probable breaks it outright as well as the head of his father confessor at all events scheherazade who being lineally descended from eve fell heir perhaps to the whole seven baskets of talk which the latter lady we all know picked up from under the trees in the garden of edenscheherazade i say finally triumphed and the tariff upon beauty was repealed now this conclusion which is that of the story as we have it upon record is no doubt excessively proper and pleasant but alas like a great many pleasant things is more pleasant than true and i am indebted altogether to the isitsoornot for the means of correcting the error le mieux says a french proverb est lennemi du bien and in mentioning that scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk i should have added that she put them out at compound interest until they amounted to seventyseven my dear sister said she on the thousandandsecond night i quote the language of the isitsoornot at this point verbatim my dear sister said she now that all this little difficulty about the bowstring has blown over and that this odious tax is so happily repealed i feel that i have been guilty of great indiscretion in withholding from you and the king who i am sorry to say snores a thing no gentleman would do the full conclusion of sinbad the sailor this person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which i related but the truth is i felt sleepy on the particular night of their narration and so was seduced into cutting them short a grievous piece of misconduct for which i only trust that allah will forgive me but even yet it is not too late to remedy my great neglect and as soon as i have given the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise i will forthwith entertain you and him if he pleases with the sequel of this very remarkable story hereupon the sister of scheherazade as i have it from the isitsoornot expressed no very particular intensity of gratification but the king having been sufficiently pinched at length ceased snoring and finally said hum and then hoo when the queen understanding these words which are no doubt arabic to signify that he was all attention and would do his best not to snore any more the queen i say having arranged these matters to her satisfaction reentered thus at once into the history of sinbad the sailor at length in my old age these are the words of sinbad himself as retailed by scheherazade at length in my old age and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home i became once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries and one day without acquainting any of my family with my design i packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious and least bulky and engaged a porter to carry them went with him down to the seashore to await the arrival of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region which i had not as yet explored having deposited the packages upon the sands we sat down beneath some trees and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship but during several hours we saw none whatever at length i fancied that i could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound and the porter after listening awhile declared that he also could distinguish it presently it grew louder and then still louder so that we could have no doubt that the object which caused it was approaching us at length on the edge of the horizon we discovered a black speck which rapidly increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster swimming with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea it came toward us with inconceivable swiftness throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast and illuminating all that part of the sea through which it passed with a long line of fire that extended far off into the distance as the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly its length was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow and it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace o most sublime and munificent of the caliphs its body which was unlike that of ordinary fishes was as solid as a rock and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated above the water with the exception of a narrow bloodred streak that completely begirdled it the belly which floated beneath the surface and of which we could get only a glimpse now and then as the monster rose and fell with the billows was entirely covered with metallic scales of a color like that of the moon in misty weather the back was flat and nearly white and from it there extended upwards of six spines about half the length of the whole body the horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive but as if to make up for this deficiency it was provided with at least four score of eyes that protruded from their sockets like those of the green dragonfly and were arranged all around the body in two rows one above the other and parallel to the bloodred streak which seemed to answer the purpose of an eyebrow two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger than the others and had the appearance of solid gold although this beast approached us as i have before said with the greatest rapidity it must have been moved altogether by necromancyfor it had neither fins like a fish nor webfeet like a duck nor wings like the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike only not far from the latter were two small holes that served for nostrils and through which the monster puffed out its thick breath with prodigious violence and with a shrieking disagreeable noise our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great but it was even surpassed by our astonishment when upon getting a nearer look we perceived upon the creatures back a vast number of animals about the size and shape of men and altogether much resembling them except that they wore no garments as men do being supplied by nature no doubt with an ugly uncomfortable covering a good deal like cloth but fitting so tight to the skin as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward and put them apparently to severe pain on the very tips of their heads were certain squarelooking boxes which at first sight i thought might have been intended to answer as turbans but i soon discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid and i therefore concluded they were contrivances designed by their great weight to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders around the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars badges of servitude no doubt such as we keep on our dogs only much wider and infinitely stiffer so that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their noses a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful if not positively in an awful degree when the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent and emitted from it a terrible flash of fire accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke and a noise that i can compare to nothing but thunder as the smoke cleared away we saw one of the odd mananimals standing near the head of the large beast with a trumpet in his hand through which putting it to his mouth he presently addressed us in loud harsh and disagreeable accents that perhaps we should have mistaken for language had they not come altogether through the nose being thus evidently spoken to i was at a loss how to reply as i could in no manner understand what was said and in this difficulty i turned to the porter who was near swooning through affright and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was what it wanted and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed upon its back to this the porter replied as well as he could for trepidation that he had once before heard of this seabeast that it was a cruel demon with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire created by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind that the things upon its back were vermin such as sometimes infest cats and dogs only a little larger and more savage and that these vermin had their uses however evil for through the torture they caused the beast by their nibbling and stingings it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill and so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii this account determined me to take to my heels and without once even looking behind me i ran at full speed up into the hills while the porter ran equally fast although nearly in an opposite direction so that by these means he finally made his escape with my bundles of which i have no doubt he took excellent care although this is a point i cannot determine as i do not remember that i ever beheld him again for myself i was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the menvermin who had come to the shore in boats that i was very soon overtaken bound hand and foot and conveyed to the beast which immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea i now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to peril my life in such adventures as this but regret being useless i made the best of my condition and exerted myself to secure the goodwill of the mananimal that owned the trumpet and who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows i succeeded so well in this endeavor that in a few days the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language so that at length i was enabled to converse with it readily and came to make it comprehend the ardent desire i had of seeing the world washish squashish squeak sinbad heydiddle diddle grunt unt grumble hiss fiss whiss said he to me one day after dinnerbut i beg a thousand pardons i had forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the cockneighs so the mananimals were called i presume because their language formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of the rooster with your permission i will translate washish squashish and so forth that is to say i am happy to find my dear sinbad that you are really a very excellent fellow we are now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the globe and since you are so desirous of seeing the world i will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the beast when the lady scheherazade had proceeded thus far relates the isitsoornot the king turned over from his left side to his right and said it is in fact very surprising my dear queen that you omitted hitherto these latter adventures of sinbad do you know i think them exceedingly entertaining and strange the king having thus expressed himself we are told the fair scheherazade resumed her history in the following words sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative to the caliphi thanked the mananimal for its kindness and soon found myself very much at home on the beast which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean although the surface of the latter is in that part of the world by no means flat but round like a pomegranate so that we went so to say either up hill or down hill all the time that i think was very singular interrupted the king nevertheless it is quite true replied scheherazade i have my doubts rejoined the king but pray be so good as to go on with the story i will said the queen the beast continued sinbad to the caliph swam as i have related up hill and down hill until at length we arrived at an island many hundreds of miles in circumference but which nevertheless had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony of little things like caterpillars hum said the king leaving this island said sinbad for scheherazade it must be understood took no notice of her husbands illmannered ejaculation leaving this island we came to another where the forests were of solid stone and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finesttempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut them down hum said the king again but scheherazade paying him no attention continued in the language of sinbad passing beyond this last island we reached a country where there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the bowels of the earth and that contained a greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all damascus and bagdad from the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads of gems liked diamonds but larger than men and in among the streets of towers and pyramids and temples there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony and swarming with fish that had no eyes hum said the king we then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty mountain down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted metal some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long while from an abyss on the summit issued so vast a quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens and it became darker than the darkest midnight so that when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain it was impossible to see the whitest object however close we held it to our eyes hum said the king after quitting this coast the beast continued his voyage until we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed for we here saw a great lake at the bottom of which more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water there flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees hoo said the king some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel just as our own does feather fiddle de dee said the king proceeding still in the same direction we presently arrived at the most magnificent region in the whole world through it there meandered a glorious river for several thousands of miles this river was of unspeakable depth and of a transparency richer than that of amber it was from three to six miles in width and its banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height were crowned with everblossoming trees and perpetual sweetscented flowers that made the whole territory one gorgeous garden but the name of this luxuriant land was the kingdom of horror and to enter it was inevitable death humph said the king we left this kingdom in great haste and after some days came to another where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads these hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil of a funnel shape and line the sides of them with rocks so disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly when trodden upon by other animals thus precipitating them into the monsters dens where their blood is immediately sucked and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an immense distance from the caverns of death pooh said the king continuing our progress we perceived a district with vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air there were others that sprang from the substance of other vegetables others that derived their substance from the bodies of living animals and then again there were others that glowed all over with intense fire others that moved from place to place at pleasure and what was still more wonderful we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved their limbs at will and had moreover the detestable passion of mankind for enslaving other creatures and confining them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks pshaw said the king quitting this land we soon arrived at another in which the bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition that they give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men of the empire the king of the place having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult problems they were solved upon the spot the one by the bees and the other by the birds but the king keeping their solution a secret it was only after the most profound researches and labor and the writing of an infinity of big books during a long series of years that the menmathematicians at length arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the bees and by the birds oh my said the king we had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves close upon another from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth and two hundred and forty miles long so that although they flew a mile during every minute it required no less than four hours for the whole flock to pass over us in which there were several millions of millions of fowl oh fy said the king no sooner had we got rid of these birds which occasioned us great annoyance than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another kind and infinitely larger than even the rocs which i met in my former voyages for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your seraglio oh most munificent of caliphs this terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive but was fashioned entirely of belly which was of a prodigious fatness and roundness of a softlooking substance smooth shining and striped with various colors in its talons the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens a house from which it had knocked off the roof and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human beings who beyond doubt were in a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited them we shouted with all our might in the hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey but it merely gave a snort or puff as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand stuff said the king it was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity but which nevertheless was supported entirely upon the back of a skyblue cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns that now i believe said the king because i have read something of the kind before in a book we passed immediately beneath this continent swimming in between the legs of the cow and after some hours found ourselves in a wonderful country indeed which i was informed by the mananimal was his own native land inhabited by things of his own species this elevated the mananimal very much in my esteem and in fact i now began to feel ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which i had treated him for i found that the mananimals in general were a nation of the most powerful magicians who lived with worms in their brain which no doubt served to stimulate them by their painful writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of imagination nonsense said the king among the magicians were domesticated several animals of very singular kinds for example there was a huge horse whose bones were iron and whose blood was boiling water in place of corn he had black stones for his usual food and yet in spite of so hard a diet he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the grandest temple in this city at a rate surpassing that of the flight of most birds twattle said the king i saw also among these people a hen without feathers but bigger than a camel instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick her blood like that of the horse to whom in fact she was nearly related was boiling water and like him she ate nothing but wood or black stones this hen brought forth very frequently a hundred chickens in the day and after birth they took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of their mother fa lal said the king one of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and wood and leather and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would have beaten at chess all the race of mankind with the exception of the great caliph haroun alraschid another of these magi constructed of like material a creature that put to shame even the genius of him who made it for so great were its reasoning powers that in a second it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year but a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing that was neither man nor beast but which had brains of lead intermixed with a black matter like pitch and fingers that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies of the koran in an hour and this with so exquisite a precision that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair this thing was of prodigious strength so that it erected or overthrew the mightiest empires at a breath but its powers were exercised equally for evil and for good ridiculous said the king among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his veins the blood of the salamanders for he made no scruple of sitting down to smoke his chibouc in a redhot oven until his dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor another had the faculty of converting the common metals into gold without even looking at them during the process another had such a delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible another had such quickness of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic body while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred millions of times in a second absurd said the king another of these magicians by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet saw could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms kick out their legs fight or even get up and dance at his will another had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of the world to the other another had so long an arm that he could sit down in damascus and indite a letter at bagdad or indeed at any distance whatsoever another commanded the lightning to come down to him out of the heavens and it came at his call and served him for a plaything when it came another took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence another constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights another made ice in a redhot furnace another directed the sun to paint his portrait and the sun did another took this luminary with the moon and the planets and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy probed into their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were made but the whole nation is indeed of so surprising a necromantic ability that not even their infants nor their commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at all or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from the face of creation analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous results preposterous said the king the wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi continued scheherazade without being in any manner disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her husband the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and refined and would be every thing that is interesting and beautiful but for an unhappy fatality that besets them and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has hitherto been adequate to save some fatalities come in certain shapes and some in others but this of which i speak has come in the shape of a crotchet a what said the king a crotchet said scheherazade one of the evil genii who are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill has put it into the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the small of the back perfection of loveliness they say is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump having been long possessed of this idea and bolsters being cheap in that country the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from a dromedary stop said the king i cant stand that and i wont you have already given me a dreadful headache with your lies the day too i perceive is beginning to break how long have we been married my conscience is getting to be troublesome again and then that dromedary touch do you take me for a fool upon the whole you might as well get up and be throttled these words as i learn from the isitsoornot both grieved and astonished scheherazade but as she knew the king to be a man of scrupulous integrity and quite unlikely to forfeit his word she submitted to her fate with a good grace she derived however great consolation during the tightening of the bowstring from the reflection that much of the history remained still untold and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous reward in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures end of text a descent into the maelstrцm the ways of god in nature as in providence are not as our ways nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the vastness profundity and unsearchableness of his works which have a depth in them greater than the well of democritus joseph glanville we had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag for some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak not long ago said he at length and i could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons but about three years past there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal manor at least such as no man ever survived to tell ofand the six hours of deadly terror which i then endured have broken me up body and soul you suppose me a very old manbut i am not it took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white to weaken my limbs and to unstring my nerves so that i tremble at the least exertion and am frightened at a shadow do you know i can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy the little cliff upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edgethis little cliff arose a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink in truth so deeply was i excited by the perilous position of my companion that i fell at full length upon the ground clung to the shrubs around me and dared not even glance upward at the skywhile i struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds it was long before i could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance you must get over these fancies said the guide for i have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event i mentionedand to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye we are now he continued in that particularizing manner which distinguished himwe are now close upon the norwegian coastin the sixtyeighth degree of latitudein the great province of nordlandand in the dreary district of lofoden the mountain upon whose top we sit is helseggen the cloudy now raise yourself up a little higherhold on to the grass if you feel giddysoand look out beyond the belt of vapor beneath us into the sea i looked dizzily and beheld a wide expanse of ocean whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the nubian geographers account of the mare tenebrarum a panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive to the right and left as far as the eye could reach there lay outstretched like ramparts of the world lines of horridly black and beetling cliff whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its white and ghastly crest howling and shrieking forever just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea there was visible a small bleaklooking island or more properly its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped about two miles nearer the land arose another of smaller size hideously craggy and barren and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks the appearance of the ocean in the space between the more distant island and the shore had something very unusual about it although at the time so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a doublereefed trysail and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight still there was here nothing like a regular swell but only a short quick angry cross dashing of water in every directionas well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks the island in the distance resumed the old man is called by the norwegians vurrgh the one midway is moskoe that a mile to the northward is ambaaren yonder are islesen hotholm keildhelm suarven and buckholm farther offbetween moskoe and vurrghare otterholm flimen sandflesen and stockholm these are the true names of the placesbut why it has been thought necessary to name them at all is more than either you or i can understand do you hear anything do you see any change in the water we had now been about ten minutes upon the top of helseggen to which we had ascended from the interior of lofoden so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit as the old man spoke i became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an american prairie and at the same moment i perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward even while i gazed this current acquired a monstrous velocity each moment added to its speedto its headlong impetuosity in five minutes the whole sea as far as vurrgh was lashed into ungovernable fury but it was between moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway here the vast bed of the waters seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels burst suddenly into phrensied convulsionheaving boiling hissinggyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents in a few minutes more there came over the scene another radical alteration the general surface grew somewhat more smooth and the whirlpools one by one disappeared while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before these streaks at length spreading out to a great distance and entering into combination took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices and seemed to form the germ of another more vast suddenlyvery suddenlythis assumed a distinct and definite existence in a circle of more than a mile in diameter the edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel whose interior as far as the eye could fathom it was a smooth shining and jetblack wall of water inclined to the horizon at an angle of some fortyfive degrees speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice half shriek half roar such as not even the mighty cataract of niagara ever lifts up in its agony to heaven the mountain trembled to its very base and the rock rocked i threw myself upon my face and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation this said i at length to the old manthis can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the maelstrцm so it is sometimes termed said he we norwegians call it the moskoestrцm from the island of moskoe in the midway the ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what i saw that of jonas ramus which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence or of the horror of the sceneor of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder i am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it nor at what time but it could neither have been from the summit of helseggen nor during a storm there are some passages of his description nevertheless which may be quoted for their details although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle between lofoden and moskoe he says the depth of the water is between thirtysix and forty fathoms but on the other side toward ver vurrgh this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel without the risk of splitting on the rocks which happens even in the calmest weather when it is flood the stream runs up the country between lofoden and moskoe with a boisterous rapidity but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts the noise being heard several leagues off and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth that if a ship comes within its attraction it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom and there beat to pieces against the rocks and when the water relaxes the fragments thereof are thrown up again but these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood and in calm weather and last but a quarter of an hour its violence gradually returning when the stream is most boisterous and its fury heightened by a storm it is dangerous to come within a norway mile of it boats yachts and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach it likewise happens frequently that whales come too near the stream and are overpowered by its violence and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves a bear once attempting to swim from lofoden to moskoe was caught by the stream and borne down while he roared terribly so as to be heard on shore large stocks of firs and pine trees after being absorbed by the current rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them this plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks among which they are whirled to and fro this stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the seait being constantly high and low water every six hours in the year early in the morning of sexagesima sunday it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground in regard to the depth of the water i could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex the forty fathoms must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of moskoe or lofoden the depth in the centre of the moskoestrцm must be immeasurably greater and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of helseggen looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling phlegethon below i could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest jonas ramus records as a matter difficult of belief the anecdotes of the whales and the bears for it appeared to me in fact a selfevident thing that the largest ship of the line in existence coming within the influence of that deadly attraction could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane and must disappear bodily and at once the attempts to account for the phenomenonsome of which i remember seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusalnow wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect the idea generally received is that this as well as three smaller vortices among the ferroe islands have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling at flux and reflux against a ridge of rocks and shelves which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract and thus the higher the flood rises the deeper must the fall be and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experimentsthese are the words of the encyclopжdia britannica kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the maelstrцm is an abyss penetrating the globe and issuing in some very remote partthe gulf of bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance this opinion idle in itself was the one to which as i gazed my imagination most readily assented and mentioning it to the guide i was rather surprised to hear him say that although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the norwegians it nevertheless was not his own as to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it and here i agreed with himfor however conclusive on paper it becomes altogether unintelligible and even absurd amid the thunder of the abyss you have had a good look at the whirl now said the old man and if you will creep round this crag so as to get in its lee and deaden the roar of the water i will tell you a story that will convince you i ought to know something of the moskoestrцm i placed myself as desired and he proceeded myself and my two brothers once owned a schoonerrigged smack of about seventy tons burthen with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond moskoe nearly to vurrgh in all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing at proper opportunities if one has only the courage to attempt it but among the whole of the lofoden coastmen we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands as i tell you the usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward there fish can be got at all hours without much risk and therefore these places are preferred the choice spots over here among the rocks however not only yield the finest variety but in far greater abundance so that we often got in a single day what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week in fact we made it a matter of desperate speculationthe risk of life standing instead of labor and courage answering for capital we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this and it was our practice in fine weather to take advantage of the fifteen minutes slack to push across the main channel of the moskoestrцm far above the pool and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near otterholm or sandflesen where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere here we used to remain until nearly time for slackwater again when we weighed and made for home we never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and comingone that we felt sure would not fail us before our returnand we seldom made a miscalculation upon this point twice during six years we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm which is a rare thing indeed just about here and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week starving to death owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently that at length we fouled our anchor and dragged it if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currentshere today and gone tomorrowwhich drove us under the lee of flimen where by good luck we brought up i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered on the groundsit is a bad spot to be in even in good weatherbut we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the moskoestrцm itself without accident although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting and then we made rather less way than we could wish while the current rendered the smack unmanageable my eldest brother had a son eighteen years old and i had two stout boys of my own these would have been of great assistance at such times in using the sweeps as well as afterward in fishingbut somehow although we ran the risk ourselves we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the dangerfor after all is said and done it was a horrible danger and that is the truth it is now within a few days of three years since what i am going to tell you occurred it was on the tenth day of july a day which the people of this part of the world will never forgetfor it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens and yet all the morning and indeed until late in the afternoon there was a gentle and steady breeze from the southwest while the sun shone brightly so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow the three of usmy two brothers and myselfhad crossed over to the islands about two oclock p m and had soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish which we all remarked were more plenty that day than we had ever known them it was just seven by my watch when we weighed and started for home so as to make the worst of the strцm at slack water which we knew would be at eight we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter and for some time spanked along at a great rate never dreaming of danger for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it all at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over helseggen this was most unusualsomething that had never happened to us beforeand i began to feel a little uneasy without exactly knowing why we put the boat on the wind but could make no headway at all for the eddies and i was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage when looking astern we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular coppercolored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away and we were dead becalmed drifting about in every direction this state of things however did not last long enough to give us time to think about it in less than a minute the storm was upon usin less than two the sky was entirely overcastand what with this and the driving spray it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing the oldest seaman in norway never experienced any thing like it we had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us but at the first puff both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed offthe mainmast taking with it my youngest brother who had lashed himself to it for safety our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water it had a complete flush deck with only a small hatch near the bow and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the strцm by way of precaution against the chopping seas but for this circumstance we should have foundered at oncefor we lay entirely buried for some moments how my elder brother escaped destruction i cannot say for i never had an opportunity of ascertaining for my part as soon as i had let the foresail run i threw myself flat on deck with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow and with my hands grasping a ringbolt near the foot of the foremast it was mere instinct that prompted me to do thiswhich was undoubtedly the very best thing i could have donefor i was too much flurried to think for some moments we were completely deluged as i say and all this time i held my breath and clung to the bolt when i could stand it no longer i raised myself upon my knees still keeping hold with my hands and thus got my head clear presently our little boat gave herself a shake just as a dog does in coming out of the water and thus rid herself in some measure of the seas i was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done when i felt somebody grasp my arm it was my elder brother and my heart leaped for joy for i had made sure that he was overboardbut the next moment all this joy was turned into horrorfor he put his mouth close to my ear and screamed out the word moskoestrцm no one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment i shook from head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the ague i knew what he meant by that one word well enoughi knew what he wished to make me understand with the wind that now drove us on we were bound for the whirl of the strцm and nothing could save us you perceive that in crossing the strцm channel we always went a long way up above the whirl even in the calmest weather and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slackbut now we were driving right upon the pool itself and in such a hurricane as this to be sure i thought we shall get there just about the slackthere is some little hope in thatbut in the next moment i cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all i knew very well that we were doomed had we been ten times a ninetygun ship by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself or perhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it but at all events the seas which at first had been kept down by the wind and lay flat and frothing now got up into absolute mountains a singular change too had come over the heavens around in every direction it was still as black as pitch but nearly overhead there burst out all at once a circular rift of clear skyas clear as i ever sawand of a deep bright blueand through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that i never before knew her to wear she lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctnessbut oh god what a scene it was to light up i now made one or two attempts to speak to my brotherbut in some manner which i could not understand the din had so increased that i could not make him hear a single word although i screamed at the top of my voice in his ear presently he shook his head looking as pale as death and held up one of his finger as if to say listen at first i could not make out what he meantbut soon a hideous thought flashed upon me i dragged my watch from its fob it was not going i glanced at its face by the moonlight and then burst into tears as i flung it far away into the ocean it had run down at seven oclock we were behind the time of the slack and the whirl of the strцm was in full fury when a boat is well built properly trimmed and not deep laden the waves in a strong gale when she is going large seem always to slip from beneath herwhich appears very strange to a landsmanand this is what is called riding in sea phrase well so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter and bore us with it as it roseupupas if into the sky i would not have believed that any wave could rise so high and then down we came with a sweep a slide and a plunge that made me feel sick and dizzy as if i was falling from some lofty mountaintop in a dream but while we were up i had thrown a quick glance aroundand that one glance was all sufficient i saw our exact position in an instant the moskoestrцm whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead aheadbut no more like the everyday moskoestrцm than the whirl as you now see it is like a millrace if i had not known where we were and what we had to expect i should not have recognised the place at all as it was i involuntarily closed my eyes in horror the lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm it could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we suddenly felt the waves subside and were enveloped in foam the boat made a sharp half turn to larboard and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt at the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shrieksuch a sound as you might imagine given out by the wastepipes of many thousand steamvessels letting off their steam all together we were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl and i thought of course that another moment would plunge us into the abyssdown which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along the boat did not seem to sink into the water at all but to skim like an airbubble upon the surface of the surge her starboard side was next the whirl and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left it stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon it may appear strange but now when we were in the very jaws of the gulf i felt more composed than when we were only approaching it having made up my mind to hope no more i got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first i suppose it was despair that strung my nerves it may look like boastingbut what i tell you is truthi began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life in view of so wonderful a manifestation of gods power i do believe that i blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind after a little while i became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself i positively felt a wish to explore its depths even at the sacrifice i was going to make and my principal grief was that i should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries i should see these no doubt were singular fancies to occupy a mans mind in such extremityand i have often thought since that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little lightheaded there was another circumstance which tended to restore my selfpossession and this was the cessation of the wind which could not reach us in our present situationfor as you saw yourself the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean and this latter now towered above us a high black mountainous ridge if you have never been at sea in a heavy gale you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together they blind deafen and strangle you and take away all power of action or reflection but we were now in a great measure rid of these annoyancesjust us deathcondemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say we careered round and round for perhaps an hour flying rather than floating getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge all this time i had never let go of the ringbolt my brother was at the stern holding on to a small empty watercask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us as we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this and made for the ring from which in the agony of his terror he endeavored to force my hands as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp i never felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt this actalthough i knew he was a madman when he did ita raving maniac through sheer fright i did not care however to contest the point with him i knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all so i let him have the bolt and went astern to the cask this there was no great difficulty in doing for the smack flew round steadily enough and upon an even keelonly swaying to and fro with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl scarcely had i secured myself in my new position when we gave a wild lurch to starboard and rushed headlong into the abyss i muttered a hurried prayer to god and thought all was over as i felt the sickening sweep of the descent i had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel and closed my eyes for some seconds i dared not open themwhile i expected instant destruction and wondered that i was not already in my deathstruggles with the water but moment after moment elapsed i still lived the sense of falling had ceased and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before while in the belt of foam with the exception that she now lay more along i took courage and looked once again upon the scene never shall i forget the sensations of awe horror and admiration with which i gazed about me the boat appeared to be hanging as if by magic midway down upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference prodigious in depth and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth as the rays of the full moon from that circular rift amid the clouds which i have already described streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss at first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld when i recovered myself a little however my gaze fell instinctively downward in this direction i was able to obtain an unobstructed view from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool she was quite upon an even keelthat is to say her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the waterbut this latter sloped at an angle of more than fortyfive degrees so that we seemed to be lying upon our beamends i could not help observing nevertheless that i had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation than if we had been upon a dead level and this i suppose was owing to the speed at which we revolved the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf but still i could make out nothing distinctly on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow like that narrow and tottering bridge which mussulmen say is the only pathway between time and eternity this mist or spray was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel as they all met together at the bottombut the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that mist i dare not attempt to describe our first slide into the abyss itself from the belt of foam above had carried us a great distance down the slope but our farther descent was by no means proportionate round and round we sweptnot with any uniform movementbut in dizzying swings and jerks that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yardssometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl our progress downward at each revolution was slow but very perceptible looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne i perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels large masses of building timber and trunks of trees with many smaller articles such as pieces of house furniture broken boxes barrels and staves i have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors it appeared to grow upon me as i drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom i now began to watch with a strange interest the numerous things that floated in our company i must have been deliriousfor i even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below this fir tree i found myself at one time saying will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappearsand then i was disappointed to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before at length after making several guesses of this nature and being deceived in allthis factthe fact of my invariable miscalculationset me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble and my heart beat heavily once more it was not a new terror that thus affected me but the dawn of a more exciting hope this hope arose partly from memory and partly from present observation i called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of lofoden having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the moskoestrцm by far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary wayso chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splintersbut then i distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all now i could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbedthat the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide or for some reason had descended so slowly after entering that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came or of the ebb as the case might be i conceived it possible in either instance that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or absorbed more rapidly i made also three important observations the first was that as a general rule the larger the bodies were the more rapid their descentthe second that between two masses of equal extent the one spherical and the other of any other shape the superiority in speed of descent was with the spherethe third that between two masses of equal size the one cylindrical and the other of any other shape the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly since my escape i have had several conversations on this subject with an old schoolmaster of the district and it was from him that i learned the use of the words cylinder and sphere he explained to mealthough i have forgotten the explanationhow what i observed was in fact the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragmentsand showed me how it happened that a cylinder swimming in a vortex offered more resistance to its suction and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body of any form whatever there was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations and rendering me anxious to turn them to account and this was that at every revolution we passed something like a barrel or else the yard or the mast of a vessel while many of these things which had been on our level when i first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool were now high up above us and seemed to have moved but little from their original station i no longer hesitated what to do i resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which i now held to cut it loose from the counter and to throw myself with it into the water i attracted my brothers attention by signs pointed to the floating barrels that came near us and did everything in my power to make him understand what i was about to do i thought at length that he comprehended my designbut whether this was the case or not he shook his head despairingly and refused to move from his station by the ringbolt it was impossible to reach him the emergency admitted of no delay and so with a bitter struggle i resigned him to his fate fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter and precipitated myself with it into the sea without another moments hesitation the result was precisely what i had hoped it might be as it is myself who now tell you this taleas you see that i did escapeand as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected and must therefore anticipate all that i have farther to sayi will bring my story quickly to conclusion it might have been an hour or thereabout after my quitting the smack when having descended to a vast distance beneath me it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession and bearing my loved brother with it plunged headlong at once and forever into the chaos of foam below the barrel to which i was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which i leaped overboard before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool the slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep the gyrations of the whirl grew gradually less and less violent by degrees the froth and the rainbow disappeared and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise the sky was clear the winds had gone down and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west when i found myself on the surface of the ocean in full view of the shores of lofoden and above the spot where the pool of the moskoestrцm had been it was the hour of the slackbut the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane i was borne violently into the channel of the strцm and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the grounds of the fishermen a boat picked me upexhausted from fatigueand now that the danger was removed speechless from the memory of its horror those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companionsbut they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spiritland my hair which had been ravenblack the day before was as white as you see it now they say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed i told them my storythey did not believe it i now tell it to youand i can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of lofoden end of text von kempelen and his discovery after the very minute and elaborate paper by arago to say nothing of the summary in sillimans journal with the detailed statement just published by lieutenant maury it will not be supposed of course that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to von kempelens discovery i have any design to look at the subject in a scientific point of view my object is simply in the first place to say a few words of von kempelen himself with whom some years ago i had the honor of a slight personal acquaintance since every thing which concerns him must necessarily at this moment be of interest and in the second place to look in a general way and speculatively at the results of the discovery it may be as well however to premise the cursory observations which i have to offer by denying very decidedly what seems to be a general impression gleaned as usual in a case of this kind from the newspapers viz that this discovery astounding as it unquestionably is is unanticipated by reference to the diary of sir humphrey davy cottle and munroe london pp it will be seen at pp and that this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question but had actually made no inconsiderable progress experimentally in the very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by von kempelen who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it is without doubt i say it unhesitatingly and can prove it if required indebted to the diary for at least the first hint of his own undertaking the paragraph from the courier and enquirer which is now going the rounds of the press and which purports to claim the invention for a mr kissam of brunswick maine appears to me i confess a little apocryphal for several reasons although there is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement made i need not go into details my opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its manner it does not look true persons who are narrating facts are seldom so particular as mr kissam seems to be about day and date and precise location besides if mr kissam actually did come upon the discovery he says he did at the period designated nearly eight years ago how happens it that he took no steps on the instant to reap the immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have resulted to him individually if not to the world at large from the discovery it seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could have discovered what mr kissam says he did and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby so like an owl as mr kissam admits that he did bytheway who is mr kissam and is not the whole paragraph in the courier and enquirer a fabrication got up to make a talk it must be confessed that it has an amazingly moonhoaxyair very little dependence is to be placed upon it in my humble opinion and if i were not well aware from experience how very easily men of science are mystified on points out of their usual range of inquiry i should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as professor draper discussing mr kissams or is it mr quizzems pretensions to the discovery in so serious a tone but to return to the diary of sir humphrey davy this pamphlet was not designed for the public eye even upon the decease of the writer as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style at page for example near the middle we read in reference to his researches about the protoxide of azote in less than half a minute the respiration being continued diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles that the respiration was not diminished is not only clear by the subsequent context but by the use of the plural were the sentence no doubt was thus intended in less than half a minute the respiration being continued these feelings diminished gradually and were succeeded by a sensation analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles a hundred similar instances go to show that the ms so inconsiderately published was merely a rough notebook meant only for the writers own eye but an inspection of the pamphlet will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion the fact is sir humphrey davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery but he was morbidly afraid of appearing empirical so that however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in question he would never have spoken out until he had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration i verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this diary full of crude speculations would have been unattended to as it seems they were i say his wishes for that he meant to include this notebook among the miscellaneous papers directed to be burnt i think there can be no manner of doubt whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad yet remains to be seen that the passages quoted above with the other similar ones referred to gave von kempelen the hint i do not in the slightest degree question but i repeat it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself momentous under any circumstances will be of service or disservice to mankind at large that von kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest it would be folly to doubt for a moment they will scarcely be so weak as not to realize in time by large purchases of houses and land with other property of intrinsic value in the brief account of von kempelen which appeared in the home journal and has since been extensively copied several misapprehensions of the german original seem to have been made by the translator who professes to have taken the passage from a late number of the presburg schnellpost viele has evidently been misconceived as it often is and what the translator renders by sorrows is probably lieden which in its true version sufferings would give a totally different complexion to the whole account but of course much of this is merely guess on my part von kempelen however is by no means a misanthrope in appearance at least whatever he may be in fact my acquaintance with him was casual altogether and i am scarcely warranted in saying that i know him at all but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a notoriety as he has attained or will attain in a few days is not a small matter as times go the literary world speaks of him confidently as a native of presburg misled perhaps by the account in the home journal but i am pleased in being able to state positively since i have it from his own lips that he was born in utica in the state of new york although both his parents i believe are of presburg descent the family is connected in some way with maelzel of automatonchessplayer memory in person he is short and stout with large fat blue eyes sandy hair and whiskers a wide but pleasing mouth fine teeth and i think a roman nose there is some defect in one of his feet his address is frank and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie altogether he looks speaks and acts as little like a misanthrope as any man i ever saw we were fellowsojouners for a week about six years ago at earls hotel in providence rhode island and i presume that i conversed with him at various times for some three or four hours altogether his principal topics were those of the day and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments he left the hotel before me intending to go to new york and thence to bremen it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public or rather it was there that he was first suspected of having made it this is about all that i personally know of the now immortal von kempelen but i have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public there can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat about this affair are pure inventions entitled to about as much credit as the story of aladdins lamp and yet in a case of this kind as in the case of the discoveries in california it is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction the following anecdote at least is so well authenticated that we may receive it implicitly von kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence at bremen and often it was well known he had been put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums when the great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of gutsmuth co suspicion was directed toward von kempelen on account of his having purchased a considerable property in gasperitch lane and his refusing when questioned to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money he was at length arrested but nothing decisive appearing against him was in the end set at liberty the police however kept a strict watch upon his movements and thus discovered that he left home frequently taking always the same road and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the dondergat finally by dint of great perseverance they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven stories in an alley called flatzplatz and coming upon him suddenly found him as they imagined in the midst of his counterfeiting operations his agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt after handcuffing him they searched his room or rather rooms for it appears he occupied all the mansarde opening into the garret where they caught him was a closet ten feet by eight fitted up with some chemical apparatus of which the object has not yet been ascertained in one corner of the closet was a very small furnace with a glowing fire in it and on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible two crucibles connected by a tube one of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube which was close to the brim the other crucible had some liquid in it which as the officers entered seemed to be furiously dissipating in vapor they relate that on finding himself taken kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands which were encased in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic and threw the contents on the tiled floor it was now that they handcuffed him and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person but nothing unusual was found about him excepting a paper parcel in his coatpocket containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown substance in nearly but not quite equal proportions all attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have so far failed but that it will ultimately be analyzed is not to be doubted passing out of the closet with their prisoner the officers went through a sort of antechamber in which nothing material was found to the chemists sleepingroom they here rummaged some drawers and boxes but discovered only a few papers of no importance and some good coin silver and gold at length looking under the bed they saw a large common hair trunk without hinges hasp or lock and with the top lying carelessly across the bottom portion upon attempting to draw this trunk out from under the bed they found that with their united strength there were three of them all powerful men they could not stir it one inch much astonished at this one of them crawled under the bed and looking into the trunk said no wonder we couldnt move it why its full to the brim of old bits of brass putting his feet now against the wall so as to get a good purchase and pushing with all his force while his companions pulled with an theirs the trunk with much difficulty was slid out from under the bed and its contents examined the supposed brass with which it was filled was all in small smooth pieces varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar but the pieces were irregular in shape although more or less flatlooking upon the whole very much as lead looks when thrown upon the ground in a molten state and there suffered to grow cool now not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal to be any thing but brass the idea of its being gold never entered their brains of course how could such a wild fancy have entered it and their astonishment may be well conceived when the next day it became known all over bremen that the lot of brass which they had carted so contemptuously to the police office without putting themselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap was not only gold real gold but gold far finer than any employed in coinagegold in fact absolutely pure virgin without the slightest appreciable alloy i need not go over the details of von kempelens confession as far as it went and release for these are familiar to the public that he has actually realized in spirit and in effect if not to the letter the old chimaera of the philosophers stone no sane person is at liberty to doubt the opinions of arago are of course entitled to the greatest consideration but he is by no means infallible and what he says of bismuth in his report to the academy must be taken cum grano salis the simple truth is that up to this period all analysis has failed and until von kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published enigma it is more than probable that the matter will remain for years in statu quo all that as yet can fairly be said to be known is that pure gold can be made at will and very readily from lead in connection with certain other substances in kind and in proportions unknown speculation of course is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results of this discovery a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally by the late developments in california and this reflection brings us inevitably to another the exceeding inopportuneness of von kempelens analysis if many were prevented from adventuring to california by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value on account of its plentifulness in the mines there as to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one what impression will be wrought now upon the minds of those about to emigrate and especially upon the minds of those actually in the mineral region by the announcement of this astounding discovery of von kempelen a discovery which declares in so many words that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes whatever that worth may be gold now is or at least soon will be for it cannot be supposed that von kempelen can long retain his secret of no greater value than lead and of far inferior value to silver it is indeed exceedingly difficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery but one thing may be positively maintained that the announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence in regard to the settlement of california in europe as yet the most noticeable results have been a rise of two hundred per cent in the price of lead and nearly twentyfive per cent that of silver end of text mesmeric revelation whatever doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism its startling facts are now almost universally admitted of these latter those who doubt are your mere doubters by professionan unprofitable and disreputable tribe there can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove at the present day that man by mere exercise of will can so impress his fellow as to cast him into an abnormal condition of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance that while in this state the person so impressed employs only with effort and then feebly the external organs of sense yet perceives with keenly refined perception and through channels supposed unknown matters beyond the scope of the physical organs that moreover his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound and finally that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency while in the same proportion the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced i say that thesewhich are the laws of mesmerism in its general featuresit would be supererogation to demonstrate nor shall i inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration today my purpose at present is a very different one indeed i am impelled even in the teeth of a world of prejudice to detail without comment the very remarkable substance of a colloquy occurring between a sleepwaker and myself i had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question mr vankirk and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened for many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations and on the night of wednesday the fifteenth instant i was summoned to his bedside the invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart and breathed with great difficulty having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma in spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres but tonight this had been attempted in vain as i entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile and although evidently in much bodily pain appeared to be mentally quite at ease i sent for you tonight he said not so much to administer to my bodily ailment as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which of late have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise i need not tell you how sceptical i have hitherto been on the topic of the souls immortality i cannot deny that there has always existed as if in that very soul which i have been denying a vague halfsentiment of its own existence but this halfsentiment at no time amounted to conviction with it my reason had nothing to do all attempts at logical inquiry resulted indeed in leaving me more sceptical than before i had been advised to study cousin i studied him in his own works as well as in those of his european and american echoes the charles elwood of mr brownson for example was placed in my hands i read it with profound attention throughout i found it logical but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book in his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself his end had plainly forgotten his beginning like the government of trinculo in short i was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of england of france and of germany abstractions may amuse and exercise but take no hold on the mind here upon earth at least philosophy i am persuaded will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things the will may assentthe soulthe intellect never i repeat then that i only half felt and never intellectually believed but latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of reason that i find it difficult to distinguish between the two i am enabled too plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence i cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination which in my abnormal existence convinces but which in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena does not extend except through its effect into my normal condition in sleepwaking the reasoning and its conclusionthe cause and its effectare present together in my natural state the cause vanishing the effect only and perhaps only partially remains these considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of welldirected questions propounded to me while mesmerized you have often observed the profound selfcognizance evinced by the sleepwakerthe extensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself and from this selfcognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism i consented of course to make this experiment a few passes threw mr vankirk into the mesmeric sleep his breathing became immediately more easy and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness the following conversation then ensuedv in the dialogue representing the patient and p myself p are you asleep v yesno i would rather sleep more soundly p after a few more passes do you sleep now v yes p how do you think your present illness will result v after a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort i must die p does the idea of death afflict you v very quickly nono p are you pleased with the prospect v if i were awake i should like to die but now it is no matter the mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me p i wish you would explain yourself mr vankirk v i am willing to do so but it requires more effort than i feel able to make you do not question me properly p what then shall i ask v you must begin at the beginning p the beginning but where is the beginning v you know that the beginning is god this was said in a low fluctuating tone and with every sign of the most profound veneration p what then is god v hesitating for many minutes i cannot tell p is not god spirit v while i was awake i knew what you meant by spirit but now it seems only a wordsuch for instance as truth beautya quality i mean p is not god immaterial v there is no immaterialityit is a mere word that which is not matter is not at allunless qualities are things p is god then material v no this reply startled me very much p what then is he v after a long pause and mutteringly i seebut it is a thing difficult to tell another long pause he is not spirit for he exists nor is he matter as you understand it but there are gradations of matter of which man knows nothing the grosser impelling the finer the finer pervading the grosser the atmosphere for example impels the electric principle while the electric principle permeates the atmosphere these gradations of matter increase in rarity or fineness until we arrive at a matter unparticledwithout particlesindivisibleone and here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified the ultimate or unparticled matter not only permeates all things but impels all thingsand thus is all things within itself this matter is god what men attempt to embody in the word thought is this matter in motion p the metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion and thinking and that the latter is the origin of the former v yes and i now see the confusion of idea motion is the action of mindnot of thinking the unparticled matter or god in quiescence is as nearly as we can conceive it what men call mind and the power of selfmovement equivalent in effect to human volition is in the unparticled matter the result of its unity and omniprevalence how i know not and now clearly see that i shall never know but the unparticled matter set in motion by a law or quality existing within itself is thinking p can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the unparticled matter v the matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in gradation we have for example a metal a piece of wood a drop of water the atmosphere a gas caloric electricity the luminiferous ether now we call all these things matter and embrace all matter in one general definition but in spite of this there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether when we reach the latter we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit or with nihility the only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its atomic constitution and here even we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom as something possessing in infinite minuteness solidity palpability weight destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity or at least as matter for want of a better word we might term it spirit take now a step beyond the luminiferous etherconceive a matter as much more rare than the ether as this ether is more rare than the metal and we arrive at once in spite of all the school dogmas at a unique massan unparticled matter for although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity there will be a pointthere will be a degree of rarity at which if the atoms are sufficiently numerous the interspaces must vanish and the mass absolutely coalesce but the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away the nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit it is clear however that it is as fully matter as before the truth is it is impossible to conceive spirit since it is impossible to imagine what is not when we flatter ourselves that we have formed its conception we have merely deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter p there seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of absolute coalescenceand that is the very slight resistance experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through spacea resistance now ascertained it is true to exist in some degree but which is nevertheless so slight as to have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of newton we know that the resistance of bodies is chiefly in proportion to their density absolute coalescence is absolute density where there are no interspaces there can be no yielding an ether absolutely dense would put an infinitely more effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron v your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the ratio of its apparent unanswerabilityas regards the progress of the star it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or the ether through it there is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an ether for however rare this ether be supposed it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to comprehend the retardation actually experienced is on the other hand about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb in the one case the retarding force is momentary and complete within itselfin the other it is endlessly accumulative p but in all thisin this identification of mere matter with godis there nothing of irreverence i was forced to repeat this question before the sleepwaker fully comprehended my meaning v can you say why matter should be less reverenced than mind but you forget that the matter of which i speak is in all respects the very mind or spirit of the schools so far as regards its high capacities and is moreover the matter of these schools at the same time god with all the powers attributed to spirit is but the perfection of matter p you assert then that the unparticled matter in motion is thought v in general this motion is the universal thought of the universal mind this thought creates all created things are but the thoughts of god p you say in general v yes the universal mind is god for new individualities matter is necessary p but you now speak of mind and matter as do the metaphysicians v yesto avoid confusion when i say mind i mean the unparticled or ultimate matter by matter i intend all else p you were saying that for new individualities matter is necessary v yes for mind existing unincorporate is merely god to create individual thinking beings it was necessary to incarnate portions of the divine mind thus man is individualized divested of corporate investiture he were god now the particular motion of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man as the motion of the whole is that of god p you say that divested of the body man will be god v after much hesitation i could not have said this it is an absurdity p referring to my notes you did say that divested of corporate investiture man were god v and this is true man thus divested would be godwould be unindividualized but he can never be thus divestedat least never will beelse we must imagine an action of god returning upon itselfa purposeless and futile action man is a creature creatures are thoughts of god it is the nature of thought to be irrevocable p i do not comprehend you say that man will never put off the body v i say that he will never be bodiless p explain v there are two bodiesthe rudimental and the complete corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly what we call death is but the painful metamorphosis our present incarnation is progressive preparatory temporary our future is perfected ultimate immortal the ultimate life is the full design p but of the worms metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant v we certainlybut not the worm the matter of which our rudimental body is composed is within the ken of the organs of that body or more distinctly our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body but not to that of which the ultimate is composed the ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses and we perceive only the shell which falls in decaying from the inner form not that inner form itself but this inner form as well as the shell is appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life p you have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles death how is this v when i say that it resembles death i mean that it resembles the ultimate life for when i am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in abeyance and i perceive external things directly without organs through a medium which i shall employ in the ultimate unorganized life p unorganized v yes organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter to the exclusion of other classes and forms the organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition and to that only his ultimate condition being unorganized is of unlimited comprehension in all points but onethe nature of the volition of godthat is to say the motion of the unparticled matter you will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain this it is not but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it is a luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether the vibrations generate similar ones within the retina these again communicate similar ones to the optic nerve the nerve conveys similar ones to the brain the brain also similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it the motion of this latter is thought of which perception is the first undulation this is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world and this external world is to the rudimental life limited through the idiosyncrasy of its organs but in the ultimate unorganized life the external world reaches the whole body which is of a substance having affinity to brain as i have said with no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous and to this etherin unison with itthe whole body vibrates setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it it is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs therefore that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life to rudimental beings organs are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged p you speak of rudimental beings are there other rudimental thinking beings than man v the multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulж planets suns and other bodies which are neither nebulж suns nor planets is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings but for the necessity of the rudimental prior to the ultimate life there would have been no bodies such as these each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic rudimental thinking creatures in all the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted at death or metamorphosis these creatures enjoying the ultimate lifeimmortalityand cognizant of all secrets but the one act all things and pass everywhere by mere volitionindwelling not the stars which to us seem the sole palpabilities and for the accommodation of which we blindly deem space createdbut that space itselfthat infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the starshadows blotting them out as nonentities from the perception of the angels p you say that but for the necessity of the rudimental life there would have been no stars but why this necessity v in the inorganic life as well as in the inorganic matter generally there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique lawthe divine volition with the view of producing impediment the organic life and matter complex substantial and lawencumbered were contrived p but againwhy need this impediment have been produced v the result of law inviolate is perfectionrightnegative happiness the result of law violate is imperfection wrong positive pain through the impediments afforded by the number complexity and substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter the violation of law is rendered to a certain extent practicable thus pain which in the inorganic life is impossible is possible in the organic p but to what good end is pain thus rendered possible v all things are either good or bad by comparison a sufficient analysis will show that pleasure in all cases is but the contrast of pain positive pleasure is a mere idea to be happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed but it has been shown that in the inorganic life pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic the pain of the primitive life of earth is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in heaven p still there is one of your expressions which i find it impossible to comprehendthe truly substantive vastness of infinity v this probably is because you have no sufficiently generic conception of the term substance itself we must not regard it as a quality but as a sentimentit is the perception in thinking beings of the adaptation of matter to their organization there are many things on the earth which would be nihility to the inhabitants of venusmany things visible and tangible in venus which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at all but to the inorganic beingsto the angelsthe whole of the unparticled matter is substancethat is to say the whole of what we term space is to them the truest substantialitythe stars meantime through what we consider their materiality escaping the angelic sense just in proportion as the unparticled matter through what we consider its immateriality eludes the organic as the sleepwaker pronounced these latter words in a feeble tone i observed on his countenance a singular expression which somewhat alarmed me and induced me to awake him at once no sooner had i done this than with a bright smile irradiating all his features he fell back upon his pillow and expired i noticed that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone his brow was of the coldness of ice thus ordinarily should it have appeared only after long pressure from azraels hand had the sleepwaker indeed during the latter portion of his discourse been addressing me from out the region of the shadows end of text the facts in the case of m valdemar of course i shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder that the extraordinary case of m valdemar has excited discussion it would have been a miracle had it notespecially under the circumstances through the desire of all parties concerned to keep the affair from the public at least for the present or until we had farther opportunities for investigation through our endeavors to effect this a garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society and became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations and very naturally of a great deal of disbelief it is now rendered necessary that i give the facts as far as i comprehend them myself they are succinctly these my attention for the last three years had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of mesmerism and about nine months ago it occurred to me quite suddenly that in the series of experiments made hitherto there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis it remained to be seen first whether in such condition there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence secondly whether if any existed it was impaired or increased by the condition thirdly to what extent or for how long a period the encroachments of death might be arrested by the process there were other points to be ascertained but these most excited my curiosity the last in especial from the immensely important character of its consequences in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test these particulars i was brought to think of my friend m ernest valdemar the wellknown compiler of the bibliotheca forensica and author under the nom de plume of issachar marx of the polish versions of wallenstein and gargantua m valdemar who has resided principally at harlaem ny since the year is or was particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person his lower limbs much resembling those of john randolph and also for the whiteness of his whiskers in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair the latter in consequence being very generally mistaken for a wig his temperament was markedly nervous and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment on two or three occasions i had put him to sleep with little difficulty but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate his will was at no period positively or thoroughly under my control and in regard to clairvoyance i could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon i always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis it was his custom indeed to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted when the ideas to which i have alluded first occurred to me it was of course very natural that i should think of m valdemar i knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him and he had no relatives in america who would be likely to interfere i spoke to him frankly upon the subject and to my surprise his interest seemed vividly excited i say to my surprise for although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with what i did his disease was if that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twentyfour hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his decease it is now rather more than seven months since i received from m valdemar himself the subjoined note my dear p you may as well come now d and f are agreed that i cannot hold out beyond tomorrow midnight and i think they have hit the time very nearly valdemar i received this note within half an hour after it was written and in fifteen minutes more i was in the dying mans chamber i had not seen him for ten days and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him his face wore a leaden hue the eyes were utterly lustreless and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheekbones his expectoration was excessive the pulse was barely perceptible he retained nevertheless in a very remarkable manner both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength he spoke with distinctness took some palliative medicines without aid and when i entered the room was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocketbook he was propped up in the bed by pillows doctors d and f were in attendance after pressing valdemars hand i took these gentlemen aside and obtained from them a minute account of the patients condition the left lung had been for eighteen months in a semiosseous or cartilaginous state and was of course entirely useless for all purposes of vitality the right in its upper portion was also partially if not thoroughly ossified while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles running one into another several extensive perforations existed and at one point permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place these appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date the ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity no sign of it had discovered a month before and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days independently of the phthisis the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible it was the opinion of both physicians that m valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow sunday it was then seven oclock on saturday evening on quitting the invalids bedside to hold conversation with myself doctors d and f had bidden him a final farewell it had not been their intention to return but at my request they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night when they had gone i spoke freely with m valdemar on the subject of his approaching dissolution as well as more particularly of the experiment proposed he still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made and urged me to commence it at once a male and a female nurse were in attendance but i did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people in case of sudden accident might prove i therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night when the arrival of a medical student with whom i had some acquaintance mr theodore l l relieved me from farther embarrassment it had been my design originally to wait for the physicians but i was induced to proceed first by the urgent entreaties of m valdemar and secondly by my conviction that i had not a moment to lose as he was evidently sinking fast mr l l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all that occurred and it is from his memoranda that what i now have to relate is for the most part either condensed or copied verbatim it wanted about five minutes of eight when taking the patients hand i begged him to state as distinctly as he could to mr l l whether he m valdemar was entirely willing that i should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition he replied feebly yet quite audibly yes i wish to be i fear you have mesmerized adding immediately afterwards deferred it too long while he spoke thus i commenced the passes which i had already found most effectual in subduing him he was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead but although i exerted all my powers no farther perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten oclock when doctors d and f called according to appointment i explained to them in a few words what i designed and as they opposed no objection saying that the patient was already in the death agony i proceeded without hesitation exchanging however the lateral passes for downward ones and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous and at intervals of half a minute this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour at the expiration of this period however a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man and the stertorous breathing ceased that is to say its stertorousness was no longer apparent the intervals were undiminished the patients extremities were of an icy coldness at five minutes before eleven i perceived unequivocal signs of the mesmeric influence the glassy roll of the eye was changed for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of sleepwaking and which it is quite impossible to mistake with a few rapid lateral passes i made the lids quiver as in incipient sleep and with a few more i closed them altogether i was not satisfied however with this but continued the manipulations vigorously and with the fullest exertion of the will until i had completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer after placing them in a seemingly easy position the legs were at full length the arms were nearly so and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin the head was very slightly elevated when i had accomplished this it was fully midnight and i requested the gentlemen present to examine m valdemars condition after a few experiments they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance the curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited dr d resolved at once to remain with the patient all night while dr f took leave with a promise to return at daybreak mr l l and the nurses remained we left m valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three oclock in the morning when i approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when dr f went away that is to say he lay in the same position the pulse was imperceptible the breathing was gentle scarcely noticeable unless through the application of a mirror to the lips the eyes were closed naturally and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble still the general appearance was certainly not that of death as i approached m valdemar i made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own as i passed the latter gently to and fro above his person in such experiments with this patient had never perfectly succeeded before and assuredly i had little thought of succeeding now but to my astonishment his arm very readily although feebly followed every direction i assigned it with mine i determined to hazard a few words of conversation m valdemar i said are you asleep he made no answer but i perceived a tremor about the lips and was thus induced to repeat the question again and again at its third repetition his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of the ball the lips moved sluggishly and from between them in a barely audible whisper issued the words yes asleep now do not wake me let me die so i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever the right arm as before obeyed the direction of my hand i questioned the sleepwaker again do you still feel pain in the breast m valdemar the answer now was immediate but even less audible than before no pain i am dying i did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of dr f who came a little before sunrise and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive after feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips he requested me to speak to the sleepwaker again i did so saying m valdemar do you still sleep as before some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak at my fourth repetition of the question he said very faintly almost inaudibly yes still asleep dying it was now the opinion or rather the wish of the physicians that m valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present apparently tranquil condition until death should supervene and this it was generally agreed must now take place within a few minutes i concluded however to speak to him once more and merely repeated my previous question while i spoke there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleepwaker the eyes rolled themselves slowly open the pupils disappearing upwardly the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue resembling not so much parchment as white paper and the circular hectic spots which hitherto had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek went out at once i use this expression because the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath the upper lip at the same time writhed itself away from the teeth which it had previously covered completely while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk leaving the mouth widely extended and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue i presume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to deathbed horrors but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of m valdemar at this moment that there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed i now feel that i have reached a point of this narrative at which every reader will be startled into positive disbelief it is my business however simply to proceed there was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in m valdemar and concluding him to be dead we were consigning him to the charge of the nurses when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue this continued for perhaps a minute at the expiration of this period there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice such as it would be madness in me to attempt describing there are indeed two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part i might say for example that the sound was harsh and broken and hollow but the hideous whole is indescribable for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity there were two particulars nevertheless which i thought then and still think might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity in the first place the voice seemed to reach our ears at least mine from a vast distance or from some deep cavern within the earth in the second place it impressed me i fear indeed that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch i have spoken both of sound and of voice i mean to say that the sound was one of distinct of even wonderfully thrillingly distinct syllabification m valdemar spoke obviously in reply to the question i had propounded to him a few minutes before i had asked him it will be remembered if he still slept he now said yes no i have been sleeping and now now i am dead no person present even affected to deny or attempted to repress the unutterable shuddering horror which these few words thus uttered were so well calculated to convey mr l l the student swooned the nurses immediately left the chamber and could not be induced to return my own impressions i would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader for nearly an hour we busied ourselves silently without the utterance of a word in endeavors to revive mr l l when he came to himself we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of m valdemars condition it remained in all respects as i have last described it with the exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration an attempt to draw blood from the arm failed i should mention too that this limb was no farther subject to my will i endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand the only real indication indeed of the mesmeric influence was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue whenever i addressed m valdemar a question he seemed to be making an effort to reply but had no longer sufficient volition to queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly insensible although i endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric rapport with him i believe that i have now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleepwakers state at this epoch other nurses were procured and at ten oclock i left the house in company with the two physicians and mr l l in the afternoon we all called again to see the patient his condition remained precisely the same we had now some discussion as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing it was evident that so far death or what is usually termed death had been arrested by the mesmeric process it seemed clear to us all that to awaken m valdemar would be merely to insure his instant or at least his speedy dissolution from this period until the close of last week an interval of nearly seven months we continued to make daily calls at m valdemars house accompanied now and then by medical and other friends all this time the sleeperwaker remained exactly as i have last described him the nurses attentions were continual it was on friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening or attempting to awaken him and it is the perhaps unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles to so much of what i cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling for the purpose of relieving m valdemar from the mesmeric trance i made use of the customary passes these for a time were unsuccessful the first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the iris it was observed as especially remarkable that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse outflowing of a yellowish ichor from beneath the lids of a pungent and highly offensive odor it was now suggested that i should attempt to influence the patients arm as heretofore i made the attempt and failed dr f then intimated a desire to have me put a question i did so as follows m valdemar can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now there was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks the tongue quivered or rather rolled violently in the mouth although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before and at length the same hideous voice which i have already described broke forth for gods sake quick quick put me to sleep or quick waken me quick i say to you that i am dead i was thoroughly unnerved and for an instant remained undecided what to do at first i made an endeavor to recompose the patient but failing in this through total abeyance of the will i retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him in this attempt i soon saw that i should be successful or at least i soon fancied that my success would be complete and i am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken for what really occurred however it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared as i rapidly made the mesmeric passes amid ejaculations of dead dead absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer his whole frame at once within the space of a single minute or even less shrunk crumbled absolutely rotted away beneath my hands upon the bed before that whole company there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome of detestable putridity end of text the black cat for the most wild yet most homely narrative which i am about to pen i neither expect nor solicit belief mad indeed would i be to expect it in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence yet mad am i notand very surely do i not dream but tomorrow i die and today i would unburthen my soul my immediate purpose is to place before the world plainly succinctly and without comment a series of mere household events in their consequences these events have terrifiedhave torturedhave destroyed me yet i will not attempt to expound them to me they have presented little but horrorto many they will seem less terrible than barroques hereafter perhaps some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the commonplacesome intellect more calm more logical and far less excitable than my own which will perceive in the circumstances i detail with awe nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects from my infancy i was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition my tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions i was especially fond of animals and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets with these i spent most of my time and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them this peculiarity of character grew with my growth and in my manhood i derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure to those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog i need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable there is something in the unselfish and selfsacrificing love of a brute which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man i married early and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own observing my partiality for domestic pets she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind we had birds goldfish a fine dog rabbits a small monkey and a cat this latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal entirely black and sagacious to an astonishing degree in speaking of his intelligence my wife who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise not that she was ever serious upon this pointand i mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens just now to be remembered plutothis was the cats namewas my favorite pet and playmate i alone fed him and he attended me wherever i went about the house it was even with difficulty that i could prevent him from following me through the streets our friendship lasted in this manner for several years during which my general temperament and characterthrough the instrumentality of the fiend intemperancehad i blush to confess it experienced a radical alteration for the worse i grew day by day more moody more irritable more regardless of the feelings of others i suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife at length i even offered her personal violence my pets of course were made to feel the change in my disposition i not only neglected but illused them for pluto however i still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him as i made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits the monkey or even the dog when by accident or through affection they came in my way but my disease grew upon mefor what disease is like alcoholand at length even pluto who was now becoming old and consequently somewhat peevisheven pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper one night returning home much intoxicated from one of my haunts about town i fancied that the cat avoided my presence i seized him when in his fright at my violence he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth the fury of a demon instantly possessed me i knew myself no longer my original soul seemed at once to take its flight from my body and a more than fiendish malevolence ginnurtured thrilled every fibre of my frame i took from my waistcoatpocket a penknife opened it grasped the poor beast by the throat and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket i blush i burn i shudder while i pen the damnable atrocity when reason returned with the morningwhen i had slept off the fumes of the nights debauchi experienced a sentiment half of horror half of remorse for the crime of which i had been guilty but it was at best a feeble and equivocal feeling and the soul remained untouched i again plunged into excess and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed in the meantime the cat slowly recovered the socket of the lost eye presented it is true a frightful appearance but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain he went about the house as usual but as might be expected fled in extreme terror at my approach i had so much of my old heart left as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me but this feeling soon gave place to irritation and then came as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow the spirit of perverseness of this spirit philosophy takes no account yet i am not more sure that my soul lives than i am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heartone of the indivisible primary faculties or sentiments which give direction to the character of man who has not a hundred times found himself committing a vile or a silly action for no other reason than because he knows he should not have we not a perpetual inclination in the teeth of our best judgment to violate that which is law merely because we understand it to be such this spirit of perverseness i say came to my final overthrow it was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itselfto offer violence to its own natureto do wrong for the wrongs sake onlythat urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury i had inflicted upon the unoffending brute one morning in cool blood i slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a treehung it with the tears streaming from my eyes and with the bitterest remorse at my hearthung it because i knew that it had loved me and because i felt it had given me no reason of offencehung it because i knew that in so doing i was committing a sina deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place itif such a thing wore possibleeven beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the most merciful and most terrible god on the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done i was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire the curtains of my bed were in flames the whole house was blazing it was with great difficulty that my wife a servant and myself made our escape from the conflagration the destruction was complete my entire worldly wealth was swallowed up and i resigned myself thenceforward to despair i am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect between the disaster and the atrocity but i am detailing a chain of factsand wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect on the day succeeding the fire i visited the ruins the walls with one exception had fallen in this exception was found in a compartment wall not very thick which stood about the middle of the house and against which had rested the head of my bed the plastering had here in great measure resisted the action of the firea fact which i attributed to its having been recently spread about this wall a dense crowd were collected and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention the words strange singular and other similar expressions excited my curiosity i approached and saw as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface the figure of a gigantic cat the impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous there was a rope about the animals neck when i first beheld this apparitionfor i could scarcely regard it as lessmy wonder and my terror were extreme but at length reflection came to my aid the cat i remembered had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house upon the alarm of fire this garden had been immediately filled by the crowdby some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown through an open window into my chamber this had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep the falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshlyspread plaster the lime of which with the flames and the ammonia from the carcass had then accomplished the portraiture as i saw it although i thus readily accounted to my reason if not altogether to my conscience for the startling fact just detailed it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy for months i could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat and during this period there came back into my spirit a halfsentiment that seemed but was not remorse i went so far as to regret the loss of the animal and to look about me among the vile haunts which i now habitually frequented for another pet of the same species and of somewhat similar appearance with which to supply its place one night as i sat half stupified in a den of more than infamy my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin or of rum which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment i had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes and what now caused me surprise was the fact that i had not sooner perceived the object thereupon i approached it and touched it with my hand it was a black cata very large onefully as large as pluto and closely resembling him in every respect but one pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body but this cat had a large although indefinite splotch of white covering nearly the whole region of the breast upon my touching him he immediately arose purred loudly rubbed against my hand and appeared delighted with my notice this then was the very creature of which i was in search i at once offered to purchase it of the landlord but this person made no claim to itknew nothing of ithad never seen it before i continued my caresses and when i prepared to go home the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me i permitted it to do so occasionally stooping and patting it as i proceeded when it reached the house it domesticated itself at once and became immediately a great favorite with my wife for my own part i soon found a dislike to it arising within me this was just the reverse of what i had anticipated buti know not how or why it wasits evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed by slow degrees these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred i avoided the creature a certain sense of shame and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty preventing me from physically abusing it i did not for some weeks strike or otherwise violently ill use it but graduallyvery graduallyi came to look upon it with unutterable loathing and to flee silently from its odious presence as from the breath of a pestilence what added no doubt to my hatred of the beast was the discovery on the morning after i brought it home that like pluto it also had been deprived of one of its eyes this circumstance however only endeared it to my wife who as i have already said possessed in a high degree that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures with my aversion to this cat however its partiality for myself seemed to increase it followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend whenever i sat it would crouch beneath my chair or spring upon my knees covering me with its loathsome caresses if i arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down or fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress clamber in this manner to my breast at such times although i longed to destroy it with a blow i was yet withheld from so doing partly by a memory of my former crime but chieflylet me confess it at onceby absolute dread of the beast this dread was not exactly a dread of physical eviland yet i should be at a loss how otherwise to define it i am almost ashamed to ownyes even in this felons cell i am almost ashamed to ownthat the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive my wife had called my attention more than once to the character of the mark of white hair of which i have spoken and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one i had destroyed the reader will remember that this mark although large had been originally very indefinite but by slow degreesdegrees nearly imperceptible and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject as fancifulit had at length assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline it was now the representation of an object that i shudder to nameand for this above all i loathed and dreaded and would have rid myself of the monster had i daredit was now i say the image of a hideousof a ghastly thingof the gallowsoh mournful and terrible engine of horror and of crimeof agony and of death and now was i indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere humanity and a brute beastwhose fellow i had contemptuously destroyeda brute beast to work out for mefor me a man fashioned in the image of the high godso much of insufferable wo alas neither by day nor by night knew i the blessing of rest any more during the former the creature left me no moment alone and in the latter i started hourly from dreams of unutterable fear to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face and its vast weightan incarnate nightmare that i had no power to shake offincumbent eternally upon my heart beneath the pressure of torments such as these the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed evil thoughts became my sole intimatesthe darkest and most evil of thoughts the moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind while from the sudden frequent and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which i now blindly abandoned myself my uncomplaining wife alas was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers one day she accompanied me upon some household errand into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit the cat followed me down the steep stairs and nearly throwing me headlong exasperated me to madness uplifting an axe and forgetting in my wrath the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand i aimed a blow at the animal which of course would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as i wished but this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife goaded by the interference into a rage more than demoniacal i withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain she fell dead upon the spot without a groan this hideous murder accomplished i set myself forthwith and with entire deliberation to the task of concealing the body i knew that i could not remove it from the house either by day or by night without the risk of being observed by the neighbors many projects entered my mind at one period i thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments and destroying them by fire at another i resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar again i deliberated about casting it in the well in the yardabout packing it in a box as if merchandize with the usual arrangements and so getting a porter to take it from the house finally i hit upon what i considered a far better expedient than either of these i determined to wall it up in the cellaras the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims for a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted its walls were loosely constructed and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening moreover in one of the walls was a projection caused by a false chimney or fireplace that had been filled up and made to resemble the red of the cellar i made no doubt that i could readily displace the bricks at this point insert the corpse and wall the whole up as before so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious and in this calculation i was not deceived by means of a crowbar i easily dislodged the bricks and having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall i propped it in that position while with little trouble i relaid the whole structure as it originally stood having procured mortar sand and hair with every possible precaution i prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old and with this i very carefully went over the new brickwork when i had finished i felt satisfied that all was right the wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed the rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care i looked around triumphantly and said to myselfhere at least then my labor has not been in vain my next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness for i had at length firmly resolved to put it to death had i been able to meet with it at the moment there could have been no doubt of its fate but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger and forebore to present itself in my present mood it is impossible to describe or to imagine the deep the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom it did not make its appearance during the nightand thus for one night at least since its introduction into the house i soundly and tranquilly slept aye slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul the second and the third day passed and still my tormentor came not once again i breathed as a freeman the monster in terror had fled the premises forever i should behold it no more my happiness was supreme the guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little some few inquiries had been made but these had been readily answered even a search had been institutedbut of course nothing was to be discovered i looked upon my future felicity as secured upon the fourth day of the assassination a party of the police came very unexpectedly into the house and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises secure however in the inscrutability of my place of concealment i felt no embarrassment whatever the officers bade me accompany them in their search they left no nook or corner unexplored at length for the third or fourth time they descended into the cellar i quivered not in a muscle my heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence i walked the cellar from end to end i folded my arms upon my bosom and roamed easily to and fro the police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart the glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained i burned to say if but one word by way of triumph and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness gentlemen i said at last as the party ascended the steps i delight to have allayed your suspicions i wish you all health and a little more courtesy by the bye gentlemen thisthis is a very well constructed house in the rabid desire to say something easily i scarcely knew what i uttered at alli may say an excellently well constructed house these walls are you going gentlementhese walls are solidly put together and here through the mere phrenzy of bravado i rapped heavily with a cane which i held in my hand upon that very portion of the brickwork behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom but may god shield and deliver me from the fangs of the archfiend no sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence than i was answered by a voice from within the tombby a cry at first muffled and broken like the sobbing of a child and then quickly swelling into one long loud and continuous scream utterly anomalous and inhumana howla wailing shriek half of horror and half of triumph such as might have arisen only out of hell conjointly from the throats of the dammed in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation of my own thoughts it is folly to speak swooning i staggered to the opposite wall for one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless through extremity of terror and of awe in the next a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall it fell bodily the corpse already greatly decayed and clotted with gore stood erect before the eyes of the spectators upon its head with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman i had walled the monster up within the tomb end of text the fall of the house of usher son coeur est un luth suspendu sitфt quon le touche il rиsonne de bйranger during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of country and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew on within view of the melancholy house of usher i know not how it wasbut with the first glimpse of the building a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit i say insufferable for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that halfpleasurable because poetic sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible i looked upon the scene before meupon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the domainupon the bleak wallsupon the vacant eyelike windowsupon a few rank sedgesand upon a few white trunks of decayed treeswith an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the reveller upon opiumthe bitter lapse into everyday lifethe hideous dropping off of the veil there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heartan unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime what was iti paused to thinkwhat was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher it was a mystery all insoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth it was possible i reflected that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of the picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed downbut with a shudder even more thrilling than beforeupon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge and the ghastly treestems and the vacant and eyelike windows nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks its proprietor roderick usher had been one of my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our last meeting a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part of the countrya letter from himwhich in its wildly importunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation the writer spoke of acute bodily illnessof a mental disorder which oppressed himand of an earnest desire to see me as his best and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting by the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady it was the manner in which all this and much more was saidit was the apparent heart that went with his requestwhich allowed me no room for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i really knew little of my friend his reserve had been always excessive and habitual i was aware however that his very ancient family had been noted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament displaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art and manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical science i had learned too the very remarkable fact that the stem of the usher race all timehonored as it was had put forth at no period any enduring branch in other words that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling and very temporary variation so lain it was this deficiency i considered while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one in the long lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the otherit was this deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name which had at length so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the house of usheran appellation which seemed to include in the minds of the peasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experimentthat of looking down within the tarnhad been to deepen the first singular impression there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstitionfor why should i not so term itserved mainly to accelerate the increase itself such i have long known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis and it might have been for this reason only that when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool there grew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous indeed that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinityan atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from the decayed trees and the gray wall and the silent tarna pestilent and mystic vapor dull sluggish faintly discernible and leadenhued shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity the discoloration of ages had been great minute fungi overspread the whole exterior hanging in a fine tangled webwork from the eaves yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation no portion of the masonry had fallen and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual stones in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air beyond this indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave little token of instability perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house a servant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway of the hall a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master much that i encountered on the way contributed i know not how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken while the objects around mewhile the carvings of the ceilings the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floors and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode were but matters to which or to such as which i had been accustomed from my infancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all thisi still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up on one of the staircases i met the physician of the family his countenance i thought wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity he accosted me with trepidation and passed on the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty the windows were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling dark draperies hung upon the walls the general furniture was profuse comfortless antique and tattered many books and musical instruments lay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow an air of stern deep and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all upon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it i at first thought of an overdone cordialityof the constrained effort of the ennuyй man of the world a glance however at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity we sat down and for some moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity half of awe surely man had never before so terribly altered in so brief a period as had roderick usher it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable a cadaverousness of complexion an eye large liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and very pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a delicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations a finely moulded chin speaking in its want of prominence of a want of moral energy hair of a more than weblike softness and tenuity these features with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features and of the expression they were wont to convey lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke the now ghastly pallor of the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things startled and even awed me the silken hair too had been suffered to grow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated rather than fell about the face i could not even with effort connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherencean inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancyan excessive nervous agitation for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament his action was alternately vivacious and sullen his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic concisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and hollowsounding enunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard or the irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intense excitement it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him he entered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and one for which he despaired to find a remedya mere nervous affection he immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations some of these as he detailed them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was alone endurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odors of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faint light and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringed instruments which did not inspire him with horror to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave i shall perish said he i must perish in this deplorable folly thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost i dread the events of the future not in themselves but in their results i shudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul i have indeed no abhorrence of danger except in its absolute effectin terror in this unnervedin this pitiable conditioni feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the grim phantasm fear i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal hints another singular feature of his mental condition he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never ventured forthin regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restatedan influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spiritan effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down had at length brought about upon the morale of his existence he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable originto the severe and longcontinued illnessindeed to the evidently approaching dissolutionof a tenderly beloved sisterhis sole companion for long yearshis last and only relative on earth her decease he said with a bitterness which i can never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the frail the last of the ancient race of the ushers while he spoke the lady madeline for so was she called passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment and without having noticed my presence disappeared i regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dreadand yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings a sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps when a door at length closed upon her my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brotherbut he had buried his face in his hands and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character were the unusual diagnosis hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herself finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyer and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtainthat the lady at least while living would be seen by me no more for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or myself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend we painted and read together or i listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the way an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all his long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears among other things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touch by touch into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the more thrillingly because i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these paintings vivid as their images now are before me i would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words by the utter simplicity by the nakedness of his designs he arrested and overawed attention if ever mortal painted an idea that mortal was roderick usher for me at leastin the circumstances then surrounding methere arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass an intensity of intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although feebly in words a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls smooth white and without interruption or device certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments it was perhaps the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth in great measure to the fantastic character of his performances but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for they must have been and were in the notes as well as in the words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered i was perhaps the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its meaning i fancied that i perceived and for the first time a full consciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne the verses which were entitled the haunted palace ran very nearly if not accurately thus i in the greenest of our valleys by good angels tenanted once a fair and stately palaceradiant palacereared its head in the monarch thoughts dominionit stood there never seraph spread a pinion over fabric half so fair ii banners yellow glorious golden on its roof did float and flow thisall thiswas in the olden time long ago and every gentle air that dallied in that sweet day along the ramparts plumed and pallid a winged odor went away iii wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a lutes welltunйd law round about a throne where sitting porphyrogene in state his glory well befitting the ruler of the realm was seen iv and all with pearl and ruby glowing was the fair palace door through which came flowing flowing flowing and sparkling evermore a troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing in voices of surpassing beauty the wit and wisdom of their king v but evil things in robes of sorrow assailed the monarchs high estate ah let us mourn for never morrow shall dawn upon him desolate and round about his home the glory that blushed and bloomed is but a dimremembered story of the old time entombed vi and travellers now within that valley through the redlitten windows see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant melody while like a rapid ghastly river through the pale door a hideous throng rush out forever and laughbut smile no more i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of ushers which i mention not so much on account of its novelty for other men have thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it this opinion in its general form was that of the sentience of all vegetable things but in his disordered fancy the idea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under certain conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization i lack words to express the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion the belief however was connected as i have previously hinted with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers the conditions of the sentience had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stonesin the order of their arrangement as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them and of the decayed trees which stood aroundabove all in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn its evidencethe evidence of the sentiencewas to be seen he said and i here started as he spoke in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls the result was discoverable he added in that silent yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family and which made him what i now saw himwhat he was such opinions need no comment and i will make none watson dr percival spallanzani and especially the bishop of landaffsee chemical essays vol v our booksthe books which for years had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalidwere as might be supposed in strict keeping with this character of phantasm we pored together over such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset the belphegor of machiavelli the heaven and hell of swedenborg the subterranean voyage of nicholas klimm by holberg the chiromancy of robert flud of jean dindaginй and of de la chambre the journey into the blue distance of tieck and the city of the sun of campanella one favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the directorium inquisitorium by the dominican eymeric de gironne and there were passages in pomponius mela about the old african satyrs and gipans over which usher would sit dreaming for hours his chief delight however was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothicthe manual of a forgotten churchthe vigiliae mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiae maguntinae i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its final interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building the worldly reason however assigned for this singular proceeding was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute the brother had been led to his resolution so he told me by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the remote and exposed situation of the burialground of the family i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival at the house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless and by no means an unnatural precaution at the request of usher i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment the body having been encoffined we two alone bore it to its rest the vault in which we placed it and which had been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation was small damp and entirely without means of admission for light lying at great depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment it had been used apparently in remote feudal times for the worst purposes of a donjonkeep and in later days as a place of deposit for powder or some other highly combustible substance as a portion of its floor and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it were carefully sheathed with copper the door of massive iron had been also similarly protected its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its hinges having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin and looked upon the face of the tenant a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and usher divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them our glances however rested not long upon the deadfor we could not regard her unawed the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death we replaced and screwed down the lid and having secured the door of iron made our way with toil into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend his ordinary manner had vanished his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal and objectless step the pallor of his countenance had assumed if possible a more ghastly huebut the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually characterized his utterance there were times indeed when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage at times again i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound it was no wonder that his condition terrifiedthat it infected me i felt creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the donjon that i experienced the full power of such feelings sleep came not near my couchwhile the hours waned and waned away i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me i endeavored to believe that much if not all of what i felt was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the roomof the dark and tattered draperies which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed but my efforts were fruitless an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at length there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle i uplifted myself upon the pillows and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber harkenedi know not why except that an instinctive spirit prompted meto certain low and indefinite sounds which came through the pauses of the storm at long intervals i knew not whence overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable i threw on my clothes with haste for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment i had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention i presently recognised it as that of usher in an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle touch at my door and entered bearing a lamp his countenance was as usual cadaverously wanbut moreover there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyesan evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor his air appalled mebut anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured and i even welcomed his presence as a relief and you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared about him for some moments in silenceyou have not then seen itbut stay you shall thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp he hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open to the storm the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind and the exceeding density of the clouds which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other without passing away into the distance i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving thisyet we had no glimpse of the moon or starsnor was there any flashing forth of the lightning but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion you must notyou shall not behold this said i shudderingly to usher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena not uncommonor it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn let us close this casementthe air is chilling and dangerous to your frame here is one of your favorite romances i will read and you shall listenand so we will pass away this terrible night together the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir launcelot canning but i had called it a favorite of ushers more in sad jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend it was however the only book immediately at hand and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read could i have judged indeed by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened or apparently harkened to the words of the tale i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design i had arrived at that wellknown portion of the story where ethelred the hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by force here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run thus and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in sooth was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his mace outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and hollowsounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment paused for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from some very remote portion of the mansion there came indistinctly to my ears what might have been in its exact similarity of character the echo but a stifled and dull one certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described it was beyond doubt the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothing surely which should have interested or disturbed me i continued the story but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit but in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor and of a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace of gold with a floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragon which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek so horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it the like whereof was never before heard here again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild amazementfor there could be no doubt whatever that in this instance i did actually hear although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant but harsh protracted and most unusual screaming or grating soundthe exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragons unnatural shriek as described by the romancer oppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the sensitive nervousness of my companion i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his demeanor from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought round his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber and thus i could but partially perceive his features although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly his head had dropped upon his breastyet i knew that he was not asleep from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile the motion of his body too was at variance with this ideafor he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway having rapidly taken notice of all this i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot which thus proceeded and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out of the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in sooth tarried not for his full coming but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound no sooner had these syllables passed my lips thanas if a shield of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of silveri became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous yet apparently muffled reverberation completely unnerved i leaped to my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed i rushed to the chair in which he sat his eyes were bent fixedly before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity but as i placed my hand upon his shoulder there came a strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered about his lips and i saw that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur as if unconscious of my presence bending closely over him i at length drank in the hideous import of his words not hear ityes i hear it and have heard it longlonglongmany minutes many hours many days have i heard ityet i dared notoh pity me miserable wretch that i ami dared noti dared not speak we have put her living in the tomb said i not that my senses were acute i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin i heard themmany many days agoyet i dared noti dared not speak and nowtonightethelredha hathe breaking of the hermits door and the deathcry of the dragon and the clangor of the shieldsay rather the rending of her coffin and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault oh whither shall i fly will she not be here anon is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste have i not heard her footstep on the stair do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart madmanhere he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soulmadman i tell you that she now stands without the door as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spellthe huge antique pannels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony jaws it was the work of the rushing gustbut then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher there was blood upon her white robes and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the thresholdthen with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother and in her violent and now final deathagonies bore him to the floor a corpse and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated from that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me the radiance was that of the full setting and bloodred moon which now shone vividly through that once barelydiscernible fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction to the base while i gazed this fissure rapidly widenedthere came a fierce breath of the whirlwindthe entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sightmy brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunderthere was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand watersand the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the house of usher end of text silence a fable alcman the mountain pinnacles slumber valleys crags and caves are silent listen to me said the demon as he placed his hand upon my head the region of which i speak is a dreary region in libya by the borders of the river zaire and there is no quiet there nor silence the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they flow not onwards to the sea but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion for many miles on either side of the rivers oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic waterlilies they sigh one unto the other in that solitude and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks and nod to and fro their everlasting heads and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water and they sigh one unto the other but there is a boundary to their realm the boundary of the dark horrible lofty forest there like the waves about the hebrides the low underwood is agitated continually but there is no wind throughout the heaven and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound and from their high summits one by one drop everlasting dews and at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber and overhead with a rustling and loud noise the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll a cataract over the fiery wall of the horizon but there is no wind throughout the heaven and by the shores of the river zaire there is neither quiet nor silence it was night and the rain fell and falling it was rain but having fallen it was blood and i stood in the morass among the tall and the rain fell upon my head and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation and all at once the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist and was crimson in color and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon and the rock was gray and ghastly and tall and the rock was gray upon its front were characters engraven in the stone and i walked through the morass of waterlilies until i came close unto the shore that i might read the characters upon the stone but i could not decypher them and i was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller red and i turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the characters and the characters were desolation and i looked upwards and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock and i hid myself among the waterlilies that i might discover the actions of the man and the man was tall and stately in form and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old rome and the outlines of his figure were indistinct but his features were the features of a deity for the mantle of the night and of the mist and of the moon and of the dew had left uncovered the features of his face and his brow was lofty with thought and his eye wild with care and in the few furrows upon his cheek i read the fables of sorrow and weariness and disgust with mankind and a longing after solitude and the man sat upon the rock and leaned his head upon his hand and looked out upon the desolation he looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery and up into the tall primeval trees and up higher at the rustling heaven and into the crimson moon and i lay close within shelter of the lilies and observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the solitude but the night waned and he sat upon the rock and the man turned his attention from the heaven and looked out upon the dreary river zaire and upon the yellow ghastly waters and upon the pale legions of the waterlilies and the man listened to the sighs of the waterlilies and to the murmur that came up from among them and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the solitude but the night waned and he sat upon the rock then i went down into the recesses of the morass and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass and the hippopotami heard my call and came with the behemoth unto the foot of the rock and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the solitude but the night waned and he sat upon the rock then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where before there had been no wind and the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest and the rain beat upon the head of the man and the floods of the river came down and the river was tormented into foam and the waterlilies shrieked within their beds and the forest crumbled before the wind and the thunder rolled and the lightning fell and the rock rocked to its foundation and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the solitude but the night waned and he sat upon the rock then i grew angry and cursed with the curse of silence the river and the lilies and the wind and the forest and the heaven and the thunder and the sighs of the waterlilies and they became accursed and were still and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven and the thunder died away and the lightning did not flash and the clouds hung motionless and the waters sunk to their level and remained and the trees ceased to rock and the waterlilies sighed no more and the murmur was heard no longer from among them nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert and i looked upon the characters of the rock and they were changed and the characters were silence and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man and his countenance was wan with terror and hurriedly he raised his head from his hand and stood forth upon the rock and listened but there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert and the characters upon the rock were silence and the man shuddered and turned his face away and fled afar off in haste so that i beheld him no more now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magi in the ironbound melancholy volumes of the magi therein i say are glorious histories of the heaven and of the earth and of the mighty sea and of the genii that overruled the sea and the earth and the lofty heaven there was much lore too in the sayings which were said by the sybils and holy holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around dodona but as allah liveth that fable which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb i hold to be the most wonderful of all and as the demon made an end of his story he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed and i could not laugh with the demon and he cursed me because i could not laugh and the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb came out therefrom and lay down at the feet of the demon and looked at him steadily in the face end of text the masque of the red death the red death had long devastated the country no pestilence had ever been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and its seal the redness and the horror of blood there were sharp pains and sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution the scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellowmen and the whole seizure progress and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an hour but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when his dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and lighthearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys this was an extensive and magnificent structure the creation of the princes own eccentric yet august taste a strong and lofty wall girdled it in this wall had gates of iron the courtiers having entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts they resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within the abbey was amply provisioned with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion the external world could take care of itself in the meantime it was folly to grieve or to think the prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure there were buffoons there were improvisatori there were balletdancers there were musicians there was beauty there was wine all these and security were within without was the red death it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held there were seven an imperial suite in many palaces however such suites form a long and straight vista while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded here the case was very different as might have been expected from the dukes love of the bizarre the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards and at each turn a novel effect to the right and left in the middle of each wall a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite these windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened that at the eastern extremity was hung for example in blue and vividly blue were its windows the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes were purple the third was green throughout and so were the casements the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange the fifth with white the sixth with violet the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue but in this chamber only the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations the panes here were scarlet a deep blood color now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers but in the corridors that followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a heavy tripod bearing a brazier of fire that protected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances but in the western or black chamber the effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings through the bloodtinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all it was in this apartment also that there stood against the western wall a gigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull heavy monotonous clang and when the minutehand made the circuit of the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that at each lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause momentarily in their performance to hearken to the sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the chimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew pale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation but when the echoes had fully ceased a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each to the other that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion and then after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies there came yet another chiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel the tastes of the duke were peculiar he had a fine eye for colors and effects he disregarded the decora of mere fashion his plans were bold and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there are some who would have thought him mad his followers felt that he was not it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not he had directed in great part the moveable embellishments of the seven chambers upon occasion of this great fete and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders be sure they were grotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm much of what has been since seen in hernani there were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions there was much of the beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the terrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of dreams and these the dreams writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps and anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet and then for a moment all is still and all is silent save the voice of the clock the dreams are stifffrozen as they stand but the echoes of the chime die away they have endured but an instant and a light halfsubdued laughter floats after them as they depart and now again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the manytinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture for the night is waning away and there flows a ruddier light through the bloodcolored panes and the blackness of the sable drapery appals and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat feverishly the heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock and then the music ceased as i have told and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought crept with more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled and thus too it happened perhaps that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before and the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from the whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation and surprise then finally of terror of horror and of disgust in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited but the figure in question had outheroded herod and gone beyond the bounds of even the princes indefinite decorum there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion even with the utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jests there are matters of which no jest can be made the whole company indeed seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the figure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat and yet all this might have been endured if not approved by the mad revellers around but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death his vesture was dabbled in blood and his broad brow with all the features of the face was besprinkled with the scarlet horror when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which with a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its role stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be convulsed in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste but in the next his brow reddened with rage who dares he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize him and unmask him that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from the battlements it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero as he uttered these words they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly for the prince was a bold and robust man and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of pale courtiers by his side at first as he spoke there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder who at the moment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and stately step made closer approach to the speaker but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party there were found none who put forth hand to seize him so that unimpeded he passed within a yard of the princes person and while the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first through the blue chamber to the purple through the purple to the green through the green to the orange through this again to the white and even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him it was then however that the prince prospero maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had approached in rapid impetuosity to within three or four feet of the retreating figure when the latter having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer there was a sharp cry and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterwards fell prostrate in death the prince prospero then summoning the wild courage of despair a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterable horror at finding the gravecerements and corpselike mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death he had come like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revellers in the bloodbedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairing posture of his fall and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay and the flames of the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all end of text the cask of amontillado the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could but when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge you who so well know the nature of my soul will not suppose however that i gave utterance to a threat at length i would be avenged this was a point definitively settledbut the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk i must not only punish but punish with impunity a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good will i continued as was my wont to smile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation he had a weak pointthis fortunatoalthough in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared he prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine few italians have the true virtuoso spirit for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunityto practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires in painting and gemmary fortunato like his countrymen was a quackbut in the matter of old wines he was sincere in this respect i did not differ from him materially i was skilful in the italian vintages myself and bought largely whenever i could it was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season that i encountered my friend he accosted me with excessive warmth for he had been drinking much the man wore motley he had on a tightfitting partistriped dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells i was so pleased to see him that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand i said to himmy dear fortunato you are luckily met how remarkably well you are looking today but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado and i have my doubts how said he amontillado a pipe impossible and in the middle of the carnival i have my doubts i replied and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to be found and i was fearful of losing a bargain amontillado i have my doubts amontillado and i must satisfy them amontillado as you are engaged i am on my way to luchesi if any one has a critical turn it is he he will tell me luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own come let us go whither to your vaults my friend no i will not impose upon your good nature i perceive you have an engagement luchesi i have no engagementcome my friend no it is not the engagement but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted the vaults are insufferably damp they are encrusted with nitre let us go nevertheless the cold is merely nothing amontillado you have been imposed upon and as for luchesi he cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado thus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person i suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo there were no attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in honor of the time i had told them that i should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house these orders were sufficient i well knew to insure their immediate disappearance one and all as soon as my back was turned i took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one to fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults i passed down a long and winding staircase requesting him to be cautious as he followed we came at length to the foot of the descent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode the pipe said he it is farther on said i but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls he turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication nitre he asked at length nitre i replied how long have you had that cough ugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ugh my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes it is nothing he said at last come i said with decision we will go back your health is precious you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy as once i was you are a man to be missed for me it is no matter we will go back you will be ill and i cannot be responsible besides there is luchesi enough he said the cough is a mere nothing it will not kill me i shall not die of a cough truetrue i replied and indeed i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarilybut you should use all proper caution a draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould drink i said presenting him the wine he raised it to his lips with a leer he paused and nodded to me familiarly while his bells jingled i drink he said to the buried that repose around us and i to your long life he again took my arm and we proceeded these vaults he said are extensive the montresors i replied were a great and numerous family i forget your arms a huge human foot dor in a field azure the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel and the motto nemo me impune lacessit good he said the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled my own fancy grew warm with the medoc we had passed through walls of piled bones with casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of the catacombs i paused again and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow the nitre i said see it increases it hangs like moss upon the vaults we are below the rivers bed the drops of moisture trickle among the bones come we will go back ere it is too late your cough it is nothing he said let us go on but first another draught of the medoc i broke and reached him a flagon of de grвve he emptied it at a breath his eyes flashed with a fierce light he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand i looked at him in surprise he repeated the movementa grotesque one you do not comprehend he said not i i replied then you are not of the brotherhood how you are not of the masons yes yes i said yes yes you impossible a mason a mason i replied a sign he said it is this i answered producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire you jest he exclaimed recoiling a few paces but let us proceed to the amontillado be it so i said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm he leaned upon it heavily we continued our route in search of the amontillado we passed through a range of low arches descended passed on and descending again arrived at a deep crypt in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the vault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner from the fourth the bones had been thrown down and lay promiscuously upon the earth forming at one point a mound of some size within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess in depth about four feet in width three in height six or seven it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite it was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see proceed i said herein is the amontillado as for luchesi he is an ignoramus interrupted my friend as he stepped unsteadily forward while i followed immediately at his heels in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche and finding his progress arrested by the rock stood stupidly bewildered a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite in its surface were two iron staples distant from each other about two feet horizontally from one of these depended a short chain from the other a padlock throwing the links about his waist it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it he was too much astounded to resist withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess pass your hand i said over the wall you cannot help feeling the nitre indeed it is very damp once more let me implore you to return no then i must positively leave you but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power the amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from his astonishment true i replied the amontillado as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken throwing them aside i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar with these materials and with the aid of my trowel i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche i had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess it was not the cry of a drunken man there was then a long and obstinate silence i laid the second tier and the third and the fourth and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain the noise lasted for several minutes during which that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction i ceased my labors and sat down upon the bones when at last the clanking subsided i resumed the trowel and finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the seventh tier the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast i again paused and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within a succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form seemed to thrust me violently back for a brief moment i hesitatedi trembled unsheathing my rapier i began to grope with it about the recess but the thought of an instant reassured me i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs and felt satisfied i reapproached the wall i replied to the yells of him who clamored i reechoedi aidedi surpassed them in volume and in strength i did this and the clamorer grew still it was now midnight and my task was drawing to a close i had completed the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in i struggled with its weight i placed it partially in its destined position but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head it was succeeded by a sad voice which i had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble fortunato the voice said ha ha hahe hea very good joke indeedan excellent jest we will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzohe he heover our winehe he he the amontillado i said he he hehe he heyes the amontillado but is it not getting late will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo the lady fortunato and the rest let us be gone yes i said let us be gone for the love of god montressor yes i said for the love of god but to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply i grew impatient i called aloud fortunato no answer i called again fortunato no answer still i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within there came forth in return only a jingling of the bells my heart grew sickon account of the dampness of the catacombs i hastened to make an end of my labor i forced the last stone into its position i plastered it up against the new masonry i reerected the old rampart of bones for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them in pace requiescat end of text the imp of the perverse in the consideration of the faculties and impulses of the prima mobilia of the human soul the phrenologists have failed to make room for a propensity which although obviously existing as a radical primitive irreducible sentiment has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them in the pure arrogance of the reason we have all overlooked it we have suffered its existence to escape our senses solely through want of belief of faith whether it be faith in revelation or faith in the kabbala the idea of it has never occurred to us simply because of its supererogation we saw no need of the impulse for the propensity we could not perceive its necessity we could not understand that is to say we could not have understood had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself we could not have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity either temporal or eternal it cannot be denied that phrenology and in great measure all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori the intellectual or logical man rather than the understanding or observant man set himself to imagine designs to dictate purposes to god having thus fathomed to his satisfaction the intentions of jehovah out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind in the matter of phrenology for example we first determined naturally enough that it was the design of the deity that man should eat we then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness and this organ is the scourge with which the deity compels man willi nilli into eating secondly having settled it to be gods will that man should continue his species we discovered an organ of amativeness forthwith and so with combativeness with ideality with causality with constructiveness so in short with every organ whether representing a propensity a moral sentiment or a faculty of the pure intellect and in these arrangements of the principia of human action the spurzheimites whether right or wrong in part or upon the whole have but followed in principle the footsteps of their predecessors deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of man and upon the ground of the objects of his creator it would have been wiser it would have been safer to classify if classify we must upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did and was always occasionally doing rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the deity intended him to do if we cannot comprehend god in his visible works how then in his inconceivable thoughts that call the works into being if we cannot understand him in his objective creatures how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation induction a posteriori would have brought phrenology to admit as an innate and primitive principle of human action a paradoxical something which we may call perverseness for want of a more characteristic term in the sense i intend it is in fact a mobile without motive a motive not motivirt through its promptings we act without comprehensible object or if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms we may so far modify the proposition as to say that through its promptings we act for the reason that we should not in theory no reason can be more unreasonable but in fact there is none more strong with certain minds under certain conditions it becomes absolutely irresistible i am not more certain that i breathe than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels us and alone impels us to its prosecution nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrongs sake admit of analysis or resolution into ulterior elements it is a radical a primitive impulseelementary it will be said i am aware that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology but a glance will show the fallacy of this idea the phrenological combativeness has for its essence the necessity of selfdefence it is our safeguard against injury its principle regards our wellbeing and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development it follows that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness but in the case of that something which i term perverseness the desire to be well is not only not aroused but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists an appeal to ones own heart is after all the best reply to the sophistry just noticed no one who trustingly consults and thoroughly questions his own soul will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the propensity in question it is not more incomprehensible than distinctive there lives no man who at some period has not been tormented for example by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by circumlocution the speaker is aware that he displeases he has every intention to please he is usually curt precise and clear the most laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses yet the thought strikes him that by certain involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered that single thought is enough the impulse increases to a wish the wish to a desire the desire to an uncontrollable longing and the longing to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker and in defiance of all consequences is indulged we have a task before us which must be speedily performed we know that it will be ruinous to make delay the most important crisis of our life calls trumpettongued for immediate energy and action we glow we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire it must it shall be undertaken today and yet we put it off until tomorrow and why there is no answer except that we feel perverse using the word with no comprehension of the principle tomorrow arrives and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty but with this very increase of anxiety arrives also a nameless a positively fearful because unfathomable craving for delay this craving gathers strength as the moments fly the last hour for action is at hand we tremble with the violence of the conflict within us of the definite with the indefinite of the substance with the shadow but if the contest have proceeded thus far it is the shadow which prevails we struggle in vain the clock strikes and is the knell of our welfare at the same time it is the chanticleer note to the ghost that has so long overawed us it flies it disappears we are free the old energy returns we will labor now alas it is too late we stand upon the brink of a precipice we peer into the abyss we grow sick and dizzy our first impulse is to shrink from the danger unaccountably we remain by slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling by gradations still more imperceptible this cloud assumes shape as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the arabian nights but out of this our cloud upon the precipices edge there grows into palpability a shape far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale and yet it is but a thought although a fearful one and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror it is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height and this fall this rushing annihilation for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it and because our reason violently deters us from the brink therefore do we the most impetuously approach it there is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient as that of him who shuddering upon the edge of a precipice thus meditates a plunge to indulge for a moment in any attempt at thought is to be inevitably lost for reflection but urges us to forbear and therefore it is i say that we cannot if there be no friendly arm to check us or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss we plunge and are destroyed examine these similar actions as we will we shall find them resulting solely from the spirit of the perverse we perpetrate them because we feel that we should not beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle and we might indeed deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the archfiend were it not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good i have said thus much that in some measure i may answer your question that i may explain to you why i am here that i may assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned had i not been thus prolix you might either have misunderstood me altogether or with the rabble have fancied me mad as it is you will easily perceive that i am one of the many uncounted victims of the imp of the perverse it is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough deliberation for weeks for months i pondered upon the means of the murder i rejected a thousand schemes because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection at length in reading some french memoirs i found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to madame pilau through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned the idea struck my fancy at once i knew my victims habit of reading in bed i knew too that his apartment was narrow and illventilated but i need not vex you with impertinent details i need not describe the easy artifices by which i substituted in his bedroom candlestand a waxlight of my own making for the one which i there found the next morning he was discovered dead in his bed and the coroners verdict was death by the visitation of god having inherited his estate all went well with me for years the idea of detection never once entered my brain of the remains of the fatal taper i had myself carefully disposed i had left no shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict or even to suspect me of the crime it is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as i reflected upon my absolute security for a very long period of time i was accustomed to revel in this sentiment it afforded me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin but there arrived at length an epoch from which the pleasurable feeling grew by scarcely perceptible gradations into a haunting and harassing thought it harassed because it haunted i could scarcely get rid of it for an instant it is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears or rather in our memories of the burthen of some ordinary song or some unimpressive snatches from an opera nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good or the opera air meritorious in this manner at last i would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security and repeating in a low undertone the phrase i am safe one day whilst sauntering along the streets i arrested myself in the act of murmuring half aloud these customary syllables in a fit of petulance i remodelled them thus i am safe i am safe yes if i be not fool enough to make open confession no sooner had i spoken these words than i felt an icy chill creep to my heart i had had some experience in these fits of perversity whose nature i have been at some trouble to explain and i remembered well that in no instance i had successfully resisted their attacks and now my own casual selfsuggestion that i might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which i had been guilty confronted me as if the very ghost of him whom i had murdered and beckoned me on to death at first i made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul i walked vigorously faster still faster at length i ran i felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud every succeeding wave of thought overwhelmed me with new terror for alas i well too well understood that to think in my situation was to be lost i still quickened my pace i bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares at length the populace took the alarm and pursued me i felt then the consummation of my fate could i have torn out my tongue i would have done it but a rough voice resounded in my ears a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder i turned i gasped for breath for a moment i experienced all the pangs of suffocation i became blind and deaf and giddy and then some invisible fiend i thought struck me with his broad palm upon the back the long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul they say that i spoke with a distinct enunciation but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry as if in dread of interruption before concluding the brief but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and to hell having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction i fell prostrate in a swoon but why shall i say more today i wear these chains and am here tomorrow i shall be fetterless but where end of text the island of the fay nullus enim locus sine genio est servius la musique says marmontel in those contes moraux which in all our translations we have insisted upon calling moral tales as if in mockery of their spirit la musique est le seul des talents qui jouissent de luimeme tous les autres veulent des temoins he here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them no more than any other talent is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise and it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude the idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point is doubtless the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone the proposition in this form will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and for its spiritual uses but there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only one which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion i mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery in truth the man who would behold aright the glory of god upon earth must in solitude behold that glory to me at least the presence not of human life only but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless is a stain upon the landscape is at war with the genius of the scene i love indeed to regard the dark valleys and the gray rocks and the waters that silently smile and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all i love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole a whole whose form that of the sphere is the most perfect and most inclusive of all whose path is among associate planets whose meek handmaiden is the moon whose mediate sovereign is the sun whose life is eternity whose thought is that of a god whose enjoyment is knowledge whose destinies are lost in immensity whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain a being which we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood that space and therefore that bulk is an important consideration in the eyes of the almighty the cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution without collision of the greatest possible number of bodies the forms of those bodies are accurately such as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of matter while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with god that space itself is infinite for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle indeed as far as our judgments extend the leading principle in the operations of deity it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute where we daily trace it and not extending to those of the august as we find cycle within cycle without end yet all revolving around one fardistant centre which is the godhead may we not analogically suppose in the same manner life within life the less within the greater and all within the spirit divine in short we are madly erring through selfesteem in believing man in either his temporal or future destinies to be of more moment in the universe than that vast clod of the valley which he tills and contemns and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation these fancies and such as these have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests by the rivers and the ocean a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic my wanderings amid such scenes have been many and farsearching and often solitary and the interest with which i have strayed through many a dim deep valley or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have strayed and gazed alone what flippant frenchman was it who said in allusion to the wellknown work of zimmerman that la solitude est une belle chose mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose the epigram cannot be gainsayed but the necessity is a thing that does not exist it was during one of my lonely journeyings amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain and sad rivers and melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all that i chanced upon a certain rivulet and island i came upon them suddenly in the leafy june and threw myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub that i might doze as i contemplated the scene i felt that thus only should i look upon it such was the character of phantasm which it wore on all sides save to the west where the sun was about sinking arose the verdant walls of the forest the little river which turned sharply in its course and was thus immediately lost to sight seemed to have no exit from its prison but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east while in the opposite quarter so it appeared to me as i lay at length and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in one small circular island profusely verdured reposed upon the bosom of the stream so blended bank and shadow there that each seemed pendulous in air so mirrorlike was the glassy water that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion began my position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet and i observed a singularlymarked difference in their aspects the latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties it glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight and fairly laughed with flowers the grass was short springy sweetscented and asphodelinterspersed the trees were lithe mirthful erect bright slender and graceful of eastern figure and foliage with bark smooth glossy and particolored there seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all and although no airs blew from out the heavens yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade a sombre yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things the trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude wreathing themselves into sad solemn and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death the grass wore the deep tint of the cypress and the heads of its blades hung droopingly and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks low and narrow and not very long that had the aspect of graves but were not although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered the shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water and seemed to bury itself therein impregnating the depths of the element with darkness i fancied that each shadow as the sun descended lower and lower separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth and thus became absorbed by the stream while other shadows issued momently from the trees taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it and i lost myself forthwith in revery if ever island were enchanted said i to myself this is it this is the haunt of the few gentle fays who remain from the wreck of the race are these green tombs theirs or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own in dying do they not rather waste away mournfully rendering unto god little by little their existence as these trees render up shadow after shadow exhausting their substance unto dissolution what the wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its shade growing thus blacker by what it preys upon may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it as i thus mused with halfshut eyes while the sun sank rapidly to rest and eddying currents careered round and round the island bearing upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the sycamoreflakes which in their multiform positions upon the water a quick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased while i thus mused it appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays about whom i had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island she stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams her attitude seemed indicative of joy but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade slowly she glided along and at length rounded the islet and reentered the region of light the revolution which has just been made by the fay continued i musingly is the cycle of the brief year of her life she has floated through her winter and through her summer she is a year nearer unto death for i did not fail to see that as she came into the shade her shadow fell from her and was swallowed up in the dark water making its blackness more black and again the boat appeared and the fay but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy she floated again from out the light and into the gloom which deepened momently and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water and became absorbed into its blackness and again and again she made the circuit of the island while the sun rushed down to his slumbers and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade which became whelmed in a shadow more black but at length when the sun had utterly departed the fay now the mere ghost of her former self went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood and that she issued thence at all i cannot say for darkness fell over an things and i beheld her magical figure no more end of text the assignation stay for me there i will not fail to meet thee in that hollow vale exequy on the death of his wife by henry king bishop of chichester illfated and mysterious manbewildered in the brilliancy of thine own imagination and fallen in the flames of thine own youth again in fancy i behold thee once more thy form hath risen before menotoh not as thou artin the cold valley and shadowbut as thou shouldst besquandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions thine own venicewhich is a starbeloved elysium of the sea and the wide windows of whose palladian palaces look down with a deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters yes i repeat itas thou shouldst be there are surely other worlds than thisother thoughts than the thoughts of the multitudeother speculations than the speculations of the sophist who then shall call thy conduct into question who blame thee for thy visionary hours or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies it was at venice beneath the covered archway there called the ponte di sospiri that i met for the third or fourth time the person of whom i speak it is with a confused recollection that i bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting yet i rememberah how should i forgetthe deep midnight the bridge of sighs the beauty of woman and the genius of romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal it was a night of unusual gloom the great clock of the piazza had sounded the fifth hour of the italian evening the square of the campanile lay silent and deserted and the lights in the old ducal palace were dying fast away i was returning home from the piazetta by way of the grand canal but as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal san marco a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night in one wild hysterical and long continued shriek startled at the sound i sprang upon my feet while the gondolier letting slip his single oar lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel like some huge and sablefeathered condor we were slowly drifting down towards the bridge of sighs when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the windows and down the staircases of the ducal palace turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day a child slipping from the arms of its own mother had fallen from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal the quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim and although my own gondola was the only one in sight many a stout swimmer already in the stream was seeking in vain upon the surface the treasure which was to be found alas only within the abyss upon the broad black marble flagstones at the entrance of the palace and a few steps above the water stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten it was the marchesa aphroditethe adoration of all venicethe gayest of the gaythe most lovely where all were beautifulbut still the young wife of the old and intriguing mentoni and the mother of that fair child her first and only one who now deep beneath the murky water was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon her name she stood alone her small bare and silvery feet gleamed in the black mirror of marble beneath her her hair not as yet more than half loosened for the night from its ballroom array clustered amid a shower of diamonds round and round her classical head in curls like those of the young hyacinth a snowywhite and gauzelike drapery seemed to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form but the midsummer and midnight air was hot sullen and still and no motion in the statuelike form itself stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the niobe yetstrange to sayher large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buriedbut riveted in a widely different direction the prison of the old republic is i think the stateliest building in all venicebut how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it when beneath her lay stifling her only child yon dark gloomy niche too yawns right opposite her chamber windowwhat then could there be in its shadowsin its architecturein its ivywreathed and solemn cornicesthat the marchesa di mentoni had not wondered at a thousand times before nonsensewho does not remember that at such a time as this the eye like a shattered mirror multiplies the images of its sorrow and sees in innumerable faroff places the wo which is close at hand many steps above the marchesa and within the arch of the watergate stood in full dress the satyrlike figure of mentoni himself he was occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar and seemed ennuye to the very death as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his child stupified and aghast i had myself no power to move from the upright position i had assumed upon first hearing the shriek and must have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous appearance as with pale countenance and rigid limbs i floated down among them in that funereal gondola all efforts proved in vain many of the most energetic in the search were relaxing their exertions and yielding to a gloomy sorrow there seemed but little hope for the child how much less than for the mother but now from the interior of that dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of the old republican prison and as fronting the lattice of the marchesa a figure muffled in a cloak stepped out within reach of the light and pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy descent plunged headlong into the canal as in an instant afterwards he stood with the still living and breathing child within his grasp upon the marble flagstones by the side of the marchesa his cloak heavy with the drenching water became unfastened and falling in folds about his feet discovered to the wonderstricken spectators the graceful person of a very young man with the sound of whose name the greater part of europe was then ringing no word spoke the deliverer but the marchesa she will now receive her childshe will press it to her heartshe will cling to its little form and smother it with her caresses alas anothers arms have taken it from the strangeranothers arms have taken it away and borne it afar off unnoticed into the palace and the marchesa her lipher beautiful lip trembles tears are gathering in her eyesthose eyes which like plinys acanthus are soft and almost liquid yes tears are gathering in those eyesand see the entire woman thrills throughout the soul and the statue has started into life the pallor of the marble countenance the swelling of the marble bosom the very purity of the marble feet we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide of ungovernable crimson and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate frame as a gentle air at napoli about the rich silver lilies in the grass why should that lady blush to this demand there is no answerexcept that having left in the eager haste and terror of a mothers heart the privacy of her own boudoir she has neglected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers and utterly forgotten to throw over her venetian shoulders that drapery which is their due what other possible reason could there have been for her so blushingfor the glance of those wild appealing eyes for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosomfor the convulsive pressure of that trembling handthat hand which fell as mentoni turned into the palace accidentally upon the hand of the stranger what reason could there have been for the lowthe singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu thou hast conquered she said or the murmurs of the water deceived me thou hast conqueredone hour after sunrisewe shall meetso let it be the tumult had subsided the lights had died away within the palace and the stranger whom i now recognized stood alone upon the flags he shook with inconceivable agitation and his eye glanced around in search of a gondola i could not do less than offer him the service of my own and he accepted the civility having obtained an oar at the watergate we proceeded together to his residence while he rapidly recovered his selfpossession and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of great apparent cordiality there are some subjects upon which i take pleasure in being minute the person of the strangerlet me call him by this title who to all the world was still a strangerthe person of the stranger is one of these subjects in height he might have been below rather than above the medium size although there were moments of intense passion when his frame actually expanded and belied the assertion the light almost slender symmetry of his figure promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at the bridge of sighs than of that herculean strength which he has been known to wield without an effort upon occasions of more dangerous emergency with the mouth and chin of a deitysingular wild full liquid eyes whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense and brilliant jetand a profusion of curling black hair from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and ivoryhis were features than which i have seen none more classically regular except perhaps the marble ones of the emperor commodus yet his countenance was nevertheless one of those which all men have seen at some period of their lives and have never afterwards seen again it had no peculiarit had no settled predominant expression to be fastened upon the memory a countenance seen and instantly forgottenbut forgotten with a vague and neverceasing desire of recalling it to mind not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed at any time to throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that facebut that the mirror mirrorlike retained no vestige of the passion when the passion had departed upon leaving him on the night of our adventure he solicited me in what i thought an urgent manner to call upon him very early the next morning shortly after sunrise i found myself accordingly at his palazzo one of those huge structures of gloomy yet fantastic pomp which tower above the waters of the grand canal in the vicinity of the rialto i was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics into an apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an actual glare making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness i knew my acquaintance to be wealthy report had spoken of his possessions in terms which i had even ventured to call terms of ridiculous exaggeration but as i gazed about me i could not bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in europe could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around although as i say the sun had arisen yet the room was still brilliantly lighted up i judge from this circumstance as well as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night in the architecture and embellishments of the chamber the evident design had been to dazzle and astound little attention had been paid to the decora of what is technically called keeping or to the proprieties of nationality the eye wandered from object to object and rested upon noneneither the grotesques of the greek painters nor the sculptures of the best italian days nor the huge carvings of untutored egypt rich draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low melancholy music whose origin was not to be discovered the senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes reeking up from strange convolute censers together with multitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald and violet fire the rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the whole through windows formed each of a single pane of crimsontinted glass glancing to and fro in a thousand reflections from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten silver the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the artificial light and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of rich liquidlooking cloth of chili gold ha ha haha ha ha laughed the proprietor motioning me to a seat as i entered the room and throwing himself back at fulllength upon an ottoman i see said he perceiving that i could not immediately reconcile myself to the bienseance of so singular a welcomei see you are astonished at my apartmentat my statuesmy picturesmy originality of conception in architecture and upholstery absolutely drunk eh with my magnificence but pardon me my dear sir here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality pardon me for my uncharitable laughter you appeared so utterly astonished besides some things are so completely ludicrous that a man must laugh or die to die laughing must be the most glorious of all glorious deaths sir thomas morea very fine man was sir thomas moresir thomas more died laughing you remember also in the absurdities of ravisius textor there is a long list of characters who came to the same magnificent end do you know however continued he musingly that at sparta which is now palж ochori at sparta i say to the west of the citadel among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins is a kind of socle upon which are still legible the letters they are undoubtedly part of now at sparta were a thousand temples and shrines to a thousand different divinities how exceedingly strange that the altar of laughter should have survived all the others but in the present instance he resumed with a singular alteration of voice and manner i have no right to be merry at your expense you might well have been amazed europe cannot produce anything so fine as this my little regal cabinet my other apartments are by no means of the same ordermere ultras of fashionable insipidity this is better than fashionis it not yet this has but to be seen to become the ragethat is with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony i have guarded however against any such profanation with one exception you are the only human being besides myself and my valet who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial precincts since they have been bedizzened as you see i bowed in acknowledgmentfor the overpowering sense of splendor and perfume and music together with the unexpected eccentricity of his address and manner prevented me from expressing in words my appreciation of what i might have construed into a compliment here he resumed arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around the apartment here are paintings from the greeks to cimabue and from cimabue to the present hour many are chosen as you see with little deference to the opinions of virtu they are all however fitting tapestry for a chamber such as this here too are some chefs doeuvre of the unknown great and here unfinished designs by men celebrated in their day whose very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to silence and to me what think you said he turning abruptly as he spokewhat think you of this madonna della pieta it is guidos own i said with all the enthusiasm of my nature for i had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness it is guidos ownhow could you have obtained itshe is undoubtedly in painting what the venus is in sculpture ha said he thoughtfully the venusthe beautiful venusthe venus of the medicishe of the diminutive head and the gilded hair part of the left arm here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty and all the right are restorations and in the coquetry of that right arm lies i think the quintessence of all affectation give me the canova the apollo too is a copythere can be no doubt of itblind fool that i am who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the apollo i cannot helppity mei cannot help preferring the antinous was it not socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of marble then michael angelo was by no means original in his couplet non ha lottimo artista alcun concetto che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva it has been or should be remarked that in the manner of the true gentleman we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the vulgar without being at once precisely able to determine in what such difference consists allowing the remark to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance i felt it on that eventful morning still more fully applicable to his moral temperament and character nor can i better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought pervading even his most trivial actionsintruding upon his moments of dallianceand interweaving itself with his very flashes of merrimentlike adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of persepolis i could not help however repeatedly observing through the mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon matters of little importance a certain air of trepidationa degree of nervous unction in action and in speechan unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable and upon some occasions even filled me with alarm frequently too pausing in the middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention as if either in momentary expectation of a visiter or to sounds which must have had existence in his imagination alone it was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction that in turning over a page of the poet and scholar politians beautiful tragedy the orfeo the first native italian tragedy which lay near me upon an ottoman i discovered a passage underlined in pencil it was a passage towards the end of the third acta passage of the most heartstirring excitementa passage which although tainted with impurity no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotionno woman without a sigh the whole page was blotted with fresh tears and upon the opposite interleaf were the following english lines written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my acquaintance that i had some difficulty in recognising it as his own thou wast that all to me love for which my soul did pinea green isle in the sea love a fountain and a shrine all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers and all the flowers were mine ah dream too bright to last ah starry hope that didst arise but to be overcast a voice from out the future cries onward but oer the past dim gulf my spirit hovering lies mutemotionlessaghast for alas alas with me the light of life is oer no moreno moreno more such language holds the solemn sea to the sands upon the shore shall bloom the thunderblasted tree or the stricken eagle soar now all my hours are trances and all my nightly dreams are where the dark eye glances and where thy footstep gleams in what ethereal dances by what italian streams alas for that accursed time they bore thee oer the billow from love to titled age and crime and an unholy pillowfrom me and from our misty clime where weeps the silver willow that these lines were written in englisha language with which i had not believed their author acquaintedafforded me little matter for surprise i was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements and of the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation to be astonished at any similar discovery but the place of date i must confess occasioned me no little amazement it had been originally written london and afterwards carefully overscorednot however so effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye i say this occasioned me no little amazement for i well remember that in a former conversation with a friend i particularly inquired if he had at any time met in london the marchesa di mentoni who for some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city when his answer if i mistake not gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of great britain i might as well here mention that i have more than once heard without of course giving credit to a report involving so many improbabilities that the person of whom i speak was not only by birth but in education an englishman there is one painting said he without being aware of my notice of the tragedythere is still one painting which you have not seen and throwing aside a drapery he discovered a fulllength portrait of the marchesa aphrodite human art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman beauty the same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon the steps of the ducal palace stood before me once again but in the expression of the countenance which was beaming all over with smiles there still lurked incomprehensible anomaly that fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful her right arm lay folded over her bosom with her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase one small fairy foot alone visible barely touched the earth and scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to encircle and enshrine her loveliness floated a pair of the most delicately imagined wings my glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend and the vigorous words of chapmans bussy dambois quivered instinctively upon my lips he is up there like a roman statue he will stand till death hath made him marble come he said at length turning towards a table of richly enamelled and massive silver upon which were a few goblets fantastically stained together with two large etruscan vases fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait and filled with what i supposed to be johannisberger come he said abruptly let us drink it is earlybut let us drink it is indeed early he continued musingly as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise it is indeed earlybut what matters it let us drink let us pour out an offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are so eager to subdue and having made me pledge him in a bumper he swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine to dream he continued resuming the tone of his desultory conversation as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the magnificent vasesto dream has been the business of my life i have therefore framed for myself as you see a bower of dreams in the heart of venice could i have erected a better you behold around you it is true a medley of architectural embellishments the chastity of ionia is offended by antediluvian devices and the sphynxes of egypt are outstretched upon carpets of gold yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone proprieties of place and especially of time are the bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent once i was myself a decorist but that sublimation of folly has palled upon my soul all this is now the fitter for my purpose like these arabesque censers my spirit is writhing in fire and the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land of real dreams whither i am now rapidly departing he here paused abruptly bent his head to his bosom and seemed to listen to a sound which i could not hear at length erecting his frame he looked upwards and ejaculated the lines of the bishop of chichester stay for me there i will not fail to meet thee in that hollow vale in the next instant confessing the power of the wine he threw himself at fulllength upon an ottoman a quick step was now heard upon the staircase and a loud knock at the door rapidly succeeded i was hastening to anticipate a second disturbance when a page of mentonis household burst into the room and faltered out in a voice choking with emotion the incoherent words my mistressmy mistresspoisonedpoisoned oh beautifuloh beautiful aphrodite bewildered i flew to the ottoman and endeavored to arouse the sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence but his limbs were rigidhis lips were lividhis lately beaming eyes were riveted in death i staggered back towards the tablemy hand fell upon a cracked and blackened gobletand a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul end of text the pit and the pendulum impia tortorum longos hic turba furores sanguinis innocui non satiata aluit sospite nunc patria fracto nunc funeris antro mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the site of the jacobin club house at paris i was sick sick unto death with that long agony and when they at length unbound me and i was permitted to sit i felt that my senses were leaving me the sentence the dread sentence of death was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears after that the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel this only for a brief period for presently i heard no more yet for a while i saw but with how terrible an exaggeration i saw the lips of the blackrobed judges they appeared to me white whiter than the sheet upon which i trace these words and thin even to grotesqueness thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness of immoveable resolution of stern contempt of human torture i saw that the decrees of what to me was fate were still issuing from those lips i saw them writhe with a deadly locution i saw them fashion the syllables of my name and i shuddered because no sound succeeded i saw too for a few moments of delirious horror the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment and then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table at first they wore the aspect of charity and seemed white and slender angels who would save me but then all at once there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit and i felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if i had touched the wire of a galvanic battery while the angel forms became meaningless spectres with heads of flame and i saw that from them there would be no help and then there stole into my fancy like a rich musical note the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave the thought came gently and stealthily and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it the figures of the judges vanished as if magically from before me the tall candles sank into nothingness their flames went out utterly the blackness of darkness supervened all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into hades then silence and stillness night were the universe i had swooned but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost what of it there remained i will not attempt to define or even to describe yet all was not lost in the deepest slumber no in delirium no in a swoon no in death no even in the grave all is not lost else there is no immortality for man arousing from the most profound of slumbers we break the gossamer web of some dream yet in a second afterward so frail may that web have been we remember not that we have dreamed in the return to life from the swoon there are two stages first that of the sense of mental or spiritual secondly that of the sense of physical existence it seems probable that if upon reaching the second stage we could recall the impressions of the first we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond and that gulf is what how at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb but if the impressions of what i have termed the first stage are not at will recalled yet after long interval do they not come unbidden while we marvel whence they come he who has never swooned is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow is not he who beholds floating in midair the sad visions that the many may not view is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed there have been moments when i have dreamed of success there have been brief very brief periods when i have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness these shadows of memory tell indistinctly of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down down still down till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent they tell also of a vague horror at my heart on account of that hearts unnatural stillness then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things as if those who bore me a ghastly train had outrun in their descent the limits of the limitless and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil after this i call to mind flatness and dampness and then all is madness the madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound the tumultuous motion of the heart and in my ears the sound of its beating then a pause in which all is blank then again sound and motion and touch a tingling sensation pervading my frame then the mere consciousness of existence without thought a condition which lasted long then very suddenly thought and shuddering terror and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move and now a full memory of the trial of the judges of the sable draperies of the sentence of the sickness of the swoon then entire forgetfulness of all that followed of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall so far i had not opened my eyes i felt that i lay upon my back unbound i reached out my hand and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard there i suffered it to remain for many minutes while i strove to imagine where and what i could be i longed yet dared not to employ my vision i dreaded the first glance at objects around me it was not that i feared to look upon things horrible but that i grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see at length with a wild desperation at heart i quickly unclosed my eyes my worst thoughts then were confirmed the blackness of eternal night encompassed me i struggled for breath the intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me the atmosphere was intolerably close i still lay quietly and made effort to exercise my reason i brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition the sentence had passed and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed yet not for a moment did i suppose myself actually dead such a supposition notwithstanding what we read in fiction is altogether inconsistent with real existence but where and in what state was i the condemned to death i knew perished usually at the autosdafe and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial had i been remanded to my dungeon to await the next sacrifice which would not take place for many months this i at once saw could not be victims had been in immediate demand moreover my dungeon as well as all the condemned cells at toledo had stone floors and light was not altogether excluded a fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart and for a brief period i once more relapsed into insensibility upon recovering i at once started to my feet trembling convulsively in every fibre i thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions i felt nothing yet dreaded to move a step lest i should be impeded by the walls of a tomb perspiration burst from every pore and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead the agony of suspense grew at length intolerable and i cautiously moved forward with my arms extended and my eyes straining from their sockets in the hope of catching some faint ray of light i proceeded for many paces but still all was blackness and vacancy i breathed more freely it seemed evident that mine was not at least the most hideous of fates and now as i still continued to step cautiously onward there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of toledo of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated fables i had always deemed them but yet strange and too ghastly to repeat save in a whisper was i left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness or what fate perhaps even more fearful awaited me that the result would be death and a death of more than customary bitterness i knew too well the character of my judges to doubt the mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me my outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction it was a wall seemingly of stone masonry very smooth slimy and cold i followed it up stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me this process however afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon as i might make its circuit and return to the point whence i set out without being aware of the fact so perfectly uniform seemed the wall i therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket when led into the inquisitorial chamber but it was gone my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge i had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry so as to identify my point of departure the difficulty nevertheless was but trivial although in the disorder of my fancy it seemed at first insuperable i tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length and at right angles to the wall in groping my way around the prison i could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit so at least i thought but i had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon or upon my own weakness the ground was moist and slippery i staggered onward for some time when i stumbled and fell my excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate and sleep soon overtook me as i lay upon awaking and stretching forth an arm i found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water i was too much exhausted to reflect upon this circumstance but ate and drank with avidity shortly afterward i resumed my tour around the prison and with much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge up to the period when i fell i had counted fiftytwo paces and upon resuming my walk i had counted fortyeight more when i arrived at the rag there were in all then a hundred paces and admitting two paces to the yard i presumed the dungeon to be fifty yards in circuit i had met however with many angles in the wall and thus i could form no guess at the shape of the vault for vault i could not help supposing it to be i had little object certainly no hope these researches but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them quitting the wall i resolved to cross the area of the enclosure at first i proceeded with extreme caution for the floor although seemingly of solid material was treacherous with slime at length however i took courage and did not hesitate to step firmly endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible i had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs i stepped on it and fell violently on my face in the confusion attending my fall i did not immediately apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance which yet in a few seconds afterward and while i still lay prostrate arrested my attention it was this my chin rested upon the floor of the prison but my lips and the upper portion of my head although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin touched nothing at the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils i put forward my arm and shuddered to find that i had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit whose extent of course i had no means of ascertaining at the moment groping about the masonry just below the margin i succeeded in dislodging a small fragment and let it fall into the abyss for many seconds i hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent at length there was a sullen plunge into water succeeded by loud echoes at the same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening and as rapid closing of a door overhead while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the gloom and as suddenly faded away i saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me and congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which i had escaped another step before my fall and the world had seen me no more and the death just avoided was of that very character which i had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the inquisition to the victims of its tyranny there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies or death with its most hideous moral horrors i had been reserved for the latter by long suffering my nerves had been unstrung until i trembled at the sound of my own voice and had become in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me shaking in every limb i groped my way back to the wall resolving there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells of which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon in other conditions of mind i might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses but now i was the veriest of cowards neither could i forget what i had read of these pits that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours but at length i again slumbered upon arousing i found by my side as before a loaf and a pitcher of water a burning thirst consumed me and i emptied the vessel at a draught it must have been drugged for scarcely had i drunk before i became irresistibly drowsy a deep sleep fell upon me a sleep like that of death how long it lasted of course i know not but when once again i unclosed my eyes the objects around me were visible by a wild sulphurous lustre the origin of which i could not at first determine i was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison in its size i had been greatly mistaken the whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twentyfive yards for some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble vain indeed for what could be of less importance under the terrible circumstances which environed me then the mere dimensions of my dungeon but my soul took a wild interest in trifles and i busied myself in endeavors to account for the error i had committed in my measurement the truth at length flashed upon me in my first attempt at exploration i had counted fiftytwo paces up to the period when i fell i must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge in fact i had nearly performed the circuit of the vault i then slept and upon awaking i must have returned upon my steps thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was my confusion of mind prevented me from observing that i began my tour with the wall to the left and ended it with the wall to the right i had been deceived too in respect to the shape of the enclosure in feeling my way i had found many angles and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep the angles were simply those of a few slight depressions or niches at odd intervals the general shape of the prison was square what i had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron or some other metal in huge plates whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression the entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise the figures of fiends in aspects of menace with skeleton forms and other more really fearful images overspread and disfigured the walls i observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct but that the colors seemed faded and blurred as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere i now noticed the floor too which was of stone in the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws i had escaped but it was the only one in the dungeon all this i saw indistinctly and by much effort for my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber i now lay upon my back and at full length on a species of low framework of wood to this i was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle it passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body leaving at liberty only my head and my left arm to such extent that i could by dint of much exertion supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor i saw to my horror that the pitcher had been removed i say to my horror for i was consumed with intolerable thirst this thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned looking upward i surveyed the ceiling of my prison it was some thirty or forty feet overhead and constructed much as the side walls in one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention it was the painted figure of time as he is commonly represented save that in lieu of a scythe he held what at a casual glance i supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks there was something however in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively while i gazed directly upward at it for its position was immediately over my own i fancied that i saw it in motion in an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed its sweep was brief and of course slow i watched it for some minutes somewhat in fear but more in wonder wearied at length with observing its dull movement i turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell a slight noise attracted my notice and looking to the floor i saw several enormous rats traversing it they had issued from the well which lay just within view to my right even then while i gazed they came up in troops hurriedly with ravenous eyes allured by the scent of the meat from this it required much effort and attention to scare them away it might have been half an hour perhaps even an hour for i could take but imperfect note of time before i again cast my eyes upward what i then saw confounded and amazed me the sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard as a natural consequence its velocity was also much greater but what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended i now observed with what horror it is needless to say that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel about a foot in length from horn to horn the horns upward and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor like a razor also it seemed massy and heavy tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above it was appended to a weighty rod of brass and the whole hissed as it swung through the air i could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture my cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agents the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myself the pit typical of hell and regarded by rumor as the ultima thule of all their punishments the plunge into this pit i had avoided by the merest of accidents i knew that surprise or entrapment into torment formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths having failed to fall it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss and thus there being no alternative a different and a milder destruction awaited me milder i half smiled in my agony as i thought of such application of such a term what boots it to tell of the long long hours of horror more than mortal during which i counted the rushing vibrations of the steel inch by inch line by line with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed ages down and still down it came days passed it might have been that many days passed ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath the odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils i prayed i wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent i grew frantically mad and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar and then i fell suddenly calm and lay smiling at the glittering death as a child at some rare bauble there was another interval of utter insensibility it was brief for upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum but it might have been long for i knew there were demons who took note of my swoon and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure upon my recovery too i felt very oh inexpressibly sick and weak as if through long inanition even amid the agonies of that period the human nature craved food with painful effort i outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats as i put a portion of it within my lips there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy of hope yet what business had i with hope it was as i say a half formed thought man has many such which are never completed i felt that it was of joy of hope but felt also that it had perished in its formation in vain i struggled to perfect to regain it long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind i was an imbecile an idiot the vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length i saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart it would fray the serge of my robe it would return and repeat its operations again and again notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep some thirty feet or more and the its hissing vigor of its descent sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron still the fraying of my robe would be all that for several minutes it would accomplish and at this thought i paused i dared not go farther than this reflection i dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention as if in so dwelling i could arrest here the descent of the steel i forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garment upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves i pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge down steadily down it crept i took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity to the right to the left far and wide with the shriek of a damned spirit to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger i alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant down certainly relentlessly down it vibrated within three inches of my bosom i struggled violently furiously to free my left arm this was free only from the elbow to the hand i could reach the latter from the platter beside me to my mouth with great effort but no farther could i have broken the fastenings above the elbow i would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum i might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche down still unceasingly still inevitably down i gasped and struggled at each vibration i shrunk convulsively at its every sweep my eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent although death would have been a relief oh how unspeakable still i quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen glistening axe upon my bosom it was hope that prompted the nerve to quiver the frame to shrink it was hope the hope that triumphs on the rack that whispers to the deathcondemned even in the dungeons of the inquisition i saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen collected calmness of despair for the first time during many hours or perhaps days i thought it now occurred to me that the bandage or surcingle which enveloped me was unique i was tied by no separate cord the first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand but how fearful in that case the proximity of the steel the result of the slightest struggle how deadly was it likely moreover that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum dreading to find my faint and as it seemed in last hope frustrated i so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast the surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions save in the path of the destroying crescent scarcely had i dropped my head back into its original position when there flashed upon my mind what i cannot better describe than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which i have previously alluded and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when i raised food to my burning lips the whole thought was now present feeble scarcely sane scarcely definite but still entire i proceeded at once with the nervous energy of despair to attempt its execution for many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which i lay had been literally swarming with rats they were wild bold ravenous their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey to what food i thought have they been accustomed in the well they had devoured in spite of all my efforts to prevent them all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish i had fallen into an habitual seesaw or wave of the hand about the platter and at length the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect in their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers with the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained i thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever i could reach it then raising my hand from the floor i lay breathlessly still at first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change at the cessation of movement they shrank alarmedly back many sought the well but this was only for a moment i had not counted in vain upon their voracity observing that i remained without motion one or two of the boldest leaped upon the framework and smelt at the surcingle this seemed the signal for a general rush forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops they clung to the wood they overran it and leaped in hundreds upon my person the measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage they pressed they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps they writhed upon my throat their cold lips sought my own i was half stifled by their thronging pressure disgust for which the world has no name swelled my bosom and chilled with a heavy clamminess my heart yet one minute and i felt that the struggle would be over plainly i perceived the loosening of the bandage i knew that in more than one place it must be already severed with a more than human resolution i lay still nor had i erred in my calculations nor had i endured in vain i at length felt that i was free the surcingle hung in ribands from my body but the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom it had divided the serge of the robe it had cut through the linen beneath twice again it swung and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve but the moment of escape had arrived at a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away with a steady movement cautious sidelong shrinking and slow i slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar for the moment at least i was free free and in the grasp of the inquisition i had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and i beheld it drawn up by some invisible force through the ceiling this was a lesson which i took desperately to heart my every motion was undoubtedly watched free i had but escaped death in one form of agony to be delivered unto worse than death in some other with that thought i rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in something unusual some change which at first i could not appreciate distinctly it was obvious had taken place in the apartment for many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction i busied myself in vain unconnected conjecture during this period i became aware for the first time of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell it proceeded from a fissure about half an inch in width extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls which thus appeared and were completely separated from the floor i endeavored but of course in vain to look through the aperture as i arose from the attempt the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding i have observed that although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite these colors had now assumed and were momentarily assuming a startling and most intense brilliancy that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own demon eyes of a wild and ghastly vivacity glared upon me in a thousand directions where none had been visible before and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that i could not force my imagination to regard as unreal unreal even while i breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapour of heated iron a suffocating odour pervaded the prison a deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies a richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood i panted i gasped for breath there could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors oh most unrelenting oh most demoniac of men i shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm i rushed to its deadly brink i threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw at length it forced it wrestled its way into my soul it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason oh for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but this with a shriek i rushed from the margin and buried my face in my hands weeping bitterly the heat rapidly increased and once again i looked up shuddering as with a fit of the ague there had been a second change in the cell and now the change was obviously in the form as before it was in vain that i at first endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place but not long was i left in doubt the inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my twofold escape and there was to be no more dallying with the king of terrors the room had been square i saw that two of its iron angles were now acute two consequently obtuse the fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound in an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge but the alteration stopped not herei neither hoped nor desired it to stop i could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace death i said any death but that of the pit fool might i have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me could i resist its glow or if even that could i withstand its pressure and now flatter and flatter grew the lozenge with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation its centre and of course its greatest width came just over the yawning gulf i shrank back but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward at length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison i struggled no more but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud long and final scream of despair i felt that i tottered upon the brink i averted my eyes there was a discordant hum of human voices there was a loud blast as of many trumpets there was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders the fiery walls rushed back an outstretched arm caught my own as i fell fainting into the abyss it was that of general lasalle the french army had entered toledo the inquisition was in the hands of its enemies end of text the premature burial there are certain themes of which the interest is allabsorbing but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction these the mere romanticist must eschew if he do not wish to offend or to disgust they are with propriety handled only when the severity and majesty of truth sanctify and sustain them we thrill for example with the most intense of pleasurable pain over the accounts of the passage of the beresina of the earthquake at lisbon of the plague at london of the massacre of st bartholomew or of the stifling of the hundred and twentythree prisoners in the black hole at calcutta but in these accounts it is the fact it is the reality it is the history which excites as inventions we should regard them with simple abhorrence i have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities on record but in these it is the extent not less than the character of the calamity which so vividly impresses the fancy i need not remind the reader that from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries i might have selected many individual instances more replete with essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster the true wretchedness indeed the ultimate woe is particular not diffuse that the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit and never by man the mass for this let us thank a merciful god to be buried while alive is beyond question the most terrific of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality that it has frequently very frequently so fallen will scarcely be denied by those who think the boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins we know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the apparent functions of vitality and yet in which these cessations are merely suspensions properly so called they are only temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism a certain period elapses and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels the silver cord was not for ever loosed nor the golden bowl irreparably broken but where meantime was the soul apart however from the inevitable conclusion a priori that such causes must produce such effects that the wellknown occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise now and then to premature interments apart from this consideration we have the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such interments have actually taken place i might refer at once if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances one of very remarkable character and of which the circumstances may be fresh in the memory of some of my readers occurred not very long ago in the neighboring city of baltimore where it occasioned a painful intense and widelyextended excitement the wife of one of the most respectable citizensa lawyer of eminence and a member of congress was seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness which completely baffled the skill of her physicians after much suffering she died or was supposed to die no one suspected indeed or had reason to suspect that she was not actually dead she presented all the ordinary appearances of death the face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline the lips were of the usual marble pallor the eyes were lustreless there was no warmth pulsation had ceased for three days the body was preserved unburied during which it had acquired a stony rigidity the funeral in short was hastened on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition the lady was deposited in her family vault which for three subsequent years was undisturbed at the expiration of this term it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus but alas how fearful a shock awaited the husband who personally threw open the door as its portals swung outwardly back some whiteapparelled object fell rattling within his arms it was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud a careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within two days after her entombment that her struggles within the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge or shelf to the floor where it was so broken as to permit her escape a lamp which had been accidentally left full of oil within the tomb was found empty it might have been exhausted however by evaporation on the uttermost of the steps which led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin with which it seemed that she had endeavored to arrest attention by striking the iron door while thus occupied she probably swooned or possibly died through sheer terror and in failing her shroud became entangled in some iron work which projected interiorly thus she remained and thus she rotted erect in the year a case of living inhumation happened in france attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that truth is indeed stranger than fiction the heroine of the story was a mademoiselle victorine lafourcade a young girl of illustrious family of wealth and of great personal beauty among her numerous suitors was julien bossuet a poor litterateur or journalist of paris his talents and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress by whom he seems to have been truly beloved but her pride of birth decided her finally to reject him and to wed a monsieur renelle a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence after marriage however this gentleman neglected and perhaps even more positively illtreated her having passed with him some wretched years she died at least her condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her she was buried not in a vault but in an ordinary grave in the village of her nativity filled with despair and still inflamed by the memory of a profound attachment the lover journeys from the capital to the remote province in which the village lies with the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse and possessing himself of its luxuriant tresses he reaches the grave at midnight he unearths the coffin opens it and is in the act of detaching the hair when he is arrested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes in fact the lady had been buried alive vitality had not altogether departed and she was aroused by the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death he bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village he employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning in fine she revived she recognized her preserver she remained with him until by slow degrees she fully recovered her original health her womans heart was not adamant and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it she bestowed it upon bossuet she returned no more to her husband but concealing from him her resurrection fled with her lover to america twenty years afterward the two returned to france in the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the ladys appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her they were mistaken however for at the first meeting monsieur renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife this claim she resisted and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her resistance deciding that the peculiar circumstances with the long lapse of years had extinguished not only equitably but legally the authority of the husband the chirurgical journal of leipsic a periodical of high authority and merit which some american bookseller would do well to translate and republish records in a late number a very distressing event of the character in question an officer of artillery a man of gigantic stature and of robust health being thrown from an unmanageable horse received a very severe contusion upon the head which rendered him insensible at once the skull was slightly fractured but no immediate danger was apprehended trepanning was accomplished successfully he was bled and many other of the ordinary means of relief were adopted gradually however he fell into a more and more hopeless state of stupor and finally it was thought that he died the weather was warm and he was buried with indecent haste in one of the public cemeteries his funeral took place on thursday on the sunday following the grounds of the cemetery were as usual much thronged with visiters and about noon an intense excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that while sitting upon the grave of the officer he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth as if occasioned by some one struggling beneath at first little attention was paid to the mans asseveration but his evident terror and the dogged obstinacy with which he persisted in his story had at length their natural effect upon the crowd spades were hurriedly procured and the grave which was shamefully shallow was in a few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant appeared he was then seemingly dead but he sat nearly erect within his coffin the lid of which in his furious struggles he had partially uplifted he was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital and there pronounced to be still living although in an asphytic condition after some hours he revived recognized individuals of his acquaintance and in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave from what he related it was clear that he must have been conscious of life for more than an hour while inhumed before lapsing into insensibility the grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an exceedingly porous soil and thus some air was necessarily admitted he heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead and endeavored to make himself heard in turn it was the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery he said which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep but no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his position this patient it is recorded was doing well and seemed to be in a fair way of ultimate recovery but fell a victim to the quackeries of medical experiment the galvanic battery was applied and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic paroxysms which occasionally it superinduces the mention of the galvanic battery nevertheless recalls to my memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point where its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of london who had been interred for two days this occurred in and created at the time a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject of converse the patient mr edward stapleton had died apparently of typhus fever accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity of his medical attendants upon his seeming decease his friends were requested to sanction a postmortem examination but declined to permit it as often happens when such refusals are made the practitioners resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure in private arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of bodysnatchers with which london abounds and upon the third night after the funeral the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight feet deep and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private hospitals an incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an application of the battery one experiment succeeded another and the customary effects supervened with nothing to characterize them in any respect except upon one or two occasions a more than ordinary degree of lifelikeness in the convulsive action it grew late the day was about to dawn and it was thought expedient at length to proceed at once to the dissection a student however was especially desirous of testing a theory of his own and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles a rough gash was made and a wire hastily brought in contact when the patient with a hurried but quite unconvulsive movement arose from the table stepped into the middle of the floor gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds and then spoke what he said was unintelligible but words were uttered the syllabification was distinct having spoken he fell heavily to the floor for some moments all were paralyzed with awe but the urgency of the case soon restored them their presence of mind it was seen that mr stapleton was alive although in a swoon upon exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to health and to the society of his friends from whom however all knowledge of his resuscitation was withheld until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended their wonder their rapturous astonishment may be conceived the most thrilling peculiarity of this incident nevertheless is involved in what mr s himself asserts he declares that at no period was he altogether insensible that dully and confusedly he was aware of everything which happened to him from the moment in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians to that in which he fell swooning to the floor of the hospital i am alive were the uncomprehended words which upon recognizing the locality of the dissectingroom he had endeavored in his extremity to utter it were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these but i forbear for indeed we have no need of such to establish the fact that premature interments occur when we reflect how very rarely from the nature of the case we have it in our power to detect them we must admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance scarcely in truth is a graveyard ever encroached upon for any purpose to any great extent that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most fearful of suspicions fearful indeed the suspicion but more fearful the doom it may be asserted without hesitation that no event is so terribly well adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress as is burial before death the unendurable oppression of the lungs the stifling fumes from the damp earth the clinging to the death garments the rigid embrace of the narrow house the blackness of the absolute night the silence like a sea that overwhelms the unseen but palpable presence of the conqueror worm these things with the thoughts of the air and grass above with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but informed of our fate and with consciousness that of this fate they can never be informed that our hopeless portion is that of the really dead these considerations i say carry into the heart which still palpitates a degree of appalling and intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil we know of nothing so agonizing upon earth we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost hell and thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest profound an interest nevertheless which through the sacred awe of the topic itself very properly and very peculiarly depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated what i have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge of my own positive and personal experience for several years i had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy in default of a more definitive title although both the immediate and the predisposing causes and even the actual diagnosis of this disease are still mysterious its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood its variations seem to be chiefly of degree sometimes the patient lies for a day only or even for a shorter period in a species of exaggerated lethargy he is senseless and externally motionless but the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible some traces of warmth remain a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek and upon application of a mirror to the lips we can detect a torpid unequal and vacillating action of the lungs then again the duration of the trance is for weeks even for months while the closest scrutiny and the most rigorous medical tests fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to catalepsy by the consequent suspicion excited and above all by the nonappearance of decay the advances of the malady are luckily gradual the first manifestations although marked are unequivocal the fits grow successively more and more distinctive and endure each for a longer term than the preceding in this lies the principal security from inhumation the unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb my own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in medical books sometimes without any apparent cause i sank little by little into a condition of hemisyncope or half swoon and in this condition without pain without ability to stir or strictly speaking to think but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the presence of those who surrounded my bed i remained until the crisis of the disease restored me suddenly to perfect sensation at other times i was quickly and impetuously smitten i grew sick and numb and chilly and dizzy and so fell prostrate at once then for weeks all was void and black and silent and nothing became the universe total annihilation could be no more from these latter attacks i awoke however with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night just so tardily just so wearily just so cheerily came back the light of the soul to me apart from the tendency to trance however my general health appeared to be good nor could i perceive that it was at all affected by the one prevalent malady unless indeed an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as superinduced upon awaking from slumber i could never gain at once thorough possession of my senses and always remained for many minutes in much bewilderment and perplexity the mental faculties in general but the memory in especial being in a condition of absolute abeyance in all that i endured there was no physical suffering but of moral distress an infinitude my fancy grew charnel i talked of worms of tombs and epitaphs i was lost in reveries of death and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my brain the ghastly danger to which i was subjected haunted me day and night in the former the torture of meditation was excessive in the latter supreme when the grim darkness overspread the earth then with every horror of thought i shook shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse when nature could endure wakefulness no longer it was with a struggle that i consented to sleep for i shuddered to reflect that upon awaking i might find myself the tenant of a grave and when finally i sank into slumber it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms above which with vast sable overshadowing wing hovered predominant the one sepulchral idea from the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams i select for record but a solitary vision methought i was immersed in a cataleptic trance of that it may fare the worse for his appearing in it as things are now governed where our answer was read and debated and some hot words between the duke of york and sir t clifford the first for and the latter against gawden but the whole put off to tomorrows council for till the king goes out of town the next week the council sits every day so with the duke of york and some others to his closet and alderman backewell about a committee of tangier and there did agree upon a price for pieces of eight at s d present the duke of york arlington berkeley sir j minnes and myself they gone the duke of york did tell me how hot clifford is for child and for removing of old officers he saying plainly tonight that though d gawden was a man that had done the best service that he believed any man or any ten men could have done yet that it was for the kings interest not to let it lie too long in one hand lest nobody should be able to serve him but one but the duke of york did openly tell him that he was not for removing of old servants that have done well neither in this place nor in any other place which is very nobly said it being or at night i home with backewell by coach and so walked to d gawdens but he not at home and so back to my chamber the boy to read to me and so to supper and to bed th could sleep but little last night for my concernments in this business of the victualling for sir d gawden so up in the morning and he comes to me and there i did tell him all and give him my advice and so he away and i to the office where we met and did a little business and i left them and by water to attend the council which i did all the morning but was not called in but the council meets again in the afternoon on purpose about it so i at noon to westminster hall and there stayed a little and at the swan also thinking to have got doll lane thither but elle did not understand my signs and so i away and walked to charing cross and there into the great new ordinary by my lord mulgraves being led thither by mr beale one of olivers and now of the kings guards and he sat with me while i had two grilled pigeons very handsome and good meat and there he and i talked of our old acquaintances w clerke and others he being a very civil man and so walked to westminster and there parted and i to the swan again but did nothing and so to white hall and there attended the king and council who met and heard our answer i present and then withdrew and they sent two hours at least afterwards about it and at last rose and to my great content the duke of york at coming out told me that it was carried for d gawden at d d and d but with great difficulty i understand both from him and others so much that sir edward walker told me that he prays to god he may never live to need to plead his merit for d gawdens sake for that it hath stood him in no stead in this business at all though both he and all the world that speaks of him speaks of him as the most deserving man of any servant of the kings in the whole nation and so i think he is but it is done and my heart is glad at it so i took coach and away and in holborne overtook d gawdens coach and stopped and went home and gibson to come after and to my house where d gawden did talk a little and he do mightily acknowledge my kindness to him and i know i have done the king and myself good service in it so he gone and myself in mighty great content in what is done i to the office a little and then home to supper and the boy to read to me and so to bed this noon i went to my lady peterboroughs house and talked with her about the money due to her lord and it gives me great trouble her importunity and impertinency about it this afternoon at court i met with lord hinchingbroke newly come out of the country who tells me that creeds business with mrs pickering will do which i am neither troubled nor glad at th lords day up and to my office to finish my journall for five days past and so abroad and walked to white hall calling in at somerset house chapel and also at the spanish embassadors at york house and there did hear a little masse and so to white hall and there the king being gone to chapel i to walk all the morning in the park where i met mr wren and he and i walked together in the pellmell it being most summer weather that ever was seen and here talking of several things of the corruption of the court and how unfit it is for ingenious men and himself particularly to live in it where a man cannot live but he must spend and cannot get suitably without breach of his honour and did thereupon tell me of the basest thing of my lord barkeley one of the basest things that ever was heard of of a man which was this how the duke of yorks commissioners do let his winelicenses at a bad rate and being offered a better they did persuade the duke of york to give some satisfaction to the former to quit it and let it to the latter which being done my lord barkeley did make the bargain for the former to have l ayear to quit it whereof since it is come to light that they were to have but l and himself l which the duke of york hath ever since for some years paid though this second bargain hath been broken and the duke of york lost by it half of what the first was he told me that there hath been a seeming accommodation between the duke of york and the duke of buckingham and lord arlington the two latter desiring it but yet that there is not true agreement between them but they do labour to bring in all new creatures into play and the duke of york do oppose it as particularly in this of sir d gawden thence he gone i to the queens chapel and there heard some good singing and so to white hall and saw the king and queen at dinner and thence with sir stephen fox to dinner and the cofferer with us and there mighty kind usage and good discourse thence spent all the afternoon walking in the park and then in the evening at court on the queens side and there met mr godolphin who tells me that the news is true we heard yesterday of my lord sandwichs being come to mounts bay in cornwall and so i heard this afternoon at mrs pierces whom i went to make a short visit to this night in the queens drawingroom my lord brouncker told me the difference that is now between the three embassadors here the venetian french and spaniard the third not being willing to make a visit to the first because he would not receive him at the door who is willing to give him as much respect as he did to the french who was used no otherwise and who refuses now to take more of him upon being desired thereto in order to the making an accommodation in this matter which is very pretty so a boat staying for me all this evening i home in the dark about eight at night and so over the ruins from the old swan home with great trouble and so to hear my boy read a little and supper and to bed this evening i found at home pelling and wallington and one aldrige and we supped and sung th up betimes and knepps maid comes to me to tell me that the womens day at the playhouse is today and that therefore i must be there to encrease their profit i did give the pretty maid betty that comes to me halfacrown for coming and had a baiser or twoelle being mighty jolie and so i about my business by water to st jamess and there had good opportunity of speaking with the duke of york who desires me again talking on that matter to prepare something for him to do for the better managing of our office telling me that my lord keeper and he talking about it yesterday my lord keeper did advise him to do so it being better to come from him than otherwise which i have promised to do thence to my lord burlingtons houses the first time i ever was there it being the house built by sir john denham next to clarendon house and here i visited my lord hinchingbroke and his lady mr sidney montagu being come last night to town unexpectedly from mounts bay where he left my lord well eight days since so as we may now hourly expect to hear of his arrival at portsmouth sidney is mighty grown and i am glad i am here to see him at his first coming though it cost me dear for here i come to be necessitated to supply them with l for my lord he sent him up with a declaration to his friends of the necessity of his being presently supplied with l but i do not think he will get one however i think it becomes my duty to my lord to do something extraordinary in this and the rather because i have been remiss in writing to him during this voyage more than ever i did in my life and more indeed than was fit for me by and by comes sir w godolphin to see mr sidney who i perceive is much dissatisfied that he should come to town last night and not yet be with my lord arlington who and all the town hear of his being come to town and he did it seems take notice of it to godolphin this morning so that i perceive this remissness in affairs do continue in my lords managements still which i am sorry for but above all to see in what a condition my lord is for money that i dare swear he do not know where to take up l of any man in england at this time upon his word but of myself as i believe by the sequel hereof it will appear here i first saw and saluted my lady burlington a very finespeaking lady and a good woman but old and not handsome but a brave woman in her parts here my lady hinchingbroke tells me that she hath bought most of the weddingclothes for mrs dickering so that the thing is gone through and will soon be ended which i wonder at but let them do as they will here i also standing by a candle that was brought for sealing of a letter do set my periwigg afire which made such an odd noise nobody could tell what it was till they saw the flame my back being to the candle thence to westminster hall and there walked a little and to the exchequer and so home by water and after eating a bit i to my vintners and there did only look upon su wife which is mighty handsome and so to my glove and ribbon shop in fenchurch street and did the like there and there stopping against the door of the shop saw mrs horsfall now a late widow in a coach i to her and shook her by the hand and so she away and i by coach towards the kings playhouse and meeting w howe took him with me and there saw the city match not acted these thirty years and but a silly play the king and court there the house for the womens sake mighty full so i to white hall and there all the evening on the queens side and it being a most summerlike day and a fine warm evening the italians come in a barge under the leads before the queens drawingroom and so the queen and ladies went out and heard them for almost an hour and it was indeed very good together but yet there was but one voice that alone did appear considerable and that was seignor joanni this done by and by they went in and here i saw mr sidney montagu kiss the queens hand who was mighty kind to him and the ladies looked mightily on him and the king come by and by and did talk to him so i away by coach with alderman backewell home who is mighty kind to me more than ordinary in his expressions but i do hear this day what troubles me that sir w coventry is quite out of play the king seldom speaking to him and that there is a design of making a lord treasurer and that my lord arlington shall be the man but i cannot believe it but yet the duke of buckingham hath it in his mind and those with him to make a thorough alteration in things and among the rest coventry to be out the duke of york did this day tell me how hot the whole party was in the business of gawden and particularly my lord anglesey tells me the duke of buckingham for child against gawden but the duke of york did stand stoutly to it so home to read and sup and to bed th tuesday michaelmas day up and to the office where all the morning the diary of samuel pepys ma frs clerk of the acts and secretary to the admiralty transcribed from the shorthand manuscript in the pepysian library magdalene college cambridge by the rev mynors bright ma late fellow and president of the college unabridged with lord braybrookes notes edited with additions by henry b wheatley fsa diary of samuel pepys october in this part of the diary no entry occurs for thirteen days though there are several pages left blank during the interval pepys went into the country as he subsequently mentions his having been at saxham in suffolk during the kings visit to lord crofts which took place at this time see october rd host he might also probably have gone to impington to fetch his wife the pages left blank were never filled up b october th lords day up and to church where i find parson mills come to town and preached and the church full most people being now come home to town though the season of year is as good as summer in all respects at noon dined at home with my wife all alone and busy all the afternoon in my closet making up some papers with w hewer and at night comes mr turner and his wife and there they tell me that mr harper is dead at deptford and so now all his and my care is how to secure his being storekeeper in his stead and here they and their daughter and a kinswoman that come along with them did sup with me and pretty merry and then they gone and my wife to read to me and to bed th up and with mr turner by water to white hall there to think to enquire when the duke of york will be in town in order to mr turners going down to audley ends about his place and here i met in st jamess park with one that told us that the duke of york would be in town tomorrow and so turner parted and went home and i also did stop my intentions of going to the court also this day about securing mr turners place of pettypurveyor to mr hater so i to my lord brounckers thinking to have gone and spoke to him about it but he is gone out to town till night and so meeting a gentleman of my lord middletons looking for me about the payment of the l lately ordered to his lord in advance of his pay which shall arise upon his going governor to tangier i did go to his lords lodgings and there spoke the first time with him and find him a shrewd man but a drinking man i think as the world says but a man that hath seen much of the world and is a scot i offered him my service though i can do him little but he sends his man home with me where i made him stay till i had gone to sir w pen to bespeak him about mr hater who contrary to my fears did appear very friendly to my great content for i was afraid of his appearing for his man burroughs but he did not but did declare to me afterwards his intentions to desire an excuse in his own business to be eased of the business of the comptroller his health not giving him power to stay always in town but he must go into the country i did say little to him but compliment having no leisure to think of his business or any mans but my own and so away and home where i find sir h cholmly come to town and is come hither to see me and he is a man that i love mightily as being of a gentleman the most industrious that ever i saw he staid with me awhile talking and telling me his obligations to my lord sandwich which i was glad of and that the duke of buckingham is now chief of all men in this kingdom which i knew before and that he do think the parliament will hardly ever meet again which is a great many mens thoughts and i shall not be sorry for it he being gone i with my lord middletons servant to mr colvills but he was not in town and so he parted and i home and there to dinner and mr pelling with us and thence my wife and mercer and w hewer and deb to the kings playhouse and i afterwards by water with them and there we did hear the eunuch who it seems is a frenchman but long bred in italy sing which i seemed to take as new to me though i saw him on saturday last but said nothing of it but such action and singing i could never have imagined to have heard and do make good whatever tom hill used to tell me here we met with mr batelier and his sister and so they home with us in two coaches and there at my house staid and supped and this night my bookseller shrewsbury comes and brings my books of martyrs and i did pay him for them and did this night make the young women before supper to open all the volumes for me so to supper and after supper to read a ridiculous nonsensical book set out by will pen for the quakers but so full of nothing but nonsense that i was ashamed to read in it so they gone we to bed penns first work entitled truth exalted in a short but sure testimony against all those religions faiths and worships that have been formed and followed in the darkness of apostacy and for that glorious light which is now risen and shines forth in the life and doctrine of the despised quakers by w penn whom divine love constrains in holy contempt to trample on egypts glory not fearing the kings wrath having beheld the majesty of him who is invisible london b th up and to the office and before the office did speak with my lord brouncker and there did get his ready assent to t haters having of mr turners place and so sir j minness also but when we come to sit down at the board comes to us mr wren this day to town and tells me that james southern do petition the duke of york for the storekeepers place of deptford which did trouble me much and also the board though upon discourse after he was gone we did resolve to move hard for our clerks and that places of preferment may go according to seniority and merit so the board up i home with my people to dinner and so to the office again and there after doing some business i with mr turner to the duke of albemarles at night and there did speak to him about his appearing to mr wren a friend to mr turner which he did take kindly from me and so away thence well pleased with what we had now done and so i with him home stopping at my lord brounckers and getting his hand to a letter i wrote to the duke of york for t hater and also at my lord middletons to give him an account of what i had done this day with his man at alderman backewells about the getting of his l paid it was probably for this payment that the tally was obtained the loss of which caused pepys so much anxiety see november th and here he did take occasion to discourse about the business of the dutch war which he says he was always an enemy to and did discourse very well of it i saying little but pleased to hear him talk and to see how some men may by age come to know much and yet by their drinking and other pleasures render themselves not very considerable i did this day find by discourse with somebody that this nobleman was the great majorgeneral middleton that was of the scots army in the beginning of the late war against the king thence home and to the office to finish my letters and so home and did get my wife to read to me and then deb to comb my head th up and by water stopping at michells and there saw betty but could have no discourse with her but there drank to white hall and there walked to st

another cart but we did not see the trial made thence i home and after dinner to st jamess and there met my brethren but the duke of york being gone out and tonight being a play there and a great festival we would not stay but went all of us to the kings playhouse and there saw the faythful shepherdess again that we might hear the french eunuch sing which we did to our great content though i

please both the king and the duke of york which i shall be sorry for mr moore tells me the sad condition my lord is in in his estate and debts and the way he now lives in so high and so many vain

other news the late frolick and debauchery of sir charles sidly and buckhurst running up and down all the night with their arses bare through the streets and at last fighting and being beat by the watch and clapped up all night and how the king takes their parts and my lord chief justice keeling hath laid the constable by the heels to answer it next sessions which is a horrid shame how the king and these gentlemen did make the fiddlers of thetford this last progress to sing them all the bawdy songs they could think of how sir w coventry was brought the other day to the duchesse of york by the duke to kiss her hand who did acknowledge his unhappiness to occasion her so much sorrow declaring his intentions in it and praying her pardon which she did give him upon his promise to make good his pretences of innocence to her family by his faithfulness to his master the duke of york that the duke of buckingham is now all in all and will ruin coventry if he can and that w coventry do now rest wholly upon the duke of york for his standing which is a great turn he tells me that my lady castlemayne however is a mortal enemy to the duke of buckingham which i understand not but it seems she is disgusted with his greatness and his ill usage of her that the king was drunk at saxam with sidly buckhurst c the night that my lord arlington come thither and would not give him audience or could not which is true for it was the night that i was there and saw the king go up to his chamber and was told that the king had been drinking he tells me too that the duke of york did the next day chide bab may for his occasioning the kings giving himself up to these gentlemen to the neglecting of my lord arlington to which he answered merrily that by god there was no man in england that had heads to lose durst do what they do every day with the king and asked the duke of yorks pardon which is a sign of a mad world god bless us out of it th this morning comes to me the coachmaker and agreed with me for l and stand to the courtesy of what more i should give him upon the finishing of the coach he is likely also to fit me with a coachman there comes also to me mr shotgrave the operator of our royal society to show me his method of making the tubes for the eyes which are clouterly done so that mine are better but i have well informed myself in several things from him and so am glad of speaking with him so to the office where all the morning and then to dinner and so all the afternoon late at the office and so home and my wife to read to me and then with much content to bed this day lord brouncker tells me that the making sir j minnes a bare commissioner is now in doing which i am glad of but he speaks of two new commissioners which i do not believe th lords day up and discoursing with my wife about our house and many new things we are doing of and so to church i and there find jack fenn come and his wife a pretty black woman i never saw her before nor took notice of her now so home and to dinner and after dinner all the afternoon got my wife and boy to read to me and at night w batelier comes and sups with us and after supper to have my head combed by deb which occasioned the greatest sorrow to me that ever i knew in this world for my wife coming up suddenly did find me embracing the girl i was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girle also and i endeavoured to put it off but my wife was struck mute and grew angry and so her voice come to her grew quite out of order and i to say little but to bed and my wife said little also but could not sleep all night but about two in the morning waked me and cried and fell to tell me as a great secret that she was a roman catholique and had received the holy sacrament which troubled me but i took no notice of it but she went on from one thing to another till at last it appeared plainly her trouble was at what she saw but yet i did not know how much she saw and therefore said nothing to her but after her much crying and reproaching me with inconstancy and preferring a sorry girl before her i did give her no provocation but did promise all fair usage to her and love and foreswore any hurt that i did with her till at last she seemed to be at ease again and so toward morning a little sleep and so i with some little repose and rest th rose and up and by water to white hall but with my mind mightily troubled for the poor girle whom i fear i have undone by this my wife telling me that she would turn her out of doors however i was obliged to attend the duke of york thinking to have had a meeting of tangier today but had not but he did take me and mr wren into his closet and there did press me to prepare what i had to say upon the answers of my fellowofficers to his great letter which i promised to do against his coming to town again the next week and so to other discourse finding plainly that he is in trouble and apprehensions of the reformers and would be found to do what he can towards reforming himself and so thence to my lord sandwichs where after long stay he being in talk with others privately i to him and there he taking physic and keeping his chamber i had an hours talk with him about the ill posture of things at this time while the king gives countenance to sir charles sidly and lord buckhurst telling him their late story of running up and down the streets a little while since all night and their being beaten and clapped up all night by the constable who is since chid and imprisoned for his pains he tells me that he thinks his matters do stand well with the king and hopes to have dispatch to his mind but i doubt it and do see that he do fear it too he told me my lady carterets trouble about my writing of that letter of the duke of yorks lately to the office which i did not own but declared to be of no injury to g carteret and that i would write a letter to him to satisfy him therein but this i am in pain how to do without doing myself wrong and the end i had of preparing a justification to myself hereafter when the faults of the navy come to be found out however i will do it in the best manner i can thence by coach home and to dinner finding my wife mightily discontented and the girle sad and no words from my wife to her so after dinner they out with me about two or three things and so home again i all the evening busy and my wife full of trouble in her looks and anon to bed where about midnight she wakes me and there falls foul of me again affirming that she saw me hug and kiss the girle the latter i denied and truly the other i confessed and no more and upon her pressing me did offer to give her under my hand that i would never see mrs pierce more nor knepp but did promise her particular demonstrations of my true love to her owning some indiscretions in what i did but that there was no harm in it she at last upon these promises was quiet and very kind we were and so to sleep and th in the morning up but my mind troubled for the poor girle with whom i could not get opportunity to speak but to the office my mind mighty full of sorrow for her to the office where all the morning and to dinner with my people and to the office all the afternoon and so at night home and there busy to get some things ready against tomorrows meeting of tangier and that being done and my clerks gone my wife did towards bedtime begin to be in a mighty rage from some new matter that she had got in her head and did most part of the night in bed rant at me in most high terms of threats of publishing my shame and when i offered to rise would have rose too and caused a candle to be light to burn by her all night in the chimney while she ranted while the knowing myself to have given some grounds for it did make it my business to appease her all i could possibly and by good words and fair promises did make her very quiet and so rested all night and rose with perfect good peace being heartily afflicted for this folly of mine that did occasion it but was forced to be silent about the girle which i have no mind to part with but much less that the poor girle should be undone by my folly so up with mighty kindness from my wife and a thorough peace and being up did by a note advise the girle what i had done and owned which note i was in pain for till she told me she had burned it this evening mr spong come and sat late with me and first told me of the instrument called parallelogram this useful instrument used for copying maps plans drawings c either of the same size or larger or smaller than the originals is now named a pantograph which i must have one of shewing me his practice thereon by a map of england th so by coach with mr gibson to chancery lane and there made oath before a master of chancery to the tangier account of fees and so to white hall where by and by a committee met my lord sandwich there but his report was not received it being late but only a little business done about the supplying the place with victuals but i did get to my great content my account allowed of fees with great applause by my lord ashly and sir w pen thence home calling at one or two places and there about our workmen who are at work upon my wifes closet and other parts of my house that we are all in dirt so after dinner with mr gibson all the afternoon in my closet and at night to supper and to bed my wife and i at good peace but yet with some little grudgings of trouble in her and more in me about the poor girle th at the office all the morning where mr wren first tells us of the order from the king came last night to the duke of york for signifying his pleasure to the sollicitorgeneral for drawing up a commission for suspending of my lord anglesey and putting in sir thomas littleton and sir thomas osborne the former a creature of arlingtons and the latter of the duke of buckinghams during the suspension the duke of york was forced to obey and did grant it he being to go to newmarket this day with the king and so the king pressed for it but mr wren do own that the duke of york is the most wounded in this in the world for it is done and concluded without his privity after his appearing for lord anglesey and that it is plain that they do ayme to bring the admiralty into commission too and lessen the duke of york this do put strange apprehensions into all our board only i think i am the least troubled at it for i care not at all for it but my lord brouncker and pen do seem to think much of it so home to dinner full of this news and after dinner to the office and so home all the afternoon to do business towards my drawing up an account for the duke of york of the answers of this office to his late great letter and late at it and so to bed with great peace from my wife and quiet i bless god th up betimes and mr povy comes to even accounts with me which we did and then fell to other talk he tells in short how the king is made a child of by buckingham and arlington to the lessening of the duke of york whom they cannot suffer to be great for fear of my lord chancellors return which therefore they make the king violent against that he believes it is impossible these two great men can hold together long or at least that the ambition of the former is so great that he will endeavour to master all and bring into play as many as he can that anglesey will not lose his place easily but will contend in law with whoever comes to execute it that the duke of york in all things but in his codpiece is led by the nose by his wife that w coventry is now by the duke of york made friends with the duchess and that he is often there and waits on her that he do believe that these present great men will break in time and that w coventry will be a great man again for he do labour to have nothing to do in matters of the state and is so usefull to the side that he is on that he will stand though at present he is quite out of play that my lady castlemayne hates the duke of buckingham that the duke of york hath expressed himself very kind to my lord sandwich which i am mighty glad of that we are to expect more changes if these men stand this done he and i to talk of my coach and i got him to go see it where he finds most infinite fault with it both as to being out of fashion and heavy with so good reason that i am mightily glad of his having corrected me in it and so i do resolve to have one of his build and with his advice both in coach and horses he being the fittest man in the world for it and so he carried me home and said the same to my wife so i to the office and he away and at noon i home to dinner and all the afternoon late with gibson at my chamber about my present great business only a little in the afternoon at the office about sir d gawdens accounts and so to bed and slept heartily my wife and i at good peace but my heart troubled and her mind not at ease i perceive she against and i for the girle to whom i have not said anything these three days but resolve to be mighty strange in appearance to her this night w batelier come and took his leave of us he setting out for france tomorrow st up and at the office all the morning at noon home to dinner with my people and afternoon to the office again and then to my chamber with gibson to do more about my great answer for the duke of york and so at night after supper to bed well pleased with my advance thereon this day my lord anglesey was at the office and do seem to make nothing of this business of his suspension resolving to bring it into the council where he seems not to doubt to have right he standing upon his defence and patent and hath put in his caveats to the several offices so as soon as the king comes back again which will be on tuesday next he will bring it into the council so ends this month with some quiet to my mind though not perfect after the greatest falling out with my poor wife and through my folly with the girl that ever i had and i have reason to be sorry and ashamed of it and more to be troubled for the poor girls sake whom i fear i shall by this means prove the ruin of though i shall think myself concerned both to love and be a friend to her this day roger pepys and his son talbot newly come to town come and dined with me and mighty glad i am to see them etext editors bookmarks a book the bishops will not let

business for the duke of york and so at noon to dinner and then w hewer to write fair what he had writ and my wife to read to me all the afternoon till anon mr gibson come and he and i to perfect it to my full mind and so to supper and to bed my mind yet at disquiet that i cannot be informed how poor deb stands with her mistress but i fear she will put her away and the truth is though it be much against my mind and to my trouble yet i think that it will be fit that she should be gone for my wifes peace and mine for she cannot but be offended at the sight of her my wife having conceived this jealousy of me with reason and therefore for that and other reasons of expense it will be best for me to let her go but i shall love and pity her this noon mr povy sent his coach for my wife and i to see which we like mightily and will endeavour to have him get us just such another nd up and a cold morning by water through bridge without a cloak and there to mr wren at his chamber at white hall the first time of his coming thither this year the duchess coming thither tonight and there he and i did read over my paper that i have with so much labour drawn up about the several answers of the officers of this office to the duke of yorks reflections and did debate a little what advice to give the duke of york when he comes to town upon it here come in lord anglesy and i perceive he makes nothing of this order for his suspension resolving to contend and to bring it to the council on wednesday when the king is come to town tomorrow and mr wren do join with him mightily in it and do look upon the duke of york as concerned more in it than he so to visit creed at his chamber but his wife not come thither yet nor do he tell me where she is though she be in town at stepney at atkinss so to mr povys to talk about a coach but there i find my lord sandwich and peterborough and hinchingbroke charles harbord and sidney montagu and there i was stopped and dined mighty nobly at a good table with one little dish at a time upon it but mighty merry i was glad to see it but sorry methought to see my lord have so little reason to be merry and yet glad for his sake to have him cheerful after dinner up and looked up and down the house and so to the cellar and thence i slipt away without taking leave and so to a few places about business and among others to my booksellers in duck lane and so home where the house still full of dirt by painters and others and will not be clean a good while so to read and talk with my wife till by and by called to the office about sir w warrens business where we met a little and then home to supper and to bed this day i went by mr povys direction to a coachmaker near him for a coach just like his but it was sold this very morning rd up and all the morning at the office at noon to dinner and then to the office and there busy till at night without much pain to my eyes but i did not use them to read or write and so did hold out very well so home and there to supper and i observed my wife to eye my eyes whether i did ever look upon deb which i could not but do now and then and to my grief did see the poor wretch look on me and see me look on her and then let drop a tear or two which do make my heart relent at this minute that i am writing this with great trouble of mind for she is indeed my sacrifice poor girle and my wife did tell me in bed by the by of my looking on other people and that the only way is to put things out of sight and this i know she means by deb for she tells me that her aunt was here on monday and she did tell her of her desire of parting with deb but in such kind terms on both sides that my wife is mightily taken with her i see it will be and it is but necessary and therefore though it cannot but grieve me yet i must bring my mind to give way to it we had a great deal of do this day at the office about clutterbucke see note to february th i declaring my dissent against the whole boards proceedings and i believe i shall go near to shew w pen a very knave in it whatever i find my lord brouncker th up and by coach to white hall and there i find the king and duke of york come the last night and every bodys mouth full of my lord angleseys suspension being sealed which it was it seems yesterday so that he is prevented in his remedy at the council and it seems the two new treasurers did kiss the kings hand this morning brought in by my lord arlington they walked up and down together the court this day and several people joyed them but i avoided it that i might not be seen to look either way this day also i hear that my lord ormond is to be declared in council no more deputy governor of ireland his commission being expired and the king is prevailed with to take it out of his hands which people do mightily admire saying that he is the greatest subject of any prince in christendome and hath more acres of land than any and hath done more for his prince than ever any yet did but all will not do he must down it seems the duke of buckingham carrying all before him but that that troubles me most is that they begin to talk that the duke of yorks regiment is ordered to be disbanded and more that undoubtedly his admiralty will follow which do shake me mightily and i fear will have ill consequences in the nation for these counsels are very mad the duke of york do by all mens report carry himself wonderfull submissive to the king in the most humble manner in the world but yet it seems nothing must be spared that tends to the keeping out of the chancellor and that is the reason of all this the great discourse now is that the parliament shall be dissolved and another called which shall give the king the deane and chapter lands and that will put him out of debt and it is said that buckingham do knownly meet daily with wildman and other commonwealthmen and that when he is with them he makes the king believe that he is with his wenches and something looks like the parliaments being dissolved by harry brounckers being now come back and appears this day the first day at white hall but hath not been yet with the king but is secure that he shall be well received i hear god bless us when such men as he shall be restored but that that pleases me most is that several do tell me that pen is to be removed and others that he hath resigned his place and particularly spragg tells me for certain that he hath resigned it and is become a partner with gawden in the victualling in which i think he hath done a very cunning thing but i am sure i am glad of it and it will be well for the king to have him out of this office thence by coach doing several errands home and there to dinner and then to the office where all the afternoon till late at night and so home deb hath been abroad today with her friends poor girle i believe toward the getting of a place this day a boy is sent me out of the country from impington by my cozen roger pepys getting whom i visited this morning at his chamber in the strand and carried him to westminster hall where i took a turn or two with him and sir john talbot who talks mighty high for my lord of ormond and i perceive this family of the talbots hath been raised by my lord when i come home tonight i find deb not come home and do doubt whether she be not quite gone or no but my wife is silent to me in it and i to her but fell to other discourse and indeed am well satisfied that my house will never be at peace between my wife and i unless i let her go though it grieves me to the heart my wife and i spent much time this evening talking of our being put out of the office and my going to live at deptford at her brothers till i can clear my accounts and rid my hands of the town which will take me a year or more and i do think it will be best for me to do so in order to our living cheap and out of sight th up and willet come home in the morning and god forgive me i could not conceal my content thereat by smiling and my wife observed it but i said nothing nor she but away to the office presently up by water to white hall and there all of us to wait on the duke of york which we did having little to do and then i up and down the house till by and by the duke of york who had bid me stay did come to his closet again and there did call in me and mr wren and there my paper that i have lately taken pains to draw up was read and the duke of york pleased therewith and we did all along conclude upon answers to my mind for the board and that that if put in execution will do the kings business but i do now more and more perceive the duke of yorks trouble and that he do lie under great weight of mind from the duke of buckinghams carrying things against him and particularly when i advised that he would use his interest that a seaman might come into the room of w pen who is now declared to be gone from us to that of the victualling and did shew how the office would now be left without one seaman in it but the surveyour and the controller who is so old as to be able to do nothing he told me plainly that i knew his mind well enough as to seamen but that it must be as others will and wren did tell it me as a secret that when the duke of york did first tell the king about sir w pens leaving of the place and that when the duke of york did move the king that either captain cox or sir jer smith might succeed him the king did tell him that that was a matter fit to be considered of and would not agree to either presently and so the duke of york could not prevail for either nor knows who it shall be the duke of york did tell me himself that if he had not carried it privately when first he mentioned pens leaving his place to the king it had not been done for the duke of buckingham and those of his party do cry out upon it as a strange thing to trust such a thing into the hands of one that stands accused in parliament and that they have so far prevailed upon the king that he would not have him named in council but only take his name to the board but i think he said that only d gawdens name shall go in the patent at least at the time when sir richard browne asked the king the names of d gawdens security the king told him it was not yet necessary for him to declare them and by and by when the duke of york and we had done and wren brought into the closet captain cox and james temple about business of the guiney company and talking something of the duke of buckinghams concernment therein and says the duke of york i will give the devil his due as they say the duke of buckingham hath paid in his money to the company or something of that kind wherein he would do right to him the duke of york told me how these people do begin to cast dirt upon the business that passed the council lately touching supernumeraries as passed by virtue of his authority there there being not liberty for any man to withstand what the duke of york advises there which he told me they bring only as an argument to insinuate the putting of the admiralty into commission which by all mens discourse is now designed and i perceive the same by him this being done and going from him i up and down the house to hear news and there every bodys mouth full of changes and among others the duke of yorks regiment of guards that was raised during the late war at sea is to be disbanded and also that this day the king do intend to declare that the duke of ormond is no more deputy of ireland but that he will put it into commission this day our new treasurers did kiss the kings hand who complimented them as they say very highly that he had for a long time been abused in his treasurer and that he was now safe in their hands i saw them walk up and down the court together all this morning the first time i ever saw osborne who is a comely gentleman this day i was told that my lord anglesey did deliver a petition on wednesday in council to the king laying open that whereas he had heard that his majesty had made such a disposal of his place which he had formerly granted him for life upon a valuable consideration and that without any thing laid to his charge and during a parliaments sessions he prayed that his majesty would be pleased to let his case be heard before the council and the judges of the land who were his proper counsel in all matters of right to which i am told the king after my lords being withdrawn concluded upon his giving him an answer some few days hence and so he was called in and told so and so it ended having heard all this i took coach and to mr povys where i hear he is gone to the swedes resident in covent garden where he is to dine i went thither but he is not come yet so i to white hall to look for him and up and down walking there i met with sir robert holmes who asking news i told him of sir w pens going from us who ketched at it so as that my heart misgives me that he will have a mind to it which made me heartily sorry for my words but he invited me and would have me go to dine with him at the treasurers sir thomas clifford where i did go and eat some oysters which while we were at in comes my lord keeper and much company and so i thought it best to withdraw and so away and to the swedes agents and there met mr povy where the agent would have me stay and dine there being only them and joseph williamson and sir thomas clayton but what he is i know not here much extraordinary noble discourse of foreign princes and particularly the greatness of the king of france and of his being fallen into the right way of making the kingdom great which none of his ancestors ever did before i was mightily pleased with this company and their discourse so as to have been seldom so much in all my life and so after dinner up into his upper room and there did see a piece of perspective but much inferior to mr povys thence with mr povy spent all the afternoon going up and down among the coachmakers in cow lane and did see several and at last did pitch upon a little chariott whose body was framed but not covered at the widows that made mr lowthers fine coach and we are mightily pleased with it it being light and will be very genteel and sober to be covered with leather and yet will hold four being much satisfied with this i carried him to white hall and so by coach home where give my wife a good account of my days work and so to the office and there late and so to bed th up and presently my wife up with me which she professedly now do every day to dress me that i may not see willet and do eye me whether i cast my eye upon her or no and do keep me from going into the room where she is among the upholsters at work in our blue chamber so abroad to white hall by water and so on for all this day as i have by mistake set down in the fifth day after this mark in the margin here is the following look back one leaf for my mistake in the room of which i should have said that i was at the office all the morning and so to dinner my wife with me but so as i durst not look upon the girle though god knows notwithstanding all my protestations i could not keep my mind from desiring it after dinner to the office again and there did some business and then by coach to see roger pepys at his lodgings next door to arundell house a barbers and there i did see a book which my lord sandwich hath promised one to me of a description of the escuriall in spain which i have a great desire to have though i took it for a finer book when he promised it me with him to see my cozen turner and the and there sat and talked they being newly come out of the country and here pretty merry and with the to shew her a coach at mr povys mans she being in want of one and so back again with her and then home by coach with my mind troubled and finding no content my wife being still troubled nor can be at peace while the girle is there which i am troubled at on the other side we past the evening together and then to bed and slept ill she being troubled and troubling me in the night with talk and complaints upon the old business this is the days work of the th though it stands under the th my mind being now so troubled that it is no wonder that i fall into this mistake more than ever i did in my life before th up and at the office all the morning and so to it again after dinner and there busy late choosing to employ myself rather than go home to trouble with my wife whom however i am forced to comply with and indeed i do pity her as having cause enough for her grief so to bed and there slept ill because of my wife this afternoon i did go out towards sir d gawdens thinking to have bespoke a place for my coach and horses when i have them at the victualling office but find the way so bad and long that i returned and looked up and down for places elsewhere in an inne which i hope to get with more convenience than there th lords day up and at my chamber all the morning setting papers to rights with my boy and so to dinner at noon the girle with us but my wife troubled thereat to see her and do tell me so which troubles me for i love the girle at my chamber again to work all the afternoon till night when pelling comes who wonders to find my wife so dull and melancholy but god knows she hath too much cause however as pleasant as we can we supped together and so made the boy read to me the poor girle not appearing at supper but hid herself in her chamber so that i could wish in that respect that she was out of the house for our peace is broke to all of us while she is here and so to bed where my wife mighty unquiet all night so as my bed is become burdensome to me th up and i did by a little note which i flung to deb advise her that i did continue to deny that ever i kissed her and so she might govern herself the truth is that i did adventure upon gods pardoning me this lie knowing how heavy a thing it would be for me to the ruin of the poor girle and next knowing that if my wife should know all it were impossible ever for her to be at peace with me again and so our whole lives would be uncomfortable the girl read and as i bid her returned me the note flinging it to me in passing by and so i abroad by coach to white hall and there to the duke of york to wait on him who told me that sir w pen had been with him this morning to ask whether it would be fit for him to sit at the office now because of his resolution to be gone and to become concerned in the victualling the duke of york answered yes till his contract was signed thence i to lord sandwichs and there to see him but was made to stay so long as his best friends are and when i come to him so little pleasure his head being full of his own business i think that i have no pleasure to go to him thence to white hall with him to the committee of tangier a day appointed for him to give an account of tangier and what he did and found there which though he had admirable matter for it and his doings there were good and would have afforded a noble account yet he did it with a mind so low and mean and delivered in so poor a manner that it appeared nothing at all nor any body seemed to value it whereas he might have shewn himself to have merited extraordinary thanks and been held to have done a very great service whereas now all that cost the king hath been at for his journey through spain thither seems to be almost lost after we were up creed and i walked together and did talk a good while of the weak report my lord made and were troubled for it i fearing that either his mind and judgment are depressed or that he do it out of his great neglect and so my fear that he do all the rest of his affairs accordingly so i staid about the court a little while and then to look for a dinner and had it at herculespillars very late all alone costing me d and so to the excise office thinking to meet sir stephen fox and the cofferer but the former was gone and the latter i met going out but nothing done and so i to my booksellers and also to crows and there saw a piece of my bed and i find it will please us mightily so home and there find my wife troubled and i sat with her talking and so to bed and there very unquiet all night th up and my wife still every day as ill as she is all night will rise to see me out doors telling me plainly that she dares not let me see the girle and so i out to the office where all the morning and so home to dinner where i found my wife mightily troubled again more than ever and she tells me that it is from her examining the girle and getting a confession now from her of all which do mightily trouble me as not being able to foresee the consequences of it as to our future peace together so my wife would not go down to dinner but i would dine in her chamber with her and there after mollifying her as much as i could we were pretty quiet and eat and by and by comes mr hollier and dines there by himself after we had dined and he being gone we to talk again and she to be troubled reproaching me with my unkindness and perjury i having denied my ever kissing her as also with all her old kindnesses to me and my illusing of her from the beginning and the many temptations she hath refused out of faithfulness to me whereof several she was particular in and especially from my lord sandwich by the sollicitation of captain ferrers and then afterward the courtship of my lord hinchingbrooke even to the trouble of his lady all which i did acknowledge and was troubled for and wept and at last pretty good friends again and so i to my office and there late and so home to supper with her and so to bed where after halfanhours slumber she wakes me and cries out that she should never sleep more and so kept raving till past midnight that made me cry and weep heartily all the while for her and troubled for what she reproached me with as before and at last with new vows and particularly that i would myself bid the girle be gone and shew my dislike to her which i will endeavour to perform but with much trouble and so this appeasing her we to sleep as well as we could till morning th up and my wife with me as before and so to the office where by a speciall desire the new treasurers come and there did shew their patent and the great seal for the suspension of my lord anglesey and here did sit and discourse of the business of the office and brought mr hutchinson with them who i hear is to be their paymaster in the room of mr waith for it seems they do turn out every servant that belongs to the present treasurer and so for fenn do bring in mr littleton sir thomass brother and oust all the rest but mr hutchinson do already see that his work now will be another kind of thing than before as to the trouble of it they gone and indeed they appear both of them very intelligent men i home to dinner and there with my people dined and so to my wife who would not dine with me that she might not have the girle come in sight and there sat and talked a while with her and pretty quiet i giving no occasion of offence and so to the office and then by coach to my cozen roger pepys who did at my last being with him this day sennight move me as to the supplying him with l this term and l the next for two years upon a mortgage he having that sum to pay a debt left him by his father which i did agree to trusting to his honesty and ability and am resolved to do it for him that i may not have all i have lie in the kings hands having promised him this i returned home again where to the office and there having done i home and to supper and to bed where after lying a little while my wife starts up and with expressions of affright and madness as one frantick would rise and i would not let her but burst out in tears myself and so continued almost half the night the moon shining so that it was light and after much sorrow and reproaches and little ravings though i am apt to think they were counterfeit from her and my promise again to discharge the girle myself all was quiet again and so to sleep th up and she with me as heretofore and so i to the office where all the morning and at noon to dinner and mr wayth who being at my office about business i took him with me to talk and understand his matters who is in mighty trouble from the committee of accounts about his contracting with this office for saylecloth but no hurt can be laid at his door in it but upon us for doing it if any though we did it by the duke of yorks approval and by him i understand that the new treasurers do intend to bring in all new instruments and so having dined we parted and i to my wife and to sit with her a little and then called her and willet to my chamber and there did with tears in my eyes which i could not help discharge her and advise her to be gone as soon as she could and never to see me or let me see her more while she was in the house which she took with tears too but i believe understands me to be her friend and i am apt to believe by what my wife hath of late told me is a cunning girle if not a slut thence parting kindly with my wife i away by coach to my cozen roger according as by mistake which the trouble of my mind for some days has occasioned in this and another case a day or two before is set down in yesterdays notes and so back again and with mr gibson late at my chamber making an end of my draught of a letter for the duke of york in answer to the answers of this office which i have now done to my mind so as if the duke likes it will i think put an end to a great deal of the faults of this office as well as my trouble for them so to bed and did lie now a little better than formerly but with little and yet with some trouble th up and with sir w pen by coach to white hall where to the duke of york and there did our usual business and thence i to the commissioners of the treasury where i staid and heard an excellent case argued between my lord gerard and the town of newcastle about a piece of ground which that lord hath got a grant of under the exchequer seal which they were endeavouring to get of the king under the great seal i liked mightily the counsel for the town shaftow their recorder and mr offly but i was troubled and so were the lords to hear my lord fly out against their great pretence of merit from the king for their sufferings and loyalty telling them that they might thank him for that repute which they have for their loyalty for that it was he that forced them to be so against their wills when he was there and moreover did offer a paper to the lords to read from the town sent in but the lords would not read it but i believe it was something about bringing the king to trial or some such thing in that year thence i to the three tuns tavern by charing cross and there dined with w pen sir j minnes and commissioner middleton and as merry as my mind could be that hath so much trouble upon it at home and thence to white hall and there staid in mr wrens chamber with him reading over my draught of a letter which mr gibson then attended me with and there he did like all but doubted whether it would be necessary for the duke to write in so sharp a style to the office as i had drawn it in which i yield to him to consider the present posture of the times and the duke of york and whether it were not better to err on that hand than the other he told me that he did not think it was necessary for the duke of york to do so and that it would not suit so well with his nature nor greatness which last perhaps is true but then do too truly shew the effects of having princes in places where order and discipline should be i left it to him to do as the duke of york pleases and so fell to other talk and with great freedom of public things and he told me upon my several inquiries to that purpose that he did believe it was not yet resolved whether the parliament should ever meet more or no the three great rulers of things now standing thus the duke of buckingham is absolutely against their meeting as moved thereto by his people that he advises with the people of the late times who do never expect to have any thing done by this parliament for their religion and who do propose that by the sale of the churchlands they shall be able to put the king out of debt my lord keeper is utterly against putting away this and choosing another parliament lest they prove worse than this and will make all the kings friends and the king himself in a desperate condition my lord arlington know not which is best for him being to seek whether this or the next will use him worst he tells me that he believes that it is intended to call this parliament and try them with a sum of money and if they do not like it then to send them going and call another who will at the ruin of the church perhaps please the king with what he will for a time and he tells me therefore that he do believe that this policy will be endeavoured by the church and their friends to seem to promise the king money when it shall be propounded but make the king and these great men buy it dear before they have it he tells me that he is really persuaded that the design of the duke of buckingham is by bringing the state into such a condition as if the king do die without issue it shall upon his death break into pieces again and so put by the duke of york who they have disobliged they know to that degree as to despair of his pardon he tells me that there is no way to rule the king but by brisknesse which the duke of buckingham hath above all men and that the duke of york having it not his best way is what he practices that is to say a good temper which will support him till the duke of buckingham and lord arlington fall out which cannot be long first the former knowing that the latter did in the time of the chancellor endeavour with the chancellor to hang him at that time when he was proclaimed against and here by the by he told me that the duke of buckingham did by his friends treat with my lord chancellor by the mediation of matt wren and matt clifford to fall in with my lord chancellor which he tells me he did advise my lord chancellor to accept of as that that with his own interest and the duke of yorks would undoubtedly have assured all to him and his family but that my lord chancellor was a man not to be advised thinking himself too high to be counselled and so all is come to nothing for by that means the duke of buckingham became desperate and was forced to fall in with arlington to his the chancellors ruin thence i home and there to talk with great pleasure all the evening with my wife who tells me that deb has been abroad today and is come home and says she has got a place to go to so as she will be gone tomorrow morning this troubled me and the truth is i have a good mind to have the maidenhead of this girl which i should not doubt to have if je could get time para be con her but she will be gone and i not know whither before we went to bed my wife told me she would not have me to see her or give her her wages and so i did give my wife l for her year and half a quarters wages which she went into her chamber and paid her and so to bed and there blessed be god we did sleep well and with peace which i had not done in now almost twenty nights together this afternoon i went to my coachmaker and crows and there saw things go on to my great content this morning at the treasurychamber i did meet jack fenn and there he did shew me my lord angleseys petition and the kings answer the former good and stout as i before did hear it but the latter short and weak saying that he was not by what the king had done hindered from taking the benefit of his laws and that the reason he had to suspect his mismanagement of his money in ireland did make him think it unfit to trust him with his treasury in england till he was satisfied in the former th up and had a mighty mind to have seen or given her a little money to which purpose i wrapt up s in paper thinking to have given her a little money but my wife rose presently and would not let me be out of her sight and went down before me into the kitchen and come up and told me that she was in the kitchen and therefore would have me go round the other way which she repeating and i vexed at it answered her a little angrily upon which she instantly flew out into a rage calling me dog and rogue and that i had a rotten heart all which knowing that i deserved it i bore with and word being brought presently up that she was gone away by coach with her things my wife was friends and so all quiet and i to the office with my heart sad and find that i cannot forget the girl and vexed i know not where to look for her and more troubled to see how my wife is by this means likely for ever to have her hand over me that i shall for ever be a slave to her that is to say only in matters of pleasure but in other things she will make it her business i know to please me and to keep me right to her which i will labour to be indeed for she deserves it of me though it will be i fear a little time before i shall be able to wear deb out of my mind at the office all the morning and merry at noon at dinner and after dinner to the office where all the afternoon doing much business late my mind being free of all troubles i thank god but only for my thoughts of this girl which hang after her and so at night home to supper and then did sleep with great content with my wife i must here remember that i have lain with my moher as a husband more times since this falling out than in i believe twelve months before and with more pleasure to her than i think in all the time of our marriage before th lords day up and after long lying with pleasure talking with my wife and then up to look up and down our house which will when our upholster hath done be mighty fine and so to my chamber and there did do several things among my papers and so to the office to write down my journal for or days my mind having been so troubled as never to get the time to do it before as may appear a little by the mistakes i have made in this book within these few days at noon comes mr shepley to dine with me and w howe and there dined and pretty merry and so after dinner w howe to tell me what hath happened between him and the commissioners of late who are hot again more than ever about my lord sandwichs business of prizes which i am troubled for and the more because of the great security and neglect with which i think my lord do look upon this matter that may yet for aught i know undo him they gone and balty being come from the downs not very well is come this day to see us i to talk with him and with some pleasure hoping that he will make a good man i in the evening to my office again to make an end of my journall and so home to my chamber with w hewer to settle some papers and so to supper and to bed with my mind pretty quiet and less troubled about deb than i was though yet i am troubled i must confess and would be glad to find her out though i fear it would be my ruin this evening there come to sit with us mr pelling who wondered to see my wife and i so dumpish but yet it went off only as my wifes not being well and poor wretch she hath no cause to be well god knows th up and by water to white hall and there at the robe chamber at a committee for tangier where some of us my lord sandwich sir w coventry and myself with another or two met to debate the business of the mole and there drew up reasons for the kings taking of it into his own hands and managing of it upon accounts with sir h cholmley this being done i away to holborne about whetstones park where i never was in my life before where i understand by my wifes discourse that deb is gone which do trouble me mightily that the poor girle should be in a desperate condition forced to go thereabouts and there not hearing of any such man as allbon with whom my wife said she now was i to the strand and there by sending drumblebys boy my flageolet maker to eagle court where my wife also by discourse lately let fall that he did lately live i find that this dr allbon is a kind of poor broken fellow that dare not shew his head nor be known where he is gone but to lincolns inn fields i went to mr povys but missed him and so hearing only that this allbon is gone to fleet street i did only call at martins my booksellers and there bought cassandra and some other french books for my wifes closet and so home having eat nothing but two pennyworths of oysters opened for me by a woman in the strand while the boy went to and again to inform me about this man and therefore home and to dinner and so all the afternoon at the office and there late busy and so home to supper and pretty pleasant with my wife to bed rested pretty well th up and to the office all the morning where the new treasurers come their second time and before they sat down did discourse with the board and particularly my lord brouncker about their place which they challenge as having been heretofore due and given to their predecessor which at last my lord did own hath been given him only out of courtesy to his quality and that he did not take it as a right at the board so they for the present sat down and did give him the place but i think with an intent to have the duke of yorks directions about it my wife and maids busy now to make clean the house above stairs the upholsters having done there in her closet and the blue room and they are mighty pretty at my office all the afternoon and at night busy and so home to my wife and pretty pleasant and at mighty ease in my mind being in hopes to find deb and without trouble or the knowledge of my wife so to supper at night and to bed th lay long in bed talking with my wife she being unwilling to have me go abroad saying and declaring herself jealous of my going out for fear of my going to deb which i do deny for which god forgive me for i was no sooner out about noon but i did go by coach directly to somerset house and there enquired among the porters there for dr allbun and the first i spoke with told me he knew him and that he was newly gone into lincolns inn fields but whither he could not tell me but that one of his fellows not then in the way did carry a chest of drawers thither with him and that when he comes he would ask him this put me into some hopes and i to white hall and thence to mr povys but he at dinner and therefore i away and walked up and down the strand between the two turnstiles hoping to see her out of a window and then employed a porter one osberton to find out this doctors lodgings thereabouts who by appointment comes to me to hercules pillars where i dined alone but tells me that he cannot find out any such but will enquire further thence back to white hall to the treasury a while and thence to the strand and towards night did meet with the porter that carried the chest of drawers with this doctor but he would not tell me where he lived being his good master he told me but if i would have a message to him he would deliver it at last i told him my business was not with him but a little gentlewoman one mrs willet that is with him and sent him to see how she did from her friend in london and no other token he goes while i walk in somerset house walk there in the court at last he comes back and tells me she is well and that i may see her if i will but no more so i could not be commanded by my reason but i must go this very night and so by coach it being now dark i to her close by my tailors and she come into the coach to me and je did baiser her i did nevertheless give her the best council i could to have a care of her honour and to fear god and suffer no man para avoir to do con her as je have done which she promised je did give her s and directions para laisser sealed in paper at any time the name of the place of her being at herringmans my bookseller in the change by which i might go para her and so bid her good night with much content to my mind and resolution to look after her no more till i heard from her and so home and there told my wife a fair tale god knows how i spent the whole day with which the poor wretch was satisfied or at least seemed so and so to supper and to bed she having been mighty busy all day in getting of her house in order against tomorrow to hang up our new hangings and furnishing our best chamber th up and at the office all the morning with my heart full of joy to think in what a safe condition all my matters now stand between my wife and deb and me and at noon running up stairs to see the upholsters who are at work upon hanging my best room and setting up my new bed i find my wife sitting sad in the dining room which enquiring into the reason of she begun to call me all the false rottenhearted rogues in the world letting me understand that i was with deb yesterday which thinking it impossible for her ever to understand i did a while deny but at last did for the ease of my mind and hers and for ever to discharge my heart of this wicked business i did confess all and above stairs in our bed chamber there i did endure the sorrow of her threats and vows and curses all the afternoon and what was worse she swore by all that was good that she would slit the nose of this girle and be gone herself this very night from me and did there demand or l of me to buy my peace that she might be gone without making any noise or else protested that she would make all the world know of it so with most perfect confusion of face and heart and sorrow and shame in the greatest agony in the world i did pass this afternoon fearing that it will never have an end but at last i did call for w hewer who i was forced to make privy now to all and the poor fellow did cry like a child and obtained what i could not that she would be pacified upon condition that i would give it under my hand never to see or speak with deb while i live as i did before with pierce and knepp and which i did also god knows promise for deb too but i have the confidence to deny it to the perjury of myself so before it was late there was beyond my hopes as well as desert a durable peace and so to supper and pretty kind words and to bed and there je did hazer con eile to her content and so with some rest spent the night in bed being most absolutely resolved if ever i can master this bout never to give her occasion while i live of more trouble of this or any other kind there being no curse in the world so great as this of the differences between myself and her and therefore i do by the grace of god promise never to offend her more and did this night begin to pray to god upon my knees alone in my chamber which god knows i cannot yet do heartily but i hope god will give me the grace more and more every day to fear him and to be true to my poor wife this night the upholsters did finish the hanging of my best chamber but my sorrow and trouble is so great about this business that it puts me out of all joy in looking upon it or minding how it was th this morning up with mighty kind words between my poor wife and i and so to white hall by water w hewer with me who is to go with me every where until my wife be in condition to go out along with me herself for she do plainly declare that she dares not trust me out alone and therefore made it a piece of our league that i should alway take somebody with me or her herself which i am mighty willing to being by the grace of god resolved never to do her wrong more we landed at the temple and there i bid him call at my cozen roger pepyss lodgings and i staid in the street for him and so took water again at the strand stairs and so to white hall in my way i telling him plainly and truly my resolutions if i can get over this evil never to give new occasion for it he is i think so honest and true a servant to us both and one that loves us that i was not much troubled at his being privy to all this but rejoiced in my heart that i had him to assist in the making us friends which he did truly and heartily and with good success for i did get him to go to deb to tell her that i had told my wife all of my being with her the other night that so if my wife should send she might not make the business worse by denying it while i was at white hall with the duke of york doing our ordinary business with him here being also the first time the new treasurers w hewer did go to her and come back again and so i took him into st jamess park and there he did tell me he had been with her and found what i said about my manner of being with her true and had given her advice as i desired i did there enter into more talk about my wife and myself and he did give me great assurance of several particular cases to which my wife had from time to time made him privy of her loyalty and truth to me after many and great temptations and i believe them truly i did also discourse the unfitness of my leaving of my employment now in many respects to go into the country as my wife desires but that i would labour to fit myself for it which he thoroughly understands and do agree with me in it and so hoping to get over this trouble we about our business to westminster hall to meet roger pepys which i did and did there discourse of the business of lending him l to answer some occasions of his which i believe to be safe enough and so took leave of him and away by coach home calling on my coachmaker by the way where i like my little coach mightily but when i come home hoping for a further degree of peace and quiet i find my wife upon her bed in a horrible rage afresh calling me all the bitter names and rising did fall to revile me in the bitterest manner in the world and could not refrain to strike me and pull my hair which i resolved to bear with and had good reason to bear it so i by silence and weeping did prevail with her a little to be quiet and she would not eat her dinner without me but yet by and by into a raging fit she fell again worse than before that she would slit the girls nose and at last w hewer come in and come up who did allay her fury i flinging myself in a sad desperate condition upon the bed in the blue room and there lay while they spoke together and at last it come to this that if i would call deb whore under my hand and write to her that i hated her and would never see her more she would believe me and trust in me which i did agree to only as to the name of whore i would have excused and therefore wrote to her sparing that word which my wife thereupon tore it and would not be satisfied till w hewer winking upon me i did write so with the name of a whore as that i did fear she might too probably have been prevailed upon to have been a whore by her carriage to me and therefore as such i did resolve never to see her more this pleased my wife and she gives it w hewer to carry to her with a sharp message from her so from that minute my wife begun to be kind to me and we to kiss and be friends and so continued all the evening and fell to talk of other matters with great comfort and after supper to bed this evening comes mr billup to me to read over mr wrens alterations of my draught of a letter for the duke of york to sign to the board which i like mighty well they being not considerable only in mollifying some hard terms which i had thought fit to put in from this to other discourse and do find that the duke of york and his master mr wren do look upon this service of mine as a very seasonable service to the duke of york as that which he will have to shew to his enemies in his own justification of his care of the kings business and i am sure i am heartily glad of it both for the kings sake and the duke of yorks and my own also for if i continue my work by this means will be the less and my share in the blame also he being gone i to my wife again and so spent the evening with very great joy and the night also with good sleep and rest my wife only troubled in her rest but less than usual for which the god of heaven be praised i did this night promise to my wife never to go to bed without calling upon god upon my knees by prayer and i begun this night and hope i shall never forget to do the like all my life for i do find that it is much the best for my soul and body to live pleasing to god and my poor wife and will ease me of much care as well as much expense st up with great joy to my wife and me and to the office where w hewer did most honestly bring me back the part of my letter to deb wherein i called her whore assuring me that he did not shew it her and that he did only give her to understand that wherein i did declare my desire never to see her and did give her the best christian counsel he could which was mighty well done of him but by the grace of god though i love the poor girl and wish her well as having gone too far toward the undoing her yet i will never enquire after or think of her more my peace being certainly to do right to my wife at the office all the morning and after dinner abroad with w hewer to my lord ashlys where my lord barkeley and sir thomas ingram met upon mr povys account where i was in great pain about that part of his account wherein i am concerned above l i think and creed hath declared himself dissatisfied with it so far as to desire to cut his examinatur out of the paper as the only condition in which he would be silent in it this povy had the wit to yield to and so when it come to be inquired into i did avouch the truth of the account as to that particular of my own knowledge and so it went over as a thing good and just as indeed in the bottom of it it is though in strictness perhaps it would not so well be understood this committee rising i with my mind much satisfied herein away by coach home setting creed into southampton buildings and so home and there ended my letters and then home to my wife where i find my house clean now from top to bottom so as i have not seen it many a day and to the full satisfaction of my mind that i am now at peace as to my poor wife as to the dirtiness of my house and as to seeing an end in a great measure to my present great disbursements upon my house and coach and horses nd lords day my wife and i lay long with mighty content and so rose and she spent the whole day making herself clean after four or five weeks being in continued dirt and i knocking up nails and making little settlements in my house till noon and then eat a bit of meat in the kitchen i all alone and so to the office to set down my journall for some days leaving it imperfect the matter being mighty grievous to me and my mind from the nature of it and so in to solace myself with my wife whom i got to read to me and so w hewer and the boy and so after supper to bed this day my boys livery is come home the first i ever had of greene lined with red and it likes me well enough rd up and called upon by w howe who went with w hewer with me by water to the temple his business was to have my advice about a place he is going to buy the clerk of the patents place which i understand not and so could say little to him but fell to other talk and setting him in at the temple we to white hall and there i to visit lord sandwich who is now so reserved or moped rather i think with his own business that he bids welcome to no man i think to his satisfaction however i bear with it being willing to give him as little trouble as i can and to receive as little from him wishing only that i had my money in my purse that i have lent him but however i shew no discontent at all so to white hall where a committee of tangier expected but none met i met with mr povy who i discoursed with about publick business who tells me that this discourse which i told him of of the duke of monmouth being made prince of wales hath nothing in it though he thinks there are all the endeavours used in the world to overthrow the duke of york he would not have me doubt of my safety in the navy which i am doubtful of from the reports of a general removal but he will endeavour to inform me what he can gather from my lord arlington that he do think that the duke of buckingham hath a mind rather to overthrow all the kingdom and bring in a commonwealth wherein he may think to be gen voice of a servant from without he said that some person apparently in great haste demanded to speak with me in the hall wildly excited with wine the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me i staggered forward at once and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building in this low and small room there hung no lamp and now no light at all was admitted save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semicircular window as i put my foot over the threshold i became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock cut in the novel fashion of the one i myself wore at the moment this the faint light enabled me to perceive but the features of his face i could not distinguish upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me and seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience whispered the words william wilson in my ear i grew perfectly sober in an instant there was that in the manner of the stranger and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger as he held it between my eyes and the light which filled me with unqualified amazement but it was not this which had so violently moved me it was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular low hissing utterance and above all it was the character the tone the key of those few simple and familiar yet whispered syllables which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery ere i could recover the use of my senses he was gone although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination yet was it evanescent as vivid for some weeks indeed i busied myself in earnest inquiry or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation i did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs and harassed me with his insinuated counsel but who and what was this wilson and whence came he and what were his purposes upon neither of these points could i be satisfied merely ascertaining in regard to him that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from dr bransbys academy on the afternoon of the day in which i myself had eloped but in a brief period i ceased to think upon the subject my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for oxford thither i soon went the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in great britain excited by such appliances to vice my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor and i spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels but it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance let it suffice that among spendthrifts i outheroded herod and that giving name to a multitude of novel follies i added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of europe it could hardly be credited however that i had even here so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession and having become an adept in his despicable science to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weakminded among my fellowcollegians such nevertheless was the fact and the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved beyond doubt the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed who indeed among my most abandoned associates would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses than have suspected of such courses the gay the frank the generous william wilson the noblest and most commoner at oxford him whose follies said his parasites were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy whose errors but inimitable whim whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance i had been now two years successfully busied in this way when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman glendinning rich said report as herodes atticus his riches too as easily acquired i soon found him of weak intellect and of course marked him as a fitting subject for my skill i frequently engaged him in play and contrived with the gamblers usual art to let him win considerable sums the more effectually to entangle him in my snares at length my schemes being ripe i met him with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive at the chambers of a fellowcommoner mr preston equally intimate with both but who to do him justice entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design to give to this a better colouring i had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself to be brief upon a vile topic none of the low finesse was omitted so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim we had protracted our sitting far into the night and i had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting glendinning as my sole antagonist the game too was my favorite ecarte the rest of the company interested in the extent of our play had abandoned their own cards and were standing around us as spectators the parvenu who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening to drink deeply now shuffled dealt or played with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication i thought might partially but could not altogether account in a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount when having taken a long draught of port he did precisely what i had been coolly anticipating he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes with a wellfeigned show of reluctance and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance did i finally comply the result of course did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt for some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine but now to my astonishment i perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful i say to my astonishment glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy and the sums which he had as yet lost although in themselves vast could not i supposed very seriously annoy much less so violently affect him that he was overcome by the wine just swallowed was the idea which most readily presented itself and rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates than from any less interested motive i was about to insist peremptorily upon a discontinuance of the play when some expressions at my elbow from among the company and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of glendinning gave me to understand that i had effected his total ruin under circumstances which rendering him an object for the pity of all should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend what now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say the pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all and for some moments a profound silence was maintained during which i could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party i will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued the wide heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open to their full extent with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished as if by magic every candle in the room their light in dying enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered about my own height and closely muffled in a cloak the darkness however was now total and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all we heard the voice of the intruder gentlemen he said in a low distinct and nevertobeforgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones gentlemen i make no apology for this behaviour because in thus behaving i am but fulfilling a duty you are beyond doubt uninformed of the true character of the person who has tonight won at ecarte a large sum of money from lord glendinning i will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information please to examine at your leisure the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper while he spoke so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor in ceasing he departed at once and as abruptly as he had entered can i shall i describe my sensations must i say that i felt all the horrors of the damned most assuredly i had little time given for reflection many hands roughly seized me upon the spot and lights were immediately reprocured a search ensued in the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte and in the pockets of my wrapper a number of packs facsimiles of those used at our sittings with the single exception that mine were of the species called technically arrondees the honours being slightly convex at the ends the lower cards slightly convex at the sides in this disposition the dupe who cuts as customary at the length of the pack will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor while the gambler cutting at the breadth will as certainly cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt or the sarcastic composure with which it was received mr wilson said our host stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs mr wilson this is your property the weather was cold and upon quitting my own room i had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper putting it off upon reaching the scene of play i presume it is supererogatory to seek here eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile for any farther evidence of your skill indeed we have had enough you will see the necessity i hope of quitting oxford at all events of quitting instantly my chambers abased humbled to the dust as i then was it is probable that i should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character the cloak which i had worn was of a rare description of fur how rare how extravagantly costly i shall not venture to say its fashion too was of my own fantastic invention for i was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry in matters of this frivolous nature when therefore mr preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor and near the folding doors of the apartment it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror that i perceived my own already hanging on my arm where i had no doubt unwittingly placed it and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every in even the minutest possible particular the singular being who had so disastrously exposed me had been muffled i remembered in a cloak and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself retaining some presence of mind i took the one offered me by preston placed it unnoticed over my own left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance and next morning ere dawn of day commenced a hurried journey from oxford to the continent in a perfect agony of horror and of shame i fled in vain my evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation and proved indeed that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun scarcely had i set foot in paris ere i had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this wilson in my concerns years flew while i experienced no relief villain at rome with how untimely yet with how spectral an officiousness stepped he in between me and my ambition at vienna too at berlin and at moscow where in truth had i not bitter cause to curse him within my heart from his inscrutable tyranny did i at length flee panicstricken as from a pestilence and to the very ends of the earth i fled in vain and again and again in secret communion with my own spirit would i demand the questions who is he whence came he and what are his objects but no answer was there found and then i scrutinized with a minute scrutiny the forms and the methods and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision but even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture it was noticeable indeed that in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes or to disturb those actions which if fully carried out might have resulted in bitter mischief poor justification this in truth for an authority so imperiously assumed poor indemnity for natural rights of selfagency so pertinaciously so insultingly denied i had also been forced to notice that my tormentor for a very long period of time while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself had so contrived it in the execution of his varied interference with my will that i saw not at any moment the features of his face be wilson what he might this at least was but the veriest of affectation or of folly could he for an instant have supposed that in my admonisher at eton in the destroyer of my honor at oxford in him who thwarted my ambition at rome my revenge at paris my passionate love at naples or what he falsely termed my avarice in egypt that in this my archenemy and evil genius could fall to recognise the william wilson of my school boy days the namesake the companion the rival the hated and dreaded rival at dr bransbys impossible but let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama thus far i had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination the sentiment of deep awe with which i habitually regarded the elevated character the majestic wisdom the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of wilson added to a feeling of even terror with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me had operated hitherto to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness and to suggest an implicit although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will but of late days i had given myself up entirely to wine and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control i began to murmur to hesitate to resist and was it only fancy which induced me to believe that with the increase of my own firmness that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution be this as it may i now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that i would submit no longer to be enslaved it was at rome during the carnival of that i attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the neapolitan duke di broglio i had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the winetable and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance the difficulty too of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper for i was anxiously seeking let me not say with what unworthy motive the young the gay the beautiful wife of the aged and doting di broglio with a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited and now having caught a glimpse of her person i was hurrying to make my way into her presence at this moment i felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder and that everremembered low damnable whisper within my ear in an absolute phrenzy of wrath i turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me and seized him violently by tile collar he was attired as i had expected in a costume altogether similar to my own wearing a spanish cloak of blue velvet begirt about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier a mask of black silk entirely covered his face scoundrel i said in a voice husky with rage while every syllable i uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury scoundrel impostor accursed villain you shall not you shall not dog me unto death follow me or i stab you where you stand and i broke my way from the ballroom into a small antechamber adjoining dragging him unresistingly with me as i went upon entering i thrust him furiously from me he staggered against the wall while i closed the door with an oath and commanded him to draw he hesitated but for an instant then with a slight sigh drew in silence and put himself upon his defence the contest was brief indeed i was frantic with every species of wild excitement and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude in a few seconds i forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting and thus getting him at mercy plunged my sword with brute ferocity repeatedly through and through his bosom at that instant some person tried the latch of the door i hastened to prevent an intrusion and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist but what human language can adequately portray that astonishment that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view the brief moment in which i averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce apparently a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room a large mirror so at first it seemed to me in my confusion now stood where none had been perceptible before and as i stepped up to it in extremity of terror mine own image but with features all pale and dabbled in blood advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait thus it appeared i say but was not it was my antagonist it was wilson who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution his mask and cloak lay where he had thrown them upon the floor not a thread in all his raiment not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not even in the most absolute identity mine own it was wilson but he spoke no longer in a whisper and i could have fancied that i myself was speaking while he said you have conquered and i yield yet henceforward art thou also dead dead to the world to heaven and to hope in me didst thou exist and in my death see by this image which is thine own how utterly thou hast murdered thyself end of text the telltale heart truenervousvery very dreadfully nervous i had been and am but why will you say that i am mad the disease had sharpened my sensesnot destroyednot dulled them above all was the sense of hearing acute i heard all things in the heaven and in the earth i heard many things in hell how then am i mad hearken and observe how healthilyhow calmly i can tell you the whole story it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain but once conceived it haunted me day and night object there was none passion there was none i loved the old man he had never wronged me he had never given me insult for his gold i had no desire i think it was his eye yes it was this he had the eye of a vulturea pale blue eye with a film over it whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold and so by degreesvery graduallyi made up my mind to take the life of the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever now this is the point you fancy me mad madmen know nothing but you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely i proceededwith what cautionwith what foresightwith what dissimulation i went to work i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him and every night about midnight i turned the latch of his door and opened itoh so gently and then when i had made an opening sufficient for my head i put in a dark lantern all closed closed that no light shone out and then i thrust in my head oh you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in i moved it slowlyvery very slowly so that i might not disturb the old mans sleep it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed ha would a madman have been so wise as this and then when my head was well in the room i undid the lantern cautiouslyoh so cautiouslycautiously for the hinges creakedi undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye and this i did for seven long nightsevery night just at midnightbut i found the eye always closed and so it was impossible to do the work for it was not the old man who vexed me but his evil eye and every morning when the day broke i went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name in a hearty tone and inquiring how he has passed the night so you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve i looked in upon him while he slept upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door a watchs minute hand moves more quickly than did mine never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powersof my sagacity i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph to think that there i was opening the door little by little and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts i fairly chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled now you may think that i drew backbut no his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door and i kept pushing it on steadily steadily i had my head in and was about to open the lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening and the old man sprang up in bed crying outwhos there i kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour i did not move a muscle and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down he was still sitting up in the bed listeningjust as i have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall presently i heard a slight groan and i knew it was the groan of mortal terror it was not a groan of pain or of griefoh noit was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe i knew the sound well many a night just at midnight when all the world slept it has welled up from my own bosom deepening with its dreadful echo the terrors that distracted me i say i knew it well i knew what the old man felt and pitied him although i chuckled at heart i knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he had turned in the bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him he had been trying to fancy them causeless but could not he had been saying to himselfit is nothing but the wind in the chimneyit is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp yes he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions but he had found all in vain all in vain because death in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feelalthough he neither saw nor heardto feel the presence of my head within the room when i had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down i resolved to open a littlea very very little crevice in the lantern so i opened ityou cannot imagine how stealthily stealthilyuntil at length a simple dim ray like the thread of the spider shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye it was openwide wide openand i grew furious as i gazed upon it i saw it with perfect distinctnessall a dull blue with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones but i could see nothing else of the old mans face or person for i had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot and have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but overacuteness of the sensenow i say there came to my ears a low dull quick sound such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i knew that sound well too it was the beating of the old mans heart it increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage but even yet i refrained and kept still i scarcely breathed i held the lantern motionless i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray upon the eve meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased it grew quicker and quicker and louder and louder every instant the old mans terror must have been extreme it grew louder i say louder every momentdo you mark me well i have told you that i am nervous so i am and now at the dead hour of the night amid the dreadful silence of that old house so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror yet for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still but the beating grew louder louder i thought the heart must burst and now a new anxiety seized methe sound would be heard by a neighbour the old mans hour had come with a loud yell i threw open the lantern and leaped into the room he shrieked onceonce only in an instant i dragged him to the floor and pulled the heavy bed over him i then smiled gaily to find the deed so far done but for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound this however did not vex me it would not be heard through the wall at length it ceased the old man was dead i removed the bed and examined the corpse yes he was stone stone dead i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes there was no pulsation he was stone dead his eye would trouble me no more if still you think me mad you will think so no longer when i describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the body the night waned and i worked hastily but in silence first of all i dismembered the corpse i cut off the head and the arms and the legs i then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber and deposited all between the scantlings i then replaced the boards so cleverly so cunningly that no human eyenot even hiscould have detected any thing wrong there was nothing to wash outno stain of any kindno bloodspot whatever i had been too wary for that a tub had caught allha ha when i had made an end of these labors it was four oclockstill dark as midnight as the bell sounded the hour there came a knocking at the street door i went down to open it with a light heart for what had i now to fear there entered three men who introduced themselves with perfect suavity as officers of the police a shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night suspicion of foul play had been aroused information had been lodged at the police office and they the officers had been deputed to search the premises i smiled for what had i to fear i bade the gentlemen welcome the shriek i said was my own in a dream the old man i mentioned was absent in the country i took my visitors all over the house i bade them searchsearch well i led them at length to his chamber i showed them his treasures secure undisturbed in the enthusiasm of my confidence i brought chairs into the room and desired them here to rest from their fatigues while i myself in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim the officers were satisfied my manner had convinced them i was singularly at ease they sat and while i answered cheerily they chatted of familiar things but ere long i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone my head ached and i fancied a ringing in my ears but still they sat and still chatted the ringing became more distinctit continued and became more distinct i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling but it continued and gained definitenessuntil at length i found that the noise was not within my ears no doubt i now grew very palebut i talked more fluently and with a heightened voice yet the sound increasedand what could i do it was a low dull quick soundmuch such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i gasped for breathand yet the officers heard it not i talked more quicklymore vehemently but the noise steadily increased i arose and argued about trifles in a high key and with violent gesticulations but the noise steadily increased why would they not be gone i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides as if excited to fury by the observations of the menbut the noise steadily increased oh god what could i do i foamedi ravedi swore i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting and grated it upon the boards but the noise arose over all and continually increased it grew louderlouderlouder and still the men chatted pleasantly and smiled was it possible they heard not almighty godno no they heardthey suspectedthey knewthey were making a mockery of my horrorthis i thought and this i think but anything was better than this agony anything was more tolerable than this derision i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer i felt that i must scream or die and nowagainhark louder louder louder louder villains i shrieked dissemble no more i admit the deedtear up

the sunlight of my reason shall exist in that chamber was i born thus awaking from the long night of what seemed but was not nonentity at once into the very regions of fairy landinto a palace of imaginationinto the wild dominions of monastic thought and eruditionit is not singular that i gazed around me with a startled and ardent eyethat i loitered away my boyhood in books and dissipated my youth in reverie but it is singular that as years rolled away and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathersit is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my lifewonderful how total an inversion took place in the character of my commonest thought the realities of the world affected me as visions and as visions only while the wild ideas of the land of dreams became in turn not the material of my everyday existence but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in itself berenice and i were cousins and we grew up together in my paternal halls yet differently we grewi ill of health and buried in gloomshe agile graceful and overflowing with energy hers the ramble on the hillsidemine the studies of the cloister i living within my own heart and addicted body and soul to the most intense and painful meditationshe roaming carelessly through life with no thought of the shadows in her path or the silent flight of the ravenwinged hours berenicei call upon her namebereniceand from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound ah vividly is her image before me now as in the early days of her lightheartedness and joy oh gorgeous yet fantastic beauty oh sylph amid the shrubberies of arnheim oh naiad among its fountains and thenthen all is mystery and terror and a tale which should not be told diseasea fatal disease fell like the simoon upon her frame and even while i gazed upon her the spirit of change swept over her pervading her mind her habits and her character and in a manner the most subtle and terrible disturbing even the identity of her person alas the destroyer came and wentand the victimwhere is she i knew her notor knew her no longer as berenice among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the moral and physical being of my cousin may be mentioned as the most distressing and obstinate in its nature a species of epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in trance itselftrance very nearly resembling positive dissolution and from which her manner of recovery was in most instances startlingly abrupt in the mean time my own diseasefor i have been told that i should call it by no other appellationmy own disease then grew rapidly upon me and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary formhourly and momently gaining vigorand at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible ascendancy this monomania if i must so term it consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in metaphysical science termed the attentive it is more than probable that i am not understood but i fear indeed that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader an adequate idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which in my case the powers of meditation not to speak technically busied and buried themselves in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe to muse for long unwearied hours with my attention riveted to some frivolous device on the margin or in the typography of a book to become absorbed for the better part of a summers day in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor to lose myself for an entire night in watching the steady flame of a lamp or the embers of a fire to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower to repeat monotonously some common word until the sound by dint of frequent repetition ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind to lose all sense of motion or physical existence by means of absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental faculties not indeed altogether unparalleled but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation yet let me not be misapprehended the undue earnest and morbid attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous must not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common to all mankind and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination it was not even as might be at first supposed an extreme condition or exaggeration of such propensity but primarily and essentially distinct and different in the one instance the dreamer or enthusiast being interested by an object usually not frivolous imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing therefrom until at the conclusion of a day dream often replete with luxury he finds the incitamentum or first cause of his musings entirely vanished and forgotten in my case the primary object was invariably frivolous although assuming through the medium of my distempered vision a refracted and unreal importance few deductions if any were made and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre the meditations were never pleasurable and at the termination of the reverie the first cause so far from being out of sight had attained that supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease in a word the powers of mind more particularly exercised were with me as i have said before the attentive and are with the daydreamer the speculative my books at this epoch if they did not actually serve to irritate the disorder partook it will be perceived largely in their imaginative and inconsequential nature of the characteristic qualities of the disorder itself i well remember among others the treatise of the noble italian coelius secundus curio de amplitudine beati regni dei st austins great work the city of god and tertullians de carne christi in which the paradoxical sentence mortuus est dei filius credible est quia ineptum est et sepultus resurrexit certum est quia impossibile est occupied my undivided time for many weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation thus it will appear that shaken from its balance only by trivial things my reason bore resemblance to that oceancrag spoken of by ptolemy hephestion which steadily resisting the attacks of human violence and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds trembled only to the touch of the flower called asphodel and although to a careless thinker it might appear a matter beyond doubt that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady in the moral condition of berenice would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature i have been at some trouble in explaining yet such was not in any degree the case in the lucid intervals of my infirmity her calamity indeed gave me pain and taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life i did not fall to ponder frequently and bitterly upon the wonderworking means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to pass but these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my disease and were such as would have occurred under similar circumstances to the ordinary mass of mankind true to its own character my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling changes wrought in the physical frame of berenicein the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal identity during the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty most surely i had never loved her in the strange anomaly of my existence feelings with me had never been of the heart and my passions always were of the mind through the gray of the early morningamong the trellised shadows of the forest at noondayand in the silence of my library at nightshe had flitted by my eyes and i had seen hernot as the living and breathing berenice but as the berenice of a dream not as a being of the earth earthy but as the abstraction of such a being not as a thing to admire but to analyze not as an object of love but as the theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation and nownow i shuddered in her presence and grew pale at her approach yet bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition i called to mind that she had loved me long and in an evil moment i spoke to her of marriage and at length the period of our nuptials was approaching when upon an afternoon in the winter of the yearone of those unseasonably warm calm and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful halcyon i sat and sat as i thought alone in the inner apartment of the library but uplifting my eyes i saw that berenice stood before me was it my own excited imaginationor the misty influence of the atmosphereor the uncertain twilight of the chamberor the gray draperies which fell around her figurethat caused in it so vacillating and indistinct an outline i could not tell she spoke no word and inot for worlds could i have uttered a syllable an icy chill ran through my frame a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul and sinking back upon the chair i remained for some time breathless and motionless with my eyes riveted upon her person alas its emaciation was excessive and not one vestige of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour my burning glances at length fell upon the face the forehead was high and very pale and singularly placid and the once jetty hair fell partially over it and overshadowed the hollow temples with innumerable ringlets now of a vivid yellow and jarring discordantly in their fantastic character with the reigning melancholy of the countenance the eyes were lifeless and lustreless and seemingly pupilless and i shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare to he contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips they parted and in a smile of peculiar meaning the teeth of the changed berenice disclosed themselves slowly to my view would to god that i had never beheld them or that having done so i had died the shutting of a door disturbed me and looking up i found that my cousin had departed from the chamber but from the disordered chamber of my brain had not alas departed and would not be driven away the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth not a speck on their surfacenot a shade on their enamelnot an indenture in their edgesbut what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory i saw them now even more unequivocally than i beheld them then the teeththe teeththey were here and there and everywhere and visibly and palpably before me long narrow and excessively white with the pale lips writhing about them as in the very moment of their first terrible development then came the full fury of my monomania and i struggled in vain against its strange and irresistible influence in the multiplied objects of the external world i had no thoughts but for the teeth for these i longed with a phrenzied desire all other matters and all different interests became absorbed in their single contemplation theythey alone were present to the mental eye and they in their sole individuality became the essence of my mental life i held them in every light i turned them in every attitude i surveyed their characteristics i dwelt upon their peculiarities i pondered upon their conformation i mused upon the alteration in their nature i shuddered as i assigned to them in imagination a sensitive and sentient power and even when unassisted by the lips a capability of moral expression of mademoiselle salle it has been well said que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments and of berenice i more seriously believed que toutes ses dents etaient des idees des ideesah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me des ideesah therefore it was that i coveted them so madly i felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace in giving me back to reason and the evening closed in upon me thusand then the darkness came and tarried and wentand the day again dawnedand the mists of a second night were now gathering aroundand still i sat motionless in that solitary roomand still i sat buried in meditationand still the phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy as with the most vivid hideous distinctness it floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the chamber at length there broke in upon my dreams a cry as of horror and dismay and thereunto after a pause succeeded the sound of troubled voices intermingled with many low moanings of sorrow or of pain i arose from my seat and throwing open one of the doors of the library saw standing out in the antechamber a servant maiden all in tears who told me that berenice wasno more she had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning and now at the closing in of the night the grave was ready for its tenant and all the preparations for the burial were completed i found myself sitting in the library and again sitting there alone it seemed that i had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream i knew that it was now midnight and i was well aware that since the setting of the sun berenice had been interred but of that dreary period which intervened i had no positive at least no definite comprehension yet its memory was replete with horrorhorror more horrible from being vague and terror more terrible from ambiguity it was a fearful page in the record my existence written all over with dim and hideous and unintelligible recollections i strived to decypher them but in vain while ever and anon like the spirit of a departed sound the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing in my ears i had done a deedwhat was it i asked myself the question aloud and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered mewhat was it on the table beside me burned a lamp and near it lay a little box it was of no remarkable character and i had seen it frequently before for it was the property of the family physician but how came it there upon my table and why did i shudder in regarding it these things were in no manner to be accounted for and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of a book and to a sentence underscored therein the words were the singular but simple ones of the poet ebn zaiatdicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas why then as i perused them did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins there came a light tap at the library doorand pale as the tenant of a tomb a menial entered upon tiptoe his looks were wild with terror and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous husky and very low what said hesome broken sentences i heard he told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the nightof the gathering together of the householdof a search in the direction of the sound and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated graveof a disfigured body enshrouded yet still breathingstill palpitatingstill alive he pointed to garmentsthey were muddy and clotted with gore i spoke not and he took me gently by the hand it was indented with the impress of human nails he directed my attention to some object against the wall i looked at it for some minutes it was a spade with a shriek i bounded to the table and grasped the box that lay upon it but i could not force it open and in my tremor it slipped from my hands and fell heavily and burst into pieces and from it with a rattling sound there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery intermingled with thirtytwo small white and ivorylooking substances that were scattered to and fro about the floor end of text eleonora sub conservatione formae specificae salva anima raymond lully i am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion men have called me mad but the question is not yet settled whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence whether much that is gloriouswhether all that is profound does not spring from disease of thought from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect they who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night in their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity and thrill in awakening to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret in snatches they learn something of the wisdom which is of good and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil they penetrate however rudderless or compassless into the vast ocean of the light ineffable and again like the adventures of the nubian geographer agressi sunt mare tenebrarum quid in eo esset exploraturi we will say then that i am mad i grant at least that there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence the condition of a lucid reason not to be disputed and belonging to the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life and a condition of shadow and doubt appertaining to the present and to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of my being therefore what i shall tell of the earlier period believe and to what i may relate of the later time give only such credit as may seem due or doubt it altogether or if doubt it ye cannot then play unto its riddle the oedipus she whom i loved in youth and of whom i now pen calmly and distinctly these remembrances was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother long departed eleonora was the name of my cousin we had always dwelled together beneath a tropical sun in the valley of the manycolored grass no unguided footstep ever came upon that vale for it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around about it shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses no path was trodden in its vicinity and to reach our happy home there was need of putting back with force the foliage of many thousands of forest trees and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers thus it was that we lived all alone knowing nothing of the world without the valley i and my cousin and her mother from the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our encircled domain there crept out a narrow and deep river brighter than all save the eyes of eleonora and winding stealthily about in mazy courses it passed away at length through a shadowy gorge among hills still dimmer than those whence it had issued we called it the river of silence for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow no murmur arose from its bed and so gently it wandered along that the pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze far down within its bosom stirred not at all but lay in a motionless content each in its own old station shining on gloriously forever the margin of the river and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided through devious ways into its channel as well as the spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom these spots not less than the whole surface of the valley from the river to the mountains that girdled it in were carpeted all by a soft green grass thick short perfectly even and vanillaperfumed but so besprinkled throughout with the yellow buttercup the white daisy the purple violet and the rubyred asphodel that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones of the love and of the glory of god and here and there in groves about this grass like wildernesses of dreams sprang up fantastic trees whose tall slender stems stood not upright but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noonday into the centre of the valley their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver and was smoother than all save the cheeks of eleonora so that but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long tremulous lines dallying with the zephyrs one might have fancied them giant serpents of syria doing homage to their sovereign the sun hand in hand about this valley for fifteen years roamed i with eleonora before love entered within our hearts it was one evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life and of the fourth of my own that we sat locked in each others embrace beneath the serpentlike trees and looked down within the water of the river of silence at our images therein we spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few we had drawn the god eros from that wave and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers the passions which had for centuries distinguished our race came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally noted and together breathed a delirious bliss over the valley of the manycolored grass a change fell upon all things strange brilliant flowers starshaped burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before the tints of the green carpet deepened and when one by one the white daisies shrank away there sprang up in place of them ten by ten of the rubyred asphodel and life arose in our paths for the tall flamingo hitherto unseen with all gay glowing birds flaunted his scarlet plumage before us the golden and silver fish haunted the river out of the bosom of which issued little by little a murmur that swelled at length into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of aeolussweeter than all save the voice of eleonora and now too a voluminous cloud which we had long watched in the regions of hesper floated out thence all gorgeous in crimson and gold and settling in peace above us sank day by day lower and lower until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains turning all their dimness into magnificence and shutting us up as if forever within a magic prisonhouse of grandeur and of glory the loveliness of eleonora was that of the seraphim but she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers no guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the valley of the manycolored grass and discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place therein at length having spoken one day in tears of the last sad change which must befall humanity she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme interweaving it into all our converse as in the songs of the bard of schiraz the same images are found occurring again and again in every impressive variation of phrase she had seen that the finger of death was upon her bosom that like the ephemeron she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she revealed to me one evening at twilight by the banks of the river of silence she grieved to think that having entombed her in the valley of the manycolored grass i would quit forever its happy recesses transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and everyday world and then and there i threw myself hurriedly at the feet of eleonora and offered up a vow to herself and to heaven that i would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of earth that i would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me and i called the mighty ruler of the universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow and the curse which i invoked of him and of her a saint in helusion should i prove traitorous to that promise involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it here and the bright eyes of eleonora grew brighter at my words and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast and she trembled and very bitterly wept but she made acceptance of the vow for what was she but a child and it made easy to her the bed of her death and she said to me not many days afterward tranquilly dying that because of what i had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when departed and if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night but if this thing were indeed beyond the power of the souls in paradise that she would at least give me frequent indications of her presence sighing upon me in the evening winds or filling the air which i breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels and with these words upon her lips she yielded up her innocent life putting an end to the first epoch of my own thus far i have faithfully said but as i pass the barrier in times path formed by the death of my beloved and proceed with the second era of my existence i feel that a shadow gathers over my brain and i mistrust the perfect sanity of the record but let me on years dragged themselves along heavily and still i dwelled within the valley of the manycolored grass but a second change had come upon all things the starshaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees and appeared no more the tints of the green carpet faded and one by one the rubyred asphodels withered away and there sprang up in place of them ten by ten dark eyelike violets that writhed uneasily and were ever encumbered with dew and life departed from our paths for the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us but flew sadly from the vale into the hills with all the gay glowing birds that had arrived in his company and the golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river never again and the lulling melody that had been softer than the windharp of aeolus and more divine than all save the voice of eleonora it died little by little away in murmurs growing lower and lower until the stream returned at length utterly into the solemnity of its original silence and then lastly the voluminous cloud uprose and abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old fell back into the regions of hesper and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the valley of the manycolored grass yet the promises of eleonora were not forgotten for i heard the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley and at lone hours when my heart beat heavily the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air and once oh but once only i was awakened from a slumber like the slumber of death by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own but the void within my heart refused even thus to be filled i longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing at length the valley pained me through its memories of eleonora and i left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world i found myself within a strange city where all things might have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams i had dreamed so long in the valley of the manycolored grass the pomps and pageantries of a stately court and the mad clangor of arms and the radiant loveliness of women bewildered and intoxicated my brain but as yet my soul had proved true to its vows and the indications of the presence of eleonora were still given me in the silent hours of the night suddenly these manifestations they ceased and the world grew dark before mine eyes and i stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed at the terrible temptations which beset me for there came from some far far distant and unknown land into the gay court of the king i served a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once at whose footstool i bowed down without a struggle in the most ardent in the most abject worship of love what indeed was my passion for the young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor and the delirium and the spiritlifting ecstasy of adoration with which i poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal ermengarde oh bright was the seraph ermengarde and in that knowledge i had room for none other oh divine was the angel ermengarde and as i looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes i thought only of them and of her i wedded nor dreaded the curse i had invoked and its bitterness was not visited upon me and once but once again in the silence of the night there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice saying sleep in peace for the spirit of love reigneth and ruleth and in taking to thy passionate heart her who is ermengarde thou art absolved for reasons which shall be made known to thee in heaven of thy vows unto eleonora
