 raven williams was a small slender woman who moved quickly with a thin underlying nervousness that was unaccountably appealing she was tanned deep gold from the california sun but at twentyfive her skin was as smooth and dewy soft as a childs she pampered it when she remembered and ignored it when she forgot it never seemed to make any difference her long hair was thick and straight and true black she wore it simply parted in the center the ends brushed her hips and it swirled and floated as she walked her face was pixielike with its cheekbones welldefined and the chin slightly pointed her mouth smiled easily but her eyes reflected her emotions they were smoky gray and round whatever raven felt would be reflected there she had an overwhelming need to love and be loved her own need was one of the reasons for her tremendous success the other was her voicethe rich dark velvet voice that had catapulted her to fame raven always felt a little strange in a recording studio insulated sealed off from the rest of the world by the glass and the soundproofing it had been more than six years since she had cut her first record but she was still never completely comfortable in a studio raven was made for the stage for the live audience that pumped the blood and heat into the music she considered the studio too tame too mechanical when she worked in the studio as she did now she thought of it exclusively as a job and she worked hard the recording session was going well raven listened to a playback with a singlemindedness that blocked out her surroundings there was only the music it was good she decided but it could be better shed missed something in the last song left something out without knowing precisely what it was raven was certain she could find it she signaled the engineers to stop the playback marc a sandyhaired man with the solid frame of a lightweight wrestler entered the booth problem he said simply touching her shoulder the last number its a little raven searched for the word empty she decided at length what do you think she respected marc ridgely as a musician and depended on him as a friend he was a man of few words who had a passion for old westerns and jordan almonds he was also one of the finest guitarists in the country marc reached up to stroke his beard a gesture raven had always thought that took the place of several sentences do it again he advised the instrumentals fine she laughed producing a sound as warm and rich as her singing voice cruel but true she murmured slipping the headset back on she went back to the microphone another vocal on love and lose please she instructed the engineers i have it on the best authority that its the singer not the musicians she saw marc grin before she turned to the mike then the music washed over her raven closed her eyes and poured herself into the song it was a slow aching ballad suited to the smoky depths of her voice itthe lyrics were hers ones she had written long before it had only been recently that she had felt strong enough to sing them publicly there was only the music in her head now an arrangement of notes she herself had produced and as she added her voice she knew that what had been missing before had been her emotions she had restricted them on the other recordings afraid to risk them now she let them out her voice flowed with them an ache passed through her a shadow of a pain before her eyes locked on the man now standing in buried for years she sang as though the words full view behind the glass would bring her relief the hurt was there still the blood drained from her face the remnants with her when the song was finished of emotion from the song surged back in full force for a moment there was silence but raven was she nearly swayed from the power of it branleagues p y too dazed to note the admiration of her col don it was a thought to be s oken aloud but on she pulled off the headset suddenly sharply in a whisper it was a dream she thought had finally conscious of its weight run its course then his eyes were on hers and okay marc entered the booth and slipped his raven knew it was real hed come back arm around her he felt her tremble lightly years of performing had taught her to act it was yes raven pressed her fingers to her temple a always an effort for her to slip a mask into place moment and gave a surprised laugh yes of but by the time brand carstairs had come down course i got a bit wrapped up in that one from the booth raven wore a professionally unhe tilted her face to his and in a rare show of troubled face shed deal with the storm inside public affection for a shy man kissed her you later were fantastic brandon its wonderful to see you again she her eyes warmed and the tears that had threatened held out both hands and tilted her face up to his for were banished i needed that t the expected meaningless kiss of strangers who the kiss or the compliment happen to be in the same business both she laughed and tossed her hair behind her composure startled him hed seen her pale her back stars need constant admiration you seen the shock in her eyes now she wore a facade know shed never had before it was slick bright and wheres the star a backup vocalist wanted to practiced brand realized hed been wrong she had know changed raven tried for a haughty look as she glanced raven he kissed her lightly and took both over you she said ominously can be re her hands youre more beautiful than anyone has placed the vocalist grinned in return too used to a right to be there was the lightest touch of ravens lack of pretentions to be intimidated brogue in his speech a mist of ireland over the whod carry you through the session more formal british raven allowed herself a mo raven turned back to marc take that one out meant to look at him really look at him and shoot him she requested mildly then looked q he was tall and now as always seemed a bit too up at the booth thats a wrap she called out thin his hair was as dark as her own but waved where hers was needle straight it was thick and full over his ears and down to the collar of his shirt his face hadnt changed it was still the same face that drove girls and women to scream and swoon at his concerts it was rawboned and tanned more intriguing than handsome as the features were not altogether even there was something of the dreamer there from his mothers irish half perhaps that was what drew women to him though they were just as fascinated by the occasional british reserve and the eyes even now raven felt the pull of his large heavylidded aquamarine eyes they were unsettling eyes for as easygoing a man as brand carstairs the blue and green seemed constantly at odds but it was the charm he wore so easily that tilted the scales raven realized charm and blatant sex appeal were an irresistible combination you havent changed have you brandon the question was quiet the first and only sign of ravens distress funny he smiled not the quick flashing grin he was capable of but a slow considering smile i thought the same of you when i first saw you i dont suppose its true of either of us no god how she wished he would release her hands what brings you to la brandon business love he answered carelessly though his eyes were taking in every inch of her face and of course the chance to see you again of course her voice was coldly polite and the smile never reached her eyes the sarcasm surprised him the raven he remembered hadnt known the meaning of the word she saw his brow lift into consideration i do want to see you raven brand told her with his sudden disarming sincerity very much can we have dinner her pulse had accelerated at his change of tone just reflex just an old habit she told herself and struggled to keep her hands passive in his im sorry brandon she answered with perfect calm im booked her eyes slipped past him in search of marc whose head was bent over his guitar as he jammed with another musician raven could have sworn with frustration brand followed the direction of her gaze briefly his eyes narrowed tomorrow then he said his tone was still light and casual i want to talk to you he smiled as to an old friend ill just drop by the house awhile brandon raven began and tugged on her hands you still have julie dont you brand smiled and held onto her hands unaware of or ignoring her resistance yes i id like to see her again ill come by around four i know the way he grinned then kissed her again a quick friendly brushing of lips before he released her hands turned and walked away yes she murmured to herself you know the way an hour later raven drove through the electric gates that led to her house the one thing she hadntallowed julie or her agent to thrust on her was a chauffeur raven enjoyed driving having control of the low sleek foreign car and indulging from time to time in an excess of speed she claimed it cleared her head it obviously hadnt done the job she thought as she pulled up in front of the house with a short peevish squeal of the brakes distracted she left her purse sitting on the seat beside her as she sprang from the car and jogged up the three stone steps that led to the front door it was locked her frustration only mounted when she was forced to go back and rip the keys from the ignition slamming into the house raven went directly to the music room she flung herself down on the silkcovered victorian sofa and stared straight ahead without seeing anything a gleaming mahogany grand piano dominated the room it was played often and at odd hours there were tiffany lamps and persian rugs and a dimestore flowerpot with a struggling african violet an old scarred music cabinet was filled to overflowing sheet music spilled onto the floor a priceless faberge box sat next to the brass unicorn she had found in a thrift shop and had fallen in love with one wall was crowded with awards grammys gold and platinum records plaques and statues and the keys to a few cities on another was the framed sheet music from the first song she had written and a breathtaking picasso the sofa on which she sat had a bad spring it was a strange hodgepodge of cultures and tastes and uniquely ravens own she would have thought eclectic a pretentious word she had allowed julie her exacting taste everywhere else in the house but here she had expressed herself raven needed the room the same way she needed to drive her own car it kept her sane and helped her remember exactly who raven williams was but the room like the drive hadnt calmed her nerves she walked to the piano she pounded out mozart fiercely like her eyes her music reflected her moods now it was tormented volatile even when shed finished anger seemed to hover in the air well i see youre home julies voice mild and unruffled came from the doorway julie walked into the room as she had walked into ravens life poised and confident when raven had met her nearly six years before julie had been rich and bored a partygoer born into old money their relationship had given them both something of importance friendship and a dual dependence julie handled the myriad details attached to raven s career raven gave julie a purpose that the glittery world of wealth had lacked didnt the recording go well julie was tall and blond with an elegant body and that exquisitely casual california chic raven lifted her head aqd the smile fled from julies face it had been a long time since shed seen that helpless ravaged look what happened raven let out a long breath hes back where did you see him there was no need for julie to ask for names in all the years of their association only two things had had the power to put that look on ravens face one of them was a man at the studio raven combed her fingers through her hair he was up in the booth i dont know how long hed been there before i saw him julie pursed her lightly tinted lips i wonder what brand carstairs is doing in california i dont know raven shook her head he said business maybe hes going to tour again in an effort to release the tension she rubbed her hand over the back of her neck hes coming here tomorrow julies brows rose i see dont turn secretary on me julie raven pleaded she shut her eyes help me do you want to see him the question was practical julie raven knew was practical she was organized logical and a stickler for detailsall the things raven wasnt they needed each other no raven began almost fiercely yes she swore then and pressed both hands to her temples i dont know now her tone was quiet and weary you know what hes like julie oh god i thought it was over i thought it was finished with something like a moan she jumped from the stool to pace around the room she didnt look like a star in jeans and a simple linen blouse her closet held everything from bib overalls to sables the sables were for the performer the overalls were for her id buried all the hurts i was so sure her voice was low and a little desperate it was still impossible for her to believe that she had remained this vulnerable after five years she had only to see him again and she felt it once more i knew sooner or later that id run into him somewhere she ran her fingers through her hair as she roamed the room i think id always pictured it would be in europelondonprobably at a party or a benefit id have expected him there maybe that would have been easier but today i just looked up and there he was it all came back i didnt have any time to stop it id been singing that damn song that id written right after hed left raven laughed and shook her head isnt that wild she took a deep breath and repeated softly wonderingly isnt that wild the room was silent for nearly a full minute before julie spoke what are you going to do do raven spun back to her her hair flew out to follow the sudden movement im not going to do anything im not a child looking for happy everafter any more her eyes were still dark with raven lifted her head and the smile fled from julies face it had been a long time since shed seen that helpless ravaged look what happened raven let out a long breath hes back where

what are you going to do do raven spun back to her her hair flew out to follow the sudden movement im not going to do anything im not a child looking for happy everafter any more her eyes were still dark with emotion but her voice had grown gradually steadier i was barely twenty when i met brandon and i was blindly in love with his talent he was kind to me at a time when i badly needed kindness i was overwhelmed by him and with my own success she lifted a hand to her hair and carefully pushed it behind her shoulders i couldnt cope with what he wanted from me i wasnt ready for a physical relationship she walked to the brass unicorn and ran a fingertip down its withers so he left she said softly and i was hurt all i could see maybe all i wanted to seewas that he didnt understand didnt care enough to want to know why i said no but that was unrealistic she turned to julie then with a frustrated sigh why dont you say something youre doing fine without me all right then raven thrust her hands in her pockets and stalked to the window one of the things ive learned is that if you dont want to get hurt you dont get too close youre the only person ive never applied that rule to and youre the only one who hasnt let me down she took a deep breath i was infatuated with brandon years ago perhaps it was a kind of love but a girls love easily brushed aside it was a shock seeing him today especially right after i finished that song the coincidence was raven pushed the feelings away and turned back from the window brandon will come over tomorrow and hell say whatever it is that he has to say then hell go thatll be the end of it julie studied ravens face will it qoh yes raven smiled she was a bit weary after the emotional outburst but more confident she had regained her control i like my life just as it is julie hes not going to change it no one is not this time emotion but her voice had grown gradually steadier i was barely twenty when i met brandon and i was blindly in love with his talent he was kind to me at a time when i badly needed kindness i was overwhelmed by him and with my own success she lifted a hand to her hair and carefully pushed it behind her shoulders i couldnt cope with what he wanted from me i wasnt ready for a physical relationship she walked to the brass unicorn and ran a fingertip down its withers so he left she said softly and i was

the window brandon will come over tomorrow and hell say whatever it is that he has to say then hell go thatll be the end of it julie studied ravens face will it qoh yes raven smiled she was a bit weary after the emotional outburst but more confident she had regained her control i like my life just as it is julie hes not going to change it no one is not this time chapter raven had dressed carefully telling herself it was because of the fittings she had scheduled and the luncheon meeting with her agent she knew it was a lie but the smart sophisticated clothes made her feel confident who could feel vulnerable dressed in a st laurent her coat was white silk and full cut with batwing sleeves that made it seem almost like a cape she wore it over matching pants with an orchid cowlneck blouse and a thick gold belt with the flatbrimmed hat and the carefully selected earrings she felt invulnerable youve come a long way she had thought as she had studied herself in the bedroom mirror now standing in wayne metcalfs elaborate the rise to fame together she scratching out a living singing in seamy clubs and smoky piano bars and he waiting tables and sketching designs no one had the time to look at but raven had looked and fitting room she thought the same thing again about both of them wayne and raven had started admired and remembered wayne had just begun to eke out a living in his trade when plans had begun for ravens first concert tour the first professional decision she made without advice was the choice of her costume designer she had never regretted it like julie wayne was a friend close enough to know something about ravens early personal life and like julie he was fiercely unquestionably loyal raven wandered around the room a much plusher room she mused than the first offices of metcalf designs thered been no carpet on that floor no signed lithographs on laquered walls no panoramic view of beverly hills it had been a cramped airless little room above a greek restaurant raven could still remember the strange heavy aromas that would seep through the walls she could still hear the exotic music that had vibrated through the bare wood floor ravens star had not risen with that firt concert tour it had rocketed the initial taste of fame had been so heady and so quick she had hardly had the time to savor it all tours rehearsals hotel rooms money and impossible demands she had loved it i reporters mobs of fans unbelievable amounts of although the traveling had sometimes left her weak and disoriented and the fans could be as frightening as they were wonderful still she had loved it wayne deluged with offers after the publicity of that first tour had soon moved out of the oneroom office above the moussaka and souvlaki hed been ravens designer for six years and although he now had a large staff and a huge workload he still saw to every detail of her designs himself while she waited for him raven wandered to the bar and poured herself a ginger ale through all the years of luncheon meetings elegant brunches and recording sessions she had never taken more than an occasional drink in this respect at least she would control her life the past she mused was never very far away at least not while she still had to worry about her mother raven shut her eyes and wished that she could shut off her thoughts as easily how long had it been that she had lived with that constant anxiety she could never remember a life without it she had been very young when she had first discovered that her mother wasnt like other mothers even as a little girl she had hated the oddly sweet smell of the liquor on her mothers breath that no mints could disguise and she had dreaded the flushed face the first slurred affectionate then angry tones that had drawn mocking stares or sympathetic glances from friends and neighbors raven pressed her fingers against her brow so many years so much waste and now her mother had disappeared again where was she in what sordid hotel room had she holed herself up in to drink away what was left of her life raven made a determined effort to push her mother out of her mind but the terrible images the frightful scenes played on in her mind its my life i have to get on with it raven told herself but she could feel the bitter taste of sorrow and guilt rise in her throat she started when the door across swung open and wayne walked in he leaned against the knob beautiful he said admiringly surveying her did you wear that for me she made a sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a sob as she moved across the room to hug him of course bless you if you were going to dress up for me you might at least have worn something of mine he complained but returned the embrace he was tall a thin reed of a man who had to bend over to give her the quick kiss not yet thirty he had a scholarly attractive face with hair and eyes the same rich shade of brown a small white scar marred his left eyebrow and gave him he preferred to think a rakish profile jealous raven grinned and drew away from him i thought you were too big for that youre never too big for that he released her then made his way across to the bar well at least take off your hat and coat raven obliged tossing them aside with a carelessness that made wayne wince he gazed at her for a long moment as he poured out a perrier she grinned again and did a slow models turn how am i holding up she demanded i should have seduced you when you were eighteen he sighed and drank the sparkling water then i wouldnt be constantly regretting that you slipped through my fingers she came back for her ginger ale you had your chance fella i was too exhausted in those days he lifted his scarred brow in a practiced gesture that always amused her i get more rest now too late she told him and touched her glass to his and youre much too busy with the modelof the week contest i only date all those skinny girls for the publicity he reached for a cigarette and lit it elegantly im basically a very retiring man the brilliance of the pun i could make is terrifying but ill pass wise he concluded then blew out a delicate trail of smoke i hear brand carstairs is in town ravens smile fled then returned he never could keep a low profile are you okay she shrugged her shoulders a minute ago i was beautiful now you have to ask if im okay raven wayne laid a hand on top of hers you folded up when he left i was there remember of course i remember the teasing note left her voice you were very good to me wayne i dont think i would have made it without you and julie thats not what im talking about raven i want to know how you feel now he turned tier hand over and laced his fingers through hers i could renew my offer to go try to break all his bones if you like touched and amused she laughed im sure youre a real killer wayne but it isnt necessary the straightening of her shoulders was unconscious a gesture of pride that made wayne smile im not going to fold this time are you still in love with him she hadnt expected such a direct question dropping her gaze she took a moment to answer a better question is did i ever love him we both already know the answer to that one wayne countered he took her hand when she would have turned away weve been friends a long time what happens to you matters to me nothings going to happen to me her eyes were back on his and she smiled absolutely nothing brandon is the past who knows better than i that you cant run away from the past and who knows better how to cope with it she squeezed his hand come on show me the costumes that are going to make me look sensational after a quick final glance at her face wayne walked over to a gleaming chippendale table and pushed the button on an intercom bring in ms williamss designs raven had approved the sketches of course and the fabrics but still the completed designs took her by surprise they had been created for the spotlights she knew shed sparkle on stage it felt odd wearing blood red and silver sequins in waynes rightly lit elegant room with mirrors tossing her image back at her from all angles but then she remembered it was an odd business raven stared at the woman in the mirrors and listened with half an ear to waynes mumbling as he tucked and adjusted her mind could not help but wander six years before shed been a terrified kid with an album shooting off the top of the charts and a whirlwind concert tour to face it had all happened so fast the typical overnight success not counting the years she had struggled in smoke choked dives still shed been young to make a name for herself and determined to prove she wasnt a oneshot fluke the romance with brand carstairs while she had still been fresh hot news hadnt hurt hex career for a brief time it had made her the crown princess of popular music for more than six months their faces appeared on every magazine cover dominating the newsstands theyd laughed about it raven remembered laughed at the silly predictable headlines raven and brand plan love nest williams and carstairs make their own music brand had complained about his billing they had ignored the constant flare and flash of cameras because they had been happy and saw little else but each other then when he had gone the pictures and headlines had continued for a long timethe cold cruel words that flashed the intimacies of private hurts for the public eye raven no longer looked at them over the months and years she had grown from the crown princess to a respected performer and celebrity in her own right thats whats important she reminded herself her career her life shed learned about priorities the hard way raven slipped into the glistening black jumpsuit and found it fit like a second skin even her quiet breathing sent sequins flashing light streaked out from it at the slightest movement it was she decided after a critical survey blisteringly sexy id better not gain a quarter of an ounce before the tour she remarked turning to view her slim sleek profile thoughtfully she gathered her hair in her hand and tossed it behind her back wayne he was kneeling at her feet adjusting the hem his answer was a grunt wayne i dont know if i have the nerve to wear this thing this thing he said mildly as he rose to pluck at the sleeve is fantastic no artistic snub intended she returned and smiled as he stepped back to survey her up and down in his concentrated professional gaze but its a bit she glanced at herself again basic isnt it youve got a nice little body raven wayne examined his creation from the rear not all my clients could wear this without a bit of help here and there okay take it off its perfect just as it is i always feel like ive been to the doctor when ive finished here she commented as she slipped back into her white slacks and orchid blouse who knows more about our bodies secrets than our dressmakers who else knows more about your secrets darling he corrected absently as he made notes on each one of the costumes women tend to get chatty when theyre halfdressed oh what lovely gossip do you know fastening her belt raven walked to him then leaned companionably on his shoulder tell me something wonderfully indiscreet and shocking wayne babs curtain has a new lover he murmured still intent on his notes i said shocking raven complained not predictable ive sworn an oath of secrecy written in dressmaker s chalk im very disappointed in you raven left his side to fetch her coat and hat i was certain you had feet of clay lauren chase just signed to do the lead in fantasy raven stopped on her way to the door and whirled what she dashed back across the room and yanked the notebook from waynes hand somehow i thought that would get your attention wayne observed dryly when oh wayne she went on before he could answer id give several years of my young life for a chance to write that score lauren chase oh yes shes so right for it whos doing the score wayne raven gripped his shoulders and closed her eyes go ahead tell me i can take it she doesnt know youre cutting off the circulation raven he added disengaging her hands doesnt know she groaned crushing the hat down on her head in a way that made wayne swear and adjust it himself thats worse a thousand times worse some faceless nameless songwriter who couldnt possibly know whats right for that fabulous screenplay is even now sitting at a piano making unforgivable mistakes theres always the remote possibility that whoever s writing it has talent he suggested and earned a lethal glare whos side are you on she demanded and flung the coat around her shoulders he grinned grabbed her cheeks and gave her a resounding kiss go home and stomp your feet darling youll feel better she struggled not to smile im going next door and buy a florence demille she threatened him with the name of a leading competitor ill forgive you that statement wayne said with a hefty sigh because along with my feet of clay ive a heart of gold she laughed and left him with her rack of costumes and his notebook the house was quiet when raven returned the faint scent of lemon oil and pine told her that the house had just been cleaned as a matter of habit she peeked into her music room and was satisfied that nothing there had been disturbed she liked her disorganization just as it was with the idle thought of making coffee raven wandered toward the kitchen she had bought the house for its size and rambling openness it was the antithesis of the small claustrophobic rooms she had grown up in and it smelled clean she decided not antiseptic she would have hated that but there was no lingering scent of stale cigarettes no sickly sweet odor of yesterdays bottle it was her house as her life was hers shed bought them both with her voice raven twirled once around the room pleased with herself for no specific reason im happy she thought just happy to be alive grabbing a rose from a china vase she began to sing as she walked down the hall it was the sight of julies long narrow bare feet propped up on the desk in the library that stopped her raven hesitated seeing julie was on the phone but was quickly gestured inside im sorry mr cummings but ms williams has a strict policy against endorsements yes im sure its a marvelous product julie lifted her eyes from her pinktinted toenails and met ravens amused grin she rolled her eyes to the ceiling and raven settled crosslegged in an overstuffed leather chair the library with its warm mahogany paneling and stately furnishings was julies domain and raven thought snuggling down more comfortably it suited her of course ill see she gets your offer but i warn you ms williams takes a firm stand on this with one last exasperated glance at the ceiling julie hung up if you didnt insist on being nice to everybody who calls you i could have thought of a few different words for that one julie snapped trouble raven asked sniffing her rose and smiling get smart and ill tell him youll be thrilled to endorse his earth bubble shampoo she laced her fingers behind her head as she made the threat mercy raven pleaded then kicked off her elegant orchidtoned shoes you look tired she said watching julie stretch her back muscles been busy just lastminute nonsense to clear things for the tour a shrug dismissed the complications she had handled i never did ask you how the recording went its finished isnt it yeah raven took a deep breath and twirled her rose by the stem it went perfectly i havent been happier with a session since the first one something just clicked you worked hard enough on the material julie remarked thinking of the endless nights raven had spent writing and arranging sometimes i still cant believe it she spoke softly the words hardly more than thoughts i listen to a playback and its all there the strings the brass the rhythm and backups and i cant believe its me ive been so incredibly lucky talented julie corrected lots of people have talent raven reminded her but theyre not sitting here theyre still in some dreary piano bar waiting without luck theyre never going to be anywhere else there are also things like drive perseverance guts ravens persistent lack of selfconfidence infuriated julie shed been with her almost from the beginning of ravens start in california six years before shed seen the struggles and the disappointments she knew about the fears insecurities and work behind the glamour there was nothing about raven williams that julie didnt know the phone interrupted her thoughts on a lecture on selfworth its your private line she said as she pressed the button hello raven tensed but relaxed when she saw julie smile hi henderson yes shes right here hold on your illustrious agent julie stated as she rose she slipped her feet back into her sandals raven got up from her chair just as the doorbell chimed i guess thats brandon with admirable ease she flopped into the chair that julie had just vacated would you tell him ill be along in a minute sure julie turned and left as ravens voice i followed her down the hall i left it where in your office henderson i dont know why i ever bother carrying a purse julie smiled raven had a penchant for losing things her purse her shoes her passport vital or trivial it simply didnt matter music and people filled ravens thoughts and material objects were easily forgotten hello brand julie said as she opened the front door nice to see you again her eyes were cool and her mouth formed no smile j hello julie there was warmth in his greeting she sensed it and ignored it come in she invited ravens expecting you shell be right out its good to be here again ive missed this place have you her tone was sharp his grin turned into a look of appraisal julie was a longstemmed woman with a sleek cap of honeyblond hair and direct brown eyes she was closer to brands age than ravens and was the sort of woman he was usually attracted to smart sophisticated and coolly sexy yet there could never have been anything between them but friendship she was too fiercely devoted to raven her loyalty he saw was unchanged five years is a long time julie im not sure its long enough she countered old resentments came simmering back to the surface you hurt her yes i know his gaze didnt falter at the confession and there was no plea for understanding in his eyes the lack of it touched off respect in julie but she dismissed it she shook her head as she looked at him so she said softly youve come back ive come back he agreed then smiled did you think i wouldnt she didnt julie retorted annoyed with herself for warming to him thats what matters julie hendersons sending over my purse raven came down the hall toward them in her quick nervous stride i told him not to bother i dont think theres anything in it but a comb and an expired credit card hello brandon she offered her hands as she had at the recording studio but now she felt more able to accept his touch she hadnt bothered to put her shoes back on or to repaint her mouth her smile was freer more as he remembered it raven brand brought her hands to his lips instantly she stiffened and brand released her can we talk in the music room his smile was easy friendly i was always comfortable in there of course she turned toward the doorway would you like something to drink id have some tea he gave julie his quick charming grin you always made a good cup of tea ill bring it in without responding to the grin julie moved down the hall toward the kitchen brand followed raven into the music room he touched her shoulder before she could cross to the sofa it was a gesture that asked her to wait turning her head raven saw that he was giving the room one of his long detailed studies she had seen that look on his face before it was a curious aspect of what seemed like a casual nature there was an intensity about him at times that recalled the tough london street kid whod once fought his way to the top of his profession the key to his talent seemed to be in his natural gift for observation he saw everything remembered everything then he translated it into lyric and melody the fingers on her shoulder caressed once almost absently and brought back a flood of memories raven would have moved away but he dropped the hand and turned to her she had never been able to resist his eyes i remember every detail of this room ive pictured it from time to time when i couldnt do anything but think of you he lifted his hand again to brush the back of it against her cheek dont she shook her head and stepped away its difficult not to touch you raven especially here do you remember the long evenings we spent here the quiet afternoons he was moving herwith just his voice just the steady spell of his eyes it was a long time ago brandon it doesnt seem so long ago at the moment it could be yesterday you look the same im not she told him with a slight shake of her head he saw her eyes darken before she turned away if i had known this was why you wanted to see me i wouldnt have let you come its over brandon its been over for a long time is it raven hadnt realized he was so close behind her he turned her in his arms and caught her show me then he demanded just once the moment his mouth touched hers she was thrown back in time it was all therethe heat the need the loving his lips were so soft so warm hers parted with only the slightest pressure she knew how he would taste how he would smell her memory was sharper than she had thought nothing was forgotten he tangled his fingers in the thickness of her hair tilting her head further back as he deepened the kiss he wanted to luxuriate in her flavor in her scent in her soft yielding response her hands were trapped between their bodies and she curled her fingers into the sweater he wore the need the longing seemed much too fresh to have been dormant for five years brand held her close but without urgency there was a quiet kind of certainty in the way he explored her mouth raven responded giving accepting remembering but when she felt the pleasure drifting toward passion she resisted when she struggled he loosened his hold but didnt release her raven stared up at him with a look he well remembered but had never been able to completely decipher it doesnt seem its altogether finished after all he murmured you never did play fair did you raven pushed out of his arms furious and shaken let me tell you something brandon i wont fall at your feet this time you hurt me before but i dont bruise so easily now i have no intention of letting you back into my life i think you will he corrected easily but perhaps not in the way you mean he paused and caught her hair with his fingers i can apologize for kissing you raven if youd like me to lie dont bother youve always been good at romance i rather enjoyed it she sat down on the sofa and smiled brightly up at him he lifted a brow it was hardly the response he had expected he drew out a cigarette and lit it you seem to have grown up in my absence being an adult has its advantages raven observed the kiss had stirred more than she cared to admit even to herself i always found your naivete charming its difficult to remain naive however charming in this business she leaned back against the cushion relaxing deliberately im not wideeyed and twenty anymore brandon tough and jaded are you raven tough enough she returned yougave me my first lesson he took a deep drag on his cigarette then considered the glowing tip of it maybe i did he murmured maybe you needed it maybe youd like me to thank you she tossed back and he looked over at her again perhaps he walked over then dropped down beside her on the sofa his laugh was sudden and unexpected good god raven youve never had this bloody spring fixed the tension in her neck fled as she laughed with him i like it that way she tossed her hair behind her back its more personal to say nothing of uncomfortable i never sit on that spot she told him you leave it for unsuspecting guests i imagine he shifted away from the defective spring thats right i like people to feel at home julie brought in a tea tray and found them sitting companionably on the sofa her quick practiced glance found no tension on ravens face satisfied she left them again howve you been brandon busy i imagine raven crossed her legs under her and leaned over to pour the tea it was a move brandon had seen many times almost savagely he crushed out his cigarette busy enough he understated the five albums he had released since shed last seen him and the three grueling concert tours thered been more than twenty songs with his name on the copyright in the past year youve been living in london mostly his brow lifted and she caught the gesture as she handed him his tea i read the trades she said mildly dont we all i saw your television special last month he sipped his tea and relaxed against the back of the sofa his eyes were on her and she thought them a bit more green than blue now you were marvelous last month she frowned at him puzzled it wasnt aired in england was it i was in new york did you write all the songs for the album you finished up yesterday all but two shrugging she took up her own china cup marc wrote right now and coming back hes got the touch yes brand eyed her steadily does he have you too ravens head whipped around i read the trades he said mildly that comes under a more personal heading her eyes were dark with anger more bluntly stated none of my business he asked sipping again you were always bright brandon thanks love he set down his cup but my question was professional i need to know if you have any entanglements at the moment entanglements are usually personal ask me about my dancing lessons later perhaps raven i need your undivided devotion for the next three months his smile was engaging raven fought his charm well she said and set her cup beside his thats bluntly stated no indecent proposal at the moment he assured her settling back in the hook of the sofas arm he sought her eyes im doing the score for fantasy i need a partner i i i chapter to say she was surprised would have seen a ridiculous understatement brand watched her eyes widen he thought they were the color of peat smoke she didnt move but simply stared at him her hands resting lightly on her knees her thoughts had been flung in a thousand different directions and she was trying to sit calmly and bring them back to order fantasy the book that had captured americas i heart a novel that had been on the bestseller list for more than fifty weeks the sale of its paperback rights had broken all records the film rights had been purchased as well and carol mason the author had written the screenplay herself it was to be a musical the musical of the eighties speculation had been buzzing for months on both coasts as to who would write the score it would be the coup of the decade the chance of a lifetime the plot was a dream and the reigning boxoffice queen had the lead and the music raven already had halfformed songs in her head carefully she reached back and poured more tea things like this dont just fall in your lap she reminded herself perhaps he means something entirely different youre going to score fantasy she said at length cautiously her eyes met his again his were clear confident slightly amused hers were dark guarded a little puzzled i just heard that lauren chase had been signed everywhere i go people are wondering whos going to play tessa whos going to play joe jack ladd brand supplied and the puzzlement in ravens eyes changed to pure pleasure perfect she reached over to take his hand youre going to have a tremendous hit im very happy for you and she was he could see as well as hear the absolute sincerity it was typical of her to gain genuine pleasure from someone elses good fortune just as it was typical of her to suffer for someone elses misfortune ravens feelings ran deep and he knew shed never been afraid to show emotion her un affectedness had always been a great part of her appeal for the moment she had forgotten to be cautious with brand she smiled at him as she held his hands so thats why youre in california she said have you already started no he seemed to consider something for a moment then his fingers interlaced with hers her hands were nanowboned and slender with palms as soft as a childs raven i meant what i said i need a partner i need you she started to remove her hands from his but he tightened his fingers ive never known you to y q q need an one brandon she said not quite succeeding in making her tone light least of all me his grip tightened quickly causing ravens eyes to widen at the unexpected pain just as quickly he released her this is business raven she lifted a brow at the temper in his voice business is usually handled through my agent she said you remember henderson he gave her a long steady look i remember everything he saw the flash of hurt in her eyes swiftly controlled raven his tone was gentler now im sorry she shrugged and gave her attention back to her tea old wounds brandon it does seem to me that if there was a legitimate offer henderson would have gotten wind of it theres been an offer brand told her i asked him to let me speak to you first oh her hair had drifted down curtaining her face and she flipped it behind her back why because i thought that if you knew wed be working together youd turn it down yes she agreed youre right and that he said without missing a beat would be incredibly softheaded henderson knows that as well as i do oh does he raven rose furious isnt it marvelous the way people determine my life did you two decide i was too feeblebrained to make this decision on my own not exactly brands voice was cool we did agree that left to yourself you have a tendency to be emotional rather than sensible terrific do i get a leash and collar for christmas dont be an idiot brand advised oh so now im an idiot raven turned away to pace the room she had the same quicksilver temper he remembered she was all motion all energy i dont know how ive managed all this time without your pretty compliments brandon she whirled back to him why in the world would you want an emotional idiot as a collaborator because brandon said and rose youre a hell of a writer now shut up of course she said seating herself on the piano bench since you ask so nicely deliberately he took out another cigarette lit it and blew out a stream of smoke all the while his eyes resting on her face this is an important project raven he said lets not blow it because we were once very close i wanted to talk to you face to face not through a mediator not through a bloody telephone wire can you understand that she waited a long moment before answering maybe brand smiled and moved over to her well add stubborn to those adjectives later but i dont want you mad again then let me ask you something before you say anything ill have to get mad about raven tilted her head and studied his face first why do you want a collaborator on this why share the glory its also a matter of sharing the work love fifteen songs she nodded all right number two then why me brandon why not someone whos scored a musical before he answered her by walking around her and slipping down on the piano bench beside her without speaking he began to play the notes flooded the room like ghosts remember this he murmured glancing over and into her eyes raven didnt have to answer she rose and walked away it was too difficult to sit beside him at the same piano where they had composed the song he now played she remembered how they had laughed how warm his eyes had been how safe she had feltqqin his arms it was the first and only song they had written and recorded together even after he had stopped playing she continued to prowl the room what does clouds and rainy have to do with anything she demanded he had touched a chord in her he heard it in the tone of her voice he felt a pang of guilt at having intentionally peeled away a layer of her defense theres a grammy over there and a gold record thanks to that two minutes and fortythree seconds raven we work well together she turned back to look at him we did once we will again brand stood and came to her but this time made no move to touch her raven you know how important this could be to your career and you must realize what youd be bringing to the project fantasy needs your special talents she wanted it she could hardly believe that something she wanted so badly was being offered to her but how would it be to work with him again to be in constant close contact would she be able to deal with it would she be sacrificing her personal sanity for professional gain but i dont love him any more she reminded herself raven caught her bottom lip between her teeth in a gesture of indecision brand saw it raven think of the music i am she admitted im also thinking of youof us she gave him a clear candid look im not sure it would be healthy for me i cant promise not to touch you he was annoyed and his voice reflected it in its crisp concise tone but i can promise not to push myself on you is that good enough raven evaded the question if i agreed when would we start ive a tour coming up i know in two weeks youll be finished in six so we could start the first week in may i see her mouth turned up a bit as she combed her fingers through her hair youve looked into this thoroughly i told you its business g all right brandon she said concedin his point where would we work not here she said quickly there was a sudden pressure in her chest i wont work with you here no i thought not i have a place he continued when raven remained silent its in cornwall cornwall raven repeated why cornwall because its quiet and isolated and no one especially the press knows i have it theyll be all over us when they hear were working together especially on this project its too hot an item couldnt we just rent a small cave on the coast somewhere he laughed and caught her hair in his hand you know how poor the acoustics are in a cave cornwalls incredible in the spring raven come with me she lifted a hand to his chest to push back not certain if she was about to agree or decline he could still draw too much from her too effortlessly she needed to think she decided a few days to put it all in perspective raven she turned to see julie in the doorway yes theres a call for you vaguely annoyed raven frowned at her cant it wait julie i its on your private line brand felt her stiffen and looked down curiously her eyes were completely blank i see her voice was calm but he detected the faintest of tremors raven without thinking he took her by the shoulders and turned her to face him what is it nothing she drew out of his arms there was something remote about her now something distant that puzzled him have some more tea she invited and smiled but her eyes remained blank ill be back in a minute she was gone for more than ten and brand had begun to pace restlessly through the room raven was definitely no longer the malleable young girl she had been five years before he knew that he wasnt at all certain she would agree to work with him he wanted herfor the project and yes for himself holding her tasting her again had stirred up much more than memories she fascinated him and always had even when she had been so young there had been an air of secrecy about her there still was it was as if she kept certain parts of herself locked in a closet out of reach she had held him off five years before in more than a physical sense it had frustrated him then and continued to frustrate him but he was older too hed made mistakes with her before and had no intention of repeating them brand knew what he wanted and was determined to get it sitting back at the piano he began to play the song he had written with raven he remembered her voice warm and sultry in his ear he was nearly at the end when he sensed her presence glancing up brand saw her standing in the doorway her eyes were unusually dark and intense then he realized it was because she was pale and the contrast accentuated the gray of her irises had the song disturbed her that much he stopped immediately and rose to go to her raven ive decided to do it she interrupted her hands were folded neatly in front of her her eyes direct good he took her hand and found it chilled are you all right yes of course she removed her hands from his but her gaze never faltered i suppose henderson will fill me in on all the details something about her calm disturbed him it was if shed set part of herself aside lets have dinner raven the urge to be with her to pierce her armor was almost overwhelming ill take you to the bistro you always liked it there not tonight brandon i have some things to do tomorrow he insisted knowing he was pushing but unable to prevent himself she looked suddenly weary yes all right tomorrow she gave him a tired smile im sorry but ill have to ask you to leave now brandon i didnt realize how late it was vaguely annoyed raven frowned at her cant it wait julie i its on your private line brand felt her stiffen and looked down curiously her eyes were completely blank i see her voice was calm but he detected the faintest of tremors raven without thinking he took her by the shoulders and turned her to face him what is it nothing she drew out of his arms there

ask you to leave now brandon i didnt realize how late it was all right bending toward her he gently kissed her it was an instinctive gesture one that demanded no response he felt the need to warm her protect her seven tomorrow he told her im at the belair you only have to call me raven waited until she heard the front door shut behind him she pressed the heel of her hand to her brow and let the tide of emotions rush through her there were no tears but a blinding headache raged behind her eyes she felt julies hand on her shoulder they found her julie asked concerned automatically she began kneading the tension from ravens shoulders yes they found her she let out a long deep breath shes coming back chapter the sanitarium was white and clean the architect a good one had conceived a restful building without medical overtones the uninformed might have mistaken it for an exclusive hotel snuggled in californias scenic ojai it was a proud elegantly fashioned building with several magnificent views of the countryside raven detested it inside the floors were thickly carpeted and conversation was always lowkey raven hated the controlled silence the padded quiet the staff members wore street clothes and only small discreet badges to identify themselves and they were among the best trained in the country just as the fieldmore clinic was the best detoxification center on the west coast raven had made cum tain of its reputation before she had brought her mother there for the first time over five years before raven waited in justin karters paneled booklined tasteful office it received its southern exposure through a wide thickpaned window the morning sunlight beamed in on a thriving collection of leafy green plants raven wondered idly why her own plants seemed always to put up only a halfhearted struggle for life one they usually lost perhaps she should ask dr karter what his secret was she laughed a little and rubbed her fingers on the nagging headache between her brows how she hated these visits and the leathery glossy smell of his office she was cold and cupped her elbows hugging her arms across her mi drift raven was always cold in the fieldmore clinic from the moment she walked through the stately white double doors until long after she walked out again it was a penetrating cold that went straight to the bone turning away from the window she paced nervously around the room when she heard the door open she stopped and turned around slowly karter entered a small youthful man with a corncolored beard and healthy pink cheeks he had an earnest face accentuated by tortoiserimmed glasses and a faint smattering of freckles under other circumstances raven would have liked his face even warmed to it ms williams he held out a hand and took hers in a quick professional grip it was cold he realized and as fragile as he remembered her hair was pinned up at the nape of her neck and she looked young and pale in the dark tailored suit this woman was far different from the vibrant laughing entertainer he had watched on television a few weeks before hello dr karter it always amazed him that the rich fulltoned voice belonged to such a small delicatelooking woman he had thought the same years before when she had been hardly more than a child he was an ardent fan but had never asked her to sign any of the albums in his collection it would he knew embarrass them both please sit down ms williams could i get you some coffee no please she swallowed her throat was always dry when she spoke to him id like to see my mother first there are a few things id like to discuss with you he watched her moisten her lips the only sign of agitation after ive seen her all right karter took her by the arm and led her from the room they walked across the quiet carpeted hallway to the elevators ms williams he began he would have liked to have called her raven he thought of her as raven just as the rest of the world did but he could never quite break through the film of reserve she slipped on in his presence it was karter knew because he knew her secrets she trusted him to keep them but was never comfortable with him she turned to him now her great gray eyes direct and expressionless yes doctor only once had raven ever broken down in his presence and she had promised herself she would never do so again she would not be destroyed by her mothers illness and she would not make a public display of herself i dont want you to be shocked by your mother s appearance they stepped into the elevator together and he kept his hand on her arm she had made a great deal of progress during her last stay here but she left prematurely as you know over the past three months her condition has deteriorated please raven said wearily dont be delicate i know where she was found and how youll dry her out again and in a couple of months shell leave and itll start all over it never changes alcoholics fight a continuing battle dont tell me about acloholics she shot back the reserve cracked and the emotion poured through dont preach to me about battles she stopped herself then shaking her head pressed her fingers to the concentrated source of her headache i know all about alcoholics she said more calmly i havent your dedication or your optimism you keep bringing her back he reminded raven softly shes my mother the elevator doors slid open and raven walked through them her skin grew colder as they moved down the hallway there were doors on either side but she refused to think of the people beyond them the hospital flavor was stronger here raven thought she could smell the antiseptic the hovering medicinal odor that always made a hint of nausea roll in her stomach when karter stopped in front of a door and reached for a knob raven laid a hand on top of his ill see her alone please he sensed her rigid control her eyes were calm but he had seen the quick flash of panic in them her fingers didnt tremble on his hand but were stiff and icy all right but only a few minutes there are complications we need to discuss he took his hand from the knob ill wait for you here raven nodded and twisted the knob herself she took a moment struggling to gather every ounce of strength then walked inside the woman lay in a hospital bed on good linen sheets dozing lightly there was a tube feeding liquid into her through a needle in her arm the drapes were drawn and the room was in shadows it was a comfortable room painted in soft blue with an ivory carpet and a few good paintiqgs with her fingers dug into the leather bag she carried raven approached the bed ravens first thought was that her mother had lost weight there were hollows in her cheeks and her skin had the familiar unhealthy yellow cast her dark hair was cropped short and streaked liberally with gray it had been lovely hair raven remembered glossy and full her face was gaunt with deathly circles under the eyes and a mouth that seemed dry and pulled in the helplessness stabbed at raven and for a minute she closed her eyes against it the tears were coming burning to be free she let them fall while she looked down on the sleeping woman without a sound without moving the woman in bed opened her eyes they were dark and gray like her daughters mama raven let the tears roll freely why by the time raven got to her front door she was exhausted she wanted bed and oblivion the headache was still with her but the pain had turned into a dull sickening throb closing the door behind her she leaned back on it trying to summon the strength to walk up the stairs raven she opened her eyes and watched julie come down the hall toward her seeing raven so pale and beaten julie slipped an arm around her shoulders her concern took the form of a scolding you should have let me go with you i should never have let you go alone she was already guiding raven up the stairs my mother my problem raven said tiredly thats the only selfish part of you julie said in a low furious voice as they entered ravens bedroom im supposed to be your friend youd never let me go through something like this alone please dont be angry with me raven swayed on her feet as julie stripped off the dark suit jacket its something i feel is my responsibility just mine ive felt that way for too long to change now i am angry with you julies voice was tight as she slipped the matching skirt down over ravens hips this is the only thing you do that makes me genuinely angry with you i cant stand it when you do this to yourself she looked back at the pale tired face have you eaten raven shook her head as she stepped out of the skirt and you wont she concluded brushing ravens fumbling hands away from the buttons of the white lawn blouse she undid them herself then pushed the material from ravens shoulders raven stood unresisting im having dinner with brandon raven murmured going willingly as julie guided her toward the bed ill call him and cancel i can bring you up something later you need to sleep no raven slipped between the crisp cool sheets i want to go i need to go she corrected as she shut her eyes i need to get out i dont want to think for a while ill rest now he wont be here until seven julie walked over to pull the shades even before the room was darkened raven was asleep it was some minutes past seven when julie opened the door to brandon he wore a stonecoloured suit with a navy shirt open at the throat he looked casually elegant julie thought the nosegay of violets was charming rather than silly in his hands he lifted a brow at the clinging black sheath she wore hello julie you look terrific he plucked one of the violets out of the nosegay and handed it to her going out julie accepted the flower in a little while she answered raven should be down in a minute brand hesitating julie shook her head then turned to lead him into the music room ill fix you a drink bourbon isnt it neat brand caught her arm that isnt what you were going to say she took a deep breath no for a moment longer she hesitated then began fixing him with her dark brown eyes ravens very important to me there arent many like her especially in this town shes genuine and though she thinks she has she hasnt really developed any hard edges yet i wouldnt like to see her hurt especially right now no i wont answer any questions she said anticipating him its ravens story not mine but im going to tell you this she needs a light touch and a great deal of patience youd better have them both how much do you know about what happened between us five years ago julie brandon asked i know what raven told me one day you ought to ask me how i felt and why i left and would you tell me yes he returned without hesitation i would im sorry raven came dashing down the stairs in a filmy flutter of white i hate to be late her hair settled in silky confusion over the shoulders of the thin voile dress as she stopped at the foot of the stairs i couldnt seem to find my shoes there was a becoming blush of color on her cheeks and her eyes were bright and full of laughter it passed through brands mind quickly and then was discarded that she looked a little too bright a little too vibrant beautiful as ever he handed her the flowers ive never minded waiting for you ah the golden irish tongue she murmured as she buried her face in the violets ive missed it raven held the flowers up to her nose while her eyes laughed at him over them and i believe ill let you spoil me tonight brandon im in a mood to be pampered he took her free hand in his where do you want to go anywhere everywhere she tossed her head but dinner first im starving all right ill buy you a cheeseburger some things do stay the same she commented before she turned to julie you have fun and dont worry about me she paused a moment then smiled and kissed her cheek i promise i wont lose my key and say hello to she hesitated as she walked toward the door with brandon who is it tonight lorenzo julie answered watching them the shoe baron oh yes raven laughed as they walked into the cool early spring air amazing she tucked her arm through brandons julies always having some millionaire fall in love with her its a gift shoe baron brand questioned as he opened the car door for raven mmm italian he wears beautiful designer suits and looks as though he should be stamped on the head of a coin brand slid in beside her and in an old reflex gesture brushed the hair that lay on her shoulder behind her back serious raven tried not to be moved by the touch of his fingers no more serious than the oil tycoon or the perfume magnate the leathery smell of the upholstery reminded her abruptly of karters office quickly she pushed away the sensation what are you going to feed me brandon she asked brightlytoo brightly i warn you im starving he circled her throat with his hand so that she had no choice but to meet his eyes directly are you going to tell me whats wrong hed always seen too much too quickly she thought it was one of the qualities that had made him an exceptional songwriter raven placed her hand on top of his no questions brandon not now she felt his hesitation then he turned his hand over and gripped hers slowly overriding her initial resistance he brought her palm to his lips not now he agreed watching her eyes i can still move you he murmured and smiled as bough the knowledge pleased him i can feel it raven felt the tremors racing up her arms yes she drew her hand from his but kept her eyes steady you can still move me but things arent the same any more he grinned a quick flash of white teeth then started the engine no things arent the same any more as he pulled away she had the uncomfortable impression that they had said the same words but meant two different things dinner was quiet and intimate and perfect they ate in a tiny old inn they had once discovered by chance here brand knew there would be no interruptions for autographs no greetings and drinks from old acquaintances here there would be just the two of them a man and a woman amidst candlelight wine fine food and an intimate atmosphere as the evening wore on ravens smile became more spontaneous less desperate and the unhappiness he had seen deep in her eyes before now faded though he noticed the transition brand made no comment i feel like i havent eaten in a week raven managed between bites of the tender roast beef that was the house specialty want some of mine brand offered his plate raven scooped up a bit of baked potato her eyes seemed to laugh at him well have them wrap it q a strand of her hair around his finger so absently q r ill meet you in new york at the end of the tour well fly to england from there all right she took a deep breath having q q dates and times are you staying in the states until then q would have resisted he laid his hand companion j q q raven was certain he was unaware of the gesture she made no complaint if its agreeable with you finally reached her fill of the roast beef youd better set it up with julie i havent any memory for im doing a couple of weeks in vegas he brushed his fingers across her cheek and when she ably over hers i havent played there in quite a while i dont suppose its changed she laughed and shook her head no i played there oh about six months ago i guess julie won a bundle at the baccarat table i was a victim of the slots up so i can take it home i want to leave room for dessert did you see that pastry tray i suppose i could roll you to cornwall brand considered adding some burgundy to his glass raven laughed a throaty sound that appealed and aroused ill be a bag of bones by the time we go to cornwall she claimed you know what those whirlwind tours can do she shook her head been much too long since ive heard you sing as he offered her more wine onenight stands from san francisco to new york brand lifted his glass as raven gave him a quizzing look i spoke to henderson he twirled ive heard you over the radio as well he i read the reviews were you as sensational as they said he smiled at her while one finger played with the thin gold bracelet at her wrist z id like to have seen you his finger drifted q you heard me just the other day in the studio she pointed out she took her hand from his to reach for her wine he easily took her other one brandon she began halfamused oh i was much more sensational than they said she assured him lazily to her pulse he felt it jump at his touch its continued but its not the same as watching you come alive at a concert or he smiled as his voice took on that soft intimate note she remembered listening to you when you sing just for me his tone was as smooth as the burgundy she drank knowing how easily he could cloud her brain she vowed to keep their conversation light do you know what i want right now she lowered her own voice as she leaned toward him but he recognized the laughter in her eyes dessert he answered you know me so well brandon she smiled she wanted to go dancing by mutual consent when they left the restaurant they avoided the popular trendy spots in town and found a crowded smoky holeinthewall club with a good band much like the dozens they had both played in at the beginnings of their respective careers they thought they wouldnt be recognized there for almost twenty minutes they were right excuse me arent you brand carstairs the toothy young blond stared up at brand in admiration then she glanced at raven and raven williams bob muldoon brand returned in a passable texas drawl and my wife sheila say howdy sheilaf he instructed as he held her close and swayed on the postagestampsized dance floor howdy raven said obligingly oh mr carstairs she giggled and thrust out a cocktail napkin and a pencil please im debbie could you write to my good friend debbie sure brand gave her one of his charming smiles and told raven to turn around he scrawled quickly using her back for support and you too raven debbie asked when hed finished on the other side it was typical of her fans to treat her informally they thought of her as raven her spontaneous warmth made it difficult for anyone to approach her with the awe normally reserved for superstars raven wrote on her side of the napkin when brand offered his back when she had finished she noted that debbies eyes were wide and fixed on brand the pulse in her throat was jumping like a jackhammer raven knew what fantasies were dancing in the girls mind here you are debbie she touched her hand to bring the girl back to reality oh debbie took the napkin looked at it blankly a moment then smiled up at brand thanks she looked at raven then ran a hand through her hair as if she had just realized what she had done thanks a lot youre welcome brand smiled but began to edge raven toward the door it was too much to expect that the incident had gone unnoticed or that no one else would recognize them for the next fifteen minutes they were wedged between the crowd and the door signing autographs and dealing with a barrage of questions brand made certain they werent separated from each other as he slowly maneuvered a path through the crowd they were jostled and shoved a bit but he judged the crowd to be fairly civilized it was still early by la standards and there hadnt been too much drinking yet still he wanted her out this type of situation was notoriously explosive the mood could change abruptly one overenthusiastic fan and it could all be different and ugly raven signed and signed some more while an occasional hand reached out to touch her hair brand felt a small wave of relief as he finally drew her out into the fresh air only a few followed them out of the club and they were able to make their way to brands car with just a smattering of extra autographs damn it im sorry he leaned across her to lock her door i should have known better than to have taken you there raven took a long breath combing her hair back from her face with her fingers as she turned to him dont be silly i wanted to go besides the people were nice they arent always he muttered as the car merged with los angeles traffic no she leaned back letting her body relax but ive been pretty lucky things have only gotten out of hand once or twice its the hyge i suppose and its to be expected that fans sometimes forget were flesh and blood qso they try to take little chunks of us home with them that raven said dryly can be a problem i remember seeing a film clip of a concert you gave oh seven or eight years ago she leaned her elbow on the back of the seat now and cupped her cheek in her palm a london concert where the fans broke through the security they seemed to swallow you whole it must have been dreadful they loved me enough to give me a couple of broken ribs oh brandon she sat up straight now shocked thats terrible i never knew that he smiled and moved his shoulders we played it down it did rather spoil my taste for live concerts for a while i got over it he turned heading toward the hills securitys tighter these days i dont know if id be able to face an audience after something like that where else would you get the adrenaline he countered we need it dont we that instant gratification of applause he laughed and pulled her over beside him why else do we do it raven why else are there countless others out there scrambling to make it why did you start up the road raven to escape she answered before she had time to think she sighed and relaxed against his shoulder when he didnt demand an explanation music was always something i could hold onto it was constant dependable i needed something that was wholly mine she turned her head a bit to study his profile why did you for most of the same reasons i suppose i had something to say and i wanted people to remember i said it she laughed and you were so radical at the start of your career such pounding demanding songs you were musics bad boy for some time ive mellowed he told her fire hot didnt sound mellow to me she commented wasnt that the lead cut on your last album he grinned glancing down at her briefly i have to keep my hand in it was number one on the charts for ten consecutive weeks she pointed out that isnt bad for mellow thats right he agreed as if hed just remembered it knocked off a little number of yours didnt it it was kind of a sweet little arrangement as i recall maybe a bit heavy on the strings but she gave him an enthusiastic punch on the arm raven brand complained mildly you shouldnt distract me when im driving that sweet little arrangement went platinum i said it was sweet he reminded her and the lyrics werent bad a bit sentimental maybe but i like sentimental lyrics she told him giving him another jab on the arm not every song has to be a blistering social commentary of course not he agreed reasonably theres always room for cute little ditties cute little ditties raven repeated hardly aware that they had fallen back into one of their oldest habits by debating each others work just because i dont go in for showboating or lyrical trickery she began but when he swung off to the side of the road she narrowed her eyes at him what are you doing pulling over before you punch me again he grinned and flicked a finger down her nose showboating showboating she repeated what else do you call that guitar and piano duel at the end of fire hot a classy way to fade out a song he returned and though she agreed with him raven made a sound of derision i dont need the gadgetry my songs are overly sentimental she lifted a haughty brow if you feel my music is overly sentimental and cute how do you imagine well work together perfectly he told her well balance each other raven just as we always did were going to have terrible fights she predicted yes i imagine we will and she added failing to suppress a smile you wont always win good then the fights wont be boring he pulled her to him and when she resisted he cradled her head on his shoulder again look he q he felt flowing from her she was unresisting as ordered pointing out the window why is it cities open and warm as a shaft of sunlight her body was always look better at night from above yearning toward him melting irresistibly she raven looked down on the glittering los angeles thought his hand burned through the thin fabric of skyline i suppose its the mystique it makes her dress and set fire to her naked skin it had been you wonder whats going on and you cant see how so long she thought dizzily so long since she had fast its moving up here its quiet she felt his lips felt anything this intensely needed anything this brush her temple brandon she drew away but desperately her whole being tuned itself to him he stopped her raven his mouth was against her ear her dont pull away from me raven it was a throat the hollow of her cheek oh god i want low murmured request that shot heat up her spine you the kiss was urgent now his hands no longer dont pull away from me gentle so long he said echoing her earlier his head lowered slowly and his lips nibbled at thought its been so long come back with me hers hardly touching but the hand at the back of let me take you back with me to the hotel stay her neck was firm he kept her facing him while he with me tonight changed the angle of the kiss his lips were persua passion flooded her senses his tongue trailed sive seductive he kissed the soft dewy skin of her over her warmed skin until he came again to her cheeks the fragile closed eyelids the scented hair mouth then he took possession the heat was at her temple she could feel herself floating building strangling the breath in her throat suffocating her toward him as she always had losing herself to there was a fierce tug of war between him fear and desire she began to struggle her lips parted so that when his returned he no she took deep gulps of air dont found them inviting him to explore the kiss deepened brand took her by the shoulders and with one but slowly as if he savored the taste of her quick jerk had her face turned back up to his on his tongue her hand slid up his chest until she why he demanded roughly you want me i held him and their bodies touched he murmured can feel it something then pressed his mouth against the no she shook her head and her hands trembled curve of her neck her scent rose and enveloped as she pushed at his chest i dont i cant him raven tried to deepen her breathing to steady it she moaned when he took her breast a sound of youre hurting me brandon please let me go both hunger and protest his mouth came back to slowly he relaxed his fingers then released her hers plunqiering now as he responded to the need the same old story he murmured turning away from her he carefully drew out a cigarette and lit it you still give until im halfway mad then pull away from me he took a long deep drag i should have been better prepared for it youre not fair i didnt start this i never wanted you wanted he tossed back furiously damn it raven you wanted ive had enough women to know when im holding one who wants me she stiffened against the ache that was speeding through her youre better off with one of your many women brandon i told you i wouldnt fall at your feet this time and i meant it if we can have a professional relationship fine she swallowed and straightened the hair his fingers had so recently caressed if you cant work with things on that level then youd best find another partner i have the one i want he tossed his cigarette through the open window well play it your way for a while raven were both professionals and we both know what this musicals going to do for our careers he started the engine ill take you home chapter raven hated to be late for a party but there was no help for it her schedule was drum tight if it hadnt been important that she be there to rub elbows with lauren chase and a few other principals from the cast and crew of fantasy shed have bowed out there were only two days left before the start of her tour the truth was raven had forgotten about the party rehearsals had run over then she had found herself driving into beverly hills to window shop she hadnt wanted to buy anything but had simply wanted to do something mindless for weeks there had been nothing but demand after demand and she could look forward only to more of the same in the weeks to come she would steal a few hours she didnt want to think about her mother and the clean white sanitarium or song lists and cues or her confusion over brand as she browsed through the measures at neimanmarcus and gucci she looked at everything and bought nothing pniving home she was met by a huge handwritten note from julie tacked on her bedroom door party at steve jaretts i knowyou forgot important get your glad rags together babe and go out with lorenzo for dinner we ll see you there j raven swore briefly rebelled then capitulated before she stalked to the closet to choose an outfit an hour later she was cruising fast through the hollywood hills it was important that she be there steve jarett was directing fantasy he was at the moment the silver screens boy wonder having just directed three major successes in a row raven wanted fantasy to be his fourth as much as he did the party would be crowded she mused and looked wistfully at the open starstudded sky and noisy abruptly she laughed at herself since when did a noisy crowded party become a trial by fire there had been a time when she had enjoyed them and there was no denying that the people who haunted these parties were fascinating and full of incredible stories raven could still be intrigued it was just that she sighed allowing herself to admit the real reason she had dragged her feet brandon would be there he was bound to be would he bring a date she wondered why wouldn the she answered herself shortly downshifting as she took a curve unless he decided to wait and take his pick from the women there raven sighed again seeing the blaze of lights that told her she was approaching jarett s house it was ridiculous to allow herself to get tied up in knots over something that had ended years before her headlights caught the dull gleam of sturdy iron gates and she slowed the guard took her name checked his list then admitted her she could hear the music before she was halfway up the curving palmlined drive there was a whitejacketed teenager waiting to hand her out of the lamborghini he was probably a struggling actor or an aspiring screenwriter or cinematographer raven thought as she smiled at him hi im late do you think i can slip in without anybody noticing i dont think so ms williams not looking like that raven lifted her brows surprised that he had recognized her so quickly in the dim light but even if he had missed the face and hair she realized he would never have mistaken the voice thats a compliment isnt it she asked yes maam he said so warmly that she laughed well im going to do my best anyway i dont like entrances unless theyre on stage she studied the sprawling white brick mansion there must be a side door around to the left he pointed theres a set of glass doors that lead into the library go through and turn left you should be able to slip in without being noticed thanks she went to take a bill out of her purse discovered she had left it in the car and in the window to retrieve it after a moments search she found a twenty and handed it to him thank yon raven he enthused as she turned away then he called to her ms williams raven turned back with a halfsmile would you sign it for me she tossed back her hair the bill yeah she laughed and shook her head a fat lot of good it would do you then here she dug into her bag again and came up with a slip of paper one side was scrawled on a list of groceries julie had given her a few weeks before but the other side was blank whats your name she demanded sam sam rheinhart here sam rheinhart she said dashing off a quick line on the paper she gave him the autograph he stared after her the twenty in one hand and the grocery list in the other as she rushed off raven found the glass doors without trouble they were closed the sounds of the party q out back listening to a very loud rock band and drifting around by the pool she stayed in the shadows she wore an anklelength skirt and a dolmansleeve pullover in a dark plum color with silver metallic threads running through which cap there q she gave herself a moment to adjust to the darkness before groping her way to the door there was no one in the hall immediately out leaned q gravitated slowly toward the focus of noise why raven it was carly devers a tiny blond fluff of an actress with a littlegirl voice and a rapier sharp talent though they generally moved you were here hi carly they exchanged obligatory brushes of the cheek congratulations are in order arent they i heard you were being signed as second lead in fantasy its still in the working stage but it looks like it its a gem of a part and of course working with steve is the thing to do these days as she spoke she gave raven a piercing look with her baby blue eyes you look fabulous she said raven knew she meant it and of course congratulations are yes im excited about doing the score came clearly through there were groups of people lured the moonlight entering through the library side pleased with herself raven stepped out and in different circles raven liked her i didnt know in order for you as well arent they carly tilted her head and a smile spread over her face i was thinking more about brand car though stairs than the score darling ravens smile faded instantly oops carlys smile only widened still tender there was no malice in her amusement she linked her arm with ravens id keep your little collaboration very tight this time around raven im tempted to make a play for him myself and i guarantee im not alone what happened to dirk wagner raven reminded herself to play it light as they dsew closer to the laughter and murmurs of the party old news darling do try to keep up carly laughed a tinkling bell of a sound that raven could not help but respond to still i dont make it a habit to tread on someone elses territory no signs posted carly raven said carelessly hmm carly tossed back a lock of silverblond hair a waiter passed by with a tray of glasses and she neatly plucked off two ive heard hes a marvelous lover she commented her eyes bright and direct on ravens raven returned the look equably and accepted the offered champagne have you but then i imagine thats old news too touche carly murmured into her glass is brandon here she asked trying to prove to herself and her companion that the conversation meant nothing here and there carly said ambiguously i havent decided whether hes been trying to avoid the flocks of females that crawl around him or if hes seeking them out he doesnt give away much does he raven uttered a noncommittal sound and shrugged it was time she decided to change the subject have you seen steve i suppose i should fight my way through and say hello it was a typical enough party raven decided clothes ranged from rive gauche to salvation army there was a steady drum beat from the band by the pool underlying the talk and laughter the doors to the terrace were open wide lening out the clouds of smoke and allowing the warm were ablaze with colored lights raven was more interested in the people but gave the room itself a night air to circulate freely the expansive lawns quick survey it was decorated stunningly in whitewalls slashed here and there raven decided it was gorgeous and that she couldnt have lived in it in a million years shed never be able to put her feet furniture rugswith a few vivid green accents up on the elegant freeform glass coffee table she went back to the people her eyes sought out julie with her handsome italian millionaire she spotted wayne with one of i decided that the rumors that he would design the his bonethin models hanging on his arm raven costumes for fantasy must be true there were a others raven recognized producers two major stars whom she had watched countless times in by face and reputation a screenwriter she had met i darkened theaters a choreographer she knew only before socially and several others whom she knew casually or not at all she and carly were both drawn into the vortex of the party there were dozens of greetings to exchange along with handkissing and cheekbrushing before raven could begin to inch her way back toward the eciges she was always more comfortable with one or two people at a time than with a crowd unless shewas onstage at a touch on her arm she turned and found herself facing her host well hello raven smiled appreciating the chance for a teteqtete hi i was afraid you werent going to make it raven realized she shouldnt have been surprised that he had noticed her absence in the crowds of people steve jarett noticed everything he was a small slight man with a pale intense face and dark beard who looked ten years younger than his thirtyseven years he was considered a perfectionist often a pain when shooting but the maker of beautiful films he had a reputation for patience enough to cause him to shoot a scene over and over and over again until he got precisely what he wanted five years before he had stunned the industry with a lowbudget sleeper that had become the unchallenged hit of the year his first film had received an oscar and had opened all the doors that had previously been firmly shut in his face steve jarett held the keys now and knew exactly which ones to use he held both of her hands and studied her face it was he who had insisted on brand carstairs as the writer of the original score for fantasy and he who had approved the choice of raven williams as collaborator fantasy was his first musical and he wasnt going to make any mistakes laurens here he said at length have you met her no id like to id like you to get a real fee for her ive copies of all of her films and records you might study them before you begin work on the score ravens brow rose i dont think ive missed any of her movies but ill watch them again she is the core of the story he beamed suddenly unexpectedly exactly and you know jack ladd yes weve worked together before you couldnt have picked a better joe im making him work off ten pounds jarett said plucking a canape from a tray he has some very unflattering things to say about me at the moment but hes taking off the ten pounds raven observed jarett grinned ounce by ounce we go to the same gym i keep reminding him joes a struggling writer not a fulfilled hedonist raven gave a low gurgling laugh and popped a bite of cheese into her mouth overweight or not youre assembling a remarkable team i dont know how you managed to wrangle larry keaston into choreographing hes been retired for five years bribes and perseverance jarett said easily glancing over to where the trim whitehaired for mum dancer lounged in a pearlcolored armchair im talking him into doing a cameo he grinned at raven again hes pretending dignified reluctance but hes dying to get in front of the cameras again if you can even get him to do a time step on film youll have the biggest coup of the decade raven observed and shook her head and hed do it she thought he has the touch hes a big fan of yours jarett remarked and watched ravens eyes widen of mine youre joking i am not he gave raven a curious look he wants to meet you raven stared at jarett then again at larry keaston such things never ceased to amaze her how many times as a child had she watched his movies on fuzzy black and white tv sets in cramped rooms while she had waited for her mother to come home you dont have to ask me twice she told jarrett she linked her arm in his time passed quickly as raven began enjoying herself she talked at length with larry keaston and discovered her girlhood idol to be personable and witty he spoke in a string of expletives delivered in his posh boston accent though she spoke briefly with jack ladd she had yet to meet lauren chase when she spotted wayne drinking quietly in a corner all alone she asked as she joined him observing the masses my dear he told her sipping lightly from his whiskey and soda its amazing how intelligent people will insist on clothing themselves in inappropriate costumes observe lela maning he suggested tilting his head toward a towering brunette in a narrow pink minidress i have no idea why a woman would care to wear a place mat in public raven suppressed a giggle she has very nice legs yes all five feet of them he swerved his line of vision then of course theres marshall peters whos trying to start a new trend chest hair and red satin raven followed the direction of his gaze and this time did giggle not everyone has your savoire faire wayne qof course not he agreed readily and took out one of his imported cigarettes but surely taste i like the way youve dressed your latest proi tqgqe raven commented nodding toward the thin model speaking to a current hot property in the television series game the model was draped in cob webby black and gold filigree lace i swear wayne she cant be more than eighteen what do you find to talk about he gave raven one of his long sarcastic looks are you being droll darling she laughed in spite of herself not intentionally he gave her a pat on the cheek and lifted his glass again i notice julie has her latest conquest with her a latin type with cheekbones i shoes raven said vaguely letting her eyes drift around the room they rested in disbelief on a girl dressed in skintight leather pants and a spangled sweat shirt who wore heartshaped glasses over heavily kohldarkened eyes knowing wayne would be horrified she started to call his attention to her when she spotted brand across the room his eyes were already on hers raven realized with a jolt that he had been watching her for some time it had been at just such a party that they had first met with noise and laughter and music all around them their eyes had found each others then also it had been ravens first hollywood party and she had been unashamedly overwhelmed there had been people there whom she had known only as voices over the radio or faces on the screen she had come alone then too but in that case it had been a mistake she hadnt yet learned how to dodge and twist she remembered she had been cornered by an actor though oddly she couldnt recall his name or his face she hadnt had the experience to deal with him and was slowly being backed against the wall when her eyes had met brands raven remembered how he had been watching her then too rather lazily a halfsmile on his mouth he must have seen the desperation in her eyes because his smile had widened before he had started to weave his way through the crowd toward her with perfect aplomb brand had slid between raven and the actor then had draped his arm over her shoulders miss me he had asked and he had kissed her people outside who want to meet you he had shot the actor an apologetic glance excuse us propelled raven through the groups of people and lightly before she could respond therere some before another word could be exchanged he had out to a terrace she could still remember the scent of orange blossoms that had drifted from an orchard nearby and the silver sprinkle of moonlight of course raven had recognized him and had been flustered she had managed to regain her on the flagstone poise by the time they were alone in the shadows on the terrace she had brushed a hand through her hair and smiled at him thanks youre welcome it had been the first time he had studied her in his direct quiet fashion she could still remember the sensation of gentle intru i get some coffee yes the agreement had sprung from her lips before she had given it a moments thought good lets go brand had held out his hand sion youre not quite what i expected no raven hadnt known exactly how to take that no hed smiled at her would you like to go after a brief hesitation raven had put hers into it it had been as simple as that raven raven she was tossed back into the present by the j sound of waynes voice and his hand on her arm yes what blandly raven looked up at him your thoughts are written all over your face he murmured not a wise move in a room full of curious people taking a fresh glass of champagne from a tray he handed it to her drink up she was grateful for something to do with her hands and took the glass i was just thinking she said inadequately then made a sound of frustration at waynes dry look so she tried another tactic it seems well be working on the same project old home week he said with a crooked grin she shot him a direct look were professionals she stated aware that they both knew whom she was speaking of and friends he asked touching a finger to her cheek raven inclined her head we might be im a friendly sort of person hmm wayne glanced over her shoulder and watched brand approach at least he knows how to dress he murmured approving of brands casual but perfectly cut slatecolored slacks and jacket but are you sure cornwalls necessary couldnt you try sausalito raven laughed is there anything you dont know i certainly hope not hello brand nice to see you again raven turned smiling easily the jolt of the memory had passed hello brandon raven his eyes stayed on her face you havent met lauren chase with an effort raven shifted her eyes from his no she smiled and looked at the woman at his side lauren chase was a slender wisp of a woman with a thick mane of dark chestnut hair and seagreen eyes there was something ethereal about her perhaps raven thought it was that pale almost translucent skin or the way she had of walking as though her feet barely touched the ground she had a strong mouth that folded itself in at the corners and a long slender neck that she adorned with gold chains raven knew she was well into her thirties and decided she looked it this was a woman who neednt rely on dewy youth for her beauty she had been married twice the first divorce had become an qexplosive affair that had received a great deal of ugly press her second marriage was now seven years old and had produced two children raven recalled there was little written about lauren chases current personal life obviously she had learned to guard her privacy brand tells me youre going to put the heart in the music laurens voice was full and rich thats quite a responsibility raven shot brand a glance generally brand considers my lyrics on the sentimental side often i consider him a cynic i good lauren smiled then we should have a score with some meat in it steves given me final word on my own numbers raven lifted a brow she wasnt altogether certain if this had been a warning or a passing remark then i suppose we should keep you up to date on our progress she said agreeably by mail and phone lauren said slanting a glance at brand since youre traipsing off halfway around the world to write artistic temperament brand said easily no question he has it raven assured her you should know i suppose lauren lifted a shoulder abruptly she fixed raven with a sharp straight look i want a lot out of this score this is the one ive been waiting for it was both a challenge and a demand raven met the look with a slow nod lauren chase was she decided the perfect tessa youll get it lauren touched her upper lip with the tip of her tongue and smiled again yes i do believe i will at that well she said turning to wayne and linking her arm through his why dont you buy me a drink and tell me about the fabulous costumes youre going to design for me raven watched them move away that she murmured toying with the stem of her glass is a woman who knows what she wants and she wants an oscar brand remarked ravens eyes came back to his youll remember shes been nominated three times and edged out three times shes determined it isnt going to happen again he smiled then fingering the dangling amethyst raven wore at her ear wouldnt you like to bag one yourself thats funny id forgotten we could she let the thought play in her mind it sounds good but wed better get the thing written before we dream up an acceptance speech howre rehearsals going good very good she sipped absently at her champagne the bands tight you leave for vegas soon dont you yes did you come alone she glanced back at him confused for a moment here why yes i was late because id forgotten about it altogether but julie left me a note did she introduce you to lorenzo no we havent crossed paths tonight as she had began to search the crowd for julie brand took her chin to bring her eyes back to his will you let me take you home her expression shifted from startled to wary i have my car brandon that isnt an answer raven felt herself being drawn in and struggled it wouldnt be a good idea wouldnt it she sensed the sarcasm before he smiled bent down and kissed her it was a light toucha tease a promise or a challenge you could be right he touched her earring again and set it swinging ill see you in a few weeks he said with a friendly grin then turned and merged back into the crowd raven stared after him hardly realizing she had touched her lips with her tongue to seek his taste chapter the theater was dark and quiet the sound of ravens footsteps echoed amplified by the excellent acoustics very soon the quiet would be shattered by stagehands grips electricians all the many backstage people who would put together the essential and hardly noticed details of the show voices would bounce mingling with hammering and other sounds of wood and metal the noise would have a hollow empty tone almost like her footsteps but it was an important sound an appealing sound which raven had always enjoyed but she enjoyed the quiet too and often found herself roaming an empty theater long before she was needed for rehearsals hours before the fans started to line up outside the main doors the press would be there then with their everlasting eternal questions and raven wasnt feeling too chummy with the press at the moment already shed seen a half dozen different stories about herself and brandonspeculation about their pending collaboration on fantasy and rehashes of their former relationship old pictures had been dredged up and reprinted old questions were being asked again each time it was like bumping the same bruise twice a week she put through a call to the fieldmore clinic and held almost identical conversations with karter twice a week he transferred her to her mothers room though she knew it was foolish raven began to believe all the promises again all the tearful vows she began to hope without the demands of the tour to keep her occupied and exhausted she knew she would have been an emotional wreck not for the first time in her life she blessed her luck and her voice mounting the stage raven turned to face an imaginary audience the rows of seats seemed to roll back like a sea but she knew how to navigate it had known from the first moment of her first concert she was an innate performer just as her voice was natural and untrained the hesitation the uncertainty she felt now had to do with the woman not the singer the song had hovered in her mind but she still paused and considered before bringing it into play memories she felt could be dangerous things but she needed to prove something to herself so she sang her voice lifted drifting to the far corners of the theater her only accompaniment was her imagination through the clouds and the rain you were there and the sun came through to find us overly sentimental she hadnt thought so when the words had been written now raven sang what she hadnt sung in years two minutes and forty three seconds that bound her and brand together whenever it had played on the radio she had switched it off and never though the requests had been many had she ever incorporated it in an album or in a concert she sang it now as a kind of test remembering the drifting almost aching harmony of her own low tones combined with brands clean cool voice she needed to be able to face the memory of working with him if she was to face the reality of doing so the tour had reached its halfway point there were only two weeks remaining it didnt hurt the way she had been afraid it would there was no sharp slap across the face there was more of a warm ache almost pleasant almost sexual she remembered te last time she had been in brands arms in the quiet car in the hills above la ive never heard you sing that caught offguard raven swung around to stage right her hand flying in quick panic to her throat oh marc on a laugh she let out a long breath you scared the wits out of me i didnt know anyone was here i didnt want you to stop ive only heard the cut you and carstairs made of that he came forward now out of the shadows and she saw he had an acoustic guitar slung over his shoulder it was typical she rarely saw him without an instrument in his hands or close by ive always thought it was too bad you never used it again its one of your best but i guess you didnt want to sing it with anyone else raven looked at him with genuine surprise of course that had been the essential reason but she hadnt realized it herself until that moment no i guess i didnt she smiled at him i guess i still dont did you come here to practice i called your room julie said youd probably be here he walked to her and since there were no chairs he sat on the floor raven sat with him she crossed her legs in the duncolored trousers and let her hair fall over the soft shoulders of her topaz angora sweater she was relaxed with him ready to talk or jam like any musician raven smiled at marc as he went through a quick complicated lick im glad you came by sometimes i have to get the feel of the theater before a performance they all begin to run together at this part of a tour raven closed her eyes and tilted her head shaking her hair back where are we kansas city god i hate the thought of getting back on that airplane shuttle here shuttle there it always hits me like this at the halfway point in a couple of days ill have my second wind marc let her ramble while he played quick quiet runs on the guitar he watched her hands as they lay still on her knees they were very narrow and although they were tanned golden brown they remained fragile there was a light tracing of blue vein just under the skin the nails were not long but wellshaped and painted in some clear hardening polish with a blush of pink there were no rings because they were motionless he knew she was relaxed whatever nerves he had sensed when he had first spoken to her were stilled now its been going well i think she continued the glass house is a terrific warmup act and the bands tight even though we lost kelly the new bass is good dont you think knows his stuff marc said briefly raven grinned and reached over to tug his beard qo do you she said let me try agreeably marc slipped the strap over his head then handed raven his guitar she was a better than average player although she took a great deal of ribbing from the musicians in her troupe whenever she attempted the guitar periodically she threatened them with a bogus plan to incorporate her semiskillful playing into the act still she liked to make music with the six strings it soothed her there was something intimate about holding an instrument close feeling its vibrations against your own body after hitting the same wrong note twice raven sighed then wrinkled her nose at marcs grin im out of practice she claimed handing him back his gibson good excuse its probably out of tune he ran quickly up and down the scales nope you might be kind and lie she changed position putting her feet flat on the floor and lacing her hands over her knees its a good thing youre a musician youd have made a lousy politician too much traveling he said as his fingers began to move again he liked the sound of her laughter as it echoed around the empty theater oh youre right how can anyone remain sane going from city to city day after day and musics such a stable business too sturdy as a crap table youve a gift for analogy she told him watching the skill of his fingers on the strings i love to watch you play she continued its so effortless when brandon was first teaching me i but the words trailed off marc glanced up at her face but his fingers never faltered iit was difficult she went on wondering what had made her bring up the matter because he was lefthanded and naturally his guitar was too he bought me one of my own but watching him i had to learn backwards she laughed pleased with the memory absently she lifted a hand to toy with the thick dangling staff of her earring maybe thats why i play the way i do im always having to twist it around in my head before it can get to my fingers she lapsed into silence while marc continued to play it was soothing and somehow intimate with the two of them alone in the huge empty theater but his music didnt sound lonely as it echoed she began to sing with it quietly as though they were at home seated on a rug with the walls close and comforting around them it was true that the tour had tired her and that the midway point had her feeling drained but the interlude here was lifting her though in a different way than the audience would lift her that night this wasnt the quick dizzying high that shot endurance back into her for the time she was on stage and in the lights this was a steadying hand like a good nights sleep or a homecooked meal she smiled at marc when the song was over and said again im glad you came he looked at her and for once his hands were silent on the strings how long have i been with you raven she thought back to when marc had first become a semiregular part of her troupe fourfour and a half years five this summer he corrected it wasin august and you were rehearsing for your second tour you had on baggy white pants and a tshirt with a rainbow on it you were barefoot you had a lost look in your eyes carstairs had gone back to england about a month before raven stared at him she had never heard him make such a long speech isnt it strange that you would remember what i was wearing it doesnt sound very impressive i remember because i fell in love with you on the spot oh marc she searched for something to say and found nothing instead she reached up and took his hand she knew he meant exactly what he said once or twice ive come close to asking you to live with me raven let out a quick breath why didnt you because it would have hurt you to have said no and it would have hurt me to hear it he laid the guitar across his lap and leaning over it kissed her i didnt know she murmured pressing both of his hands to her cheeks i should have iin sorry youve never gotten him out of your head raven its damn frustrating competing with a memory marc squeezed her hands a moment then released them its also safe i kneur youd never make a commitment to me so i could avoid making one to you he shrugged his wellmuscled shoulders i think it always scared me that you were the kind of woman who would make a man give everything because you asked for nothing her brows drew together am i you need someone who can stand up to you id never have been able to id never have been able to say no or shout at you or make crazy love lifes nothing without things like that and wed have ended up hurting each other she tilted her head and studied him why are you telling me all this now because i realized when i watched you singing that ill always love you but ill never have you and if i did id lose something very special he reached across to touch her hair a fantasy that warms you on cold nights and makes you feel young again when youre old sometimes might havebe ens can be very precious raven didnt know whether to smile or to cry i havent hurt you no he said so simply she knew he spoke the truth youve made me feel good have i made you uncomfortable no she smiled at him youve made me feel good he grinned then rose and held out a hand to her lets go get some coffee brand changed into jeans in his dressing room it was after two in the morning but he was wide awake still riding on energy left over from his last show hed go out he decided and put some of it to use at the blackjack table he could grab eddie or one of the other guys from the band and cruise the casinos thered be women brand knew thered be a throng of them waiting for him when he left the privacy of his dressing room he could take his pick but he didnt want a woman he wanted a drink and some cards and some action anything to use up the adrenaline speeding through his system he reached for his shirt and the mirror reflected his naked torso it was tight and lean teetering on being thin but there were surprising cords of muscles in the arms and shoulders hed had to use them often when hed been a boy on the london streets he always wondered if it had been the piano lessons his mother had insisted on that had saved him from being another victim of the streets music had opened up something for him he hadnt been able to get enough learn enough it had been like food and he had been starving at fifteen brand had started his own band he was tough and cocky and talked his way into cheap little dives there had been women even then not just girls but women attracted by his youthful sexuality and arrogant confidence but theyd only been part of the adventure he had never given up though the living had been lean in the beersoaked taverns he had pulled his way up and made a local reputation for himself both his music and his personality were strong it had taken time he had been twenty when he had cut his first record and it had gone nowhere brand had recognized that its failure had been due to a combination of poor quality recording mismanagement and his own seeificare attitude he had taken a few steps back found a savvy manager worked hard on arrangements and talked himself into another recording session two years later he had bought his family a house in the london suburbs pushed his younger brother into a university and set off on his first american tour now at thirty there were times he felt hed and if i did id lose something very special he reached across to touch her hair a fantasy that warms you on cold nights and makes you feel young again when youre old sometimes might havebe ens can be very precious raven didnt know whether to smile or to cry i havent hurt you no he said so simply she knew he spoke the truth youve made me feel good have i made

arrangements and talked himself into another recording session two years later he had bought his family a house in the london suburbs pushed his younger brother into a university and set off on his first american tour now at thirty there were times he felt hed never been off the merrygoround half his life had been given over to his career and its demands he was tired of wandering brand wanted something to focus his life something to center it he knew he couldnt give up music but it wasnt enough by itself any more his family wasnt enough and neither was the money or the applause he knew what he wanted he had known five years before but there were times he didnt feel as sure of himself as he had when he had been a fifteenyearold punk talking his way past the back door of a thirdrate nightclub a capacity crowd had just paid thirty dollars a head to hear him and he knew he could afford to take every cent he made on that twoweek gig and throw it away on one roll of the dice he had an urge to do it he was restless reckless running on the same nerves he had felt the night hed taken raven home from their dinner date hed only seen her once after thatat steve jaretts house almost immediately afterward he had flown to las vegas to begin polishing his act it was catching up with him nowthe tension the anger the needs not for the first time brand wondered whether his unreasonable need for her would end if he could have her once just once with quick impatient movements he thrust the tail of his shirt into the waist of his jeans he knew better but there were times he wished it could be he left the dressing room looking for company for an hour brand sat at the blackjack table he lost a little won a little then lost it again his mind wasnt on the cards he had thought the noise the bright lights the rich smell of gambling was what he had wanted there was a thin intense woman beside him with a huge chunk of diamond on her finger and sapphires around her neck she drank and lost at the same steady rhythm across the table was a young couple he pegged as honeymooners the gold band on the girls finger looked brilliantly new and untested they were giddy with winning what brand figured was about thirty dollars there was something touching in their pleasure and in the soft exchanged looks all around them came the endless chinkitychink of the slots brand found himself as restless as he had been an hour before in his dressing room a halfempty glass of bourbon sat at his elbow but he left it as he rose he didnt want the casino and he felt an enormous surge of envy for the man who had his woman and thirty dollars worth of chips when he entered his suite it was dark and silent a sharp contrast to the world he had just left brand didnt bother hitting the switches as he made his way into the bedroom taking out a cigarette he sat on the bed before lighting it the flame made a sharp hiss and a brief flare he sat with the silence but the adrenaline still pumped finally he switched on the small bedside lamp and picked up the phone raven was deep in sleep but the ringing of the phone shot panic through her before she was fully awake her heart pounded in her throat before the mists could clear shed grown up with calls coming in the middle of the night she forgot where she was and fumbled for the phone with a sense of dread and anticipation yes hello raven i know i woke you im sorry she tried to shake away the fog brandon is something wrong are you all right yes imfine just unbelievably inconsiderate relaxing raven sank back on the pillows and tried to orient herself youre in vegas arent you the dim light told her it was nearing dawn he was two hours behind her or was it three she couldnt for the life of her remember what time zone she was in yes im in vegas through next week hows the show going it was typical of her he mused not to demand to know why the hell he had called her in the middle of the night she would simply accept that he needed to talk he drew on the cigarette and wished he could touch her better than my luck at the tables she laughed comfortably sleepy the connection was clean and sharp he didnt sound hundreds of miles away is it still blackjack im consistent he murmured hows kansas where he laughed pleasing her the audience was fantastic she continued letting her mind wander back to the show has been straight along thats the only thing that keeps you going on a tour like this will you be there in time for the show in new york id love you to hear the warmup act ill be there he laid back on the bed as some of the superfluous energy started to drain cornwall is sounding more and more appealing you sound tired i wasnt i am now raven she waited but he didnt speak yes i missed you i needed to hear your voice tell me what youre looking at he demanded what you see right now its dawn she told him or nearly i cant see any buildings just the sky its more mauve than gray and the lights very soft and thin she smiled it had been a long time since she had seen a day begin its really lovely brandon id forgotten will you be able to sleep again he had closed his eyes the fatigue was taking over yes but id rather go for a walk though i dont think julie would appreciate it if i asked her to come along brand pried off his shoes using the toe of one foot then the other go back to sleep and well walk on the cliffs one morning in cornwall i shouldnt have woken you no im glad you did she could hear the change the voice that had been sharp and alert was now heavy get some rest brandon ill look for you in new york all right good night raven he was asleep almost before he hung up fifteen hundred miles away raven laid her cheek on the pillow and watched the morning come i i chapter raven tried to be still while her hair was being twisted and knotted and groomed her dressing room was banked with flowers they had been arriving steadily for more than two hours and it was crowded with people a tiny little man with sharp black eyes touched up her blusher behind her occasionally muttering in french was the nimblefingered woman who did her hair wayne was there having business of his own here in new york hed told raven that hed come to see his designs in action and was even now in deep discussion with her dresser julie opened the door to another flower delivery have i packed everything you know should have told brandon to give me an extra day in town for shopping therere probably a dozen things i need raven turned in her seat and heard the swift french oath as her partially knotted hair flew from the womans fingers sorry marie julie did i pack a coat i might need one slipping the card from the latest arrangement of flowers she found it was from a successful television producer with whom shed worked on her last tv special theyre from max theres a party tonight why dont you go she handed the card to julie and allowed her lip liner to be straightened by the finicky makeup artist yes you packed a coat your suede which you could need this early in the spring and several sweaters julie added distractedly checking her list and maybe i will i cant believe this is it the last show its been a good tour hasnt it julie raven turned her head and winced at the sharp tug on her hair i cant remember you ever getting a better response or deserving one more and were all glad its over raven finished for her im going to sleep for a week julie found space for the flowers then continued to check off things in her notebook not everyone has your constant flow of energy i love playing new york she said tucking up her legs to the despair of her hairdresser you must hold still marie if i hold still much longer im going to explode raven smiled at the makeup artist as he fussed around her face you always know just what to do it looks perfect i feel beautiful recognizing the signal julie began nudging people from the room eventually they went and soon only julie and wayne were left the room quieted considerably now the walls hummed gently with the vibrations of the warmup act raven let out a deep sigh ill be so glad to have my face and body and hair back she said and sprawled in the chair you should have seen what he made me put all over my face this morning what was it wayne asked absently as he smoothed the hem of one of her costumes green she told him and shuddered he laughed and turned to julie what are you going to do when this one takes off to the moors cruise the greek islands and recuperate she pushed absently at the small of her back ive already booked passage on the ninth these tours are brutal listen to her raven sniffed and peered at herself critically in the glass shes the one whos held the whip and chair for four weeks he certainly makes me look exotic doesnt he she wrinkled her nose and spoiled the effect into costume julie commanded see orders orders obediently raven rose here wayne lifted the red and silver dress from the hanger since i nudged your dresser along ill be your minion oh good thanks she stepped oqit of her robe and into the dress you know wayne she continued as he zipped her up you were right about the black number it gets a tremendous response i never know if theyre applauding me or the costume after that set have i ever let you down he demanded as he tucked a pleat no she turned her head to smile at him over her shoulder never will you miss me tragically he kissed her ear there was a brief brisk knock at the door ten minutes ms williams she took a long breath are you going to go out front ill stay back with julie he glanced over at her lifting a brow in question yes thanks here raven dont forget these wonderfully gaudy earrings she watched raven fasten one really wayne theyre enough to make me shudder but theyre fabulous with that i dress naturally she laughed shaking her head the mans ego she said to raven never ceases to amaze me as long as it doesnt outdistance the talent he put in suavely new york audiences are tough raven spoke quickly her voice jumping suddenly with nerves and excitement they scare me to death i thought you said you loved playing new york wayne took out a cigarette and offered one to julie i do especially at the end of a tour it keeps you sharp theyre really going to know if im not giving them everything how do i look the dress is sensational wayne decided youll do some help you are lets go julie urged youll miss your cue i never miss my cue raven fussed with the second earring stalling hed said hed be here she told herself why isnt he he could have gotten the time mixed up or he could be caught in traffic or he could simply have forgotten that hed promised to be here for the show the quick knock came again five minutes ms williams raven julies voice was a warning yes yes all right she turned and gave them both a flippant smile tell me im wonderful when its over even if i wasnt i want to end the tour feeling marvelous then she was dashing for the door and hurrying down the hall where the sounds of the warmup band were no longer gentle now they shook the walls ms williams ms williams raven she turned breaking the concentration shed been building and looked at the harried stage manager he thrust a white rose into her hand just came back for you raven took the bud and lifted it wanting to fill herself with the scent she needed no note or message to tell her it was from brand for a moment she simply dreamed over it raven the warmup act had finished the transition to her own band would take place on the darkened stage quickly youre going to miss your cue no im not she gave the worried stage manager a kiss forgetful of her carefully applied lipstick twirling the rose between her fingers she took it with her they were introducing her as she reached the wings big buildup dont let the audience cool down they were already cheering for her thirty seconds take a breath her band hit her introduction music crashed through the cheers one two three she ran out diving into a wave of applause the first set was hot and fast staged to keep the audience up and wanting more she seemed to be a ball of flame with hundreds of colored lights flashing around her raven knew how to play to them play with them and she pumped all her energy into a routine she had done virtually every night for four weeks enthusiasm and verve kept it fresh it was hot under the lights but she didnt notice she was wrapping herself in the audience in the music the costume sizzled and sparked her voice smoked it was a demanding forty minutes and when she rushed offstage during an instrumental break she had less than three minutes in which to change costumes now she was in white a brief shimmering top covered with bugle beads matched with thin harem pants the pace would slow a bit giving the audience time to catch their breath the balance was in ballads the slow trembling ones she did best the lighting was muted soft and moody it was during a break between songs when she traditionally talked to the audience that someone in the audience spotted brand in their midst soon more people knew and while raven went on unaware of the disturbance the crowd soon became vocal shielding her eyes she could just make out the center of the commotion then she saw him it seemed they wanted him up on stage raven was a good judge of moods and knew the value of showmanship if she didnt invite brand on stage shed lose the crowd they had already taken the choice out of her hands brandon raven spoke softly into the mike but her voice carried though she couldnt see his eyes with the spotlight in her own she knew he was looking at her if you come up and sing she told him lightly we might get you a refund on your ticket she knew hed grin at that there was an excited rush of applause and cheers as he rose and came to the stage he was all in black trim wellcut slacks and a casual polo sweater the contrast was striking as he stood beside her it might have been planned smiling at her he spoke softly out of the range of the microphone im sorry raven i should have gone backstage i wanted to watch you from out front she tilted her head it was she discovered more wonderful to see him than she had imagined youre the one being put to work what would you like to do before he could answer the demand sprang from the crowd once the idea formed it was shouted over and over with growing enthusiasm ravens smile faded clouds and rain brand took her wrist and lifted the rose she held you remember the words dont you it was a challenge a stagehand rushed out with a hand mike for brand my band dqesnt know it she began i know it marc shifted his guitar and watched them the crowd was still shouting when he gave the opening chords well follow you brand kept his hand on ravens wrist and lifted his own mike raven knew how it needed to be sung face to face eye to eye it was a caress of a song meant for lovers the audience was silent now their harmony was close intricate raven had once thought it must be like making love their voices flowed into each other and she forgot the audience forgot the stage and for a moment forgot the five years there was more intimacy in singing with him than she had ever allowed in any other aspect of their relationship here she could not resist him when he sang to her it was as if he told her there wasnt anyone else had never been anyone else it was more moving than a kiss more sexual than a touch when they finished their voices hung a moment locked together brand saw her lips tremble before he brought her close and took them they might have been on an island rather than on stage spotlighted for thousands she didnt hear the tumultuous applause the cheers the shouting of their names her arms went around him one hand holding the mike the other the rose cameras flashed like fireworks but she was trapped in a velvet darkness she lost all sense of time her lips might have moved on his for hours or days or only seconds but when he drew her away she felt a keener sense of loss than any she had ever known before brand saw the confusion in her eyes the dazed desire and smiled youre better than you ever were raven he kissed her hand too bad about those sentimental numbers you keep sticking into the act her brows rose try to boost your flagging career by letting you sing with me and you insult me her balance was returning as they took a couple of elaborate bows hands linked lets see if you can carry the rest on your own love ive warmed them back up for you he kissed her again but lightly now on the cheek before he waved to the audience and strolled offstage left raven grinned at his back then turned to her audience too bad he never made it isnt it raven should have been wrung dry after the two hours were over but she wasnt shed given them three encores and though they clamored for more brand caught her hand as she hesitated in the wings theyll keep you out there all night raven he could feel the speed of her pulse under his fingers because he knew how draining two hours onstage could be he urged her back down the hall toward her dressing room there were crowds of people jammed in together in the hallway congratulating her touching her now and then a reporter managed to elbow through to shoot out a question she answered and brandon tossed off remarks with quick charm while steering her determinedly toward her dressing room once inside he locked the door i think they liked me she said gravely then laughed and spun away from him i feel so good her eyes lit on the bucket of ice that cradled a bottle champagne i thought youd need to console yourself after a flop like that brand moved over and drew out the bottle youll have to open the door soon and see people do try to put on a cheerful front love ill do my best the cork popped and the white froth fizzed a bit over the mouth of the bottle brand poured two glasses to the rim and handed her one i meant it raven he touched his glass to hers you were never better raven smiled bringing the glass to her lips again he felt the painful thrust of desire carefully branti took the glass from her then set both it and his own down again theres something i didnt finish out there tonight she was unprepared even though he drew her close slowly and took his time bringing his mouth to hers raven wasnt ready it was a long deep kiss that mingled with the champagne his mouth was warm on hers seeking his hands ran over her hips snugly encased in the thin black jumpsuit but she could sense he was under very tight control his tongue made a thorough lengthy journey through the moist recesses of her mouth and she responded in kind but he wanted her to do more than give he wasted her to want more and she did feeling the pull of need the flash of passion she could feel the texture of his long clever fingers through the sheer material of her costume then flesh to flesh as he brought them up to caress the back of her neck her head was swimming with a myriad of sensations excitement and power still clinging from her performance the heady heavy scent of mixed flowers which crowded the air the firm press of his body against her and desire more complex more insistent than she had been prepared for brandon she murmured against his lips she wanted him wanted him desperately and was afraid brand drew her away then carefully studied her face her eyes were like thin glass over her emotions youre beautiful raven one of the most beautiful women i know she was unsteady and tried to find her balance without clinging to him she stepped back resting her hand on the table that held their glasses one of the most she challenged lifting her champagne i know a lot of women he grinned as he lifted his own glass why dont you take that stuff off your face so i can see you do you know how long i had to sit still while he troweled this stuff on moving to the dressing table she scooped up a generous glob of cold cream her blood was beginning to settle its supposed to make me glamorous and alluring she slathered it on you make me nervous when youre glamorous and youd be alluring in a paper sack she lifted her eyes to his in the mirror his expression was surprisingly serious i think that was a compliment she smeared the white cream generously over her face and grinned am i alluring now brand grinned back then slowly let his eyes roam down her back to focus on her snugly clad bottom raven dont fish the answer is obvious she began to tissue off the cream and with it the stage makeup brandon it was good to sing with you again after removing the last of the cream from her face raven toyed with the stem of her champagne glass i always felt very special when i sang with you i still do he watched her chew for a moment on her bottom lip as if she was unsure about what she should say i imagine theyll play up that duet in the papers theyll probably make something else out of it especiallyespecially with the way we ended it i like the way we ended it brand came over and laid his hands on her shoulders it should always be ended that way he kissed the back of her neck while his eyes smiled into hers in the glass are you worried about the press raven no of course not but brandon do you know he interrupted brushing the hair away from her neck with the back of his hand no one else calls me that but my mother strange he bent nuzzling his lips into the sensitive curve of her neck you affect me in an entirely different way brandon when i was a boy he continued moving his lips up to her ear and she called me brandon i knew that was it whatever crime id committed had been found out justice was about to strike i imagine you committed quite a few crimes she forced herself to speak lightly when she would have moved away he turned her around to face him too many to count he leaned to her but instead of the kiss she expected and prepared for he caught her bottom lip between his teeth she clutched at his shirt as she struggled for breath and balance their eyes were open and on each others but his face dimmed then faded as passion clouded her vision brand released her then gave her a quick kiss on the nose raven ran a hand through her hair trying to steady herself he was tossing her back and forth too swiftly too easily do you want to change before we let anyone in he asked when she would focus again raven saw he was drinking champagne and watching her there was an odd look on his face as if she thought he were a boxer checking for weaknesses looking for openings i yes raven brought herself back yes i think i would but she glanced around the dressing room i dont know what i did with my clothes he laughed and the look was gone from his face relieved raven laughed with him they began to search through the flowers and sparkling costumes for her jeans and tennis shoes chapter it was late when they arrived at the airport raven was still riding on postperformance energy and chattered about everything that came into her head she looked up at a halfmoon as she and brand transferred from limo to plane the private jet wasnt what she had been expecting and studying the comfortably lush interior of the main cabin helped to allay the fatigue of yet one more flight it was carpeted with a thick pewtercolored shag and contained deep leather chairs and a wide plush sofa there was a padded bar at one end and a doorway at the other which she discovered led into a tidy galley you didnt have this before she commented as she poked her head into another room and found the bath complete with tub i bought it about three years ago brand sprawled on the sofa and watched her as she explored she looked different than she had a short time before her face was naked now and he found he preferred it that way makeup seemed to needlessly gloss over her natural beauty she wore faded jeans and sneakers which she immediately pried off her feet an oversized yellow sweater left her shapeless it made him want to run his hands under it and find her do you still hate to fly raven gave him a rueful grin yes youd think after all this time id have gotten over it but she continued to roam the cabin not yet able to settle if she had to raven felt she could give the entire performance again she had enough energy strap in brand suggested smiling at the quick nervous gestures well get started then you wont even know youre in the air you dont know how many times ive heard that one still she did as he said and waited calmly enough while he told the pilot they were ready in a few minutes they were airborne and she was able to unstrap and roam again i know the feeling brand commented watching her she turned in silent question its as though you still have one last burst of energy to get rid of its the way i felt that night in vegas when i called and woke you up she caught back her hair with both hands i feel i should jog for a few miles it might settle me down how about some coffee yes she wandered over to a porthole and pressed her nose against it it was black as pitch outside the glass yes coffee would be nice then you can tell me what marvelous ideas you have forming for the score youve probably got dozens of them a few she heard the clatter of cups i imagine youve some of your own a few she said and he chuckled turning away from the dark window she saw him leaning against the opening between the galley and the main cabin how soon do you think well start to fight soon enough lets wait at least until were settled into the house is julie going back to la or have you tied up all your loose ends there a shadow crossed her face raven thought of the one brief visit she had paid to her mother since the start of the tour they had had a days layover in chicago and she had used the spare time to make the impossible flight to the coast and back there had been the inevitable interview with karter and a brief emotional visit with her mother raven had been relieved to see that the cast had gone from her mothers skin and that there was more flesh to her face there had been apologies and promises and tears just as there always were raven thought wearily and as she always did she had begun to believe them again i never seem to completely tie up the loose ends she murmured will you tell me whats wrong she shook her head she couldnt bear to dwell on unhappiness now no nothing nothing really the kettle sang out and she smiled your cue she told him he studied her for a moment while the kettle spit peevishly behind him then turning he went back into the galley to fix the coffee black he asked and she gave an absent assent sitting on the sofa raven let her head fall back while the energy began to subside it was almost as if she could feel it draining brand recognized the signs as soon as he came back into the room he set down her mug of coffee then sipped thoughtfully from his own as he watched her sensing him raven slowly opened her eyes there was silence for a moment her body and her mind were growing lethargic what are you doing she murmured remembering her lids shuttered down concealing her eyes and their expression dont he drank again letting his eyes continue their slow measured journey over her its a bit much to ask me not to remember raven isnt it it was a question that expected no answer and she gave it none but her lids fluttered up again he didnt have her full trust nor did he believe he had ever had it that was the root of their problems he studied her while he stood and drank his coffee there was high natural color in her cheeks and her eyes were dark and sleepy she sat as was her habit with her legs crossed under her and her hands on her knees in contrast to the relaxed position her fingers moqqed restlessly i still want you you know that dont you again raven left his question unanswered but he saw the pulse in her throat begin to thump when she spoke her voice was calm were going to work together brandon its best not to complicate things qhe laughed not in mockery but in genuine amusement she watched his eyes lose their brooding intensity and light by all means lets keep things simple after draining his coffee he walked over and sat beside her in a smooth practiced move he drew her against his side relax he told her annoyed when she resisted give me some credit i know how tired you are when are you going to trust me raven she tilted her head until she could see him her look was long and eloquent before she settled into the crook of his shoulder and let out a long sigh like a child she fell asleep quickly and like that of a child the sleep was deep for a long moment he stayed as he was raven curled against his side then he laid her down on the sofa watching as her hair drifted about her rising brand switched off the lights in the dark he settled into one of the deep cabin chairs and lit a cigarette time passed as he sat gazing out at a sprinkle of stars and listening to ravens soft steady breathing unable to resist he rose and moving to her laid down beside her she stirred when he brushed the hair from her cheek but only to snuggle closer to him over the raw yearning came a curiously sweet satisfaction he wrapped his arm around her felt her sigh then slept it was brand who awoke first as was his habit his mind and body came together quickly he laid still and allowed his eyes to grow accustomed to the darkness beside him curled against his chest raven slept on he could make out the curve of her face the pixie sharp features the rain straight fall of hair her leg was bent at the knee and had slipped between his she was soft and warm and tempting brand knew he had experience enough to arouse her into submission before she was fully awake she would be drowsy and disoriented the hazy gray of early dawn came upon them as he watched her he could make out her lashes now a long sweep of black that seemed to weigh her lids down he wanted her but not that way not the first time asleep she sighed and moved against him desire rippled along his skin carefully brand shifted away from her and rose in the kitchen he began to make coffee a glance at his watch and a little arithmetic told him theyd be landing soon he thought rather enthusiastically about breakfast the drive from the airport to his house would take some time he remembered an inn along the way where they could get a good meal and coffee better than the instant he was making hearing raven stir he came to the doorway and watched her wake up she moaned rolled over and unsuccessfully tried to bury her face her hand reached out for a pillow that wasnt there then slowly on a disgusted sigh she opened her eyes brand watched the stages as her eyes roamed the room first came disinterest then confusion then sleepy understanding good morning he ventured and she shifted her eyes to him without moving her head he was grinning at her and his greeting was undeniably cheerful she had a wary respect for cheerful risers coffee she managed and shut her eyes again in a minute the kettle was beginning to hiss behind him howd you sleep dragging her hands through her hair she made a courageous attempt to sit up the light was still gray but now brighter and she pressed her fingers against her eyes for a moment i dont know yet she mumbled from behind her hands ask me later the whistle blew and as brand disappeared back into the galley raven brought her knees up to her chest and buried her face against them she could hear him talking to her making bright meaningless conversation but her mind wasnt yet receptive she made no attempt to listen or to answer here love as raven cautiously raised her head brand held out a steaming mug have a bit then youll feel better she accepted with murmured thanks he sat down beside her ive a brother who wakes up ready to bite someonesanyone s head off its metabolism i suppose raven made a noncommittal sound and began to take tentative sips it was hot and strong for some moments there was silence as he drank his own creamcooled coffee and watched her when her cup was half empty she looked over and managed a rueful smile im sorry brandon im simply not at my best in the morning especially early in the morning she tilted her head so that she could see his watch made a brave stab at mathematics then gave up i dont suppose it matters what time it actually is she decided it takes one days to adjust to the change anyway a good meal will set you up he told her lazily sipping at his own coffee i read somewhere where drinking yeast and jogging cures jet lag but i ll take my chances with breakfast yeast raven grimaced into her mug then drained it i think sleeps a better cure piles of it the mists were clearing and she sho k back her hair i guess well be landing soon wont we less than an hour id say good the less time i spend awake on a plane the less time i have to think about being on one i slept like a rock with another sigh raven stretched her back letting her shoulders lift and fall with the movement i made poor company her system was starting to hum again though on slow speed you were tired over the rim of his cup he watched the subtle movements of her body beneath the oversized sweater it i turned off like a tap she admitted happens that way sometimes after a concert she lifted one shoulder in a quick shrug but i suppose well both be better today for the rest where with you raven closed her mouth on a yawn swallowed did you sleep and stared at him what i said i slept with you here on the couch like to snuggle she could see he was enjoying her dismayed shock his eyes were deep blue with amusement as q iiaill iull he lifted his cup again you had no right raven began i always fancied being the first man you slept qth he told her before draining his cup want ravens face flooded with color her eyes turned me more coffee dark and opaque she sprang up but brand managed to pluck the cup from her hand before she stood breathing hard watching him while he gave her his calm measuring stare dont flatter yourself she tossed out could hurl it across the room for a moment she you dont know how many men ive slept with very precisely he set down both coffee cups then looked back up at her youre as innocent as the day you were born raven youve barely been touched by a man much less been made love to her temper flared like a rocket you dont know anything about who ive been with in the last five years brandon she struggled to keep from shouting to keep her voice as calm and controlled as his its none of your business how many men ive slept with he lifted a brow watching her thoughtfully innocence isnt something to be ashamed of raven im not she stopped balling her fists you had no right to she swallowed and shook her head as fury and embarrassment raced through her while i was asleep she finished do what while you were asleep brandon demanded lazing back on the sofa ravish you his humor shimmered over the oldfashioned word and made her feel ridiculous i dont think youd have slept through it raven her voice shook with emotion dont laugh at me brandon then dont be such a fool he reached over to the table beside him for a cigarette then tapped the end of it against the surface without lighting it his eyes were fixed on hers and no longer amused i could have had you if id wanted to make no mistake about it you have colossal nerve brandon please remember that youre not privy to my sex life and that you wouldnt have had me because i dont want you i choose my own lovers she hadnt realized he could move so fast the indolent slouch on the sofa was gone in a flash he reached up seizing her wrist and in one swift move had yanked her down on her back trapping her body with his her gasp of surprise was swallowed as his weight pressed down on her never in all the time they had spent together past and present had raven seen him so angry an iron taste of fear rose in her throat she could only shake her head too terrified to struggle too stunned to move she had never suspected he possessed the capacity for violence she now read clearly on his face this was far different from the cold rage she had seen before and which she knew how to deal with his fingers bit into her wrist while his other hand came to circle her throat how far do you think ill push he demanded his voice was harsh and deep with the hint of ireland more pronounced her breathing was short and shallow with qear laying completely still she made no answer dont throw your imaginary string of lovers in my face or by god youll have a real one quickly enough whether you want me or not his fingers tightened slightly around her throat when the time comes i wont need to get q you drunk on champagne or on exhaustion to have you lie with me i could have you now this minute and after five minutes of struggle youd be more than willing his voice lowered trembling along her skin i know how to play you raven and dont you forget it his face was very close to hers their breathing mixed both swift and strained the only sound coming from the hum of the planes engines the fear in her eyes leaped out finally penetrating his q qy swearing brand pushed himself from her and rose her eyes stayed on his as she waited for what he would do next he stared at her then turned sharply away moving over to a porthole raven lay where she was not realizing she was massaging the wrist that throbbed from his fingers she watched him drag a hand through his hair i slept with you last night because i wanted to be close to you he took another long cleansing breath it was nothing more than that i never touched you it was an innocent and rather sweet way to spend the night he curled his fingers into a fist remembering the frantic flutter of her pulse under his hand when he had circled it around her throat it gave him no pleasure to know he had frightened her it never occurred to me that it would offend you like this i apologize raven covered her eyes with her hand as the tears began she swallowed sobs not wanting to give way to them guilt and shame washed over her as fear drained her reaction to brands simple affectionate gesture had been to slap his face it had been embarrassment she knew but more her own suppressed longing for him that had pushed her to react with anger and spiteful words shed tried to provoke him and had succeeded but more she knew now she had hurt him rising from the sofa she attempted to make amends though she walked over to stand behind him raven didnt touch him she couldnt bear the thought that he might stiffen away from her brandon im so sorry she dug her teeth into her bottom lip to keep her voice steady that was stupid of me and worse unkind im terribly ashamed of the way i acted i wanted to make you angry i was embarrassed i suppose and the words trailed off as she searched for some way to describe the way she had felt even now something inside her warmed and stirred at the knowledge that she had lain beside him sharing the intimacy of sleep raven heard him swear softly then he rubbed a hand over the back of his neck i baited you youre awfully good at it she said trying to make light of what had passed between them much better than i am i cant think about what im saying when im angry obviously neither can i look raven brand began and turned her eyes were huge swimming with restrained tears he broke off what he had been about to say and moved to the table for his cigarettes after lighting one he turned back to her im sorry i lost my temper its something i dont do often because its a nasty one and youve got a good aim with a punch raven and it reminded me of the last time we were together five years ago she felt her stomach tighten in defense i dont think either of us should dwell on that no he nodded slowly his eyes were calm again and considering raven knew he was poking into her brain not at the moment in any case we should get on with today he smiled and she felt each individual muscle in her body relax it seems we couldnt wait until we settled in before having a fight no she answered his smile but then ive always been impatient moving to him raven rose on her toes and pressed her lips lightly to his im really sorry brandon youve already apologized yes well just remember the next time itll be your turn to grovel brand tugged on her hair ill make some more coffee we should have time for one more cup before we have to strap in when he had gone into the galley raven stood where she was a moment the last time she thought five years ago she remembered it perfectly each word each hurt and she remembered that the balance of the fault then had also been hers theyd been alone hed wanted her she had wanted him then everything had gone wrong raven remembered how she had shouted at him near hysteria hed been patient then his patience had snapped though not in the way it had today then she remembered hed been cold horribly horribly cold comparing the two reactions raven realized she preferred the heat and violence to the icy disdain raven could bring the scene back with ease theyd been close and the desire had risen to warm her then it was furnace hot and she was smothering then shouting at him not to touch her shed told him she couldnt bear for him to touch her brand had taken her at her word and left her raven could easily remember the despair the regret and confusionand the love for him outweighing all else but when she had gone to find him the next morning he had already checked out of his hotel he had left california left her without a word and thered been no word from him in five years no word she mused but for the stories in every magazine in every newspaper no word but for the whispered comments at parties and in restaurants whenever she would walk in no word but for the constant questions the endless speculation in print as to why they were no longer an itemwhy brand carstairs had begun to collect women like trophies so she had forced him out of her mind her work her talent and her music had been used to fill the holes he had left in her life shed steadied herself and built a life with herself in control again that was for the best she had decided sharing the reins was dangerous and she mused glancing i toward the galley it would still be dangerous he would still be dangerous j quickly raven shook her head brandon was right she told herself it was time to concentrate on today they had work to do a score to write taking a deep breath she walked to the galley to help him with the coffee chapter raven fell instantly in love with the primitive countryside of cornwall she could accept this as the setting for arthurs camelot it was easy to imagine the clash of swords and the glint of armor the thundering gallop of swift horses spring was beginning to touch the moors the green blooms just now emerging here and there was the faintest touch of pink from wild blossoms a fine constant drizzling mist added to the romance there were houses cottages really with gardens beginning to thrive lawns were a tender thin green and she spotted the sassy yellow of daffodils and the sleepy blue of wood hyacinths brand drove south toward the coast and cliffs and lands end they had eaten a country breakfast of brown eggs thick bacon and oat cakes and had set off again in the little car brand had arranged to have waiting for them at the airport whats your house like brandon raven asked as she rummaged through her purse in search of something to use to secure her hair youve never told me anything about it he glanced at her bent head ill let you decide for yourself when you see it it wont be long now raven found two rubber bands of differing sizes and colors are you being mysterious or is this your way of avoiding telling me the roof leaks it might brand considered though i dont recall being dripped on the pengalleys would see to it theyre quite efficient about that sort of thing pengalleys raven began to braid her hair caretakers he told her theyve a cottage a mile or so off from the house they keep an eye on the place and she does a bit of housekeeping when im in residence he does the repairs pengalley she murmured rolling the name over on her tongue cornishmen tried and true brand remarked absently i know raven turned to him with a sudden smile shes short and a tqit stout not fat just solidly built with dark hair pulled back and a staunch rather disapproving face hes thinner and going gray and he tipples a bit from a flask when he thinks shes not looking brand quirked a brow and shot her another brief glance very clever just how did you manage it it had to be raven shrugged as she secured one braid and started on the next if any gothic novel ive ever read had a dab of truth in it are there any neighbors no one close by thats one of the reasons i bought it antisocial she asked smiling at him survival instinct brand corrected sometimes i have to get away from it or go mad then i can go back and slip into harness again and enjoy it its like recharging he felt her considering look and grinned i told you id mellowed yes she said slowly you did still watching him raven twisted the rubber band around the tip of the second braid yet youve still managed to put out quite a bit all the albums the double one last year all but five of the songs were yours exclusively and the songs you wrote for cal ripleythey were the best cuts on his album did you think so he asked you know they were she said letting the rubber band snap into place praise is good for the ego love youve had your share now she tossed both braids behind her back what i was getting at was that for someone whos so mellow youre astonishingly productive i do a lot of my writing here brand explained or at my place in ireland more here actually because ive family across the channel so theres visiting to be done if im there raven gave him a curious look i thought you still lived in london primarily but if ive serious work or simply need to be alone i come here ive family in london as well yes raven looked away again out into the misty landscape i suppose large families have disadvantages something in her tone made him glance over again but her face was averted he said nothing knowing from experience that any discussion of ravens family was taboo occasionally in the past i he had probed but she had always evaded him he knew that she had been an only child and had left home at seventeen out of curiosity brand had questioned julie julie knew all there was to know about raven he was certain but she had told him nothing it was yet another mystery about raven which alternately frustrated and attracted brand now he put the qiiestions in the back of his mind and continued smoothly well we wont be troubled by family or neighbors mrs pengalley righteously disapproves of show people and will keep a healthy distance show people raven repeated and turning back to him grinned have you been having orgies again brandon not for at least three months he assured her and swung onto a back road i told you id mellowed but she knows about actors and actresses you see because as mr pengalley tells me she makes it her business to read everything she can get her hands on about them and as for musicians rock musicians well he let the sentence trail off meaningfully and raven giggled shell think the worst i imagine she said cheerfully the worst brand cocked a brow at her that you and i are carrying on a hot illicit love affair is that the worst it sounds rather appealing to me raven colored and looked down at her hands you know what i meant brand took her hand kissing it lightly i know what you meant the laugh in his voice eased her embarrassment will it trouble you to be labeled a fallen woman ive been labeled a fallen woman for years she returned with a smile every time i pick up a magazine do you know how many affairs ive had with people ive never even spoken to celebrities are required to have overactive libidos he murmured its part of the job your press does yours credit she observed dryly brand nodded gravely ive always thought so i heard about a pool going around london last year they were betting on how many women id have in a threemonth period the british he explained will bet on anything raven allowed the silence to hang for a moment what number did you take twentyseven he told her then grinned i thought it best to be conservative she laughed enjoying him he would have done it too she reected there was enough of the cocky street kid left in him i dont think id better ask you if you won i wish you wouldnt he said as the car began to climb up a macadam drive raven saw the house it was three stories high formed of sober cornish stone with shutters of deep weathered green and a series of stout chimneys on the roof she could just make out thin puffs of smoke before they merged with the leadcolored sky oh brandon how like you she cried enchanted how like you to find something like this she was out of the car before he could answer it was then that she discovered the house had its back to the sea there were no rear doors she learned as she dashed quickly to the retaining wall on the left side the cliff sheared off too close to the back of the house to make one practical instead there were doors on the sides set deep in cornish stone raven could look down from the safety of a rteq waisthigh wall and watch the water foam and lash out at jagged clumps of rock far below the view sent a thrill of terror and delight through her the q sea roared below a smashing fury of sourq raven stood heedless of the chill drizzle and tried to take it all in its fabulous fabulous turning she lifted her face studying the house again against the stone in a great tangle of vines grew wild roses and honeysuckle they were greening not yet ready to bloom but she could already imagine their fragrance a rock garden had been added and among the tender green shoots was an occasional flash of color you might find the inside fabulous too brand ventured laughing when she turned her wet face to him and dry oh brandon dont be so unromantic she turned a slow circle until she faced the house again its like something out of wuthering heights he took her hand unromantic or not mate i want a bath a hot one and my tea that does have a nice sound to it she admitted but bung back as he pulled her to the door she thought the cliffs wonderfully jagged and fierce will we have scones i developed a taste for them when i toured england a couple years ago scones and clotted creamwhy does that have to sound so dreadful youll have to take that up with mrs pengalley brand began as he placed his hand on the knob it opened before he could apply any pressure mrs pengalley looked much as raven had jokingly described her she was indeed a sturdily built woman with dark hair sternly disciplined into a sensible bun she had dark sober eyes that passed briefly over raven took in the braids and damp clothing then rested on brandon without a flicker of expression good morning mr carstairs you made good time she said in a soft cornish burr hullo mrs pengalley its good to see you again this is ms williams wholl be staying with me her rooms ready sir good morning miss williams good morning mrs pengalley said raven a trifle daunted this she was sure was what was meant by a formidable woman i hope i havent put you to too much trouble theres been little to do mrs pengalleys dark eyes shifted to brand again there be fires laid and the pantrys stocked as you instructed ive done you a casserole for tonight youve qinly to heat it when youve a mind to eat mr pengalley laid in a good supply of wood the qqightsre cool and its been damp hell be bringing your bags in now we heard you drive thanks brand glanced over seeing that raven was already wandering around the room nere both in need of a hot bath and some tea en we should do well enough is there anything qu want in particular raven she glanced back over at the sound of her name she hadnt been attentive to the conversation im q what he smiled at her is there anything youd like before mrs pengalley sees to tea no raven smiled at the housekeeper im sure everythings lovely mrs pengalley inclined her head her body bending not an inch ill make your tea then as she swept from the room raven shot brand a telling glance he grinned and stretched his back you continually amaze me brandon she murmured then went back to her study of the room it was raved knew the room in which they would be doing most of their work over the next weeks a grand piano an old one which she discovered on a quick testing run had magnificent tone was set near a pair of narrow windows occasional rag rugs dotted the oakplanked door the drapes were creamcolored lace and obviously handworked two comfortable sofas both biscuitcoloured and a few chippendale tables completed the furniture a fire crackled in the large stone fireplace raven moved closer to examine the pictures on the mantel at a glance she could tell she was looking at brands family there was a teenage boy in a black q leather jacket whose features were the same as q brands though his dark hair was a bit longer and was as straight as ravens he wore the same cocky grin as his brother a woman was next raven thought her about twentyfive and astonishingly pretty with fair hair and slanted green eyes and a true english rose complexion for all the difference in coloring however the resemblance to brand was strong enough for raven to recognize his sister she was in another picture along with a blond man and two boys both boys had dark hair and the carstairs mischief gleaming in their eyes raven decided brands sister had her hands full raven studied the picture of brands parents for some time the tall thin frame had been passed down from his father but it seemed only one of the children had inherited his fair english looks raven judged it to be an old snapshottwenty perhaps twentyfive years old it had been painstakingly staged with the man and woman dead center standing straight in their sunday best the woman was dark and lovely the man looked a bit elfconscious and ill at ease having to pose but the woman beamed into the camera her eyes bespoke qmischief and her mouth a hint of the cockiness so qy recognized in her children qthere were more pictures family groups and did shots with brand in several of them the tairses were very much a family raven felt a stir of envy shaking it off she turned back to d and smiled s is quite a group she flicked her fingers d her toward the mantel youre the oldest t you i think i read that somewhere the mblance is remarkable weeney genes from my mothers side brand her looking beyond her shoulder at the crow duping of frames the only one they slipped up on a bit was alison he ran a hand through his damp hair and came to stand beside her let me take you upstairs love and get you settled in the grand tour can wait until were dry he slipped an arm around her im glad youre here raven ive never seen you with things that are mine before and hotel rooms no matter how luxurious are never home later lounging in a steaming tub raven thought over brands statement it was part of the business of being an entertainer to spend a great many nights in hotel rooms albeit luxury suites in their positions but they were hotel rooms nonetheless home was a place for between concerts and guest appearances and to her it had become increasingly important over the years it seemed the higher she rose the more she needed a solid base she realized it was the same with brand theyd both been on the road for several weeks he was home now and somehow raven knew already that she too would be at home there for all its age and size there was something comforting q in the house perhaps raven mused as she lazily soaped a leg its the age and size continuity was important to her as she felt shed had little of it in q her life and space was important for the same p reason raven had felt an instant affinity for the house she liked the muffled roar of the sea outside her window and the breathtaking view she liked the oldfashioned porcelain tub with the curved legs and the oval mahoganyframed mirror over the tiny pedestal sink rising from the tub she lifted a towel from the heated bar when she had dried herself she wrapped a thick buffcolored towel around her before letting down her hair the two braids fell from where she had pinned them atop of her head absently as she wandered back onto the bedroom she began to undo them her luggage still sat beside an old brass chest but she didnt give much thought to unpacking instead she walked to the window seat set in the youth wall and knelt on the padded cushion below her the sea hurled itself onto the rocks tossed up by the wind there was a sucking drawing sound before it crashed back onto the shingles and cliffs like the sky they were gray flqcept for where the waves crested in stiff white the rain drizzled still with small drops ing her window to trail lazily downward placing arms on the wide sill raven rested her chin on and lost herself in dreamy contemplation of scene below what a spectacular view this is look does your room face the sea like this kl could sit here watching it forever it has its points he agreed and came over to stand behind her he tucked his hands into his pockets i didnt know you had such a fondness for the sea yes always but ive never had a room where i felt right on top of it before im going to like hearing it at night she smiled over her shoulder at him is your house in ireland on the coast too no its more of a farm actually id like to take you there he ran his fingers through her hair finding it thick and soft and still faintly damp its a green weepy country and as appealing as this one in a different way thats your favorite isnt it raven smiled up at him even though you live in london and come here to do work its the place in ireland thats special he returned the smile if it wasnt that thered have been sweeneys and hardestys everywhere we looked id have taken you there my mothers family he explained are very friendly people if the score goes well perhaps we can take a bit of a vacation there when were done raven hesitated yes id like that good the smile turned into a grin and i like your dress puzzled raven followed his lowered glance stunned she gripped the towel at her breasts and scrambled to her feet i didnt realize id forgotten she could feel the color heating her cheeks brandon you might have said something i just did he pointed out his eyes skimmed down to her thighs very funny raven retorted and found herself smiling now why dont you clear out and let me change must you pity he hooked his hand over the towel where it met between her breasts the back of his fingers brushed the swell of her bosom i was just thinking i liked your outfit without touching her in any other way he brought his mouth down to hers you smell good he murmured then traced just the inside of her mouth with his tongue rains still in your hair a roaring louder than the sea began in her brain instinctually she was kissing him back meeting his tongue with hers stepping closer and rising on her toes though her response was quick and giving he kept the kiss light she sensed the hunger and the strength under tight control under the towel his finger swept over her nipple finding it taut with desire raven felt a strong unfamiliar ache between her thighs she moaned with it as each muscle in her body went lax he lifted his face and waited until her eyes opened shall i make love to you raven she stared at him aching with the churn of rising needs he was putting the decision in her hands she should have been grateful relieved yet at that moment she found she would have preferred it if he had simply swept her away for an instant she wanted no choice no voice but only to be taken youll have to be sure he told her quietly lifting her chin with his finger he smiled his eyes were a calm bluegreen ive no intention of making it easy for you he dropped his hand ill wait for you downstairs though i still think its a pity you have to change youre very attractive in a towel brandon she said when he was at the door he turned lifting a brow in acknowledgment what if id said yes raven grinned feeling a bit more steady with the distance between them wouldnt that have been a bit awkward with mrs pengalley still downstairs leaning against the door he said lazily raven if youd said yes i wouldnt give a damn if mrs pengalley and half the country were downstairs he shut the door carefully behind him both raven and brand were anxious to begin they started the day after their arrival and soon fell into an easy routine brand rose early and was usually finishing up a goodsized breakfast by the time raven dragged herself downstairs when she was fortified with coffee they started their morning stretch working until noon and mrs pengalleys arrival while the housekeeper brought in the days marketing and saw to whatever domestic chores needed to be seen to brand and raven would take long walks the days were balmy scented with sea spray and spring the land was rugged even harsh with patches of poor ground covered with heather not yet in bloom the pounding surf beat against towering granite cliffs hardy birds built their nests in the crags their cries could be heard over the crash of the waves standing high raven could see down to the village with its neat rows of cottages and white church spire theyd work again in the afternoon with the fire sizzling in the grate at their backs after dinner they went over the days work by the end of the week they had a loosely based outline for the score and the completed title song they didnt work without snags both raven and brand felt too strongly about music for any collaboration to run smoothly but the arguments seemed to stimulate both of them and the final product was the better for them they were a good team they remained friends brand made no further attempt to become ravens lover from time to time raven would catch him staring intently at her then she would feel the pull as sensual as a touch as tempting as a kiss the lack of pressure confused her and drew her more effectively than his advances would have advances could be refused avoided she knew he was waiting for her decision underneath the casualness the jokes and professional disagreements the air throbbed with tension the afternoon was long and a bit dreary a steady downpour of rain kept raven and brand from walking the cliffs their music floated through the house echoing in corners here and there and drifting to forgotten attics theyd built the fire high with mr pengalleys store of wood to chase away the dampness that seemed to seep through the windows a tray of tea and biscuits that they had both forgotten rested on one of the chippendale tables their argument was reaching its second stage weve got to bring up the tempo raven insisted it just doesnt work this way its a mood piece raven not a funeral dirge it drags this way brandon people are going to be nodding off before she finishes singing it nobody falls asleep while lauren chase is singing brand countered this number is pure sex raven and shell sell it yes she will raven agreed but not at this tempo she shifted on the piano bench so that she faced him more directly all right joes fallen asleep at the typewriter in the middle of the chapter hes writing hes already believing himself a little mad because of the vivid dreams hes having about his character tessa she seems too real and hes fallen in love with her even though he knows shes a product of his own imagination a character in a novel hes writing a fantasy and now in the middle of the day hes dreaming about her again and this time she promises to come to him that night i know the plot raven brand said dryly though she narrowed her eyes raven checked her temper she thought she detected some fatigue in his voice once or twice shed been awakened in the middle of the night by his playing nightfall is hot brandon youre right about it being pure sex and your lyrics are fabulous but it still needs to move it moves he took a last drag on his cigarette before crushing it out chase knows how to hang onto a note raven made a quick sound of frustration unfortunately he was usually right about such things his instincts were phenomenal this time however she was certain that her own instinctsas a songwriter and as a woman were keener she knew the way the song had to be sung to reap the full effect the moment she had read brands lyria she had known what was needed the song had flowed completed through her head i know she can hang onto a note and she can handle choreography shell be able to do both and still do the song at the right tempo let me show you she began to play the opening bars brand shrugged and rose from the bench raven moved the tempo to andante and sang to her own accompaniment her voice wrapped itself around the music brand moved to the window to watch the rain it was the song of a temptress full of implicit wild promises ravens voice flowed over the range of notes then heated when it was least expected until brand felt a tight knot of desire in the pit of his stomach there was something not quite earthy in the melody she had created the quicker tempo made a sharp contrast much more effective than the pace brand had wanted she ended abruptly in a raspy whisper without any fadeout she tossed her hair then shot him a look over her shoulder well there was a halfsmile on her face he had his back to her and kept his hands tucked into his pockets you have to be right now and again i suppose raven laughed spinning around on the bench until she faced the room youve a way with compliments brandon it sets my heart fluttering she doesnt have your range he murmured then making an impatient movement he wandered over to the teapot i dont think shell get as much out of the low scale as you do mmm raven shrugged as she watched him pour out a cup of tea shes got tremendous style though shell milk every ounce out of it he set the tea down again without touching it and roamed to the fire as she watched him a worried frown creased ravens brow brandon whats wrong he threw another log on the already roaring fire nothing just restless this rains depressing she rose to go to the window ive never minded it sometimes i like a dreary sleepy day i can be lazy without feeling guilty maybe thats what you should do brandon be lazy today youve got that marvelous chessboard in the library why dont you teach me to play she lifted her hands to his shoulders and feeling the tension began to knead absently of course that might be hard work julie gave up playing backgammon with me she says i havent any knack for strategy raven broke off when brand turned abruptly around and removed her hands from his shoulders without speaking he walked away from her he went to the liquor cabinet and drew out a bottle of bourbon raven watched as he poured three fingers into a glass and drank it down i dont think ive the patience for games this afternoon he told her as he poured a second drink all right brandon she said no games she walked over to stand in front of him keeping her eyes direct why are you angry with me certainly not because of the song the look held for several long moments while the fire popped and sizzled in the grate raven heard a log fall as the one beneath it gave way perhaps its time you and i talked brandon said as he idly swirled the remaining liquor in the glass its dangerous to leave things hanging for five years you never know when theyre going to fall raven felt a ripple of disquiet but nodded you may be right brand gave her a quick smile should we be civilized and sit down or take a few free swings standing up she shrugged i dont think theres any need to be civilized civilized fighting never clears the air all right he began but was interrupted by the peal of the bell setting down his glass brand shot her a last look then went to answer alone raven tried to control her jitters there was a storm brewing she knew and it wasnt outside the windows brand was itching for a fight and though the reason was unclear to her raven found herself very willing to oblige him the tension between them had been glossed over in the name of music and peace now despite her nerves she was looking forward to shattering the calm hearing his returning footsteps she walked back to the tea tray and picked up her cup package for you brand gestured with it as he came through the doorway from henderson i wonder what he could be sending me she murmured already ripping off the heavy packing tape oh of course she tossed the wrappings qlessly aside and studied the album jacket q qqeyre sample jackets for the album im releasing this summer without glancing at him raven qhanded brand one of the covers then turned tother to read the liner notes for the next few minutes brand studied the cover qture without speaking again a background of ste raven sitting in her habitual crosslegged qhion she was looking full into the camera with dy a tease of a smile on her lips her eyes were ry gray and very direct over her shoulders d down to her knees her hair spilleda sharp ptrast against the softfocused white of the background the arrangement appeared to be haphazard but had been cleverly posed nonetheless she appeared to be nude and the effect was fairly erotic did you approve this picture hmm raven pushed back her hair as she continued to read oh yes i looked over the proofs before i left on tour im still not completely sure about this song order but i suppose its a bit late to change it now i always felt henderson was above packaging you this way packaging me what way she asked absently as a virgin offering to the masses he handed her the cover brandon really how ridiculous i dont think so he said i think its an uncannily apt description virgin white soft focus and you sitting naked in the middle of it all im not naked she retorted indignantly i dont do nudes the potential buyer isnt supposed to know that though is he brand leaned against the piano and watched her through narrowed eyes its provocative certainly its meant to be raven frowned down at the cover again theres nothing wrong with that im not a child to be dressed up in mary jones and a pink pinafore brandon this is business theres nothing extreme about this cover and im more modestly covered than i would be on a public beach but not more decently he said coldly theres a difference color flooded her face now a mixture of annoyance and embarrassment its not indecent ive never posed for an indecent picture karl straighter is one of the finest photographers in the business he doesnt shoot indecent pictures one mans art is anothers porn i suppose her eyes widened as she lowered the jackets to the piano bench thats a disgusting thing to say she whispered youre being deliberately horrible im simply giving you any opinion he corrected lifting a brow you dont have to like it i dont need your opinion i dont need your approval no he said and crushed out his cigarette you bloody well dont do you but youre going to have it in any case he caught her by the arm when she would have turned away the power of the grip contrasted the cool tone and frosty eyes let go of me raven demanded putting her hand on top of his and trying unsuccessfully to pry it from her arm when im finished you have finished her voice was abruptly calm and she stopped her frantic attempts to free herself instead she faced him squarely emotion burning in her eyes i dont have to listen to you when you go out of your way to insult me brandon i wont listen to you you can prevent me from leaving because youre stronger than i am but you cant make me listen she swallowed but managed to keep her voice steady i run my own life youre entitled to your opinion certainly but youre not entitled to hurt me with it i dont want to talk to you now i just want you to let me go he was silent for so long raven thought he would refuse then slowly he loosened his grip until she could slip her arm from his fingers without a word she turned and left the room perhaps it was the strain of her argument with brand or the lash of rain against the windows or the sudden fury of thunder and lightning the dream formed out bf a vague montage of childhood remembrances that left her with impressions rather than vivid pictures thoughts and images floated and receded against the darkness of sleep there were rolling sensations of fear guilt despair one lapping over the other while she moaned and twisted beneath the sheets trying to force herself awake but she was trapped caught fast in the world just below consciousness then the thunder seemed to explode inside her head and the flash of lightning split the room with a swift white flash screaming raven sat up in bed the room was pitch dark again when brand rushed in he found his way to the bed by following the sounds of ravens wild weeping raven here love even as he reached her she threw herself into his arms and clung she was trembling hard and her skin was icy brand pulled the quilt up over her back and cuddled her dont cry love youre safe here he patted and stroked as he would for a child frightened of a storm itll soon be over hold me she pressed her face into his bare shoulder please just hold me her breathing was quick burning her throat as she struggled for air oh brandon such an awful dream he rocked and laid a light kiss on her temple what was it about the telling he recalled from childhood usually banished the fear shed left me alone again raven murmured shuddering so that he drew her closer in response the words came out as jumbled as her thoughts as tumbled as the dream how i hated being alone in that room the only light was from the building next doo was one of those red neon lights that blinks on and off on and off so that the dark was never still and so much noise out on the street even with the windows closed too hot too hot to sleep she murmured into his shoulder i watched the light and waited for her to come back she was drunk again she whimpered her fingers opening and closing against his chest and shed brought a man with her i put the pillow over my head so i wouldnt hear raven paused to steady her breath it was dark and quiet in brands arms outside the storm rose in high fury she fell down the steps and broke her arm so we moved but it was always the same dingy little rooms airless rooms that smelled always of gin no matter how you scrubbed thin walls walls that might as well not have existed for the privacy they gave you but she always promised that this time this time itd be different shed get a job and id go to school but always one day id come home and thered be a man and a bottle she wasnt clinging any longer but simply leaning against him as if all passion were spent lightning flared again but she remained still raven brand eased her gently away and tilted her face to his tears were still streaming from her eyes but her breathing was steadier he could barely make out the shape of her face in the dark where was your father he could see the shine of her eyes as she stared at him she made a soft quiet sound as one waking he knew the words had slipped from her while she had been vulnerable and unaware now she was aware but it was too late for defenses the sigh she made was an empty weary sound i dont know who he was slowly she drew out of brands arms and rose from the bed she didnt either you see there were so many brand said nothing but reached into the pocket of the jeans he had hastily dragged on and found a pack of matches striking one he lit the bedside candle the light wavered and flickered hardly more than a pulse beat in the dark how long he asked and shook out the match did you live like that raven dragged both hands through her hair then hugged herself she knew shed already said too much for evasions i dont remember a time she didnt drink but when i was very young five or six she still had some control over it she used to sing in clubs she had big dreams and an average voice but she was very lovely once pausing raven pressed her fingers against her eyes and wiped away tears by the time i was eight she was her problem was unmanageable and there were always men she needed men as much as she needed to drink some of them were better than others one of them took me to the zoo a couple of times she trailed off and turned away brand watched the candlelight flicker over the thin material of her nightgown she got steadily worse i think part of it was from the frustration of having her voice go of course she abused it dreadfully with smoking and drinking but the more it deteriorated the more she smoked and drank she ruined her voice and ruined her health and ruined any chance she had of making something of herself sometimes i hated her sometimes i know she hated herself a sob escaped but raven pushed it back and began to wander the room the movement seemed to make it easier and the words tumbled out quicker pressing for release shed cry and cling to me and beg me not to hate her shed promise the moon and more often than not id believe her this timethat was one of her favorite beginnings it still is raven let out a shaky sigh she loved me when she wasnt drinking and forgot me completely when she was it was like living with two different women and neither one of them was easy when she was sober she expected an average motheranddaughter relationship had i done my homework why was i five minutes late getting home from school when she was drunk i was supposed to keep the hell out of her way i remember once when i was twelve she went three months and sixteen days without a drink then i came home from school and found her passed out on the bed shed had an audition that afternoon for a gig at this twobit club later she told me shed just wanted one drink to calm her nerves just one raven shivered and hugged herself tighter its cold she murmured brand rose and stooped in front of the fire he added kindling and logs to the bed of coals in the grate raven walked to the window to watch the fury of the storm over the sea lightning still flashed sporadically but the violence of the thunder and the rain were dying there were so many other times she was working as a cocktail waitress in this little piano bar in houston i was sixteen then i always came by on payday so i could make certain she didnt spend the money before i bought food shed been pretty good then shed been working about six weeks straight and had an affair going with the manager he was one of the better ones i used to play around at the piano if the place was empty one of my mothers lovers had been a musician hed taught me the basics and said i had a good ear mama liked hearing me play her voice had quieted brand watched her trail a finger down the dark pane of window glass ben the manager asked me if i wanted to play during the lunch hour he said i could sing too as long as i kept it soft and didnt talk to the customers so i started raven sighed and ran a hand over her brow behind her came the pop and crackle of fqame we left houston for oklahoma city i lied about my age and got a job singing in a club it was one of mamas worst periods there were times i was afraid to leave her alone but she wasnt working then and she broke off with a sound of frustration and rubbed at an ache in her temple she wanted to stop wanted to block it all out but she knew she had come too far pressing her brow against the glass she waited until her thoughts came back into order we needed the money so i had to risk leaving her at night i suppose we exchanged roles for a time she murmured the thing i learned young but consistently forgot was that an alcoholic finds money for a bottle always no matter what one night during my second set she wove her way into the club wayne was working there and caught onto the situation quickly he managed to quiet her down before it got too ugly later he helped me get her home and into bed he was wonderful no lectures no pity no advice just support raven turned away from the window again and wandered to the fire but she came back again twice more and they let me go there were other towns other clubs but it was the same then and hardly matters now just before i turned eighteen i left her her voice trembled a bit and she took a moment to steady it i came home from work one night and she was passed out at the kitchen table with one of those halfgallon jugs of wine i knew if i didnt get away from her id go crazy so i put her to bed packed a bag left her all the money i could spare and walked out just like that she covered her face with her hands a moment pressing her fingers into her eyes it was like being able to breathe for the first time in my life raven roamed back to the kitchen she could see the vague ghost of her own reflection studying it listening to the steady but more peaceful drum of rain she continued i worked my way to la and henderson saw me he pushed me im not certain what my ambition was before i signed with him just to survive i think one day and then the next then there were contracts and recording sessions and the whole crazy circus doors started opening some of them were trap doors ive always thought she gave a quick wondering laugh god it was marvelous and scary and i dont believe i could ever go through those first few months again anyway henderson got me publicity and the first hit single got me more and then i got a call from a hospital in memphis raven turned and began to pace the light silk of her nightgown clung then swirled with her movements i had to go of course she was in pretty bad shape her latest lover had beaten her and stolen what little money she had she cried oh god all the same promises she was sorry she made no attempt to stop them as soon as she loved me never again never again i was the only decent thing shed ever done in her life the tears were beginning to flow again but this time raven could travel i brought her back with me julie had found a sanitarium in ojai and a very earnest young doctor justin randolf karter isnt that a marvelous name brandon bitterness spilled out would receive with the tears a marvelous name a remarkable man he took me into his tasteful leatherbound office and explained the treatment my mother r birling raven faced brand her shoulders wanted him to do it he told me not to set my all he must have found me cynical because he suggested several good organizations i could speak heaving with sobs i didnt want to know i just hopes too high and i told him i hadnt any hopes at to he reminded me that alcoholism is a disease and that my mother was a victim i said the hell she i had had to live with her and deal with her lies and i for him to be sanctimonious and understanding behind that tidy white coat and i hated her ithe was i was the victim raven forced the words out as she hugged herself tightly i was the victim i her sickness and her men it was so safe so easy sobs came in short quick jerks as she balled her hands and pressed them against her eyes and i loved her her breath trembled in and out as every thing she had pent up over the weeks of her mothers latest treatment poured through her i still love her she whispered weary nearly spent she turned to the fire resting her palms on the mantel dr karter let me shout at him then he sat with me when i broke down i went home and they started her treatment two days later i met you raven didnt hear him move didnt know he stood behind her until she felt his hands on her shoulders without speaking she turned and went into his arms brand held her feeling the light tremors while he stared down at the licking greedy flames outside the storm had become only a patter of rain against the windows raven if you had told me i might have been able to make things easier for you she shook her head then buried her face against his chest no i didnt want it to touch that part of my life i just wasnt strong enough taking a deep breath she pulled back far enough to look in his eyes i was afraid that if you knew you wouldnt want anything to do with me raven there was hurt as well as censure in his voice i know it was wrong brandon even stupid but you have to understand everything seemed to be happening to me at once i needed time i needed to sort out how i was going to live my life how i was going to deal with my career my mother everything her hands gripped his arms as she willed him to see through her eyes i was nobody one day and being mobbed by fans the next my picture was everywhere i heard myself every time i turned on the radio you know what thats like brand brushed her hair from her cheek yes i know what thats like as he spoke he could feel her relax with a little shudder before i could take a breath mama walked back into my life part of me hated her but instead of realizing that it was a normal reaction and dealing with it i felt an unreasonable guilt and i was ashamed no she shook her head anticipating him theres no use telling me i had no need to be thats an intellectual statement a practical statement it has nothing to do with emotion i dont expect you to understand that part of it youve never had to deal with it shes my mother it isnt possible to completely separate myself from that even knowing that the responsibility for her problem isnt mine raven gave him one last long look before turning away and on top of everything that was happening to me i fell in love with you the flames danced and snapped as she watched i loved you she murmured so quietly he strained to hear but i couldnt be your lover brand stared at her back started to reach for her then dropped his hands to his sides why only her head turned as she looked over her shoulder at him her face was in shadows because then i would be like her she whispered then turned away again you dont really believe that raven brand took her shoulders but she shook her head not answering firmly he turned her to face him making a slow thorough study of her do you make a habit of condemning children for their parents mistakes no but i you dont have the right to do it to yourself she shut her eyes on a sigh i know i know that but therere no buts on this one raven his fingers tightened until she opened her eyes again you know who you are there was only the sound of the sea and the rain and fire i wanted you she managed in a trembling voice when you held me touched me you were the first man id ever wanted she swallowed and again he felt the shudder course through her then id remember all those cramped little rooms all those men with my mother she broke off and would have turned away again if his hands hadnt held her still brand removed his hands from her arms then slowly his eyes still on hers he used them to frame her face sleeping with a stranger is different from making love with someone you care for raven moistened her lips yes i know that but do you the question stopped her she could do no more than let out a shaky breath let me show you raven her eyes were trapped by his she knew he would release her if she so much as shook her head fear was tiny pinpoints along her skin need was a i qrl q lqq llqq nlq i c q qqwq was qq qqcq vqvvuq n eu ner nan as to his wrists yes again brand gently brushed the hair away from her cheeks when her face was framed by his hands alone he lowered his head and kissed her eyes closed he could feel her trembling in his arms her hands still held his wrists and her fingers tightened when he brought his mouth to hers his was patient waiting until her lips softened and the kisses grew deeper but slowly now moister parted until she swayed against him his finger caressed his mouth roamed firelight flickered over them in reds and golds casting its own shadows raven could feel the heat from it through the silk she wore but it was the glow inside of her which built and qamed hot brand lowered his hands to her shoulders gently massagingqas he teased her lower lip with his teeth raven felt the gown slp down over her breasts then cling briefly to her hips before it drifted to the pc floor she started to protest but he demanded the kiss the thought spiraled away down the curve of her back over the slight flare of heq hips he ran his hands then he picked her up in his arms with her mind spinning she sank into the mattress when against hers jolted her bringing on a fresh surge of brand joined her the touch of his naked body doubts and fears brandon please i the words were muffled then died inside his mouth easily his hands caressed her stroking without hurry somewhere in the back of her mind she knew he held himself under tight control but her mind had relaxed and her limbs were heavy his mouth wandered to her throat tasting giving pleasure arousing by slow irresistible degrees he worked her nipple with his thumb and she moaned and moved against him brand allowed his mouth to journey downward laying light feathering kisses over the curve of her breast lightly very lightly he ran his tongue over the tip raven felt the heat between her thighs and tangling her fingers in his hair pressed him closer she arched and shuddered not from fear but from passion heat unlike anything she had ever known or imagined was building inside her she was still aware of the flicker of the fire and candlelight on her closed lids of the soft brush of linen sheets against her back of the faint pleasant smell of wood smoke but these sensations were dim while her being seemed focused on the liquefying touch of his tongue over her skin the feathery brush of his fingers on her thighs over the hiss of rain and fire she heard him murmur her name heard her own soft mindless response her breath quickened and her mouth grew hungry suddenly desperate she drew his face back to hers she wrapped her arms around him tightly as the pressure of the kiss pushed her head deep into the pillow brand lay across her flesh to flesh so that her breasts yielded to his chest raven could feel the light mat of his hair against her skin his hand lay on her stomach and drifted down as she moved under him there was a flash of panic as he slid between her thighs then her breath caught in a heady rush of pleasure he was still patient his fingers gentle and unhurried as they gradually increased her rhythm for raven there was no world beyond the fire lit room beyond the fourposter bed his mouth took hers his tongue probing deeply then moving to her ear her throat her neck and back to her lips all the while his hands and fingers were taking her past all thought past all reason then he was on top of her and she opened for him ready to give to receive she was too steeped in wonder to comprehend his strict unwavering control she knew only that she wanted him and urged him to take her there was a swift flash of pain dulled by a pleasure too acute to be measured she cried out but the sound was muffled against his mouth then all was lost on wave after wave of delight chapter with her head in the curve of brands shoulder raven watched the fire her hand lay over his heart she could feel its quick steady rhythm under her palm the room was quiet and outside the rain had slackened to a murmur raven knew she would remember this moment every time she lay listening to rain against windows brands arm was under her curled over her back with his hand loosely holding her arm since he had rolled from her and drawn her against his side he had been silent raven thought he slept and was content to lay with him watching the fire and listening to the rain she shifted her head wanting to look at him and found he was asleep she could see the sheen of his eyes as he stared at the ceiling raven lifted a hand to his cheek i thought you were asleep brand caught her hand and pressed it to his lips no i looking down at her he broke off then slowly brushed a tear from her lash with his thumb i hurt you no raveq shook her head for a moment she buried her face in the curve of his neck where she could feel his warmth smell his scent oh no you didnt hurt me you made me feel wonderful i feel free she looked up at him again and smiled does that sound foolish no brand ran his fingers through the length of her hair pushing it back when it would have hidden her face from him her skin was flushed in her eyes he could see the reflected flames from the fire youre so beautiful she smiled again and kissed him ive always thought the same about you he laughed drawing her closer have you she lay half across him heated flesh to heated flesh yes i always thought youd make a remarkably lovely girl and i see by your sisters picture that i was right he lifted a brow strange i never realized the direction of your thoughts perhaps its best i didnt raven gave one of her low rich chuckles and pressed her lips against the column of his throat she loved the way his tones could become suddenly suavely british im sure you make a much better man thats comforting he said dryly as he began to stroke her back under the circumstances his fingers lingered at her hip to caress im sure i like you much better this way raven kissed the side of his throat again working her way up to his ear under her breast she felt the sudden jump and scramble of his heartbeat brandon she sighed nuzzling his ear youre so good to me so kind so gentle she heard him groan before he rolled over reversing their positions his eyes were heated and intense and very green reminding her of the moment he had held her like this on the plane now again her pulse began to hammer but not with fear love isnt always kind raven he said roughly it isnt always gentle his mouth came down on hers crushingly urgently as all the restraints he had put on himself snapped there was no patience in him now only passion where before he had taken her up calmly easily now he took her plummeting at a desperate velocity her mouth felt bruised and tender from his yet she learned hunger incited hunger raven wanted more and still more so she caught him closer demanding possessing he took his hands over her so long she heard him mutter ive wanted you for so long then his teeth found the sensitive area of her neck and she heard nothing she plunged toward the heat and the dark brand felt her give and respond and demand he was nearly wild with need he wanted to touch all of her taste all of her he was as desperate as a starving man and as ruthless where before responding to her innocence he had been cautious now he took what he had wanted for too many years she was his as he had dreamed she would be soft and yielding then soft and hungry beneath him he could hear her moan feel the bite of her fingernails in his shoulders as he took his mouth down the curve of her breast the skin of her i stomach was smooth and quivered under his tongue he slipped a hand between her thighs and she strained against him so that he knew she was as desperate as he yet he wouldnt take her not yet he felt an impossible greed his tongue moved to follow the path of his hands all the years hed wanted her all the frustrated passion burst out catching them both in the explosion not knowing the paths raven went where he led her and learned that desire was deeper stronger than anything she had known possible i he was pulling her down down until the heat was too intense to bear but she wanted more his i hands were rough bruising her skin but she craved no gentleness she was steeped in passion i too deep for escape she called out for him desperately mindlessly for him to take her she knew there couldnt be more theyd gone past all the rules pleasure could not be sharper passion could not be darker than it was at that moment then he was inside her and everything that had gone before paled against the color and the heat his mouth was buried at her neck from far off he heard her gasps for breath merge with his own they moved together like lightning so that he could no longer think there was only raven all passion intensified concentrated until he thought he would go mad from it the pain of it shot through him then flowed from him leaving him weak they lay still with brand over her his face buried in her hair his breathing was ragged and he gave no thought to his weight as he relaxed completely beneath him raven shuddered again and again with the release of passion she gripped his shoulders tightly not wanting him to move not wanting to relinquish the unity if he had shown her the tenderness and compassion of loving the first time now he had shown her darker secrets a log fell in the grate scattering sparks against the screen brand lifted his head and looked down at her his eyes were heavy still smoldering as they lowered to her swollen mouth he placed a soft kiss on them then shifting his weight prepared to rise no dont go raven took his arm sitting up as he did only to bank the fire bringing her knees to her chest raven watched as brand stacked the fire for the night the light danced over his skin as she stared entranced the passion in the cool easygoing man was just as surprising but she knew the feel of it now just as q looked at her with the fire leaping at his back they studied each other both dazed by what had passed between them then he shook his head my god raven i want you again she held her arms out to him ravens eyes it was a warm red haze she allowed q q from his face because she didnt want to wake him not yet for the first time in her life she woke to look at her lovers face she felt a warm settled q q he had been faintly distressed to hear her say so the night before and i love him raven almost said the words aloud as she let herself think themive through the years in betweenand even more now q closed her eyes tight on the sudden fear that he could walk out of her life again no demands no ripple of muscles was surprising in one so lean she saw them in his shoulders his back his thighs the she knew the feel of the muscles he turned and there was a brilliant ribbon of sunlight across her lids to open slowly before turning to brand he slept still his breathing deep and even she had to suppress the urge to brush his hair away satisfaction he is beautiful she thought remembering how always loved him right from the beginning all that were together but my mistakes this time she pressures well just be together thats all i need she dropped her eyes to his mouth it had been tender in the night she remembered then hungry almost brutal she hadnt realized how badly he had wanted her or she him until the barriers had shattered five years five empty years raven pushed the thought away there was no yesterday no tomorrow only the present suddenly she smiled thinking of the enormous breakfasts he habitually ate she would usually stumble into the kitchen for coffee as he was cleaning off a plate cooking wasnt her best thing she mused but it would be fun to surprise him his arm was tossed around her waist holding her against him so that their bodies had warmed each other even in sleep carefully raven slipped out from under it padding to the closet she found a robe then left brand sleeping to go downstairs the kitchen was washed in sunlight raven went straight to the percolator first things first she decided strangely she was wide awake there was none of the drowsy fogginess she habitually used coffee to chase away she felt vital full of energy very much the way she felt when finishing a live concert she realized as she scooped out coffee perhaps there was a parallel raven fit the lid on the pot then plugged it in she had always felt that performing for an audience was a bit like making love sharing yourself opening your emotions pulling down the barriers thats what she had done with brand the thought made her smile and she was singing as she rummaged about for a frying pan upstairs brand stirred reached for her and found her gone he opened his eyes to see that the bed beside him was empty quickly he pushed himself up and scanned the room the fire was still burning it had been late when he had added the last logs the dr pcs were open to the full strength of the sun it spilled across the bed and onto the floor ravens nightgown lay where it had fallen the night before not a dream he told himself tugging a hand through his hair theyd been together last night again and again until every ounce of energy had been drained then they had slept stillholding each other still clinging his eyes drifted to the empty pillow beside him again but where where the devil is she now feeling a quick flutter of panic he rose tugged on his jeans and went to find i her before brand reached the bottom of the stairs her voice drifted to him every morning when i wake ill see your eyes and therell only be the love we make no more goodbyes he recognized the song as the one he had teased her about weeks before when they had sat in his car in the hills above los angeles the knot in his stomach untied itself he walked down the hall listening to the husky morning quality of her voice then paused in the doorway to watch her her movements suited the song she sang cheerful happy the kitchen was filled with morning noises and scents there was the popping rhythm of the percolator as the coffee bubbled on the burner the hiss and sizzle of the fat sausage she had frying in a castiron skillet the clatter of crockery as she searched for a platter her hair was streaming down her back still tumbled from the night while the short terry robe she wore rode high up on her thighs as she stretched to reach the top shelf of a cupboard raven stopped singing for a moment to swear goodnaturedly about her lack of height after managing to get a grip on the platter she lowered her heels back to the floor and turned she gave a gasp when she spotted brand dropped the fork she held and just managed to save the platter from following it brandon raven circled her throat with her hand a moment and took a deep breath you scared me i didnt hear you come down brand didnt answer her smile he didnt move but only moked at her i love you raven her eyes widened and her lips trembled open then shut again the words she reminded herself mean so many different things it was important not to take a simple statement and deepen its meaning raven kept her voice calm as she stooped to pick up the fork i love you too brandon he frowned at the top of her head then at her back as she turned away to the sink she turned on the tap to rinse off the fork you sound like my sister ive already two of those i dont need another raven took her time she turned off the tap composed her face into a smile then turned i dont think of you as a brother brandon the tension at the back of her neck made it difficult toy move calmly back to the cupboard for cups and saucers it isnt easy for me to tell you how i feel i needed your support your compassion you helped me last night more than i can say now you make me sound like a bloody doctor i said i love you raven there was a snap of anger in the words this time when raven turned back to him her eyes were eloquent brandon you dont have to feel obligated she broke off as his eyes flared storming into the room he flicked off the gas under the smoking sausage then yanked the percolator cord from the wall coffee continued to pop for a few moments then subsided weakly dont tell me what i have to do he shouted i know what i have to do he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her i have to love you its not an obligation its a fact its a demand its a terror brandon shut up he commanded he pulled her close trapping the dishes she held between them before he kissed her she tasted the desperation the temper dont tell me you love me in that calm steady voice brand lifted his head only to change the angle of the kiss his mouth was hard and insistent before it parted from her i need more than that from you raven much more than that his eyes blazed green into hers ill have more damn it brandon she was breathless dizzy then laughing this was no dream the cups digging a permanent hole in my chest please let me put the dishes down he said something fierce about the dishes but she managed to pull away from him enough to put them on the counter oh brandon immediately raven threw her arms around his neck you have more you have everything i was afraidand a fool to be afraidto tell you how much i love you she placed her hands on his cheeks holding his face away from hers so that he could read what was in her eyes i love you brandon quick and urgent their lips came together they clung still when he swept her up in his arms youll have to do without your coffee for a while he told her as she pressed a kiss to the curve of his neck she only murmured an assent as he began to carry her down the hall too far she whispered mmm the bedrooms much too far away brand turned his head to grin at her too far he agreed taking a sharp right into the music room entirely too far they sank together on a sofa hows this he slipped his hands beneath the robe to feel her skin weve always worked well together here raven laughed into his eyes running her fingers along the muscles of his shoulders it was real she thought triumphantly kissing him again the secret brand decided then dug his teeth playfully into her neck is a strong melody its nothing without the proper lyric music doesnt always need words he switched to the other side of her neck as his hand roamed to her breast no she agreed finding that her own hands refused to be still they journeyed down his back and up again but harmonytwo strong notes coming together and giving a bit to each other melding he murmured im big on melding he loosened the belt of her robe oh brandon she exclaimed suddenly remembering mrs pengalley shell be here soon this should certainly clinch her opinion of show people he decided as his mouth found her breast oh no brandon stop she laughed and moaned and struggled cant he said reasonably trailing his lips back up to her throat savage lust he explained and bit her ear uncontrollable besides he said as he kissed her then moved to her other ear its sunday her day off it is ravens mind was too clouded to recall trivial things like days of the week savage lust she repeated as he pushed the robe from her shoulders really absolutely shall i show you oh yes she whispered and brought his mouth back to hers please do a long time later raven sat on the hearth rug and watched brand stir up the fire she had reheated the coffee and brought it in along with the sausages brand had pulled a sweater on with his jeans but she still wore the short terry robe holding a coffee cup in both hands she yawned and thought that she had never felt so relaxed she felt like a cat sitting in her square of sunlight watching brand fix a log onto snapping flames he turned to find her smiling at him what are you thinking he stretched out on the floor beside her how happy i am she handed him his coffee leaning over to kiss him as he took it it all seemed so simple so right how happy he demanded he smiled at her over the rim of the cup oh somewhere between ecstatic and delirious i think she sought his hand with hers their fingers linked bordering on rapturous just bordering on brand asked with a sigh well well work on it he shook his head then kissed her hand do you know you nearly drove me mad in this room yesterday yesterday raven tossed her hair back over her shoulder with a jerk of her head what are you talking about i dont suppose youll ever realize just how arousing your voice is he mused as he sipped his coffee and studied her face that might be part of the reasonthat touch of innocence with a hell smoked voice i like that raven reached behind her to set down her empty cup the movement loosened the tie of her robe leaving it open to brush the curve of her breasts do you want one of these sausages theyre probably awful brand lifted his eyes from the smooth expanse of flesh that the shift of material had revealed he shook his head again and laughed you make them sound irresistible a starving man cant be picky she pointed out raven plucked one with her fingers and handed it over theyre probably greasy he lifted a brow at this but took a bite arent you going to have one no i know better than to eat my own cooking she handed him a napkin we could go out to eat use your imagination she suggested resting her hands on her knees pretend youve already eaten it always works for me my imagination isnt as good as yours brand finished off the sausage maybe if you tell me what ive had an enormous heap of scrambled eggs she decided narrowing her eyes five or six at least you really should watch your cholesterol and three pieces of toast with that dreadful marmalade you pile on you havent tried it he reminded her i imagined i did she explained patiently you also had five slices of bacon she put a bit of censure in her voice and he grinned ive a healthy morning appetite i dont see how you could eat another bite after all that coffee raven reached for the pot no i imagine ive had enough she laughed and leaning over linked her arms around his neck did i really drive you mad brandon she found the taste of her own power delicious and sweet yes he rubbed her nose with his first it was all but impossible to simply be in the same room with you wanting you as i did then that song he gave a quiet laugh then drew back to look at her music doesnt always soothe the savage breast and then that damn album jacket i had to be furious or id have thrown you down on the rug then and there he saw puzzlement then comprehension dawn in her eyes is that why you she stopped and the smile grew slowly raven tilted her head and ran the tip of her tongue over her teeth i suppose that now that youve had your way with me i wont drive you mad any more thats right he kissed her lightly i can take you or leave you brand set down his empty cup then ruffled her hair amused by her wry expression its noon he said with a glance at the clock wed best get to it if were going to get any work done today that novelty number we were toying with the one for the second female leadid an idea for that really raven unhooked her hands from behind his neck what sort of idea we might bounce up the beat a bit of early forties jive tempo you know itd be a good contrast to the rest of the score hmmm could be a good dance number i raven slipped her hands under his sweater and ran them up his naked chest she smiled gently at the look of surprise that flickered in his eyes we need a good dance number there thats what i was thinking brand murmured the move had surprised him and the light touch of her fingers sent a dull thud of desire hammering in his stomach he reached for her but she rose and moved to the piano like this then raven played a few bars of the melody they had worked with using the tempo he had suggested a little boogiewoogie yes he forced his attention to the bouncing repetitive beat but found his blood beating with it thats the idea she looked back over her shoulder and smiled at him then all we need are the lyrics she experimented a moment longer then went to the coffee pot cute and catchy raven drank smiling down at brand with a chorus any ideas yes she set down the cup i have some ideas raven sat down beside him facing him and thoughtfully brushed the hair back from his i forehead if theyre going to cast carly as it appears theyre going to do we need something to suit that babydoll voice of hers her songs should be a direct foil for laurens she pressed her lips lightly to his ear of course the chorus csuld carry the meat of it again she slipped a hand under his sweater letting her fingertips toy with the soft mat of hair on his chest she slid her eyes up to his what do you think brand took her arm and pulled her against him but she turned her head so that the kiss only brushed her cheek raven he said after a laughing moan but when she trailed her fingers down to his stomach she felt him suck in air again he moaned her name and crushed her against him raven tilted her head back for the kiss it was deep and desperate but when he would have urged her down she shifted so that her body covered his she buried her mouth at his neck and felt the pulse hammering against her lips her hands were still under his sweater so that she was aware of the heating of his skin he tugged at her robe but she only pressed harder against him lodging the fabric between them she nipped at the cord of his neck raven his voice was low and husky for gods sake let me touch you am i driving you mad brandon she murmured nearly delirious with her own power before he could answer she brought her lips to his and took her tongue deep into his mouth slowly she hiked up his sweater feeling the shudders of his skin as she worked it o qer his chest and shoulders even as she tossed it aside raven began journeying down his chest using her lips and tongue to taste him it was a new sensation for her the knowledge that he was as vulnerable to her as she was to him there was harmony between them and the mutual need to make the music real and full before he had guided her but now she was ready to experiment with her own skill she wanted to toy with tempos to take the lead she wanted to flow pianissimo savoring each touch each taste now it was her turn to teach him as he had taught her his skin was hot under her tongue he was moving beneath her but the first wave of desperation had passed into a drugged pleasure her fingers werent shy but rather sought curiously stroking over him to find what excited what pleased his taste was something she knew now she would starve without she could feel his fingers in her hair tightening as his passion built as she had the night before she sensed his control but now the challenge of breaking it excited her i his stomach was taut and tightened further when she glided over it she heard his breathing catch finding the snap to his jeans she undid it then began to tug them down over his hips the rhythm was gathering speed j then her mouth was on his ripping them both far beyond the gentle pace she had initiated she was suddenly starving trembling with the need pushing herself up raven let the robe fall from her s i shoulders her hair tumbled forward to drape her i breasts touch me her eyes were heavy but locked on his touch me now brands fingers tangled in her hair as they sought her flesh when she would have swayed back down to him he held her upright wanting to watch the pleasure and passion on her face her eyes were blurred with it the need built fast and was soon too great raven there was desperate demand in his voice as he took her hips she let him guide her then gave a sharp gasp of pleasure their bodies fused in a soaring rhythm completely tuned to each other raven shuddered from the impact then drained she lowered herself until she lay prone on him he brought his arms around her to hold her close as the two of them flowed from passion to contentment tangled with him fresh from loving in a room quiet and warm raven gave a long contented sigh brandon she murmured just wanting to hear the sound of his name hmm he stroked her hair seemingly lost somewhere in a world between sleep and wakefulness i never knew it could be like this neither did i raven shifted until she could look at his face but youve been with so many women she curled up at his side preparing to rest her head in the curve of his shoulder brand rose on his elbow then tilted her face up to his he studied her softly flushed cheeks the swollen mouth and drowsy eyes ive never been in love with my lover before he told her quietly for a moment there was silence then she smiled im glad i suppose ive never been sure of that until now be sure of it he kissed her hard and quick and possessively she settled against him again but shivered then laughed a few moments ago id have sworn id never be cold again grinning brand reached for her robe i seriously doubt well get any work done unless you get dressed in fact id suggest unattractive clothes after tugging her arms through the sleeves raven put her hands on his shoulders her eyes were light and full of mischief do i distract you brandon you might put it that way ill probably be tempted to try all the time now that i know i can raven kissed him then gave a quick shrug i wont be able to help myself ill hold you to that brand lifted a brow would you like to start now she gave his hair a sharp tug i dont think thats very flattering im going to go see about those unattractive clothes later he said pulling her back when she started to rise raven laughed again amazed with what she saw in his eyes brandon really later he said again and pressed her back gently to the floor chapter summer came to cornwall in stages cool mornings turned to warm afternoons that had bees humming outside the front windows the stinging chill of the nights mellowed the first scent of honeysuckle teased the air then the roses lush wild roses began to bloom and all through the weeks the countryside blossomed raven felt that she too was blooming she was loved throughout her life if anyone had asked her what one thing she wanted most raven would have answered to be loved she had starved for it as a child had hungered as an adolescent when she had been shuffled from town to town never given the opportunity to form lasting friendships and affections it was this need in part that had made her so successful as a performer raven was willing to let the audience love her she never felt herself beyond their reach when she stood in the spotlight and they knew st the love she had gained from her audiences had filled an enormous need it had filled her but had not satisfied her as much she discovered as brands love as the weeks passed she forgot the demands and responsibilities of the performer and became more and more in tune with the woman she had always known herself it had been important early that she grasp an identity but for the first time in her life raven focused on her womanhood she explored it discovered it enjoyed it brand was demanding as a lover not only in the physical sense but in an emotional one as well he wanted her body her heart her thoughts with no reservations his need for an absolute commitment was the only shadow in the summery passing of days raven found it impossible not to hold parts of herself in reserve shed been hurt and knew how devastating pain could be when you loved without guard her mother had broken her heart too many times to count with always a promise of happiness after the severest blow raven had learned to cope with that to guard against it to some extent she had loved brand before naively perhaps but totally when he had walked out of her life raven had thought she would never be whole again for five years she had insulated herself against the men who had touched her life they could be friendsloving friendsbut never loven the wounds had healed but the scar had been a constant reminder to be careful she had promised herself that no man would ever hurt her as brand carstairs had and raven discovered the vow she had made still held true he was the only man who would ever have the power to hurt her that realization was enough to both exhilarate and frighten there was no doubt that he had awakened her physically her fears had been swept away by the tides of love raven found that in this aspect of their relationship she could indeed give herself to brand unreservedly knowing she could arouse him strengthened her growing confidence as a woman she learned her passions were as strong and sensitive as his she had kept them restricted far too long if brand could heat her blood with a look raven was aware he was just as susceptible to her there was nothing of the cool british reserve in his lovemaking she thought of him as all irish then stormy and passionate one morning he woke her at dawn by strewing the bed with wild rosebuds the following evening he surprised her with iced champagne while she bathed in the ancient footed tub at night he could be brutally passionate waking and taking her with a desperate urgency that allowed no time for surprise protest or response at times he appeared deliriously happy at others she would catch him studying her with an odd searching expression raven loved him but she could not yet bring herself to trust him completely they both knew it and they both avoided speaking of it seated next to brand at the piano raven experimented with chords for the opening bars of a duet i really think a minor mode with a raised seventh she frowned thoughtfully i imagine a lot of strings here a big orchestration of violins and cellos she played more hearing the imagined arrangement rather than the solitary piano what do you think raven turned her head to find brand looking down at her go ahead he suggested drawing on a cigarette play the lot she began only to have him interrupt during a bridge no he shook his head that part doesnt fit that was your part she reminded him with a grin genius is obliged to correct itself he returned and raven gave an unladylike snort he looked down his very straight british nose had you a comment then who me i never interrupt genius wise he said and turned back to spread his own fingers over the keys like this brand played the same melody from the beginning only altering a few notes on the bridge section did you change something i realize your inferior ear might not detect the subtlety he began she jammed her elbow into his ribs well said he murmured rubbing the spot shall we try again i love it when youre dignified brandon really he lifted an inquiring brow now where was i you were about to demonstrate the first movement from tchaikovskys second symphony ah nodding brand turned back to the keys he ran through the difficult movement with a fluid skill that had raven shaking her head showoff she accused when he finished with a flourish youre just jealous with a sigh she lifted her shoulders unfortunately youre right brand laughed and put his hand palm to palm with hers i have the advantage in spread raven studied her small narrowboned hand its a good thing i didnt want to be a concert pianist beautiful hands brand told her making one of his sudden and completely natural romantic gestures by lifting her fingers to his lips im quite helplessly in love with them brandon disarmed raven could only look at him a tremble of warmth qhot up her spine they always smell of that lotion you have in that little white pot on the dresser i didnt think youd notice something like that she shivered in response when his lips brushed the inside of her wrist theres nothing about you i dont notice he kissed her other wrist you like your bath too hot and you leave your shoes in the most unexpected places and you always keep time with your left foot brand looked back up at her keeping one hand entwined with her while he reached up with the other to brush the hair from her qhoulder and when i touch you like this your eyes go to smoke he ran a fingertip gently over the point of her breast and watched her irises darken and cloud very slowly he leaned over and touched his lips to hers lazily he ran his finger back and forth until her nipple was taut and straining against the fabric of her blouse her mouth was soft and opened willingly raven tilted her head back inviting him to take more currents of pleasure were already racing along her skin brand drew her closer one hand lingering at her breast i can feel your bones melt he murmured his mouth grew hungrier his hand more insistent it drives me crazy his fingers drifted from her breast to the top button of her blouse even as he loosened it the phone shrilled from the table across the room he swore and raven gave a laugh and hugged him never mind love she said on a deep breath ill remind you where you left off this time too slipping out of his arms she crossed the room to answer hello hello id like to speak with brandon carstairs please a voice said raven smiled at the musical lilt in the voice and wonderedvaguely how one of brands fans had gotten access to his number mr carstairs is quite busy at the moment she grinned over at him and got both a grin and a nod of approval before he crossed to her he began to distract her by kissing her neck would you ask him to call his mother when hes free i beg your pardon raven stifled a giggle and tried to struggle out of brands arms his mother dear the voice repeated ask him to call his mother when he has a minute wont you he has the number oh please mrs carstairs wait im sorry wideeyed she looked up at brand brandons right here your mother raven said in a horrified whisper that had him grinning again still holding her firmly to his side he accepted the receiver hullo mum brand kissed the top of raven head then chuckled yes i was busy i was kissing a beautiful woman im madly in love with the color rising in ravens cheeks had him laughing no no its all right love i intend to get back to it how are you and the rest raven nudged herself free of brands arm ill make some tea she said quietly then slipped from the room mrs pengalley had left the kitchen spotlessly clean and raven spent some time puttering around it aimlessly while the kettle heated on the stove she found herself suddenly hungry then remembered that she and brand had worked straight through lunch she got out the bread deciding to make buttered toast fingers to serve with the tea afternoon tea was one of brands rituals and raven had grown fond of it she enjoyed the late afternoon breaks in front of the fireplace with tea and biscuits or scones or buttered toast they could be any two people then raven mused two people sitting in front of a fireplace having unimportant conversations the kettle sang out and she moved to switch off the flame raven went about the mechanical domestic tasks of brewing tea and buttering toast but her thoughts kept drifting back to brand there had been such effortless affection in his voice when he had spoken to his mother such relaxed love and raven had felt a swift flash of envy it was something she had experienced throughout childhood and adolescence but she hadnt expected to feel it again raven reminded herself she was twentyfive and no longer a child the chores soothed her she loaded the tray and started back down the hall with her feelings more settled when she heard brands voice she hesitated not wanting to interrupt his conversation but the weight of the tray outbalanced her sense of propriety he was sunk into one of the chairs by the fire when raven entered with a smile he gestured her over so that she crossed the room and set the tray on the table beside him i will mum perhaps next month give everyone my love he paused and smiled again taking ravens hand shes got big gray eyes the same color as the dove shown kept in the coop on the roof yes ill tell her bye mum i love you hanging up brand glanced at the ladened tea tray then up at raven youve been busy she crouched down and began pouring i discovered i was starving she watched with the usual shake of her head as he added milk to his tea that was one english habit raven knew she would never comprehend she took her own plain my mother says to tell you youve a lovely voice over the phone brand picked up a toast finger and bit into it you didnt have to tell her youd been kissing me raven mumbled faintly embarrassed brand laughed and she glared at him mum knows i have a habit of kissing women he explained gravely she probably knows ive occasionally done a bit more than that but we havent discussed that particular aspect of my life for some time he took another bite of toast studying ravens face she wants to meet you if the score keeps going along at this pace i thought we might drive up to london next month im not used to families brandon she said raven reached for her cup but he placed his hand over hers waiting until she looked back up at him theyre easy people raven theyre important to me youre important to me i want them to know you she felt her stomach tighten and lowered her eyes raven brand gave a short exasperated sigh when are you going to talk to me she couldnt pretend not to understand him she could only shake her head and avoid the subject a little while longer the time when they would have to return to california and face reality would come soon enough please tell me about your family it might help me get used to being confronted with all of them if i know a bit more than ive read in the gossip columns raven smiled her eyes asked him to smile back and not to probe not yet brand struggled with a sense of frustration but gave in he could give her a little more time im the oldest of five he gestured toward the mantel michaels the distinguishedlooking one with the pretty blond wife hes a solicitor brand smiled remembering the pleasure it had given him to send his brother to a good university hed been the first i carstairs to receive that sort of education there was nothing distinguished about him at all as a boy brand remarked he liked to give anyone within reach a bloody nose sounds like a good lawyer raven observed dryly please go on alisons next she graduated from oxford at the top of her class he watched raven glance up at the photo of the fragile lovely blond an amazing brain brand continued smiling she does something incomprehensible with computers and has a particular fondness for rowdy rugby matches thats where she met her husband raven shook her head trying to imagine the delicatelooking woman shouting at rugby games or programming sophisticated computers i suppose your other brothers a physicist no showns a veterinarian affection slipped into brands voice your favorite he tilted his head as he reached for more tea if one has a favorite among brothers and sisters i suppose so hes simply one of the nicest people i know hes incapable of hurting anyone as a boy he was the one who always found the bird with the broken wing or the dog with a sore paw you know the type raven didnt but she murmured something and continued to sip at her tea brands family was beginning to fascinate her somehow she had thought that people raised in the same house under the same circumstances would be more the same these people seemed remarkably diverse and your other sister moria he grinned shes in school yet claims shes going into finance or drama or perhaps he added anthropology shes undecided how old is she eighteen she thinks your records are smashing by the way and had them all the last time i was home i believe ill like her raven decided she let her gaze sweep the mantel again your parents must be very proud of all of you what does your father do hes a carpenter brand wondered if she was aware of the wistful look in her eyes he still works six days a week even though he knows money isnt a problem any more he has a great deal of pride he paused a moment stirring his on a line even though i bought her a perfectly they are youre very lucky raven told him and rose to tea his eyes on raven mum still hangs sheets out good dryer ten years ago thats the sort of people wander about the room yes i know that brand watched her move around the room with her quick nervous stride though i doubt i thought a great deal about it while i was growing up its very easy to take it all for granted it must have been very difficult for you i on the cliffs and the sea lets go for a walk brandon its so lovely out j shoulders brand turned her around to face him raven lifted her shoulders then let them fall i survived walking to the window she looked out he rose and walked to her taking her by the theres more to life than surviving raven i survived intact she told him not everyone does raven i know you call home twice a week but quick caring shake talk to me you never tell me anything about it he gave her a not about that not now not here she slipped her arms around him and pressed her cheek to his chest i dont want anything to touch us here nothing from the past nothing from tomorrow oh theres so much ugliness brandon so many responsibilities i want time is that so wrong she held him tighter suddenly possessive cant this be our fantasy brandon that there isnt anybody but us just for a little while she heard him sigh as his lips brushed the crown of her head for a little while raven but fantasies have to end and i want the reality too raven lifted her face then framed his with her hands like joe in the script she reflected and smiled he finds his reality in the end doesnt he yes brand bent to kiss her and found himself lingering over it longer than he had intended proving dreams come true he murmured but im not a dream brandon she took both of his hands in hers while her eyes smiled at him and youve already brought me to life and without magic raven lifted a brow that depends on your point of view she countered i still feel the magic slowly she lifted his hand to the neckline of her blouse i think you were here when we left off so i was he loosened the next button watching her fqr what about that walk qu q that rain raven glanced over to the sunfilled window no shaking her head she looked back at brand i think wed better stay inside until it blows over he ran his finger down to the next button smiling at her while he toyed with it youre probably right j chapter mrs pen galley made it a point to clean the music room first whenever raven and brand left her alone in the house it was here they spent all their time working if what show people did could be considered work she had her own opinion on that she gathered up the cups as she always did and sniffed them tea now and again she had sniffed wine and occasionally some bourbon but she was forced to admit that mr carstairs didnt seem to live up to the reputation of heavy drinking that show people had mrs pengalley was the smallest bit disappointed they lived quietly too she had been sure when brand had notified her to expect him to be in residence for three months that he would have plans to entertain mrs pengalley knew what sort of entertainment show business people went in for she had waited for the fancy cars to start arriving the fancy people in their outrageous clothes she had told mr pengalley it was just a matter of time but no one had come no one at all there had been no disgraceful parties to clean up after there j had only been mr carstairs and the young girl with the big gray eyes who sang as pretty as you please but of course mrs pengalley reminded herself she was in that business too mrs pengalley walked over to shake the wrinkles q from the drapes at the side window from there she could see raven and brand walking along the cliffs always in each others pockets she mused and sniffed to prevent herself from smiling at them she snapped the drape back into place and began dusting off the furniture and how was a body supposed to give anything a proper dusting she wanted to know when they i were always leaving their papers with the chicken scratchings on them all over everywhere picking up a piece of staff paper mrs pengalley scowled down at the lines and notes she couldnt make head nor tail out of the notations she scanned the j words instead loving you is no dream ll need you here to hold ontolwanting you is everythinglcome back to me she clucked her tongue and set the paper back down fine song that one she thought resuming her dusting doesnt even rhyme outside the wind from the sea was strong and brand slipped his arm over ravens shoulders turning her swiftly to face him he bent her backward and gave her a long lingering kiss she gripped his shoulders for balance then stared at him when his mouth lifted what she began and let out a shaky breath i shes peeking out the music room window down to hers again her halfhearted protest turned into total response with a quiet sound of pleasure brand deepened the kiss and dragged her closer to him raven could feel the heat of the sun would come when they would have to deal with the i on her skin even as the sea breeze cooled it the wind brought them the scent of honeysuckle and roses that he murmured as his mouth brushed over her cheeks was for me have any other friends raven asked brand gave her a quick hug and released her i suppose weve given her enough to cluck her tongue over today so thats what you want me for raven tossed her head shock value among other things they wandered to the sea wall for some moments looking out in comfortable silence raven liked the cliffs with their harsh faces and sheer dizzying drop she liked the constant boiling noise of the sea the screaming of the gulls the score was all but completed with only a few minor loose ends and a bit of polishing to be done copies of completed numbers had been sent back to california raven knew they were drawing out a was that for for mrs pengalley he answered easily brandon youre terrible his mouth came i i i i would their work be a problem that was one of the questions raven refused to ask herself or if q every detail of their relationship would be ex i q had no doubt theirs was but she had other doubts would she ever be able to rid herself of the nagging fear that he might leave her again the memory of the hurt kept her from giving herself to job that could be finished quickly she had her own reasons for procrastinating though she wasnt raven wasnt sure precisely what brand wanted j her yet there were things she knew that had to be settled between themthings that could be avoided for the time being while they both simply let themselves be consumed by love but the time everyday business of living she asked it she refused to answer commitments went with their profession timeconsuming commitments that made it difficult to establish any sort of a normal ife and there was so little privacy plored in the press there would be pictures and stories true and fabricated the worst kind raven mused were those with a bit of both all of this she realised could be handled with hard work and determination if the love was strong enough she wholly certain of brands she didntwant to break the spell from her because she hadnt permitted him to tell brand completely and her feelings of responsibility to her mother created yet another barrier this was something she had always refused to share with anyone she couldnt even bring herself to share it with the person she cared for most in the world years before she had made a decision to control her own life promising herself she would never depend too heavily on anything or anyone too often she had watched her mother relinquish control and lose if she could have found a way raven would have prolonged the summer but more and more the knowledge that the idyll was nearly at an end intruded into her thoughts the prelude to fantasy was over she hoped the fantasy would become a reality brand watched ravens face as she leaned her elbows on the rough stone wall and looked out to sea there was a faraway look in her eyes that bothered him he wanted to reach her but their time alone together was slipping by rapidly a cloud slid across the sun for a moment and the light shifted and dimmed he heard raven sigh what are you thinking he demanded catching her flying hair in his hand that of all the places ive ever been this is the best raven tilted her head to smile up at him but didnt alter her position against the wall julie and i took a break in monaco once and i was sure it was the most beautiful spot on earth now i know its the second here brand mused still toying with the ends of her hair i had some bad moments thinking youd refuse im not at all sure i could have come up i knew youd love it if i could ever get you with an alternate plan plan ravens forehead puckered over the word i dont know what you mean what plan to get you here where we could be alone raven straightened away from the wall but continued looking out to sea i thought we came here to write a score yes brand watched the flight of a bird as it swooped down over the waves the timing of that was rather handy handy raven felt the knot start in her stomach the cloud shifted over the sun again i doubt youd have agreed to work with me again if the project hadnt been so tempting he so you dangled the score in front of my nose said brand frowned up at a passing cloud you certainly wouldnt have agreed to live with me like a meaty bone i the project the moment it was offered to me it was all just a matter of timing really timing and planning she said softly like a chess game julies right ive never been any good of course not i wanted to work with you on at strategy raven turned away but brand caught her arm before she could retreat raven how could you she whirled back to face him her eyes were dark and hot her cheeks flushed with fury brand narrowed his eyes and studied her how could i what he asked coolly releasing her arm how could you use the score to trick me into coming here she dragged at her hair as the wind blew it into her face id have used anything to get you back brand said and i didnt trick you raven i told you nothing but the truth part of the truth she countered perhaps he agreed were both rather good at that arent we he didnt touch her but the look he gave her became more direct why are you angry because i love you or because i made you realize you love me nobody makes me do anything she balled her hands into fists as she whirled away oh i detest being maneuvered i run my own life make my own decisions i dont believe ive made any for you no you just led me gently along by the nose until i chose what was best for myself raven turned back again and now her voice was low and vibrant with anger why couldnt you have been honest with me you wouldnt have let me anywhere near you if id been completely honest i had experience with you before remember ravens eyes blazed dont tell me what i couldve done brandon youre not inside my head no youve never let me in there he pulled out a cigarette cupped his hands around a match and lit it before speaking he took a long contemplative drag well say i wasnt in the mood to be i taking chances then will that suit you his cool careless tone fanned her fury you had no right she tossed at him you had no right to arrange my life this way who said i had to play by your rules brandon when did you decide i was incapable of planning for myself if youd like to be treated as a rational adult i perhaps you should behave as one he suggested in a deceptively mild tone at the moment id say youre being remarkably childish i didnt bring you here under false pretenses raven there was a score to be written and this was a quiet place to do it it was also a place i felt youd have the chance to get used to being with me again i wanted you back qyou felt you wanted raven tossed back her hair how incredibly selfish what about my feelings do you think you can just pop in and out of my life at your convenience as i remember i was pushed out you left me the tears came from nowhere and blinded her nothings ever hurt me like that before nothing tears of hurt sprang to her eyes ill be damned if youll do it to me again you went away without a word you mightnt have liked the words i wanted to say brand tossed the stub of his cigarette over the wall you werent the only one who was hurt that night how the hell else could i be rational unless i put some distance between us i couldnt have given you the time you seemed to need if id stayed anywhere near you time raven repeated as thoughts trembled and raced through her mind you gave me time you were a child when i left he said shortly id hoped youd be a woman when i came beck you had hoped her voice trailed off into an astonished whisper are you telling me you stayed away giving me a chance toto grow up i didnt see i had any choice brand dug his hands into his pockets as his brows came together didnt you she remembered her despair at his going the emptiness of the years and of course why should you have given me one you simply took it upon yourself to decide for me it wasnt a matter of deciding he turned away from her knowing he was losing his grip on his temper it was a matter of keeping sane i simply couldnt stay near you and not have you so you stayed away for five years then suddenly reappeared using my music as an excuse to lure me into bed you didnt give a damn about the quality of fantasy you just used itand the talent and sweat of the performersfor your own selfish ends that he said in a deadly calm voice is beyond contempt turning he walked away within moments raven heard the roar of an engine over the sound of the sea she stood watching the car speed down the lane if she had meant to deal a savage blow she had q her throat she shut her eyes tightly even with her eyes closed she could see clearly succeeded the shock of her own words burned in the look of fury on brands face before he had walked away raven ran a shaking hand through her hair her head was throbbing with the aftereffects of temper slowly she opened her eyes and stared out at the choppy green sea i she resented the fact that brand had secretly everything weve had these past weeks was all part of some masterplan she thought even as she stood the anger drained out of her leaving only the weight of unhappiness placed a hand on the reins of her life resented that he had offered her the biggest opportunity in her i and miserable she turned to walk back to the mrs pengalley met her at the music room door theres a call for you miss from california she career as a step in drawing her to him and yet raven shook her head in frustration confused house had watched the argument from the window with a healthy curiosity now however the look in the gray eyes set her maternal instincts quivering she repressed an urge to smooth down ravens hair i ill make you some tea she said raven walked to the phone and lifted the receiver yes hello raven its julie julie raven sank down in a chair she blinked back fresh tears at the sound of the familiar voice back from the isles of greece ive been back for a couple weeks raven of course she should have known that yes all right whats happened karter contacted me because he wasnt able to reach you this morning some trouble on the line or something has she left again ravens voice was dull apparently she left last night she didnt go very far hearing the hesitation in julies voice raven felt the usual tired acceptance sharpen into apprehension julie words dried up and she waited there was an accident raven youd better come home raven closed her eyes is she dead no but its not good raven i hate having to tell you over the phone this way the housekeeper said brand wasnt there no raven opened her eyes and looked vaguely around the room no brandon isnt here she managed to snap herself back how bad julie is she in the hospital julie hesitated again then spoke quietly shes not going to make it raven im sorry karter says hours at best oh god raven had lived with the fear all her life yet it still came as a shock she looked around the room again a little desperately trying to orient herself i know theres no good way to tell you this raven but i wish i could find a better one what she brought herself back again with an enormous effort no im all right ill leave right away shall i meet you and brand at the airport the question drifted through ravens mind no no ill go straight to the hospital where is she st catherines intensive care tell dr karter ill be there as soon as i can julie yes stay with her of course i will ill be here raven hung up and sat staring at the silent phone mrs pengalley came back into the room carrying a cup of tea she took onp look at ravens white face and set it aside without speaking she went to the liquor cabinet and took out the brandy after pouring out two fingers she pressed the snifter on raven here now miss you drink this the cornish burr was brisk ravens eyes shifted to her what drink up theres a girl she obeyed as mrs pengalley lifted the glass to her lips instantly raven sucked in her breath at the unexpected strength of the liquor she took another sip then let out a shaky sigh thank you she lifted her eyes to mrs pengalley again thats hefter brandy has its uses the housekeeper said righteously raven rose trying to put her thoughts in order there were things to be done and no time to do them mrs pengalley i have to go back to america right away could you pack some things for me while i call the airport aye she studied raven shrewdly hes gone off to cool his heels you know they all do that but hell be back soon enough realizing mrs pengalley spoke of brand raven dragged a hand through her hair im not altogether certain of that if brandons not back by the time i have to go to the airport would you ask mr pengalley to drive me i know its an inconvenience but its terribly important if thats what you want mrs pengalley sniffed young people she thought always flying off the handle ill pack your things then q thank you raven glanced around the music room then picked up the phone an hour later she hesitated at the foot of the stairs everything seemed to have happened at once she willed brand to return but there was no sign of his car in the driveway raven struggled over writing a note but could think of nothing to say on paper that could make up for the words she had thrown at him and how could she say in a few brief lines that her mother was dying and she had to go to her yet there wasnt time to wait until he returned she knew she couldnt risk it frantically she pulled a note pad from her purse brandon she wrote quickly i had to go im needed at home please forgive me i love you raven dashing back into the music room she propped the note against the sheet of staff paper on top of the pile on the piano then hurrying from the room she grabbed her suitcases and ran outside mr pengalley was waiting in his serviceable sedan to drive her to the airport chapter five days passed before raven began thinking clearly again karter had been right about there only being a matter of hours raven had had to deal not only with grief but also with an unreasonable guilt that she hadnt been in time the demand of details saved her from giving into the urge to sink into selfpity and selfrebuke she wondered once during those first crushing hours if that was why people tied so many traditions and complications to death to keep from falling into total despair she was grateful that karter handled the police himself in a way that ensured the details would be kept out of the papers after the first busy days there was nothing left but to accept that the woman she had loved and despised was gone there was no more she could do the disease had beaten them just as surely as if it had been a cancer gradually she began to accept her mothers death as the result of a long debilitating illness she didnt cry knowing she had already mourned knowing it was time to put away the unhappiness she had never had control of her mothers life she needed the strength to maintain control of her own a dozen times during those days raven phoned the house in cornwall there was never an answer she could almost hear the hollow echoing sound of the ring through the empty rooms more than once she considered simply getting on a plane and going back but she always pushed the thought aside he wouldnt be there waiting for her where could he be she wondered again and again where would he have gone he hasntforgiven me and worse she thought again and again hell never forgive me after hanging up the phone a last time raven looked at herself in her bedroom mirror she was pale the color that had drained from her face five days before in cornwall had never completely returned there was too much of a helpless look about her raven shook her head and grabbed her blusher borrowed color she decided was better than none at all she had to start somewhere yes she thought again still holding the sable brush against her cheek ive got to start somewhere turning away from the mirror raven again picked up the phone thirty minutes later she came downstairs wearing a black silk dress she had twisted her hair up and was setting a plain stiffbrimmed black hat over it as she stepped into the hall raven julie came out of the office are you going out yes if i can find that little envelope bag and my car keys i think theyre inside it she was already poking into the hall closet are you all right raven drew her head from the closet and met julies look im better she answered knowing julie wouldnt be satisfied with a cliched reply the lecture you gave me after the funeral about not blaming roy self im trying to put it into practice it wasnt a lecture julie countered it was simply a statement of facts you did everything you could do to help your mother you couldnt have done any more raven sighed before she could stop herself i did everything i knew how to do and i suppose thats the same thing she shook off the mood as she shut the closet door i am better julie and im going to be fine she smiled then glimpsing a movement looked beyond julies shoulder wayne stepped out of the office hello wayne i didnt know you were here he moved past julie well i can definitely approve of that dress he greeted her and so you should raven returned dryly you charged roe enough for it dont be a philistine darling art has no price he flicked a finger over the shoulder of the dress where are you off to alphonsos im meeting henderson for lunch wayne touched ravens cheek with a fingertip a bit heavy on the blush he commented im tired of looking pale dont fuss she placed a hand on each of his cheeks urging him to bend so that she could kiss him youve been a rock wayne i havent told you how much i appreciate your being here these last few days i needed to escape from the office i adore you she lowered her hands to meet his arms and squeezed briefly now stop worrying about me raven shot a look past his shoulder to julie you too im meeting henderson to talk over plans for a new tour new tour julie frowned raven youve been working nonstop for over six months the album the tour the score she paused after all of this you need a break after all this the thing i need least is a break raven corrected i want to work then take a sabbatical julie insisted a few months back you were talking about finding a mountain cabin in colorado remember yes raven smiled and shook her head i was going to write and be rustic wasnt i get away from the glitterglamour and into the woods raven grinned recalling the conversation you said something about not being interested in anything more rustic than a margarita at poolside julie lifted a thin arched brow ive changed my mind im going shopping for hiking boots waynes comment was a dubious hmmm raven smiled youre sweet she said to julie as she kissed her cheek but it isnt necessary i need to do something that takes energy physical energy im going to talk to henderson about a tour of australia my records do very well there if youd just talk to brand julie began but raven cut her off ive tried to reach him i cant there was something final and flat in the statement obviously he doesnt want to talk to me im not at all sure i blame him hes in love with you wayne said from behind her raven turned and met the look a few thousand people saw the sparks flying the night of your concert in new york yes he loves me and i love him it doesnt seem to be enough and i cant quite figure out why no please she took his hand pressing it between both of hers i have to get my mind off it all for a while i feel as if i had been having a lovely picnic and got caught in a landslide the bruises are still a bit sore i could use some good news she added glancing from one of them to the other if the two of you are ever going to decide to tell me raven watched as wayne and julie exchanged glances she grinned enjoying what she saw ive been noticing a few sparks myself isnt this a rather sudden situation very wayne agreed smiling at julie over ravens head its only been going on for about six years six years ravens brows shot up in amazement i didnt choose to be one of a horde wayne said mildly lighting one of his elegant cigarettes and i always thought he was in love with you julie stated letting her gaze drift from raven to wayne with me raven laughed spontaneously for the first time in days i fail to see the humor in that wayne remarked from behind a nimbus of smoke im considered by many to be rather attractive oh you are she agreed then giggled and kissed his cheek madly so but i cant believe anyone could think you were in love with me youve always dated those rather alarmingly beautiful models with their sculptured faces and long legs i dont think we need bring all that up at the moment wayne retorted its all right julie smiled sweetly and tucked her hair behind her ear i havent any problem with waynes checkered past when did all this happen please amused raven cut into their exchange i turn my back for a few weeks and i find my two best friends making calfs eyes at each other ive never made calfs eyes at anyone wayne remonstrated horrified smoldering glances perhaps he lifted his rakishly scarred brow when raven repeated i looked up from my deck chair the first morning out on the cruise julie began and who do you suppose is sauntering toward me in a perfectly cut mediterranean white suit really rqaven eyed wayne dubiously im not certain whether im surprised or impressed it seemed like a good opportunity he explained tapping his expensive ashes into a nearby dish if i could corner her before she charmed some shipping tycoon or handy sailor i believe i charmed a shipping tycoon a few years ago julie remarked lazily and as to the sailor nevertheless wayne went on shooting her a glance i decided a cruise was a very good place to begin winning her over it was he remarked remarkably simple oh julies left brow arched really wayne tapped out his cigarette then moved over to gather her in his arms a piece of cake he added carelessly of course women habitually find me irresistible it would be safer if they stopped doing so i might be tempted to wring their necks julie cooed winding her arms around his neck the womans going to be a trial to live with wayne kissed her as though hed decided to make the best of it i can see you two are going to be perfectly miserable together im so sorry walking over raven slipped an arm around each of them you will let me give you the wedding she began then stopped that is are you having a wedding absolutely wayne told her we dont trust each other enough for anything less encumbering he gave julie a flashing grin that inexplicably made raven want to weep raven hugged them both again fiercely i needed to hear something like this right now im going to leave you alone i imagine you can entertain yourselves while im gone can i tell henderson she asked or is it a secret you can tell him julie said watching as ravenadjusted her hat in the hall mirror were planning on taking the plunge next week ravens eyes darted up to julies in the mirror my you two move fast dont you when its right its right raven smiled in quick agreement yes i suppose it is theres probably champagne in the refrigerator isnt there julie she turned away from the mirror we can have a celebration drink when i get back ill just be a couple of hours raven julie stopped her as she headed for the door raven looked curiously over her shoulder your purse smiling julie retrieved it from a nearby table you wont forget to eat will you she demanded as she placed it in ravens hand i wont forget to eat raven assured her then dashed through the door within the hour raven was seated in the glassedin tenace room of alphonsos toying with a plate of scampi there were at least a dozen people patronizing the restaurant whom she knew personally a series of greetings had been exchanged before she had been able to tuck herself into a corner table the room was an elaborate jungle with exotic plants and flowers growing everywhere the sun shining through the glass and greenery gave the tenace a warmth and glow the floor was a cool ceramic tile and there was a constant trickle of water from a fountain at the far end of the room raven enjoyed the casual elegance the wicker accessories and the pungent aromas of food and ftowen that filled the place now however she gave little attention to the tenace rooro as she spoke with her agent hendenon was a big burly roan whom raven had always thought resembled a log jammer rather than the smooth savvy agent he was he had a light red thatch of hair that curled thinly on top of his head and bright meny blue eyes that she knew could sharpen to a swords point there was a friendly smattering of freckles over his broad flatfeatured face he could smile and look genial and none too bright it was one of his best weapons raven knew henderson was as sharp as they came and when necessary he could be hard as nails he was fond of her not only because she made biro so rich but because she never resented having done so he couldnt say the same about all of his clients now henderson allowed raven to ramble on about ideas for a new tour australia new zealand promotion for the new album that was already shooting up the charts a week after its release he ate his veal steadily washing it down with heavy red wine while raven talked and sipped occasionally from her glass of white wine he noticed she made no mention of the fantasy score or of her time in cornwall the last progress report he had received from her had indicated the project was all but completed the convenations he had had with jarett had been enthusiastic lauren chase had approved each one of her numbers and the choreography had begun the score seemed the be falling into place without a hitch so hendenon had been surprised when raven had returned alone so abruptly from cornwall he had expected her to phone him when the score was completed then to take the week or two she had indicated she and brand wanted to relax and do nothing but here she was back early and without brand she chattered nervously darting from one topic to another hendenon didnt interrupt only now and again making some noncommittal sounds as he attended to his meal raven talked nonstop for fifteen minutes then began to wind down henderson waited then took a long swallow of wine well now he said patting his lips with a white linen napkin i dont imagine there should be any problem setting up an australian tour his voice suited his looks good raven pushed the scampi around on her plate she realized she had talked herself out spearing a bit of shrimp she ate absently while its being set up you could take yourself a nice little vacation somewhere ravens brows rose no i thought you could book me on the talkshow circuit dig up some guest shots here and there could do that too he said genially after you take a few weeks off i want gigs not a few weeks off her brows lowered suspiciously have you been talking to julie he looked surprised no about what nothing raven shook her head then smiled gigs henderson youve lost weight you know he pointed out and shoveled in some more veal it shows in your face eat raven gave an exasperated sigh and applied herself to her lunch why does everyone treat me like a dimwitted child she mumbled swallowing shrimp im going to start being temperamental and hard to get along with until i get some star treatment henderson said something quick and rude between mouthfuls which she ignored what about jerry michaels didnt i hear he was lining up a variety special for the fall you could get me on that simplest thing in the world henderson agreed hed be thrilled to have you well well what hendenon resolutely raven pushed her plate aside are you going to book me on the jerry michaels show no he poured more wine into his glass the sun shot through it casting a red shadow on the tablecloth why annoyance crept into ravens tone its not for you henderson lifted a hand palm up as she began to argue i know whos producing the show raven its not for you she subsided a bit huffily but she subsided his instincts were the best in the field all right forget the michaels gig what then want some dessert no just coffee he signaled the waiter then after ordering blueberry cheesecake for himself and coffee for both of them he settled back in his chair what about fantasy raven twirled her wineglass between her fingers its finished she said flatly and and she repeated looking up his merry blue eyes were narrowed its finished she said again or essentially finished i cant foresee any problem with the final details brandon or his agent will get in touch with you if there are im sure jarett will probably need the two of you off and on during the filming henderson said mildly i wouldnt consider myself finished with it for a while yet raven fmwned into the pale golden liquid in her glass yes youre right of course i hadnt thought about it well she shook her head and pushed the wine away ill deal with that when the time comes howd it go she looked at henderson levelly but her thoughts drifted we wrote some of the best music either one of us has ever done that im sure of we work remarkably well together i was surprised you didnt think you would henderson eyed the blueberry cheesecake the waiter set in front of him no i didnt think we would thank you this to the waiter before she looked at henderson again but everything else apart we did work well together youd worked well together before he pointed out clouds and rain he saw her frown but continued smoothly did you know sales on that have picked up again after your new york concert you got yourself a lot of free press too yes raven mumbled into her coffee im sure we did ive had a lot of questions thrown at me during the last weeks he continued blandly even when her eyes lifted and narrowed from the inside he said with a smile as well as the press i was at a nice little soiree just last week you and brand were the main topic of conversation as i said we work well together raven set down her cup brandon was right we are good for each other artistically and personally henderson took a generous bite of cheesecake well raven lifted a brow you certainly get to the point thats all right you dont have to answer me he swallowed the cake then broke off another piece you can tell him brand henderson answered easily and added cream to his coffee he just walked in raven whirled around in her chair instantly her eyes locked on brands with the contact came a wild swift surge of joy her first instinct was to spring from the table and run to him indeed she had pushed her chair back preparing to do so when the expression on his face cut through her initial spring of delight it was ice cold fury raven sat where she was watching as he weaved his way through the crowded restaurant toward her there were casual greetings along the way which he ignored raven heard the room fall silent he reached her without speaking once or taking his eyes from her ravens desire to hold out a hand to him was also overcome she thought he might strike it away the look in his eyes had her blood beating uneasily henderson might not have been sitting two feet away lets go go raven repeated dumbly now brand took her hand and yanked her to her feet she might have winced at the unexpected pressure if she hadnt been so shocked by it brandon now he repeated he began to walk away dragging her behind him raven could feel the eyes following them shock delight anxiety all faded into temper let go of me she demanded in a harsh undertone whats the matter with you you cant drag me around like this she bumped into a lunching comedian then skirted around him with a mumbled apology as brand continued to stalk away with her hand in his brandon stop this i will not be dragged out of a public restaurant he halted then and turned so that their faces were very close would you prefer that i say what i have to say to you here and now his voice was clear and cool in the dead silence of the room it was very easy to see the violence of temper just beneath the surface raven could feel it in the grip of his hand on hers they were spotlighted again she thought fleetingly but hardly in the manner in which they had been in new york she took a deep breath no raven struggled for dignity and kept her voice lowered but there isnt any need to make a scene brandon oh im in the mood for a scene raven he tossed back in fluid british tones that carried well im in the mood for a bloody beaut of a scene before she could comment brand turned away again and propelled her out of the restaurant there was a mercedes at the curb directly outside he shoved her inside it slamming the door behind her raven straightened in the seat whipping her head around as he opened the other door oh youre going to get one she promised and ripped off her hat to throw it furiously into the back seat how dare you shut up i mean it brand turned to her as she started to speak again just shut up until we get where were going otherwise i might be tempted to strangle you here and be done with it he shot away from the curb and raven flopped back against her seat ill shut up all right she thought on wave after wave of anger ill shut up itll give me time to think through exactly what i have to say by the time brand stopped the car in front of the belair raven felt she had her speech well in order as he climbed out of his side she climbed out of hers then turned to face him on the sidewalk but before she could speak he had her arm in a tight grip and was pulling her toward the entrance i told you not to drag me and i told you to shut up he brushed past the doorman and into the lobby raven was forced into an undignified halftrot in order to keep up with his longlegged stride i will not be spoken to like that she fumed and gave her arm an unsuccessful jerk i will not be carted through a hotel lobby like a piece of bag im tired of playing it your way brand turned i grabbing both of her shoulders and dragging her against him his fingers bit into her skin and shocked her into silence my game now my rules his mouth came down hard on hers it was a kiss of rage his teeth scraped across her lips forcing them open so that he could plunder and seek he held her bruisingly close as if daring her to struggle when brand pulled away he stared at her for a long silent moment then swore quickly fiercely turning he pulled her to the elevators though she was no longer certain if it was fear or anger raven was trembling with emotion as they took the silent ride up brand could feel the throbbing pulse as he held her arm he swore again pungently but she didnt glance at him as the doors slid open he pulled her into the hall and toward the perqihouse there were no words exchanged between them as he slid the key into the lock he released her arm as he pushed the door open without protest raven walked inside she moved to the center of the room the suite was elegant even lush in a dignified oldfashioned style with a small bricked fireplace and a good thick carpet behind her the door slammeda final soundand she heard brand toss the key with a faint metallic jingle onto a table raven drew a breath and turned around brandon no ill do the talking first he crossed to her his eyes locked on hers my rules remember yes she lifted her chin her arm throbbed faintly where his fingers had dug into it i remember first rule no more bits and pieces i wont have you closing parts of yourself off from me any more they were standing close now that the first dazed shock and surprise were passing raven noticed signs of strain and fatigue on his face his words were spilling out so quickly she couldnt interrupt you did the same thing to me five years ago but then we werent lovers you were always holding out never willing to trust no she shook her head scrambling for some defense no thats not true yes its true he countered and took her by the shoulders again did you tell me about your mother all those years ago or how you felt what you were going through did you bring me into your life enough to let me help you or at least comfort you this was not what she had expected from him raven could only press her hand to her temple and shake her head again no it wasnt something wasnt something you wanted to share with me he dropped her arms and stepped away from her yes i know his voice was low and furious again as he pulled out a cigarette he knew he had to do something with his hands or hed hurt her again he watched as she unconsciously nursed her arm where he had gripped her and this time raven would you have told me anything about it if it hadnt been for the nightmare if you hadnt been half asleep and frightened would you have told me trusted me i dont know she made a small sound of confusion my mother had nothing to do with you brand hurled the cigarette away before he t it how can you say that to me how can you stand there and say that to me he took a step toward her then checked himself and stalked to the bar damn you raven he said under his breath he stayed away he managed in a calmer tone poured bourbon and drank maybe i should have youd already tossed me out of your life five years ago you walked out on me you left me flat because i wouldnt be your lover raven walked over to the i my house and out of my life and the only word i i tossed you out this time her voice rose bar and leaned her palms on it you walked out of i had from you was what i read in the paper it didnt take you long to find other womenseveral other women drank again as quickly as i could i used women i found as many as i could brand agreed and booze gamblinganythingto try to get you out glass and added thoughtfully it didnt work he set the gla down and looked at her again which is why i knew i had to be patient with you of my system he studied the dregs of liquor in his ravens eyes were still dark with hurt dont talk to me about tossing you out thats exactly what you did brand grabbed her wrist as she turned to swirl away from him he held her still the narrow mahogany bar between them we were alone remember julie was away for a few days raven kept her eyes level i remember perfect do you he arched a brow both his eyes and voice were cool again there might be a few things you dont remember when i came to the house that night i was going to ask you to marry me raven could feel every thought ever emotion pour out of her body she could only stare at him surprised brand released her wrist and again reached in his pocket for a cigarette apparently we have two differing perspectives on that night i loved you the words were an accusation that kept her speechless and god help me all those weeks we were together i was faithful to you i never touched another woman he lit the cigarette and as the end flared raven heard him say softly i nearly went mad you never told me her voice was weak and shaken her eyes were huge gray orbs you never once said you loved me you kept backing off he retorted and i knew you were innocent and afraid though i didnt know why he gave her a long steady look it would have made quite a lot of difference if i had but you didnt trust me oh brandon that night he went on you were so warm and the house was so quiet i could feel how much you wanted me it drove me crazy good god i was trying to be gentle patient when the need for you was all but destroying me he ran a tense hand through his hair and you were giving melting everywhere i touched you and thenthen you were struggling like some terrified child pushing at me as if id tried to kill you telling me not to touch you you said you couldnt bear to have me touch you he looked back at her but his eyes were no longer cool youre the only woman whos ever been able to hurt me like that brandon raven shut her eyes i was only twenty and there were so many things yes i know now i didnt know then his tone was flat though there really werent so many changes this time around raven opened her eyes and started to speak but he shook his head no not yet ive not finished i stayed away to give you time as i told you before i didnt see any other way i could hardly stay kicking my heels in la waiting for you to make up your mind i didnt know how long id stay away but during those five years i concentrated on my career so did you brand paused spreading his long elegant hands on the surface of the bar looking back i suppose thats all for the best you needed to establish yourself and i had a surge of productivity when i started reading about you regularly in the gossip columns i knew it was time to come back he watched her mouth fall open at that and her eyes heat get as mad as you damn well like when ive finished he said shortly but dont interrupt raven turned away to search for control all right go on she managed and faced him again i came to the states without any real plan except to see you the solid idea fell into my lap by way of fantasy when i was in new york i used the score to get you back he said simply and without apology when i stood up in that recording booth watching you again i knew id have used anything but the score did nicely he pushed his empty glass aside with his fingertip i wasnt lying about wanting to work with you again for professional reasons or about feeling you were particularly right for fantasy but i would have if it had been necessary so perhaps you werent so far wrong about what you said on the cliffs that day he moved from the bar to the window of course there was a bit more to it in my mind than merely getting you to bed raven felt her throat burn brandon she swallowed and shut her eyes ive never been more ashamed of anything in my life than what i said to you anger is hardly an excuse but id hopedid hoped youd forgiven me brand turned his head and studied her a moment perhaps if you hadnt left it would have been easier i had to i told you in the note what note his voice sharpened as he turned to face her the note raven was uncertain whether to step forward or back i left it on the piano with the music i didnt see any note i didnt see anything but that you were gone he let out a long breath i dumped all the music into a briefcase i didnt notice a note julie called only a little while after youd left to tell me about the accident his eyes shot back to hers again what accident raven stared at him your mother he said reading it in her eyes yes shed had an accident i had to get back right away he jammed his hands into his pockets why didnt you wait for me i wanted to i couldnt raven laced her fingers together to prevent her hands from fluttering dr karter said it would only be a matter of hours as it was she paused and turned away i was too late anyway brand felt the anger drain from him im sorry i didnt know raven didnt know why the simple quiet statement should bring on the tears she hadnt shed before they blinded her eyes and clogged her throat so that speech was impossible i went a bit crazy when i got back to the house and found youd packed and gone brand spoke wearily now i dont know exactly what i did at first afterwards i got roaring drunk the next morning i dumped all the music together packed some things and took off for the states i stopped off for a couple of days in new york trying to sort things out it seems i spend a great deal of time running after you its difficult on the pride in new york i came up with a dozen very logical very valid reasons why i should go back to england and forget you but there was one very small very basic point i couldnt argue aside he looked at her again her back was to him her head bent so that with her hair pulled up he could see the slender length of her neck i love you raven brandon raven turned her teardrenched face toward him she blinked at the prisms of light that blinded her then shook her head quickly when she saw him make a move to come to her no please dont i wont be able to talk if you touch me she drew in a deep breath brushing the tears away with her fingertips ive been very wrong i have to tell you he stood away from her though impatience was beginning to simmer through him again i had my say he agreed i suppose you should have yours all those years ago she began all those years ago there were things i couldnt say things i couldnt even understand because i was so dazzled by everything my career the fame the money the perpetual spotlight the words came quickly and her voice grew stronger with them everything happened at once there didnt seem to be any time to get used to it all suddenly i was in love with brandon carstairs she laughed and brushed at fresh tears the brandon carstairs you have to understand one minute you were an image a name on a record and the next you were a man and i loved you raven moistened her lips moving to stare from the window as brand had and my mother my mother was my responsibility brandon ive felt that always and it isnt something that can be changed overnight you were the genuine knight on a charger i couldntwouldnt talk to you about that part of my life i was afraid and i was never sure of you you never told me you loved me brandon i was terrified of you he murmured of what i was feeling for you you were the first he shrugged but you were always pulling back zqoq me always putting up no trespassing signs whenever i started to get close you always seemed to want so much she hugged her arms even this time in corevlatl when we were so close it didnt seem to be enough i always felt you were waiting far more i you still put up the signs raven she turned and his eyes locked on hers your body isnt enough that isnt what i waited five years for love should be enough she tossed back suddenly angry and confused no brand shook his head cutting her off it isnt enough i want a great deal more than that he waited a moment watching the range of expressions on her face i want your trust without conditions without exceptions i want a commitment a total one its all or nothing this time raven she backed away you cant own me brandon a quick flash of fury shot into his eyes damn it i dont want to own you but i want you to belong to me dont you know theres a difference raven stared at him for a full minute she dropped her arms no longer cold the tension that had begun to creep up the back of her neck vanished i didnt she said softly i should have slowly she crossed to him she was vividly aware of every detail of his face the dark expressive brows drawn together now with thought the bluegreen eyes steady but with the spark of temper the faint touch of mauve beneath them that told her hed lost sleep it came to her then that she loved him more as a woman than she had as a girl a woman could love without fear without restrictions raven lifted her fingertip to his cheek as if to smooth away the tension then they were locked in each others arms mouth to mouth his hands went to her hair scattering pins until it tumbled free around them he murmured something she had no need to understand then plunged deep again into her mouth hurriedly impatiently they began to undress each other no words were needed they sought only to touch to give to fulfill his fingers fumbled with the zipper of her dress making him swear and her laugh breathlessly until he pulled her with him to the rug then somehow they were flesh to flesh raven could feel the shudders racing through him to match her own as they touched his mouth was no more greedy than i hers his hands no less demanding their fire blazed clean and bright need erupted in them both so that she pulled him to her desperate to have him frantic to give raw pleasure shot through her rocking her again and again as she moved with him his face was buried in her hair his body damp to her touch air was forcing its way from her lungs in moans i and gasps as they took each other higher and faster then the urgency passed and a sweetness took its place it lost all meaning as they lay together neither moved or spoke tensions and angers ecstasies and desperations had all passed all that was left was a soft contentment she could feel his breath rlove lightly against her neck brandon raven murmured letting her lips brush his skin hmm i think i still had something to say but its slipped my mind she gave a low laugh brand lifted his head and grinned maybe itll come back to you probably wasnt important youre right im sure she smiled touching his cheek it had something to do with loving you beyond sanity or some such thing and wanting more than anything in the world to belong to qyou nothing important brand lowered his mouth to hers and nipped at her still tender lip you were distracted he mused seeking her breast with his fingertip raven ran her hands down his back i was in a bit of a hurry this time he began to taste her neck and shoulder this time well slow down the tempo a bit more orchestration dont you think his fingers slid gently and teasingly over the point of her breast yes quite a bit more orchestration brandon her words were lost on a sound of pleasure as his tongue found her ear once more with feeling she whispered
