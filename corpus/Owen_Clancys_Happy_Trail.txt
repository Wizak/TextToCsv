owen clancys happy trail chapter i almost a riot no it was not an earthquake that happened in the city of los angeles california on that beautiful sunshiny morning it was just a towheaded crosseyed youth shaking things up at the corner of sixth and main in an attempt to find his father and not one corner of the cross streets was involved but all four corners the upheaval that followed this search for a missing relative extended in several directions so that a very small cause led up to remarkably large results it was nine oclock of a saturday morning that saturday was some sort of a festal day for the chinese and at the hour mentioned a dragon a block long consisting of a hundred celestials covered with papiermache was twisting and writhing along sixth street on one corner leaning against the side of a building was a tall man in seedy clothes a card on his breast bore the sad legend help the blind the mans eyes were covered with large blue goggles and in one hand he held his hat and in the other a couple of dozen cheap lead pencils across the street on corner number two was an italian with a hand organ the italians assistant was a monkey in a red cap corner number three among others held a grocers boy carrying a basket with six dozens of eggs he was very much absorbed in watching the chinese dragon wriggle along the thoroughfare the fourth corner was reserved for hiram hill the towheaded crosseyed chap who was destined to cause all the commotion while hill stood on the walk telling himself that the gaudily painted dragon looked very much like an overgrown centipede he suddenly caught sight of a man in an automobile the auto was headed along main street and was waiting for the dragon to clear the way so it could proceed hill looked at the machine across the papiermache spine of the chink monster and he gave a yell of surprise when his gaze took account of the one man in the tonneau of the car undoubtedly that man was hiram hills father the parent who had been mysteriously missing ever since the first klondike gold rush hirams eyes were sharp and to them the beetling brow the one squint eye the very pronounced roman nose and the retreating chin which made the face resemble a birds beak were all very plain after that first yell of surprise hirams astonishing good luck held him speechless following a year of a trying towntotown canvas of the whole southwest he had at last come within hailing distance of his longlost parent only one point remained to make assurance doubly sure had the suspect a brown mole on the back of his neck sharp as hills eyes were they could not determine that who wants a pencil came feebly from the hapless person on the first corner help the blind jocko said the son of sunny italy on corner two maka da bow taka da mon the monkey lifted his hat and went through motions that passed for a bow he also looked at his master and showed his teeth not relishing the way his chain had been pulled pipe de chink wid de pigeon toes and de bow legs yelped the grocers boy if hes goin de way dem feet are pointed foist ting yous know hell be runnin into himself the boy with the basket of eggs was very observing as he shouted his remarks he leveled a finger at a pair of coolie legs supporting one of the vertebra of the passing dragon the legs were badly sprung at the knees but they ended in feet which the chinaman had to step over as he walked dad whooped hiram hill i say dad hiram recovered his speech and all at once became as active as a swarm of bees after some one has kicked over the hive he wanted to get to that automobile and give his father a filial embrace and he was in a hurry the chinese dragon was in the way but hiram didnt mind a little thing like that he jumped at the papiermache thing and hit it in the vicinity of the bowlegged chinaman that particular chink went down and the dragon was broken squarely in two midway of its length now a papiermache dragon is a sort of a blindfollowmyleader affair the chinaman at the head is the only one in the procession who can see where he is going and the remaining sections of the monster hang onto him and follow his lead the rear half of the dragon got lost and went groping wildly for the front half somehow or other it ran into the crowd on the corner and there was a mixup in which three dollars worth of eggs were badly scrambled the last section of the front half missing the part behind began swinging back and forth across the street in an attempt to find the lost tail it carromed into corner number two smashing one perfectly good hand organ freeing an excited monkey and drawing forth a volley of lurid words from the italian jocko ran across the street and began climbing the tall man who was selling lead pencils with a roar of consternation the tall man rushed into the street flourishing his arms and begging some one any one to take it away take it away he finally collided with the head end of the dragon demoralizing that half of the chink procession as completely as the latter half had been by that time sixth and main was in a turmoil the dragon had broken up in a hundred parts like a jointed snake and each part was thrashing around blindly trying to get rid of its papiermache so it could see where it was and what it was doing from the four corners the crowd flowed into the street eggs entirely whole or only slightly cracked flew from mischievous hands over heaving heads only to smash against some particularly inviting mark the monkey leaped from one pair of shoulders to another chattering wildly in course of time he reached the automobile landed in a heap on the bosom of the beetlebrowed romannosed passenger in the tonneau and encircling him with his hairy arms the beetlebrowed man got up and fought for his freedom clamoring furiously for police police just at that moment the only policeman in that vicinity was at the patrol box sending in a riot call meanwhile hiram hill was having his own share of troubles the bowlegged chinaman had slipped out of his papiermache shell he did not know of course that hill was the one who had knocked his section of the dragon out of line but the instant he was able to look around he saw hill and immediately selected him as a suitable object for hostility the chink did not step on himself nor in any way interfere with his progress in going for hiram he hit hiram so hard over the head with the piece of dragon that he knocked a hole in the papiermache and just as hiram freed himself of the encumbrance and straightened up to get his bearings and swoop down on his assailant an egg smashed in his face and effectually blinded him a hollow murmur sounded in hirams ears like the roar of the sea he was picked up on the troubled waters of the melee and borne back and forth in the surging tide at last he slammed into something and fell limp and dazed to the ground he drew his sleeve across his eyes thus freeing them for clearer vision to his joy and wonder he found that destiny had hurled him against the side of the automobile he had been trying to reach jocko had jumped from the shoulders of the passenger in the tonneau and the passenger was still on his feet and had his back toward hiram the latter boiling over with filial sentiments climbed up on the running board and encircled the beetlebrowed man in a fond embrace dad clamored hiram excitedly dont you know me get off get off roared the man going at once into a flurry whose monkey is this anyway police police the man naturally was in a highly excited state of mind and thought the simian was upon him again just then the driver of the machine found a cleared space ahead and started for it he started so quickly that hiram was thrown from the running board dropped to the hard pavement and there stumbled against and fallen over by the jostling mob this rough usage was more than hiram could stand the senses were being knocked out of him by swift degrees he felt his wits going and he made a frantic attempt to stay them as they drifted away the attempt was useless however and a great darkness suddenly descended upon hiram and closed him in when he regained his senses he was lying on a bench in a drug store a clerk was holding a handkerchief saturated with a drug of some kind to his nostrils and a bluecoat was standing near twirling his club and looking down at hiram speculatively question is said the policeman what is he doing with two hats thats more than i can tell you officer answered the clerk ah hes coming to hiram sat up on the bench and pushed aside the drugsoaked handkerchief dad he murmured confusedly im not your dad said the officer im just the fellow who pulled you out of the crowd whered you get that hat hiram looked down his own hat was on his head and had in some manner remained with him throughout all the excitement but in his hand he was clutching like grim death a battered black stetson turning the hat over hiram looked into the crown the gilt letters u h met his eyes its dads hat he gurgled upton hill thats his name i knew i had a bean on the right number i i a bit of white showed under the sweatband westerners of a certain type sometimes carry important documents under the sweatband of their hats hiram pulled his object out of the stetson examined it and then inquired his way to the nearest telegraph office five minutes later he had sent the following telegram owen clancy the motor wizard phoenix arizona hot on the trail you said you would help me find dad come to los angeles at once and get busy meet me renfrew house hiram this heres a great day for me murmured hiram rubbing his bruises as he turned away from the operators window i reckon thatll fetch clancy if hes well enough to come him and me can run out this happy trail together with ground to spare that redheaded wizard has got more sense in a minute than i have in a year and i reckon well get along hes a good feller to tie to in a time like this chapter ii clancy hits the happy trail hows the shoulder clancy doctor ferguson asked as the young motor wizard walked into his office i know it belongs to me was the smiling reply every time i make a move but i guess its coming along all right at that doc no reason why it shouldnt youre as tough as a piece of whalebone and a little nick like that cant put you on the retired list sit down here ive got a few words to say to you the doctor indicated a chair close to his desk and then sank back in his own seat with the air of one who is about to say something weighty and important dont you try to scare me about anything doc said clancy apprehensively as he slid into the chair tush and the physician wagged his head you havent got sense enough to be scared at anything thats the main trouble with you its two weeks since you went to wickenburg and got in front of that bullet we kept you in bed for a week and now you have been on your feet for another week so far as the wound is concerned clancy you are all right but so far as something else is concerned you are all wrong fergusons eyes narrowed and he leveled a forefinger at his patient what happened up there at wickenburg he demanded what happened repeated clancy why you just spoke of that i got in front of a bullet stop trying to play horse with me went on the doctor sourly something took place between you and your partner lafe wynn at wickenburg and i want to know what it was clancy stiffened thats a personal matter doctor ferguson he answered and i dont have to explain it to anybody well you neednt get hot about it theres something on your mind and its holding back your complete recovery im asking questions and talking from the standpoint of your physician if i knew the nature of the thing that bothered you very possibly i could take means to counteract it clancy was impressed by fergusons shrewdness yet he had no intention of revealing the cause of his secret worry how could he tell ferguson or anybody else what really happened at wickenburg only two or three people knew that lafe wynn had forged clancys name to a check and had absconded with that money and with all the cash assets of the firm of clancy wynn only two or three knew how clancy had trailed wynn to wickenburg and had sent him back to phoenix to take charge of the squaredeal garage as usual while he clancy was in bed in the other town for a week apparently all was the same as it ever had been between the two partners in this instance however surface indications were not to be trusted clancys confidence in wynn had been rudely shattered the motor wizard had spared his partner had been generous with him in fact far beyond his deserts this was not particularly on wynns account but on account of wynns mother an old lady who had come to phoenix on the very day wynn had absconded mrs wynn proud of the business success her son had made had come to him so that he might make her a home in her declining years clancy had not the heart to tell the old lady the exact situation and he had gone to wickenburg to get lafe and make him return to phoenix wynn knew that clancy had spared him on his mothers account this knowledge caused a restraint between the two partners all the greater because wynns forgery and defalcation had wiped out all the cash assets of clancy and the firm some fifteen thousand dollars which had not been recovered clancy would not tell all this to any one for fear it might reach mrs wynn and he was anxious that wynn should have another chance without letting the one error of an otherwise blameless life weigh in the scales against him ill get along doctor observed clancy ill bet all the fretting i do wont land on me so hard you can notice it confound it burst out the doctor i do notice it youve got to get away from things for a while take the happy trail clancy and run it out i reckon you can afford it after the way you held up that streetcar company happy trail echoed clancy whats that its the carefree road of pure and unadulterated joy explained ferguson solemnly it takes you out of yourself gives you new scenes and experiences and finally you wake up feeling better than you ever felt before in your life lead me to it said clancy i wish i could was the answer but i cant a happy trail for you might be a mighty miserable one for me and vice versa youll have to find it for yourself clancy but when you do find it hit it hard thats a fine prescription i dont think laughed clancy getting up to leave you tell me what i must do but dont tell me how im to do it im as frank with you as you are with me growled ferguson goodby clancy got back to the squaredeal garage to find the whole force of employees moving the repair shop over to the garage known as the red star in order to keep rockwell of the red star from driving the squaredeal place out of business clancy had been forced to buy the building and lot that housed the establishment belonging to him and wynn he had consummated this deal for ten thousand dollars paying three thousand dollars down and getting time on the balance at seven per cent and the mortgage had come due just before wynn had absconded with all the cash resources a stroke of luck alone had saved clancy the streetcar company had suddenly developed a need for the property he had bought judge pembroke a friend of clancys did the negotiating with the result that the premises sold for twenty thousand dollars the judge knowing that clancy wynn would have to move and must have some place to go had secured an option on the redstar establishment for four thousand dollars so clancy had financed the tottering affairs of clancy wynn had bought rockwells old place and the transfer was in progress lafe wynn was overseeing the removal when clancy entered the garage lafe turned abruptly on his heel and walked into the office clancy followed him whats the matter with you lafe inquired clancy why do you take pains to avoid me all the time we cant get along like that and remain partners a look of suffering filled wynns face owen said he with an effort every time i look at you i think of what i am a thief and a forger only saved from the penitentiary by your generosity it isnt a pleasant thought for a man who wants to be independent if i could undo the wrong i did you if i could you can some time said clancy after you are able you can pay me back my just proportion of that fifteen thousand after i am able murmured lafe sarcastically that will be a matter of years owen i cant feel like this for years without going crazy if i could find my rascally brother gerald i i might induce him to give back the money never returned the motor wizard shortly your brother gerald has probably got rid of the money by this time there were two to help him spend it remember bob katz and hank burton those three would make it fly there were extenuating circumstances about what lafe wynn had done the extenuating circumstances were wrapped up in his unscrupulous brother gerald had told lafe a pretty fiction about needing money to save him from dishonor and lafe had covered himself with dishonor in order to help gerald no sooner had lafe secured the money than he and his two cronies had taken it and made good their escape this was when clancy had been wounded at the time he was seeking to help lafe save the fifteen thousand dollars i have got to make that loss up to you somehow muttered lafe and ive got to do it soon my conscience will send me to a madhouse if i dont clancy studied his partner curiously for a few moments lafe he went on presently you and i have got to get away from each other for a while we are simply millstones around each others neck you cant look at me without thinking you owe me the biggest part of fifteen thousand dollars and i cant look at you without thinking how you betrayed my confidence you can get rid of me owen in about two shakes said wynn kick me out i havent any right to be one of the firm anyhow the motor wizard shook his head youve got to hang on and make good in the place where you lost out clancy returned youve got to do this for the sake of your mother who thinks so much of you weve got to allow a little time you know for us to get back on our old footing i need a change ferguson says so and i have a feeling that he knows what he is talking about i a boy came into the office that moment with a telegram he knew the motor wizard by sight and went directly to him this is for you mr clancy said he clancy signed for the message tore it open read the contents and laughed by thunder he cried heres just the thing what do you mean asked wynn its a hurryup call from hiram hill you remember hiram wynn winced yes said he i remember hiram hill quite vividly he left phoenix for the coast several weeks ago carrying on his search for his father i always thought that search of hirams was more or less of a joke and i havent any positive information yet that it isnt but heres a message asking me to come to los angeles at once hiram says that he is hot on the trail and that i promised him to help him find his father which is true clancy arose with sudden determination in his voice and manner wynn he continued im going to leave you here to get clancy wynn started in the old rockwell garage it will give you plenty to occupy your mind while youre hard at it im going to soldier and have a good time heres where i hit the happy trail what in the deuce is the happy trail queried wynn ferguson will tell you about it im going with hiram on a wildgoose chase and im hoping to have some fun when i come back old man i want you to be feeling differently and i expect to be feeling differently myself this afternoon i am starting for the pacific coast and if hiram and i between us cant stir up a few thrills and corral a little enjoyment then ive got another guess coming lafe im for the happy trail and im going to hit it hard chapter iii hatching a plot say fellows heres a howdedo and no mistake you ought to have been at the corner of sixth and main about two hours ago youd have seen something that would have made a horse laugh but theres something back of it that isnt so thundering funny at that gerald wynn could smoke a cigarette and talk at the same time he burst into the room in the cheap boarding house where he and his friends had taken up their headquarters and eased himself of the foregoing remarks hank burton and bob katz sat at a table playing cards there were a bottle and two glasses on the table katz was smoking a pipe and burton a cigar hanged if i care a hoot about anything just now but annexing a little kale said burton turning in his chair to look at gerald with a scowl here i havent a sou in my jeans and ive got as much right to that fifteen thousand as you or katz have wynn fork over a hundred im tired of bein broke nary i dont fork wynn answered positively you know what were going to do with this money hank and you know that if we start to break into it the whole will go and well be up a spout on this tia juana business blast the tia juana business a bird in the hand beats a whole flock in the bush give me my share now gerald and you and bob can do what you blamed please with your own part of the swag that wont go spoke up katz the share we want in that gamblin layout below the border will take all the fifteen thousand you agreed to go inter it hank dont crawfish now i want somethin to jingle in my pocket barked burton take a couple o nails suggested katz i allow its right funny to you continued burton sourly but it aint pleasant to go around with nary a red in your pants im paying your expenses hank put in gerald staked to your three squares your smoking and your travel pay i dont see what more you need if this tia juana scheme works out well all of us get rich i want a little loose cash now cried burton go out and work for it then said gerald out of patience if we put anything into the tia juana game its got to be fifteen thousand and id be mighty foolish to give you money out of our capital give it to me out of your own pocket if you dont want to give me any of the capital ive got just enough to get us to catalina where were to see jack lopez and clean up the tia juana business why dont you do a little something on the side hank youre a champion swimmer go to some natatorium and give swimming lessons that would be easy money gammon snorted burton in a fit of anger he jumped to his feet and he would have left the room but gerald stood in front of the door and barred the way now dont get ugly said gerald ive got something to tell you thats mighty interesting i think fellows that we have been trailed from phoenix that was more than interesting burtons flash of temper left him at once and he and katz showed their apprehension who trailed us demanded katz that crosseyed towheaded freak hiram hill how do you know he trailed us asked burton well hes in los angeles it isnt a happenchance that were here at the same time when did you see hill went on katz about two hours ago at the corner of sixth and main he he gerald paused to laugh i dont see anythin humorous in this layout grunted burton if weve been trailed to los wed better be diggin out instead of enjoyin the situation whats funny about it gerald asked katz there was a chink dragon going down the street you know the kind a dragon in sections with a yellow boy under each section well i was watching the procession when i heard some one yell dad in a voice that sounded pretty familiar the next minute who but hiram hill knocked a hole in that chink snake he was trying to get to a man who sat in an automobile on the other side of the street in about two seconds there was the biggest kind of a roughhouse i kept out of it and saw hiram get to the automobile and begin hugging the chap in the tonneau the fellow in the car didnt like it and the driver started up and hill was left behind the crowd rolled over the place where hill was lying and i saw him picked up by a couple of policemen and carried to a drug store naturally i was in a good deal of a taking not knowing but hill had been following me see well i waited till he came out of the drug store then i camped on his trail for a while he went to a telegraph office and sent a telegram who did he send it to cut in burton apprehensively what do i know about that you dont think i was foolish enough to go close and try to get a line on what hill was writing do you well after he left the telegraph office he went to the renfrew house i reckon thats where he stays i dont like this a little bit commented katz i allow wed better duck and do it pronto if hill is really trailin us maybe he has sent a telegraft message to the sheriff back in phoenix we got to look sharp gerald or well be pinched thats my motion bob said burton hanged if this hill business hasnt got me on the run dont fret continued gerald reassuringly ive hatched a plot that will take care of hill all right plot said burton what sort of a plot listen hank you know about this hill ive told you and bob how hes got a fool bee in his bonnet and is running around the southwest looking for his father the old man judging from his photograph which hill totes around in his pocket is a bigger freak than hiram is hes got a beak like a pelican and is homely enough to stop a clock you know plenty about hill and his hunt for his dad returned burton you flimflammed hill out of five hundred by offering to take him across the mexican boundary and showing him where his father could be found said burton with a laugh but you got the money and hill got the experience he added which said gerald calmly is mainly the reason why hill is trying to get even with me i know enough about hills father though to put over a scheme that will get this crosseyed buttinsky off our track whats the scheme inquired katz it hinges on this point that hiram hill would rather find his father than get even with me for that con game i worked on him im going to write hiram a letter bob and send it to him at the renfrew house what sort of a letter put in burton im going to sign the name of his father upton hill to the thing and play up that incident at sixth and main pretty strong wheres that pen and ink hank and give me a sheet of paper and envelope while his companions got the writing materials gerald seated himself at a table and began getting his thoughts busy by the time pen ink and paper were put in front of him he had his letter mapped out in his mind and had only to put it upon paper wont hiram know that the letter isnt in his dads handwritin suggested katz i reckon he wont answered gerald craftily leaning back in his chair with the letter in his hand its been some sort of a while bob since the first klondike rush when old up hill disappeared it isnt likely that hiram remembers anything about his fathers handwriting heres what the letter says dear son was it really you who jumped aboard my automobile at the corner of sixth and main this morning my conscience has been troubling me ever since i have hunted up the policeman and secured from him your name and address but am in a hurry to get back to san diego where i live and cannot remain in los angeles to prosecute a personal search for you if you are really my son come to san diego make my house at eighteentwenty q street your home and i will ask you certain questions whose answers will prove indisputably whether or not you are my son i must have the proof you know because i am a very rich man and you as my sole relative will inherit everything i leave hoping to see you in san diego at your earliest convenience i remain yours expectantly upton hill gerald dropped the letter on the table and looked up at his friends with a guileful smile hows that for a bait he asked bully declared katz hiram hill will tumble all over himself to go to san diego whatll happen when he cant find any upton hill in san diego said burton we dont care what happens then answered gerald by that time you know we ought to have finished our deal with jack lopez and to be away from catalina and where hill will never be able to find us how do you know he gave his name and address to a policeman continued burton thats what people always do when they get into trouble on the street or meet with an accident isnt it maybe it is but if it happens that hill didnt give his name and address to the cop the fact will queer that whole letter i allow hank is right gerald chimed in katz this here is one of them cases where you cant be too careful reckon id write another letter and change that its not necessary insisted gerald hill was stunned if he cant remember giving his name and address to the policeman hell think he did it at a time when he didnt know what he was doing the letter goes as i have written it gerald began addressing the envelope both the sheet of paper and the envelope were plain and bore no clew of the hotel in which they had been written the letter was folded thrust into the envelope and the envelope sealed and stamped its dinner time fellows announced gerald and well post this on our way to the noon eats come on they all got up and left the room when do we hike for the island gerald asked katz as they went downstairs well pull out for san pedro tomorrow and catch the morning boat was the reply we want to wind up our business with lopez and clear out before hill discovers that letter is a fake and gets back from san diego we can turn the trick with ground to spare dont fret about that chapter iv clancy reaches los angeles the renfrew house was a very modest hostelry in south hill street hiram stopped there because the establishment was in hill street and he believed in omens incidentally too he preferred the renfrew to the alexandria or the hayward because the rates on the american plan were two dollars a day it was about eleven oclock monday morning when clancy entered the lobby of the renfrew house the lobby was crowded bell hops were hustling back and forth and the place was as busy as a highclass establishment clancy stood at the counter caught the clerks eye and asked for hiram hill the clerk who had curly hair and parted it squarely in the middle forthwith gave the newcomer his full and complete attention you a friend of that guys the clerk asked yes acknowledged clancy then im mighty glad you showed up why well i think hes locoed and needs a keeper about every day he does some fool thing clancy grinned what has he done today nothing yet but hes due to break out most any minute you wait around a spell and youll the clerk was interrupted by a wild whoop of dad heres hiram clancy looked in the direction from which the yell came and saw a little group of people heaving around the lobby in excitement thats him now cried the clerk what did i tell you the motor wizard hurried toward the scene of the commotion he found a fat man pounding a dent out of the crown of a shabby silk hat and mumbling wrathfully get an officer shouted the fat man i dont know but im robbed hiram hill stood in front of the aggrieved gentleman stood and stared at him blankly i i thought you was my dad murmured hiram your dad repeated the fat man glaring you ought to be arrested for that anyhow i refuse to be insulted by gorry whats your name anyhow the fat man was feeling about his person making sure that his watch pocketbook and other person property were safe that mole on the back of your neck explained hiram was what caused me to make the bobble well snorted the fat man walking off dont make any more bobbles around me or therell be trouble its my opinion that youre crazy the crowd set up a laugh clancy elbowed his way to hills side and took him by the hand howdy hiram said he clancy exclaimed hill say the sight of you is good for sore eyes i just been hankerin for a friend you need a guardeen moren a friend remarked some one hill began to bristle and to look around in search of the one who had spoken clancy grabbed his arm and drew him away down the lobby to a couple of leather chairs whats the matter with you hiram the motor wizard asked i reckon my nerves have got twisted clancy hill answered im all in a twitter seems like ever since i piped off dad in that automobile last saturday mornin i havent been able to look around without seein some un i thinks him queer aint it im all flustered better put the clamps on your nerves hiram or youll be in jail the first thing you know hows the shoulder coming along in fine shape i didnt know whether youd be able to answer that there telegram of mine in person and if you was able i didnt know whether you would look here hiram said clancy didnt i tell you id help you find your father if youd keep mum about what lafe wynn did uhhuh well i always try to pay my debts got any trace o gerald wynn burton and katz yet no then that fifteen thou is gone for good im afraid so but lets not talk about that you say youre hot on the trail of your father tell me about it hiram started with the chinese procession at sixth and main streets very earnestly he told how he had disrupted the dragon and he described other events that happened down to the point where he found himself with the extra stetson in his hand that hat declared hiram sure belonged to dad i got it away from him somehow and i hung to it all the while my wits was woolgatherin and i was bein toted to a drug store then i say what you laughin at clancy had been enjoying hills recital to the limit it would be hard to mix six dozens of eggs a chinese dragon and a runaway monkey into a smallsized riot and not get a little fun out of it the sober matteroffact way in which hiram narrated the details added to the humor of the story never mind what im laughing at hiram sputtered clancy wiping his eyes you say you found something under the sweatband of that stetson what was it a card here it is hill thrust a hand into one of his pockets and drew forth an oblong square of pasteboard this he handed to his companion sr j lopez was the name on the card followed by the address avalon catalina island california then in the lower lefthand corner were the words representing the fortunatus syndicate of tia juana mexico what do you make out of this hiram the motor wizard asked what do you make out of it countered hill if you are sure the stetson belonged to the man in the automobile to the man whom you thought was your father ill take my solemn alfred on that well if this is the mans business card it proves that the man is j lopez and he cant be your father thats not his business card clancy how do you know there was two gilt letters pasted in the crown o that stetson and them letters was u h sabe my dads name is upton hill clancy was suitably impressed well whos this j lopez and the fortunatus syndicate he inquired those are two things we ought to find out im wise to the fortunatus syndicate all right said hill you remember i was down in tia juana that time i got hornswoggled out o five hundred dollars by gerald wynn well i heard about this fortunatus syndicate while i was in the place some americanos are planning a gambling resort just across the boundary line and they call their company the fortunatus syndicate and your dads mixed up with it hiram that doesnt speak very well for him maybe hes mixed up in it and maybe he isnt i wouldnt go and connect him with any gamblin syndicate just because i found that there card under the sweatband of his stetson what do you allow is the thing for us to do my hands on the table clancy and i want you to help me play it strikes me said clancy reflectively that the best move is to go across to catalina island and talk with this man lopez i allowed wed better advertise in the papers remarked hill we could use the lost and found column how well we could say lost one man about fifty with a squinch eye a roman nose and a mole on the back of his neck answers to name of upton hill communicate with hiram hill renfrew house city and then we could put in another like this found one black stetson initials u h in crown picked up corner sixth and maine time the chink dragon went to pieces communicate with hiram hill and so forth i dont see any use in huntin up this lopez your father must have business with lopez hiram or he wouldnt be having the mexicans card would he i reckon not its likely your father is over at catalina now if we go to the island and hunt up lopez theres a chance of our locating upton hill or the man you think is upton hill maybe youre right said hill i dont think advertising would do any good your supposed father didnt seem very enthusiastic about meeting you the time you landed on him in the automobile hills cross eyes blinked it was the way i come at him said he i been thinkin since there was a hull lot of excitement and ill gamble dad didnt have time to get the run o what was happenin he didnt have no good chance to be affectionate i suppose not returned clancy trying hard to keep a straight face the trail seems to be a pretty warm one all right and where are you going clancy broke off his remarks to grab hold of hiram and restrain him the towheaded chap had suddenly leaped out of his chair like a restive wild cat aint that dad over yonder he asked i see a feller that seems to be built on the same lines of the photograft but nnno he finished musingly that fellers a mexican letter for you mr hill said a bell boy coming across the lobby from the clerks desk hill took the letter wonderingly stared at it tore it open and then sank into a chair while he read the communication presently he began to breathe hard and to gurgle in his throat i knew the old man didnt have a marble heart he muttered joyfully i reckoned hed come around if id only give him time enough the trails a short one clancy and it leads to san diego instead of to catalina there and he thrust the letter into the motor wizards hand read that chapter v the motor wizards judgment this has a fishy look to me hiram said clancy after reading the letter upton hill who claims to have written it says he got your address from the policeman who pulled you out of the melee and helped you to the drug store mighty queer he couldnt spend time to call on you after getting your address instead of putting you to all the expense of going to san diego to find him dont be a wet blanket blame it begged hill only dad i got in the world and here you go to throwin cold water on his motives did you give your address to the policeman give it up i was plump batty just after i got away from that mob and i dont know what i did reckon i must have given up the information or dad couldnt have got it and sent me that letter the motor wizard was conscious of a deep distrust regarding that communication upon which hill was setting such store instinctively he had become suspicious and the more he considered the letters contents the more suspicious he became do you recognize your fathers handwriting hiram asked clancy well hardly was the grinning response dad got lost in the shuffle almost before id cut my teeth im not familiar with his handwritin did you read what he says about bein well off gosh say im lible to come into some money i reckon this is one time my cups right side up when it rains good luck havent you got a sample of your fathers penmanship anywhere hiram not that i know anythin about you see all the letters hed written i left back home and hill paused abruptly gee he went on reaching into the breast pocket of his coat i allow i have got a scrap o dads writin its on the back o that photograft he drew the photograph into sight turned it over and pushed it under clancys eyes there and he pointed with his finger thats a sample o dads fist upton hill age thirtysix this was all the writing on the back of the photograph it was enough however clancy compared the name signed to the letter with that on the photograph it could be seen at a glance that the same hand had not written the two signatures they were utterly different just as i imagined observed clancy hiram either your father did not write what is on the back of the photograph or else that letter is a forgery the same hand did not trace the two signatures look you can see that just as plainly as i can hill took the letter in one hand and the photograph in the other squinted up his cross eyes and tried to institute comparisons the signature aint the same he finally agreed and thats a fact which proves that the letters a forgery im not asayin that clancy it cant be that dad wrote whats on the back o the picter you have always thought he did the writing on the back of the photograph havent you then youre thinking he didnt now so you can believe the letters genuine well what of it id a heap rather pin my faith to the writin in the letter than to whats on the photograft clancy saw that argument was useless hill was completely carried away with the letter for it steered him along the line of least resistance right into the haven of his happiest desires he believed in that letter because he wanted to believe in it and for no other earthly reason then said the motor wizard quietly you think youll go to san diego and not to catalina island whats the use o wastin time on catalina when that letter tells us right where to go demanded hill youre goin with me aint you not if youre going right away hiram i just reached los angeles after a long ride from phoenix and im not going to hit the iron trail again before i have a chance to get the cinders out of my eyes and the dust off my face if youre going to san diego this afternoon or tonight youll go alone you dont take any stock in this letter at all huh no who do you think wrote it if it wasnt my lost dad i dont know who wrote it well grumbled hiram i wont start for san diego afore tomorrow i want you to be along and im waitin over sost to have you spose we go and eat registered yet ill register now said clancy and then well sit in at the chuck table and have dinner he went over to the desk alone put down his name and then wrote out a telegram he handed it to a boy along with some money and asked that the message be put on the wires as soon as possible after that he went to his room got the dust and cinders off his face and out of his hair joined hill and the two went into the dining room together clancy was determined to make the most of his happy trail and directly after dinner proposed that he and hill should spend the afternoon at one of the beaches hill who was all wrapped up in san diego now that he had received that supposed letter from his father consented reluctantly the two boarded an electric car and went to venice there was a big crowd at this particular beach hill in spite of the fact that he professed to believe his father was in san diego was scanning every face he passed for the beetling brow retreating chin roman nose and squint eye he acted so wild and unreasonable that clancy was tempted to believe he had gone daffy on the subject of his lost father he would run up to a man with a prominent nose grab him by the shoulders and study his face in a search for the other specifications once he was knocked down and another time he was nearly arrested when an irate man whom he had stopped to investigate raised a shout for a policeman look here hiram remonstrated the motor wizard drawing his towheaded friend apart if youre convinced your father is in san diego what the deuce are you expecting to see him here in venice for i got the habit of lookin answered hill lamely and seems like i cant give it up well youve got to give it up for the rest of today or you and i will separate here and now you act as though you had just escaped from a lunatic asylum and when people see me they are apt to think there are two of us they went out on the pleasure pier bought post cards to send to their friends had their pictures taken on a couple of burros and finally got into bathing suits and went into the surf hill at last forgot about his lost parent and let himself loose for a good time both he and clancy enjoyed themselves to the limit refreshed by their plunge in the ocean they went into a restaurant and did ample justice to a splendid meal after that they started back to los angeles this here has been a great afternoon clancy sighed hiram sinking back in the car seat and showing his weariness we havent done much toward runnin out the trail but we can begin on that again tomorrow im running out my own trail hiram laughed clancy eh returned hill blankly the motor wizard did not explain his companion he knew would not have understood him if he had explained but clancy realized that he was more contented in mind than he had been at any time during the last two weeks tired though he was it was astonishing how much better he felt new sights and new scenes thought clancy do a lot to put new life into a fellow im beginning to wish i had taken this happy trail a long time ago it was ten oclock when they walked into the lobby of the renfrew house as they stopped at the counter to get the keys to their rooms clancy asked the clerk if there was a telegram for him the clerk thumbed over a bunch of messages and tossed out one owen clancy he queried there you are i hope it aint wynn wirin you to come back remarked hill with sudden foreboding it isnt from wynn said clancy i know that before i open it ill bet something handsome its from the chief of police at san diego the chief of police whats he wiring you for come over here hiram and ill explain clancy led his companion to a couple of chairs now said he after they had seated themselves were about to decide whether were going to catalina island in the morning or to san diego thats already decided asserted hill whatever makes you think it aint look at that letter you received at noon hiram went on clancy you were asked to come to eighteentwenty q street werent you yes hiram answered consulting the letter well explained clancy i wired the chief of police at san diego asking him who lives at that number in q street if this reply to my message says that upton hill lives at that address then ill congratulate you and we will go on together to san diego in the morning sure but if the message says that some one else lives at the address its proof positive that your letter was a fake and that going to san diego is worse than a waste of time eh lets see what the message says parried hill clancy opened it removed the folded yellow sheet opened it out and he and hill read the following owen clancy renfrew house los angeles no such street as q in the city no such man as upton hill in directory never heard of him pennypacker chief of police what do you think of that asked clancy i reckon your judgment is good clancy answered the baffled hill if it wasnt id not have asked you to help me run out this trail then well cut out san diego and go to catalina whats the use o goin to san diego lookin for a street they havent got in the town of course well try the island nothin else for us to do chapter vi the glassbottom boat the distance from the mainland to the island of catalina is only about twenty miles and the steamer from san pedro makes the trip in something like two hours and a half at ten oclock in the morning clancy and hill went aboard at tenfifteen the boat got under way and promptly at tenseventeen hiram became seasick there wasnt anything halfway about it either he was sick all through and all over for an hour he was afraid he was going to die and for an hour and a half he was afraid he wasnt clancy was so busy with hill that he had no time to enjoy the trip as soon as the boat tied up at the avalon pier and the gangplank was run out hill galloped ashore and sank down on the dock with a groan of thanksgiving clancy hurried after him picked him up and supported him to solid earth i thought you were a better sailor than that hiram chuckled clancy me a sailor whimpered hill say it always makes my stomach do a hornpipe just to look at a picture of the sea i cant cross a creek on a bridge without getting separated from my last meal darn it this is why i wanted to find my lost dad in san diego i could go there by land clancy im goin to stay on this island and live and die here i wont never go back lets find a restaurant somewhere and fill up i never was so empty in all my life finding a restaurant was not difficult for the little town was full of them a rattling good fish dinner put hill in a pleasanter mood so that his wretchedness of the morning survived as only a faint and faroff memory senor jack lopez had a curio store on the main street of the town the investigators were directed to his place of business but to their disappointment lopez was away on the other side of the island and would not be back until evening as they came out of the curio store a man approached them and sounded the praises of the glass bottom boats ugh said hiram trying to get away no boats for mine but you dont want to leave the island without seeing the marine gardens exclaimed the man there are enough gardens on shore to do me answered hill my friend is afraid hell get seasick observed clancy with a wink you cant get seasick in one o my boats any moren you could on land averred the runner we jest go out around by the sugarloaf were close inshore all the time its makin me feel faint just to talk about it said hill come on clancy he caught the motor wizards arm and tried to drag him off clancy however held back ive heard a lot about these glassbottom boats said he and ill have to take a trip in one if you dont want to go hiram you can sit on the dock and wait till i come back no you dont growled hiram you and me dont get separated this trip if i can help it if youre going clancy ill go too even if it kills me you wont be the least mite sick friend the runner insisted if you are ill give up your fare that wont be a patchin to what ill give up if you have to give up my fare commented hill i only hope i dont step so hard on the glassbottom that i go through you cant do that the man laughed this way gents he led them out on a pier and down a flight of steps to a float alongside of which a boat was moored the boat was a flatbottom affair rigged with a canopy top and having seats along the sides extending down the middle of the craft was something which looked like a long box open at the top the lower side of the box was covered with glass passengers on the seats could look into the box through the glass bottom and see objects on the oceans bed with wonderful clearness a man up near the prow did the rowing i claim said the runner that this heres the only kind of a boat to use in seein the marine gardens we can go places in these little boats that they cant get to in the big ones that must have been a particularly slack day for the glassbottom boats for clancy and hill were the only passengers on this particular craft i reckon thats all ike said the man who had brought the two youths to the boat let er go ike proceeded to use the oars and while the boat rounded the end of the pier hiram hung to his seat with both hands and looked wildly and expectantly at clancy beginnin to feel squeamish mumbled hiram dont think about it returned the motor wizard look down at the marine gardens hiram hill gradually forgot his uneasiness there was hardly any motion to the boat save a slow steady gliding onward off avalon there is no surf the tides rise and fall as on the mainland but the sea is usually as quiet as the waters of a pond there were other glassbottom boats out that afternoon and they were scattered just off shore to sugarloaf rock and beyond not far from the towering rock were two or three rowboats each manned by an oarsman and carrying a man in a bathing suit thems divers explained ike nodding to the men in the bathing suits didnt you see em when your boat come in no answered hill i was too busy gettin ashore what were those divers doing when our boats came in passengers were throwin money overboard and they were divin for it youll see em when you get in the steamer to go back to pedro over yan by ole sugarloaf the divers goes down under the glass bottoms looks up at you from below makes faces throws kisses at the girls and i dont know what all likewise they brings up abalone shells you can see em brought up and can buy em for a quarter apiece a very pretty and interestin souvenir of your trip to the island now look down for were right over the gardens its funny remarked hill that im such a good swimmer when this seasickness takes holt o me so hard and quick maybe if id swim the ocean the water wouldnt bother my stummick at all i the words died on hills lips he suddenly found himself gazing from one world into another of weird beauty and wondrous enchantment beneath his eyes and clancys there unfolded a landscape of rainbow tints flecking a forest of softly waving trees some of the trees bore fruit and in and out among their branches swam fishes of silver and gold it was like fairyland that landscape on the bed of the sea beats anything i ever seen whispered the entranced hiram if a mermaid was to float up to the glass bottom of this here boat and shake a finger at me id go right over the side and join her in them pretty gardens wonderful exclaimed clancy look at the rocks and shells you can see them as clearly as though they were out of the water and on the land them forests explained ike are made of kelp from kelp is where we get our iodine of commerce it takes four hundred pounds of kelp to make one pound of iodine and a million pounds of the iodine o commerce snorted hiram aint worth one pound o kelp down below and growin same as we see what do they want to root it up for why dont they leave it where it is to please the eye that looks down through these glassbottom boats i pass answered ike wearily i aint no philosopher thataway kelps no good and iodines useful thats all i know divers goin over and comin this way he added with sudden animation watch close now and maybe youll see him pick up an abalone shell and look up and make faces its right remarkable how long some o them divers can stay under the water look sharp clancy and hill looked sharp but they couldnt see anything of the diver shucks grunted ike he come up for another boat afore he got here but hell be along after a spell ike rested from his rowing a bit and filled and lighted his pipe up there said he waving his hand aloft is the towerin summits o black jack and orizaba if youre goin to be on the island overnight you dont want to miss the coach trip to the top o the uplifts its ten miles up and two miles back same road all the way he chuckled as he exhaled a cloud of smoke and the round trip is only eight miles itll cost you a dollar apiece and you dont want to miss it clancy and hill had already discovered that the inhabitants of avalon had a hand out for tourist money when one had got all he could of a guileless sightseer he passed him on to a brother who had something else to show but they were a kindly lot those avalonians for all that now watch warned ike here the diver comes for sure this time ike was correct clancy and hill peering through the glass bottom of the boat saw a human form glide gracefully to a point directly underneath turn over on its back and float face upward full a dozen feet below the surface the diver commenced to throw kisses and to make faces but he suddenly ceased that pleasing performance his face abruptly froze as with horror and his wide eyes looked up at the two faces staring down through the glass a sharp exclamation escaped clancys lips hill gave a yell sat up and began tearing off his coat hat and vest its its hank burton he murmured far gone with wonder its gerald wynns pard and he helped walk off with your fifteen thousand clancy whats he doin in the marine gardens id like to know wouldnt this put kinks into your intelleck say hiram hill was climbing up on his seat bending low to avoid hitting the canopy top what are you going to do shouted clancy im goin down into the marine gardens lookin for trouble if i can get my lunch hooks on that chap below ill bring him aboard or ashore or well both stay down in the kelp till the crack o doom you hear me clancy that feller gave us the slip once but hell not do it again with that hiram hill kicked off his shoes rolled over the rail and went into the water with a splash clancy reached for him but was a minute too late for his fingers clutched only empty air look whispered ike huskily leaning over the glass bottom and staring for the love o mike look whats goin on down there chapter vii at the base of old sugarloaf clancy and ike had the privilege of seeing one of the strangest sights that any one ever saw through a glassbottom boat they saw a halfclad man grab another in a bathing suit and immediately a submarine wrestling match was staged burton gripped hill about the throat and hills fingers slipped forthwith to burtons windpipe the scene grew more and more horrible as the moments passed and clancy fell to throwing aside his garments preparatory to making a trip of his own to the marine gardens wait clamored ike excitedly theyve broke loose from each other theyre comin up dont go in clancy took another look through the glass burtons face was livid and ghastly and it was plain that he was hard put to it for breath with feeble faltering strokes he was coming to the surface hill was following him as relentlessly as a shark the rowboat from which burton had dived came alongside the flatbottom craft the fellow at the oars clancy did not know the motor wizard had half expected to see either gerald wynn or bob katz but the oarsman was neither of these whats happened he asked a tense note of alarm in his voice before ike could answer burtons head bobbed to the surface and a gurgling cry for help floated over the water wait a minute called clancy catching the side of the smaller boat before the man at the oars could get away from ikes craft i guess ill go with you without much difficulty clancy transferred himself from one boat to the other you neednt wait for us ike he called have our clothes ready for us when we call for them thats all whatre you trying to do demanded the oarsman weve got two fellows to pick up clancy answered and im going to help are you a friend of burtons i get half he makes for handlin the boat for him how long has he been doing this yesterday and today and your name is mynie boltwood well right mynie boltwood steady it is now and well pick up the two in the water never mind me clancy sang out hill who had come to the surface and was swimming easily despite the weight of the wet clothing he had on burton is purty nigh tuckered take care o him first burton was a splendid swimmer there was no doubt about that but his ordeal in the water had told on him severely he grabbed clancys outstretched hand desparingly and was assisted to climb over the bulwarks once aboard he fell in a sprawl on the boats bottom breathing heavily hiram hill got into the boat much more easily lifting his dripping body to a seat he grinned and shook the long towcolored hair back from his face how was that for hi he asked it was a great piece of work clancy answered admiringly youre certainly there with the goods when it comes to swimming i thought for a time that both you and burton would be drowned we could have got him just as easily hiram if you hadnt gone into the water i wanted to make sure that was all boltwood called clancy put us all ashore on the rocks at the foot of old sugarloaf well bask in the sun for a while and ill talk a little with burton were old friends you know and here clancy smiled the last person in the world i was expecting to see through the glass bottom of that boat was hank burton it was the surprise of my life and no mistake there was something here which mynie boltwood could not understand he was not ambitious in the acquirement of knowledge however and merely did as he was told and let it go at that burton sat up in the boats bottom and peered at clancy feeling better hank the motor wizard inquired pleasantly whatre you and hill doing here inquired burton confusedly we reckoned you were in san diego oh you did returned clancy you must know something about that letter hiram received inviting him to hang up his hat in q street and feel at home burton realizing that he had said something he hadnt ought to bit his lip angrily howd you happen to come to catalina he went on the happy trail branched in this direction eh well clancy laughed hiram came to catalina to find his father and im helping in the search weve got a few things to discuss hank and i think well do the chinning ashore by that time the boat was grounded among the rocks close to the foot of old sugarloaf i havent got a thing to discuss with you snarled burton and im not goin ashore sure you are declared clancy youd a heap rather go ashore and talk matters over with hiram and me than go to jail wouldnt you now fire snapped in the motor wizards eyes and his voice although it was like velvet cut like steel burton saw there was no use trying to hang back if wynn hadnt made me work for a little money growled burton this wouldnt a happened whats that nothing boltwood had jumped to the rocks and was holding the boat by the painter hill followed him out of the craft and now burton followed hill clancy was last to leave the boat he walked up toward the base of sugarloaf rock boltwood he called you stay there and take care of the boat burton you and hill come up here with me the excitement that had claimed the passengers in ikes boat had been missed by the other boats the rest of the glassbottom fleet had gone around sugarloaf rock and clancy was now able to look across the low rise of rocks separating the headland from the shore and see the other sightseers hill and i came over here to find hills father said clancy turning to burton and we find you that strikes me as being mighty strange hank what are you and gerald wynn and bob katz doing here who said gerald and bob were with me returned burton sullenly you said something before we got out of the boat which proved to me that gerald wynn was here with you and if gerald is here katz is along too why are you in this place burton did not answer why did one of you write that letter to hill and try to get him to san diego still nothing from burton did you fellows bring the fifteen thousand with you clancys voice was sharp as he put this question it must be clear to you returned burton that i havent any of that fifteen thousand if i had do you think id be divin for quarters the motor wizard seated himself on a bowlder the sun was hot but a cool breeze from the sea tempered its warmth as he stared at the stubborn face of burton his eyes hardened hank he went on i havent any cause to love you or gerald wynn or bob katz one of you put a bullet into my shoulder at the old adobe near wickenburg the three of you also made off with fifteen thousand dollars belonging to me and to lafe wynn now i can put you through for all that and put you through good and hard even if i cant get hands on gerald and katz ive got you securely do you want to save yourself or dont you save myself how why by helping me get back that stolen money tell us where gerald wynn and katz are hiding themselves where the money is and how were to get hold of it think im a squealer demanded burton indignantly where are your clothes clancy asked boltwood knows the motor wizard walked down to the waters edge boltwood said he i want you to go and get burtons clothes also get from ike the clothes belonging to hill and me bring them back here and listen dont say a word to anybody about what happened understand i dont know whats happened or whats goin on now answered boltwood so how can i talk just remember that then heres a fivedollar gold piece for you do as i tell you and youll be all right do something else and youll find yourself in more trouble than burton is in im no fool i guess mumbled boltwood pouching the gold piece i dont pry into things that aint my business ill row across and get the clothes he sprang into the boat pushed off and began using the oars vigorously the motor wizard turned thoughtfully and walked back to the place where he had left hill and burton hank burton had issued his defiance he was not a squeeler but he was apprehensive regarding clancys next move whatre you goin to do he asked im sending for your clothes was the reply then what why then ill find some place where i can make a complaint against you you think more of your pals liberty than you do of your own but thats your lookout not mine if you want to go to jail and leave gerald wynn and bob katz free to spend that fifteen thousand why have it that way clancys tone was relentless burton knew enough of the motor wizard to understand that he would do what he said he would the chap in the bathing suit walked back and forth among the rocks for a few moments then finally he flung up his hands helplessly and halted in front of clancy youve got the whip hand as usual said he with a tinge of bitterness ill exchange what i know for my liberty what am i to tell you chapter viii treachery that succeeded and failed the motor wizard congratulated himself for a moment that he had won hank burton over to his side in the argument but only for a moment even as clancy was getting ready to frame his first question burton took to his heels and ran like a deer toward the other side of sugarloaf rock on that side three persons had landed in a small boat they had secured their boat by twisting the painter around a rock and were now climbing old sugarloaf burton must have seen this landing party while walking back and forth and turning clancys proposition over in his mind he had gained a little time by seeming to fall in with clancys desires but now the mask was dropped consarn the critter whooped hiram stop him clancy stop him this is exactly what clancy was trying to do but the feat was physically impossible burton had too long a lead snatching the painter from the rock the fleeing rascal sprang into the boat picked up the oars and was twenty feet from shore before clancy and hill came to the waters edge guess again taunted burton applying himself vigorously to the oars this island aint so big shouted hiram furiously the steamer for san pedro has gone and theres no other boat for the mainland until tomorrow you aint out o this yet hank burton what burton thought regarding this did not appear he put all his energy into his rowing and was soon halfway across the bay if wed toted a popper bewailed hiram this couldnt have happened popper questioned clancy meanin gun with a sixshooter we could have drawn a bead on mister man in the boat and fetched him ashore blame it i sure hate to see him get away after bein to so much trouble ketchin him the motor wizard felt in the same way but there was no use crying over spilled milk mynie boltwood got back from the other side of the bay with a load of clothes and hill removed his wet garments wrung them out dried them in the sun and was soon back in his complete wardrobe and but little the worse for his drenching clancy hoping to develop something in the nature of a clew searched the pockets of burtons clothes he found nothing to repay his search now inquired hill gloomily whats the next step we came here to find your father hiram clancy answered and suddenly got switched off into another trail now well get back to the work that originally brought us to the island and let that bunch o grafters go i dont see what we can do at present we can set the police on their trail clancy shook his head that wont do hiram he answered i made a crack of that kind at burton but it was only a bluff the moment we ring in the police that moment we lift the veil on lafe wynn lafe must be protected at any cost if we could get back the money by our own efforts that would be all right what weve got to avoid is making this thing too public well return to the curio store and see if lopez has got back from the other side of the island mynie boltwood displayed little curiosity regarding burton the fivedollar gold piece had evidently blinded him muzzled him and tied up his ears he rowed clancy and hill back to the pier and they left the boat and proceeded to the establishment of jack lopez lopez looked a good deal like a man who might deal in dazzling futures taking care that all the profit came to himself he was swarthy and goodnatured but with a crafty eye the fortunatus syndicate he said with an airy laugh gentlemen it is gone as you say where the woodbine twineth yes for two years past the concession was granted by diaz for a great plant dedicated to the god of luck at tia juana but well diaz went out and some one else came in down below the border nothing remains as it was for long it took what you call too much money to grease the wheels the syndicate dropped one hundred thousand dollars and thought that was plenty no no you can not invest in fortunatus for there is no fortunatus this is your card isnt it inquired clancy offering for inspection the card found wider the sweatband of the stetson why si i used that card at the time the tia juana matter looked very bright and promising now though i use the card no more did you ever see a feller like this put in hiram handing over the photograph of his father lopez looked at the photograph started took it in his hands and gave it a more careful scrutiny as i live said he it is the picture of my good friend captain hogan of the steam yacht sylvia look and lopez lifted and leveled a forefinger they were standing in front of the curio store and the stores all along that street overlooked the bay lopez indicated a trimlooking craft painted white and with the sun striking gleams from dazzling brasswork floating at anchor far from the shore line that continued lopez is my good friends boat her home port is san diego and she can be chartered by any one with the price hogan is at the island for a few days looking for customers disappointment struck heavily at hiram hills heart and was reflected in his face you say his name is hogan he asked yes whats time whole of his handle uriah hogan strange you do not know since you have his picture theres a whole lot o things i dont know answered hiram and am just beginnin to find out was capn hogan over to los angeles last saturday he was he has told me about it he returned to the island sunday do you happen to know where i can find him why yes in the quarter of the town called buena vista there is a bungalow called the rest a while there captain hogan stays whenever he is in avalon this ended the talk with senor j lopez clancy took his friend by the arm and walked with him to the restaurant where they had had their dinner aint this the limit queried hill plaintively nothin goes right for us clancy well dont fret about it returned the motor wizard order up a good meal and try and be happy they sent in a generous order hill however could not get the hard luck out of his mind he continued to air the state of his feelings while the order was being made ready this capn hogan is a dead ringer for dad him and dad couldnt look more alike if they had been twins and then clancy them initials in his stetson u h i reckoned that made a cinch of this here trail im follerin but no stead o standin for upton hill them letters in the stetson meant uriah hogan never before has fate played it so low down on me as that we have certainly blundered into some remarkable coincidences agreed clancy a man with red hair who sat at their table cocked up his ear as hill shook out his opinions hogan said he leaning forward did i hear you mention smuggler hogan of the sylvia i called him uriah hogan said hill its all one and the same hogans bad medicine the man surveyed clancy with an approving eye maybe i shouldnt say anything about this he continued but your hairs the same color as mine and i always make it a point to pass valuable information along to a fellow bricktop beware of hogan whats the fellow doing with that boat of his some say hes smuggling arms into lower california for the use of the revolutionists and some say hes running chinks and opium both contraband goods into the united states capn hogan is not in these waters for any good take it from me the redheaded man finished with an ominous look and then with great politeness requested hill to pass the salt hogan i hear the loquacious stranger continued presently charters that boat of his to the unsuspecting he does it for a blind nothing else now if you gents want a trip up or down the coast as far north as san fran or as far down as the horn ive got just the thing slickest little schooner with steam auxiliary you ever put eyes on a light broke over clancy maybe captain hogan wasnt such bad medicine after all this rival ship owner might be giving him a bad character for business purposes were not intending to charter any boat said clancy no harm done anyway said the redhaired person ive given you a straight tip about hogan though and you can bank on it much obliged returned clancy a little later he and hill got up from the table settled their bill and left the restaurant how about takin a walk hill asked the way that redheaded chap throwed me into the man i thought was dad kinder made me feverish all right agreed the motor wizard cheerfully well walk its always a good thing to walk a mile or so after youve had your supper they strolled down the main street clancy doing his best to cheer up his melancholy companion presently they turned a corner and started along a thoroughfare that was bordered on both sides with eucalyptus trees a figure stepped suddenly out of the black shadow of one of the trees and posted itself in front of clancy barring his path owen clancy the figure asked yes clancy answered thinking the voice sounded rather familiar well im back again and burton the motor wizard exclaimed yes burton the other returned ive had it rubbed into me by gerald wynn and bob katz till i reckon i cant stand it no longer im ready to help you now and this time i mean it whats happened to cause this great change burton clancy asked skeptically wynn and katz are trying to beat me out of my share of the fifteen thousand was the reply if i help you clancy maybe between us we can beat out the pair of them what do you say chapter ix a split in the gang clancy had no confidence whatever in burton im willing to hear what youve got to say burton he said but whether i believe you or not is another question youll believe me fast enough was the confident response down the street a little way is a place where we can talk they walked down the street to a bench the bench was in an obscure place and the gloom of the eucalyptus trees surrounded it here after they had seated themselves burton began his remarks ive been treated like a dip by wynn and katz said he and im going to be square with you clancy just to get even with them when we lifted the fifteen thousand at the time you were shot we laid a bee line for los angeles weve been there ever since up to last sunday morning gerald was bughouse on a gambling proposition across the mexican line he heard of a stockholder he could buy out for fifteen thousand dollars and thats what set him to working his brother for the money in the first place well he was as closefisted with that dinero as any miser you ever saw i didnt have a cent in my pocket and gerald wouldnt give me any cash he paid my expenses but that was all last saturday he saw that mixup at sixth and main in los angeles and he got the idea that hill was trailing him of course gerald knows all about hills search for his lost father of course he does grunted hiram theres a reason for that and he conceived the notion of sending hill a letter and signing the name of upton hill to it went on burton the idea was to get hill off of our trail and we all reckoned the scheme had won out i didnt know until i looked up into the glass bottom of that boat that hill was within a hundred miles of catalina island and i thought clancy was still in phoenix say it was sure a big surprise to me thats what i reckoned remarked hill with a chuckle i used to be swimming instructor in a gymnasium proceeded burton and as soon as we reached avalon i made a deal with mynie boltwood who owns a boat and we took to snorkin the tourists gerald was still the tightwad and i couldnt live on prospects no matter how rosy they might be sunday afternoon while i was out diving gerald and bob called on lopez i get it straight from a fellow who knows that lopez told them the fortunatus deal had fallen through right then and there is where those two skunks began to scheme to beat me out of my share of the swag we brought from wickenburg burton fell silent for a moment evidently reflecting on the great wrong that had been done him by his former pals at last he resumed wynn and katz chartered the sylvia to take them down the coast i was told that by lopez and i reckon he got it from captain hogan lopez i saw him no more than half an hour ago says wynn and katz are planning to cut loose from me ive been a fool all along to let those two do all the schemin and never put in my oar but now im going to get busy you saw lopez pretty soon after you gave us the slip at sugarloaf rock clancy asked quite a long time after that i laid low in town until mynie boltwood brought me my clothes you see i was expecting every minute youd have an officer on my trail so i didnt stir around very much lopez is a friend of yours hes treated me white when he saw how i was being doublecrossed by fellows i thought were my pards now clancy heres a plan ive thought of from all i can find out wynn and katz havent an idea you and hill are up avalon suppose we three go to their hangout and jump them we can do it and recover the money well have to be quick though and pull off the work before they leave in the sylvia where are gerald wynn and bob katz lopez says theyre staying at hogans bungalow i know where that is will you go clancy hesitated youre afraid im working some underhand scheme eh said burton well forget it all i want in this world is to break even with wynn and katz dont you believe what ive been telling you youre a slippery customer answered clancy and you may be lying for the purpose of getting hill and me into hot water nothing to it i tell you im square with you lets try him once clancy suggested hill if it turns out to be a frameup burton will be with us and we can hand him a sample of our regards very well said the motor wizard lead the way burton burton moved down the walk to the first cross street proceeded halfway along the block and halted in front of a small bungalow with a deep porch heres where captain hogan stays when hes in avalon and ashore remarked burton in a guarded tone cant see any light murmured hill looks like the place was empty i should say at a guess put in clancy that the captain is not at home he may be aboard the sylvia were not looking for hogan but for wynn and katz continued burton ill not leave this place until i investigate a bit he began climbing the steps that led to the porch clancy was still very distrustful of burton and watched warily while following the fellow to the front door of the house burton seemed straight enough with a soft hand he tried the door and discovered it to be locked moving thence to a window that opened upon the porch he tried to raise the lower sash it was secured maybe i can open the sash lock he whispered to clancy if its the ordinary kind a knife will do the trick he took a jackknife from his pocket opened a blade thrust it upward between the upper and lower sash and maneuvered for a minute or two finally he gave vent to a muttered word of satisfaction closed the knife and slipped it into his pocket heres a little luck said he we can open the window now noiselessly the lower sash was lifted and the way into the bungalow was open you can stay here whispered burton or you can go with me if youre afraid to trust me i can look around and report what i find ill go with you returned clancy i dont want to take your report about what you find i want to see for myself as carefully as possible they crawled through the window and while they stood in the dark room at the front of the house hiram came through the opening and joined them a noise reached their ears as of heavy breathing hill caught clancys arm in a convulsive clutch theres some one in the place all right said burton under his breath strike a light suggested the motor wizard i believe its safe enough here let me put in hiram ive got a match right in my fingers he scraped the match on the wall as a flicker of light blazed up a small meagerly furnished front room was disclosed neither captain hogan nor either of those who had chartered his boat could be seen clancy stepped to a shelf on the side wall and took down a candle in a candlestick hill touched the match to the wick and the investigation continued under a better light there was a door opening off the rear of the room burton glided to it and carefully pushed it ajar stygian darkness reigned beyond the opening of the rear door had caused the heavy breathing to grow louder the man evidently the only one they were to find in the bungalow must be in that back room clancy with the candle pushed into the lead and entered the next apartment hill was watching burton as keenly as a cat watches a mouse at the first sign of a treacherous move or the springing a trap hill would have been at burton in a flash nothing occurred however to alarm the investigators something was discovered on the other hand which certainly astounded them a figure was lying on a cot bed a figure that was bound wrist and ankle a towel was tied over the face of the helpless form and from behind this towel came the labored breathing which had already attracted attention the candle revealed the gruesome situation dimly there seemed no longer any good reason for silence and startled exclamations dropped from the lips of the three investigators black work has been going on here growled burton wonder if thats hogan queried clancy whoever it is spoke up hill if that towel aint removed hell soon be smothered to death as he spoke he hastened to the head of the bed turned the form slightly so he could untie the ends of the towel and presently removed the suffocating gag as the head of the bound man fell back on the pillow of the bed his face was brought clearly into the full light of the candle by thunder gasped clancy startled what do you think of that murmured the bewildered burton katz or im a hottentot whispered hill there followed a few moments of silence during which the three at the cotside exchanged wondering glances here was a situation which seemed incomprehensible to all of them katzs eyes were closed and the breath came and went stertorously between his bloated lips his face was puffed and of a purplish hue whats the matter with him queried burton he came within one of being suffocated thats all clancy answered get the ropes off his hands and feet so hell be more comfortable i dont think it will be long before he opens his eyes the motor wizard was right hardly had katz been freed of the ropes when his eyelids flickered wide open he stared up dazedly into the faces bending over him wynn he exclaimed his wits wandering youre doublecrossin me eh same as we doublecrossed burton you and hogan are going to make off with the swag well it wont do you no good you can gamble on that youll be sorry you did this some day and here his voice trailed off into incoherent mumbling it was quite evident that there had been a bad split in the gang chapter x plot and counterplot burtons eyes glimmered as he listened to these wandering words from the lips of his treacherous friend he got a dose of the same medicine he helped give me he said serves him right gerald wynn is a yellow dog he turned against me and then he hitched up with captain hogan and the two turned on katz wish i knew just how it all happened bring some water said clancy and perhaps we can help katz recover his wits hes half delirious now burton found some cool water and brought a basin of it the bloated purplish face of katz was bathed his limbs were rubbed and gradually his condition physical and mental became more normal he peered at burton with blinking eyes thank you hank he asked yes its hank was the taunting response how do you like bein doublecrossed you and wynn put the kibosh on me and here youve got a taste of it yourself wynns a coyote snarled katz hes not the only one what took place here struck in clancy seeking to direct the talk into more profitable channels a shiver convulsed the form of katz slowly his eyes turned to clancy and grew round with astonishment that redheaded motor wizard he breathed however did you get here im here and thats enough said clancy he came on from phoenix because i wired him to put in hill hes helpin me locate my father it was clancys judgment ill bet observed burton that kept you from going to san diego now you are shouting i was bound to go there but chancy held me back and steered me toward catalina island katzs eyes passed from clancy to hill slowly the wonder died out of them and a grim expression crossed his face youre the clever boy all right clancy said katz but wynn is too many for you hes bit it off with hogan who owns the steam yacht sylvia and theyre off for down the coast with all the money after we cut you out burton wynn and i had divided i had seventyfive hundred all in the long green in that dinky satchel of mine when i came to this wikiup to join wynn and hogan them two were layin for me the minute i stepped in at the door they bowled me over i went down like a log and when i came to myself i was lyin on this bed lashed hand and foot and with a towel tied so tight over my face that i could hardly breathe hogan and wynn were in the room and they just laughed at me youre easiern burton was wynn says hogan and i are leavin the harbor tonight he says and were takin the hull fifteen thousand with us good night and happy dreams katz he winds up then puts out the light locks the front door and leaves me to strangle to death katz turned his head and spat contemptuously thats the sort of a jigger this wynn is he finished youre no better than he is snapped burton if i could come within arms reach o him by thunder id show whether im better than he is or not cried katz getting up with an effort and sitting on the edge of the cot you say said clancy speaking quickly that hogan and wynn are intending to get away in the sylvia tonight i reckon theyve already gone maybe not theres a chance that the sylvia is still in the harbor are you as anxious to get even with wynn as burton is katz try me thats all growled katz lifting his arms and working them back and forth to get the cramps out of them id like a chance to show gerald wynn just how i feel then come with me perhaps we can head off hogan and wynn at the dock no such luck but look here oncet clancy are you intendin to mix the police in this game o muggins no was the answer well handle it ourselves and the idee is to recover the fifteen thousand dollars who gets it after its recovered i do it belongs to lafe wynn and myself doesnt it this part of the arrangement it was clear did not please katz clancy saw that and his voice hardened and grew threatening youre a plain thief katz first thing you know youll get your just deserts and land in the los angeles jail you can either come with the rest of us or you can stay here suit yourself when you talk in that tone of voice returned katz humbly i come on the run give your orders clancy and count on me to help carry em out where does hogan keep the dinghy that carries him between the sylvia and the shore asked the motor wizard i can show you if the sylvia is still in the harbor and theres any one ashore from her i can take you right to the place where the dinghy is tied up thats where we want to go the entire party emerged from the bungalow descended the steps to the street and started forthwith for the water front katz led the way out upon the same pier at which clancy and hill had taken the glassbottom boat to view the marine gardens well out on the pier they came to a halt and swept their eyes over the dark waters of the bay by cracky said katz pointing the sylvia aint got away yet theres her lights if im not mistaken probably thirty or forty boats most of them small were anchored in the bay each carried lights and picking the sylvias lights out from among the others was no easy matter i guess youve got it right katz said clancy unless the yacht changed her anchorage thats about where she ought to be we can tell to a certainty by goin down to the floats and seein if the sylvias dinghy is tied up at the pier if the dinghy isnt there spoke up burton it wouldnt prove that the sylvia wasnt still in the harbor she may be at anchor katz with no one ashore righto answered katz on tother hand burton if the sylvias dinghy is at the pier then its a lead pipe that the yacht isnt far away well go look they went down the stairs to the floats there were several boats chained and locked to the floats and among them was the sylvias dinghy the dinghy however was not locked to the float post and a pair of oars lay across the thwarts shes here by jerry muttered katz hogan and wynn havent left us yet not just yet i allow theyre whoopin it up somers and are show gettin out to the yacht maybe theyre on the sylvia said burton and some of the crews ashore what diffrence does it make whos ashore and whos on the yacht it makes a good deal put in the motor wizard two of our party will stay on the pier and watch this float to see who comes after the dinghy and the other two will take the dinghy and go out to the sylvia by making a move of that kind well be able to land on gerald wynn no matter whether hes ashore or on the boat ill watch this end o the play said katz no objected clancy youll go with me to the yacht katz hill and burton will stay here and keep an eye on the float well youre the doctor acquiesced katz grumblingly clancy had divided the party so that he and hill would each have a man to watch neither katz nor burton would have the same opportunity to be treacherous as they would have had if they had been left together the motor wizard fully believed that hogan and wynn were ashore and that the dinghy was waiting to carry them to the yacht he felt that he could trust burton to be one to deal with wynn much more safely than he could trust the more desperate katz wholl do the rowin queried katz youd better do that katz said clancy my shoulder isnt in the right sort of condition for such work katz was interested at once whats the matter with your shoulder he asked you ought to know im pretty sure youre the one who put a bullet into it i got an alibi for that muttered katz stepping into the boat and adjusting the oars clancy followed him the idea is hill said clancy to get the money from wynn you and burton may have a hard time of it if hogan and wynn are together i cant tell you what to do except to be careful and do the best you can therell be no dinghy for wynn and hogan to use and i think you ought to have some success if you use your wits as well as your fists if we get a chance clancy answered hill well either make good or know the reason why all right katz called the motor wizard softly make as little noise as possible if we cant get aboard the sylvia without any one knowing it we wont be able to get aboard at all i sabe the burro fast enough answered katz the fellow proved a good oarsman and there was scarcely a sound as he dropped and lifted the oars as they picked their way through the fleet of harbor craft coming closer and closer to the lights for which they had headed they found out that they had located the sylvia correctly her white trim bulwarks suddenly loomed up like a ghost ship no one was on deck to hail the dinghy and katz brought the small boat to a stop under the sylvias side and at the foot of a short ladder that was lashed to the rail clancy laid hold of the ladder and with little noise gained the deck some one started out from the shadow of a deck awning and stepped toward him is that you lewis the man asked clancys response was quick and to the point with a tigerlike leap he gained the mans side and pressed both hands about his throat chapter xi aboard the sylvia clancys shoulder received a hard wrench and a tingling pain shot through his arm the man who had hailed him was of medium height and stocky build and well muscled clancy was in no physical condition to keep up his end in such a setto and the result would probably have been disastrous had not katz leaped over the side and taken a hand katz remembering the way his pal had treated him was as venomous as a rattlesnake the motor wizard had all he could do to keep him from going too far and seriously injuring the man with very little commotion the fellow was overcome gagged with a handkerchief and tied with a rope which clancy picked up on the deck this rough work finished the two intruders stood breathlessly in the shadow of the awning and waited and listened they could hear a drone of voices forward the monotonous sound kept going without a break which seemed to prove that the slight noise aft had not been overheard so far so good muttered katz what next clancy our next move is to look around and see whos aboard was the reply theres somebody in the cabin thats a cinch but i reckon this dub was the only other chap around the works like enough he was a watchman or somethin what did he call you lewis lewis is the engineer if he saw you climb over the rail and if he thought you was lewis then its a safe guess that lewis is one of the men whos ashore thats right if lewis has shore leave then ill bet hogan is on board i think so hogan and wynn theyre the two who are in the cabin hey it takes two to make a talk well find out whos in the cabin there was a deck house amidships with steps leading up from the afterdeck windows opening into the cabin were almost flush with the deck and by kneeling down clancy and katz could look into the small room below they found that they had been correct in their surmises wynn and hogan sat facing each other on upholstered benches a table was between them and upon the table was a battered satchel of small dimensions katz reached for clancys arm and gave it a quick pressure thats the grip with the money he whispered whats the reason we cant get hold of it weve got to get hold of it somehow returned clancy suppose you go aft and yell for hogan its possible katz that your call will take both hogan and wynn out of the cabin that may give me a chance to duck down the companion and grab the satchel its worth tryin approved katz even if it dont win out we can still end the thing in a fight you got a shootin iron no neither have i blamed if i dont feel kinder lost without one ill bet hogan is heeled and i know wynn never goes without his artillery well have to look sharp and be spry clancy if things come to a showdown while clancy watched the two in the cabin he saw wynn draw the satchel across the table open it and pull a packet of greenbacks from inside he held up the packet and laughed hogan joined in the laugh the motor wizard had a very good look at captain hogan and he did not wonder that hiram had been deceived into thinking the fellow was his father the bulging brow the huge nose and the retreating chin all conspired to form a countenance that would have claimed attention anywhere one eye had an evil squint and it gave to the whole face a crafty expression captain hogan it was clear would never be hung for his good looks although it would be too much to say that he might not some time be strung up for his evil deeds wynn dropped the money into the satchel and sat back arm the bench as usual he was whiffing at a cigarette hogan was smoking a big black cigar neither clancy nor katz was so situated that he could hear the conversation going forward between the two in the cabin the voices sounded from below in considerable volume but the words ran together in hollow echoes that baffled the ear go on katz whispered clancy well try that scheme if hogan leaves the cabin ill go down suppose wynn stays with the money i guess i can take care of wynn well heres hopin id like to crack out a winnin this play sit tight now and listen to the meller trill o my bazoo the motor wizard remained at his post while katz crept back to the after part of the boat then suddenly katz opened up with a yell for hogan capn hogan hogan leaped to his feet all energy and curiosity in a moment a startled look crossed wynns face and was clearly visible in the rays of the swinging lamp the captain jumped for the companion stairs closely followed by wynn clancy fell to wondering which side of the deck house theyd travel on their way aft if they came down his side then the chances were good for a scrimmage instead of a dash into the cabin in the excitement of the moment the satchel had been left entirely unprotected on the cabin table as luck would have it hogan and wynn ran along the alley across from the one in which clancy was lying the time had now come for clancy to act and without loss of a moment he gained the companion and made his way swiftly down the steep stairs he could hear a sound of husky voices and a tramp of quick feet from aft what was going on between the captain and wynn on one side and katz on the other was a mystery clancy did not waste time in any guessing but grabbed up the satchel and started with it on his return up the companion stairs but he only started as he began going up at the bottom some one began coming down from the top the fellow above was in as big a hurry as clancy and he lost his footing on the steep stairs and came below with a rush the motor wizard was caught full by the descending form and knocked flat his game shoulder as he fell struck against the corner of a locker with cruel force and a cry of pain was wrenched from his lips almost as soon as he was down he was up again and he had not let go of the satchel the other fellow was also on his feet it was gerald wynn wynn stared at clancy as though he could hardly credit the evidence of his senses you here wynn gulped no answer was necessary besides with clancy time was pressing taking advantage of wynns surprise the motor wizard attempted to push by him and get to the deck wynn however had full use of his limbs and his faculties give me that satchel he cried and tried to snatch the grip out of clancys hand clancy evaded him with a deft leap sideways wynn swore savagely and struck at the motor wizard with his clenched fist clancy blocked the blow with his game arm hurting it so that he almost felt as though it had been struck by lightning then his other fist shot out catching wynn fairly and driving him against the bulkhead clancy had to drop the satchel while executing his defense he now grabbed it from the floor and plunged on up the companionway as he emerged through the companion doors he beheld a form bulking largely in the half gloom it was captain hogan braced in the passageway between the top of the deck house and the rail and leveling a revolver at the crouching form of katz stand where you are you bloomin beach comber yelled hogan or ill blow a hole through you katz swore and continued his forward movement last call went on the captain another step this way and ill shoot youre a robber cried katz you and wynn between you have skinuned me out of seventyfive hundred dollars where did you get the money demanded hogan ironically its no crime to skin a skinner or to shoot one either heres where you get yours before hogan could pull the trigger clancy sprang upon him from behind and forced his revolver hand downward the weapon exploded and a bullet plumped into the deck while the captain was struggling with the motor wizard katz ran forward and wrenched away the sixshooter let go o him clancy panted katz ive got him now the old sea shark will do as i say or take the same medicine hes been threatenin to hand me clancy flung himself from hogan and the latter stood at bay under the muzzle of the revolver youre a measly pirate flamed hogan to come aboard of me and carry on like youre doing im no worsen you if i am a pirate snarled katz put your hands to your back clancy get another piece o that rope and make hogans arms fast clancy put down the satchel and followed his companions orders now sit down hogan snapped katz whats your scheme demanded the captain to put you out o the runnin drop on the deck i tell you katz flourished the revolver as he spoke hogan lowered himself to the planks on which he was standing easing his pentup feelings wrathfully as he did so now a half hitch around his legs clancy said katz and clancy came around with the end of the rope and got the captains legs in limbo youre a fine pair of grafters sneered the irate hogan i hope i live to manhandle you for this nights work far off across the water could be heard a screech of oars in the locks and a faint sound of voices hogan aware that some of his men were coming from the pier lifted his voice in a loud roar for help katz cursing furiously sprang toward him and drew back his fist to strike clancy caught the arm before it could deal the blow and saved the captain from such savage brutality katz turned on the motor wizard oh you he yelped i reckon im about done with this foolin gi me that satchel ill keep this returned clancy the money in it belongs to me blamed if i care who it belongs to im goin to have it fork over katz pushed the point of the revolver in clancys face fork i tell you or take the consequences clancy dropped the satchel chapter xii more than he bargained for yes clancy dropped the satchel it was the only thing for him to do under the circumstances he had discretion as well as bravery besides clancy was facing the companionway and katz had his back to it the motor wizard could see something which escaped katz entirely and that was the stealthy advance of gerald wynn through the companion doors wynn would soon be a factor in the situation there was nothing he could do which would make the run of events worse than they already were for clancy what had happened showed the folly of putting any trust in a desperado it was through clancys efforts that katz had been freed from his dangerous predicament in captain hogans bungalow but katz did not give any consideration to that when the time came for him to turn the tables and secure the satchel for himself perhaps all katz had helped clancy for was the hope that just such an opportunity would come his way now that the opportunity had come he was making the most of it katz is doing you dirt eh rumbled the captain turning his eyes upon clancy he forgets how i saved him at your bungalow said the motor wizard if you pulled him out of that scrape then keelhaul me you deserve all he gives you katz laughed in ugly fashion ill get back what you and wynn stole from me he remarked stooping over to pick up the satchel as he bent down two things happened they happened very suddenly too clancy and wynn sprang toward katz at the same time clancy for the satchel and wynn for the revolver the work of both was excellent for each got what he went after the approaching boat by that time was close alongside in another moment hogan and wynn would be supplied with reenforcements give me that yelled katz jumping toward clancy here the captain took a part in the combat bound though he was he swung his feet upward suddenly and powerfully katz was struck in the side and toppled to the deck four men came bounding over the bulwarks captain they called where are you captain here yelled the captain make prisoners of these two fellows katz and clancy katz is on the deck there and clancy clancy was just going over the side and into the water so it was impossible to make a prisoner of him he took the valuable satchel along get back into that boat two of you bellowed hogan and snake that redheaded streak of lightning out of the water and back aboard the sylvia look alive now a hundreddollar bonus to the man who captures clancy and recovers the satchel hes got with him two of the men flung themselves into the boat and put off the other two gave their first attention to bob katz and bound him with the rope which was taken from the captain so katz as it will be seen was left in the hands of his enemies thereby getting vastly more than he had bargained for meanwhile the motor wizard was swimming he was perfectly at home in the water and even though he was handicapped with a game shoulder he found no difficulty in keeping afloat with the satchel and in spite of the weight of his wet clothes clancy called a voice across the water where are you clancy two boats at that moment were searching for the motor wizard one of course held enemies and was coming from the sylvia the other carrying hill and burton was approaching from the pier it was hiram hill who had hailed clancy knew for he had recognized the voice this way hiram the motor wizard cried two boats were aimed in clancys direction and two pairs of oars struck the water crack your back burton yelled hill if you want to get even with wynn nows your chance do your prettiest the two men from the sylvia are trying to beat us to clancy and its a close race hill could see the dark form in the water and the black shadow of the other boat rushing toward it an idea flashed through his mind an idea as dangerous as it might possibly be successful starboard oar burton he whooped hard on the starboard oar burtons back was to the exciting little scene he could only obey orders as he heard them all his strength went suddenly into the starboard oar the boat began to whirl and then crash the bow of the craft swung against the side of the boat from the sylvia the sylvias men were dumped into the water but hill flung himself on the port gunwale of his own boat and kept it from turning turtle burton hurled from his seat by the force of the collision picked himself up and took note of the situation hill had caused two life preservers came whizzing from the deck of the sylvia and the two men in the water each grabbed one bully yelled burton as hill helped clancy aboard theres the satchel clancy brought away the grip with the money oh this is better than i hoped for the motor wizard dropped with a splash into the bottom of the boat while hill held up his head and wrung the water out of his red hair burton got back on the midship thwart and grabbed the oars wheres katz clancy hill asked he must be on the sylvia clancy answered no use trying to go back after him is there great scott no hogan and wynn would get the satchel away from me if we went back anyhow were not indebted to bob katz for anything if he hadnt turned on me at the last moment and taken the satchel away at the point of a gun he and i would both have got clear of the sylvia in the dinghy katz is to blame for what happened thats like him growled burton hes getting it all around see what he did to me hes a pesky varmint grunted hill he might a died there in hogans bungalow if it hadnt been for clancy it was almost the same as turnin on the fellow that saved his life i aint got no use for such coyotes clancy sat up on the boats bottom and looked in the direction of the sylvia the yachts dinghy could be dimly discerned putting off to the rescue of the two men in the water im in luck to be safe out of that mess muttered clancy where were you when those four fellows from the sylvia came down to the pier we saw that hogan and wynn werent among them hill answered and so we didnt interfere there was a big howl when they couldnt find their dinghy they managed to get another boat though and put off from the pier a little later we heard the commotion on the sylvia and thought wed better get a boat of our own and investigate its lucky you did said clancy if you hadnt been close enough to pick me up id now be in the hands of hogan and wynn along with katz and hogan and wynn would have the money i guess taking it by and large we havent anything to complain of they reached the pier and made the boat fast to the float from which hill and burton had taken it the excitement in the bay had not been heard and there was no one besides themselves moving about the pier clancy carrying the watersoaked satchel slopped and splashed his way to the street followed by his two companions on the sidewalk the motor wizard paused for a final word with burton what are you going to do now that your two pals have passed you up clancy asked ill work this diving stunt with mynie boltwood burton answered and see if i cant get together a bit of a stake come around to the bolingbroke in the morning burton and ask for me changed your mind think youll turn me over to the police after all havent any such idea i think you could be decent if youd give your mind to it whats the matter with turning over a new leaf and trying to be honest from now on when i want to hear a sermon sneered burton turning on his heel i know where to go without pausing to hear or to say anything further he passed rapidly down the street and vanished in the night what do you want to see him in the mornin for queried hill curiously id like to grubstake him answered clancy youd what the motor wizard repeated his words well im blessed murmured hill why hank burton is one of the three who helped lafe wynn nearly ruin you and now you talk o grubstakin him that red hair of yours certainly covers a lot of foolish idees burton is the best of geralds old gang hiram said clancy as the two walked in the direction of the bolingbroke house that aint asayin a heap in his favor hes a whole lot better than bob katz not much in that nuther but you wont have no chance to grubstake burton clancy he wont show up in the mornin they reached the hotel secured a room and clancy at once got out of his wet clothes he was so tired and sleepy that he dozed off without thinking anything about the watersoaked satchel hill however had the satchel on his mind and took good care of it when clancy awoke in the morning the bright sun was streaming in at the two windows of the room on the floor in front of the windows hill had spread two newspapers and on these newspapers where the warm sun would strike them he had spread out the bank notes that had gone into the ocean with clancy the night before it was pleasant work for hiram drying all that money he whistled joyously as he changed the wet bills around shifting the dryest to the shade and the wettest to the place where they would receive the hottest part of the suns rays how much is there all together hiram clancy asked youre shy just half of the fifteen thousand clancy was the reply theres only seventyfive hundred here hardly enough to bother with chapter xiii a wireless for lafe clancy was startled he had only been half as successful as he thought he had well thunder he exclaimed sitting up in bed last night hiram i was sure i had all the money that had been taken from phoenix by lafe this was bob katzs satchel wasnt it hill asked nodding toward the grip yes well katz said he had only severityfive hundred in it when it was taken from him by hogan and wynn thats so mused clancy i didnt have much time last night to reason matters out to a fine point half a loaf is better than no bread though ive heard say i hadnt dreamed of recovering a cent of that fifteen thousand lafe and i are just so much ahead a knock fell on the door hill answered the summons and admitted hank burton well by golly exclaimed hill whats the matter queried burton sourly i told clancy i didnt think youd come seein you sort o surprised me what made you think i wouldnt come demanded burton oh the way you acted the way you talked and your lowdown character genrally burton flushed and scowled turning away from hill he addressed himself to clancy here i am said he why did you want me to call here this morning i want to give you a grubstake answered the motor wizard hiram if there are five dry twentydollar bills in that heap give them to burton burton started stared at clancy and then watched hill while he knelt down and selected five twenties from the drying bills what are you doing this for asked burton falteringly just trying to give you a little boost in the right direction im not entitled to any of that money i think you are you earned something last night take the hundred burton and see if you cant be square the young fellows face paled then the color dyed his cheeks he stood looking down at the floor then presently lifted his head and moved slightly toward clancy and half raised his hand then he paused once more whirled suddenly and got out of the room as fast as he could hill had been watching these strange maneuvers in frank amazement i reckon hes locoed he said as soon as the door had closed behind burton no returned clancy his gratitude was trying to express itself but couldnt quite make it he has had his lesson hiram and will profit by it he has profited a hundred dollars worth anyhow commented hill dryly this happy trail of yours clancy is a mighty queer one seems to me for a ways it follows the one i took in huntin for dad then it branches off and points straight toward gerald wynn and his gang now here we are at the end of it and youre seventyfive hundred to the good clancy laughed get me a pencil and a piece of paper hiram he requested hiram found the writing materials and clancy wrote out the following message lafe wynn phoenix arizona luck seventyfive hundred of the missing fifteen thousand recovered cheer up happy trail panning out better than expected still gunning for hills father clancy right across the street said clancy is a wireless station take this message over there hiram and let the hertzian waves get busy with it at once on the jump answered hill better take a fivedollar bill with you clancy suggested hill picked up the bank note id like to see that money get dry before we spend it all he complained and then went out with the wireless message for lafe wonder if lafe will feel any different when he gets that clancy murmured smiling happily i know im feeling a whole lot different myself the end owen clancys double trouble or the motor wizards mystery concludes the redheaded chaps series of adventures in the midst of which we have left him at the conclusion of this story you will find the doubletrouble story in the next issue of the weekly no out april th chapters of the snapshot mystery not included as the story is continued from a previous issue and continues in later issues the cossacks the cossacks are a race of freemen the entire territory belongs to the cossack commune and every individual has an equal right to the use of the land together with the pastures hunting grounds and fisheries the cossacks pay no taxes to the government but in lieu of this and here you see the connection between them and the russian government they are bound to perform military service they are divided into three classes first the minors up to their sixteenth year secondly those on actual service for a period of twentyfive years therefore until their fortysecond year thirdly those released from service who remain for five years or until their fortyseventh year in the reserve after which period they are regarded as wholly released from service and invalided every cossack is obliged to equip clothe and arm himself at his own expense and to keep his horse while on service beyond the frontiers of his own country he receives rations of food and provender and a small amount of pay the artillery and train are at the charge of the government instead of imposing taxes on the don cossacks the russian government pays them an annual tribute varying in peace and war together with grants to be distributed among the widows and orphans of those who have fallen in battle a satirical reward there was perhaps more satire than gratitude in the reward bestowed by a french lady on a surgeon for bleeding her an operation in which the lancet was so clumsily used that an artery was severed and the poor woman bled to death when she recognized that she was dying she made a will in which she left the operator a life annuity of eight hundred francs on condition that he never again bleeds anybody as long as he lives dodged the trap doctor james b angell tells in his reminiscences the following enjoyable story of his college days at brown university under the presidency of doctor wayland the doctors son heman lincoln wayland one of my classmates inherited from his father a very keen wit the passages between father and son were often entertaining to the class one day when we were considering a chapter in the fathers textbook on moral philosophy lincoln rose with an expression of great solemnity and respect and said sir i would like to propound a question well sir what is it was the reply well sir said the son in the learned authors work which we are now perusing i observe the following remark and then he quoted the class saw that fun was at hand and began to laugh well what of it asked the father with a merry twinkle in his eye why continued the son in another work of the same learned author entitled on the limitation of human responsibility i find the following passage he quoted again clearly the two passages were irreconcilable the boys were delighted to see that the doctor was in a trap and broke into loud laughter well what of it asked the doctor and his eyes twinkled still more merrily why said the son with the utmost gravity it has occurred to me that i should like to know how the learned author reconciles the two statements oh said the father that is simple enough it only shows that since he wrote the first book the learned author has learned something the compass news from all points illustration compass books for trainers and athletes so many inquiries reach us from week to week concerning the various manuals on athletic development which we publish that we have decided to keep a list of them standing here any number can be had by mail by remitting cents and cents

exchange post cards professor fourmen it was with great pleasure that i read in tip top of your return to this country i have been a reader of the tip top for three years now and i think it is the ideal weekly of the age i would like very much to get in touch with other readers of your great paper although the items of interest were interesting to read they are nothing like the good old applause column the part i like best in the merriwell stories is the way mr standish keeps the reader interested all the way through they are not like most stories because you cant tell how they are going to end there is something new all the time i would like some of the tip top post cards and it will be a pleasure to exchange cards with any of our merriwell admirers i hope to hear from some of them soon i remain for the tip top always elgin ill chicago street wm de garis has read tip top from no was pleased to note the return of the applause column to tip top i believe it will serve to increase the popularity of your longfamed and worldrenowned king of weeklies and thought this an appropriate time to drop you this note of appreciation i have followed your weekly from no old tip top to date and can recommend it to any friend as the weekly that stands alone there are no others in its class although i never expect the frank juniors to equal the oldtime stories i find them all good i will deem it a favor if you will tell me if i can get any of the merriwell stories in the cloth binding which were published several years ago this tribute probably sounds a little strong but sincerely every word is sent in good faith and i am sure hosts of others who have followed the merriwell adventures for any length of time join with me i dont wish to appear as butting in but dont you think a few illustrations in your new medal books would aid in increasing interest in this fine series of stories and interest to the readers please send me a set of the postal cards formerly sent to tip top readers if you still have them with best wishes for a successful future to street smith a long life to burt the author i will end hoping to long remain a true tiptopper gravette arkansas h wyric lewis p s would welcome some of the old tip top characters back to the front some of frank or dicks oldtime friends and schoolmates you are certainly a loyal tiptopper and we thank you for your letter of praise and for its suggestions the merriwell stories have never been bound in cloth but you can find them all in the new medal library the post cards have been mailed to you some suggestions i have read tip top for over a year now and i buy it every week it is an excellent weekly and i think the revival of the applause column will make it more interesting in g patients letter in no he asks for some tip top post cards i dont know what they are but if you have another set i would like to have it has the joking quality died out of the merriwell family i notice that frank junior takes life too seriously too much association with grown people lets have a joke now and then also its about time young franks girl is introduced to the reader dont you think hoping to see part of my letter in the tip top at some early issue i am yours truly roswell nothwary little rock ark battery street we have mailed you the post cards thank you for your suggestions there is a humorous character coming in the clancy stories that we think you will like a poet tiptopper upon opening a recent number of tip top i discovered to my great delight that you have reopened the applause column i have read most of the merriwell stories but i have never written to the applause column before so i think it is about time i agree with mr charles w meyers that when the professor fourmen and applause were left out and also when frank and dick were dropped there was surely something lacking frank merriwell junior is all right but to my mind he will never quite come up to his father and uncle but of course i expect him to improve as he grows older i do not like the owen clancy stories i think they just about spoil the series i hope that dick will soon win back his fortune which he lost in the revolution what about june arlington and all of dicks old friends especially jim stretcher i hope that old joe crowfoot is still among the living i would like very much to see bart hodges daughter in the stories i also read the topnotch magazine and i like it next to tip top i like the adventure stories the best but the athletic stories are good also i have a little doggerel here that i would like to see in print now boys fill up your glasses in calm weather as well as in blizzard for the hero of men of all classes for you frank merriwell the wizard once more for dick franks brother the boy who will always be trailed because on all things he does not falter the fellow who never failed and now for frank merriwell junior who is one of the merriwell flock who always gets there a little sooner a chip of the old sturdy block i see you have some tip top post cards and i would be immensely pleased to receive a set of them waiting eagerly for the return of both frank and dick i will close hoping

cards hoping you will pardon the extent of this letter hanover ontario canada sidney dankert glad you think we are improving we have mailed you the post cards cigarettes are certainly bad for your

was only informally discussed it was declared no final action will be taken until after further experiments are made next fall the proposed change in the rules to provide for an additional official

the house of representatives in incorporating an amendment fathered by representative lenroot in the burnett immigration bill excluding all asiatics including japanese from the united states except in so far as they have rights under existing treaties or agreements while the vote is subject to change when the bill comes up for final passage president wilson and his subordinates are gravely concerned over the prominence given to the exclusion question at this juncture in the diplomatic negotiations now in progress between japan and the united states fear was expressed that if the house should stand firm on the amendment the result might be a further irritation in japan and new outbreaks of the antiamerican feeling in the island empire the report was adopted following the rejection of an amendment offered by representative hayes of california excluding japanese hindus and also all blacks without regard to treaty obligations with any country auto wheel wrecks house causes fire

miles an hour makes a great disturbance in the atmosphere and creates air waves which of course are invisible to the naked eye attempts which have been made to take photographs of bullets going at this speed have been unsuccessful but scientists are still trying if a photograph could be taken they say the print would probably show a space like a body of water marked by what looked like speeding water bugs each having a ripple in its wake photographs of a bullet going at a rate of speed less than feet a second show no air waves at all but anything cutting through the air at a greater rate

has been denounced as a fake by federal authorities and is not given the most implicit confidence even in remote rural communities of the united states experiments in german south africa have located water at subterranean depth in per cent of the tests the department of agriculture of the french republic is seriously investigating the divining rod and an association having five hundred members in stuttgart germany has begun laborious tests to determine its real value french publicists and scientists have taken up the personalmagnetism phase of the question it is held by some that considering the surprising discoveries of late in regard to radiation of all sorts it may be that there is some radioactive influence of underground waters which may act physiologically on the organism of the person in whose hand the rod seems to turn toward the subterranean water an effort will be made to differentiate between any alleged diviners sincerity and real physical effect from charlatanism and
