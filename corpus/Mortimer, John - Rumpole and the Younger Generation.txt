rumpole and the younger generation by john mortimer from rumpole of the bailey i horace rumpole barrister at law next birthday old bailey hack husband to mrs hilda rumpole and father to nicholas rumpole i who have a mind full of old murders legal anecdotes and memorable fragments of the oxford book of english verse together with a dependable knowledge of bloodstains blood groups fingerprints and forgery by typewriter i who am now the oldest member of my chambers take up my pen at this advanced age during a lull in business in order to write my reconstructions of some of my recent triumphs in the courts of law hoping thereby to turn a bob or two which wont be immediately grabbed by the taxman or my clerk henry or by she who must be obeyed and perhaps give some sort of entertainment to those who like myself have found in british justice a lifelong subject of harmless fun when i first considered putting pen to paper in this matter of my life i thought i must begin with the great cases of my comparative youth the penge bungalow murder where i gained an acquittal alone and without a leader or the great brighton benefit club forgery which i contrived to win by reason of my exhaustive study of typewriters in these cases i was for a brief moment in the public eye or at least my name seemed almost a permanent feature of the news of the world but when i come to look back on that period of my life at the bar it all seems to have happened to another rumpole an eager young barrister whom i can scarcely recognize and whom i am not at all sure i would like at least not enough to spend a whole book with him i am not a public figure now so much has to be admitted but some of the cases i shall describe the wretched business of the honourable member for instance or the charge of murder brought against the youngest and barmiest of the appalling delgardo brothers did put me back on the front page of the news of the world but i suppose i have become pretty well known if not something of a legend round the old bailey in pommeroys wine bar in fleet street in the robing room at london sessions and in the cells at brixton prison they know me there for never pleading guilty for chainsmoking small cigars and for quoting wordsworth when they least expect it such notoriety will not long survive my nottobedelayed trip to golders green crematorium barristers speeches vanish quicker than chinese dinners and even the greatest victory in court rarely survives longer than the next sundays papers to understand the full effect on my family life however of that case which i have called rumpole and the younger generation it is necessary to know a little of my past and the long years that led up to my successful defence of jim timson the yearold sprig the young hopeful and apple of the eye of the timsons a huge and industrious family of south london villains as this case was by and large a family matter it is important that you should understand my family my father the reverend wilfred rumpole was a church of england clergyman who in early middle age came reluctantly to the conclusion that he no longer believed any one of the articles as he was not fitted by character or training for any other profession however he had to soldier on in his living in croydon and by a good deal of scraping and saving he was able to send me as a boarder to a minor public school on the norfolk coast i later went to keble college oxford where i achieved a dubious third in law you will discover during the course of these memoirs that although i only feel truly alive and happy in law courts i have a singular distaste for the law my fathers example and the number of theological students i met at keble gave me an early mistrust of clergymen whom i have always found to be most unsatisfactory witnesses if you call a clergyman in mitigation the old darling can be guaranteed to add at least a year to the sentence when i first went to the bar i entered the chambers of c h wystan wystan had a moderate practice acquired rather by industry than talent and a strong disinclination to look at the photographs in murder cases being particularly squeamish on the fascinating subject of blood he also had a daughter hilda wystan as was now mrs hilda rumpole and she who must be obeyed i was ambitious in those days i did my best to cultivate wystans clerk albert and i started to get a good deal of criminal work i did what was expected of me and spent happy hours round the bailey and sessions and my fame grew in criminal circles at the end of the day i would take albert for a drink in pommeroys wine bar we got on extremely well and he would always recommend his mr rumpole if a solicitor rang up with a particularly tricky indecent assault or a nasty case of receiving stolen property there is no point in writing your memoirs unless you are prepared to be completely candid and i must confess that in the course of a long life i have been in love on several occasions i am sure that i loved miss porter the shy and nervous but at times liberated daughter of septimus porter my oxford tutor in roman law in fact we were engaged to be married but the engagement had to be broken off because of miss porters early death i often think about her and of the different course my home life might have taken for miss porter was in no way a girl born to command or expect implicit obedience during my service with the ground staff of the raf i undoubtedly became helplessly smitten with the charms of an extremely warmhearted and gallant officer in the waafs by the name of miss bobby okeefe but i was no match for the wings of a pilot officer as appeared on the chest of a certain sam threefingers dogherty during my conduct of a case which i shall describe in a later chapter which i have called rumpole and the alternative society i once again felt a hopeless and almost feverish stirring of passion for a young woman who was determined to talk her way into holloway prison my relationship with hilda wystan was rather different to begin with she seemed part of life in chambers she was always interested in the law and ambitious first for her widowed father and then when he proved himself unlikely lord chancellor material for me she often dropped in for tea on her way home from shopping and wystan used to invite me in for a cup one year i was detailed off to be her partner at an inns of court ball there it became clear to me that i was expected to marry hilda it seemed a step in my career like getting a brief in the court of appeal or doing a murder when she proposed to me as she did over a glass of claret cup after an energetic waltz hilda made it clear that when old wystan finally retired she expected to see me head of chambers i who have never felt at a loss for a word in court found absolutely nothing to say in that silence the matter was concluded so now you must picture hilda and me twentyfive years later with a son at that same east coast public school which i just managed to afford from the fruits of crime in our matrimonial home at froxbury court gloucester road we were having breakfast and between bites of toast i was reading my brief for that day an old bailey trial of the yearold jim timson charged with robbery with violence he having allegedly taken part in a wage snatch on a couple of elderly butchers an escapade planned in the playground ol the local comprehensive as so often happens the poet wordsworth that old sheep of the lake district sprang immediately to mind and i gave tongue to his lines well knowing that they must only serve to irritate she who must be obeyed trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home heaven lies about us in our infancy i looked at hilda she was impassively demolishing a boiled egg i also noticed that she was wearing a hat as if prepared to set out upon some expedition i decided to give her a little more wordsworth prompted by my reading the story of the boy timson shades of the prison house begin to close upon the growing boy hilda spoke at last rumpole youre not talking about your son i hope youre never referring to nick shades of the prison house begin to close not round our son of course not round nick shades of the public school have grown round him the thousandquidayear remand home hilda always thought it indelicate to refer to the subject of school fees as if being at mulstead were a kind of unsolicited honour for nick she became increasingly businesslike hes breaking up this morning shades of the prison house begin to open up for the holidays nick has to be met at at liverpool street and given lunch when he went back to school you promised him a show you havent forgotten hilda was clearing away the plates rapidly to tell the truth i had forgotten the date of nicks holidays but i let her assume i had a long planned treat laid on for him of course i havent forgotten the only show i can offer him is a robbery with violence in number court at the old bailey i wish i could lay on a murder nicks always so enjoyed my murders it was true on one distant half term nick had sat in on the peckham billiard hall stabbing and enjoyed it a great deal more than treasure island i must fly daddy gets so crotchety if anyones late and he does love his visits hilda removed my halfempty coffee cup our father which art in horsham give my respects to the old sweetheart it had also slipped my mind that old c h wystan was laid up with a dicky ticker in horsham general hospital the hat was no doubt a clue i should have followed hilda usually goes shopping in a headscarf by now she was at the door and looking disapproving old sweetheart is hardly how you used to talk of the head of your chambers somehow i can never remember to call the head of my chambers daddy the door was open hilda was making a slow and effective exit tell nick ill be back in good time to get his supper your wish is my command i muttered in my best imitation of a slave out of chou chin chow she chose to ignore it and try not to leave the kitchen looking as though its been hit by a bomb i hear oh master of the blue horizons i said this with a little more confidence as she had by now started off on her errand of mercy and i added for good measure she who must be obeyed i had finished my breakfast and was already thinking how much easier life with the old bailey judge was than marriage soon after i finished my breakfast with hilda and made plans to meet my son at the start of his holidays from school fred timson star of a dozen court appearances was seeing his son in the cells under the old bailey as the result of a specially arranged visit i know he brought the boy his best jacket which his mother had taken specially to the cleaners and insisted on his putting on a tie i imagine he told him that they had the best brief in the business to defend him mr rumpole having always done wonders for the timson family i know that fred told young jim to stand up straight in the witness box and remember to call the judge my lord and not show his ignorance by coming out with any gaffe such as your honour or sir the world that day was full of fathers showing appropriate and paternal concern the robbery with which jim timson was charged was an exceedingly simple one at about pm one friday evening the date being september the two elderly brixton butchers mr cadwallader and mr lewis stein closed their shop in bombay road and walked with their weeks takings round the corner to a narrow alleyway known as greens passage where their grey austin van was parked when they got to the van they found that the front tyres had been deflated they stooped to inspect the wheels and as they did so they were attacked by a number of boys some armed with knives and one flourishing a cricket stump luckily neither of the butchers was hurt but the attache case containing their money was snatched chief inspector persil white the old darling in whose territory this outrage had been committed arrested jim timson all the other boys got clean away but no doubt because he came from a family well known indeed almost embarrassingly familiar to the chief inspector and because of certain rumours in the school playground he was charged and put on an identity parade the butchers totally failed to identify him but when he was in the remand centre young jim according to the evidence had boasted to another boy of having done the butchers as i thought about this case on my way to the temple that morning it occured to me that jim timson was a year younger than my son but that he had got a step further than nick in following his fathers profession i had always hoped nick would go into the law and as i say he seemed to thoroughly enjoy my murders in the clerks room in chambers albert was handing out the work for the day rather as a trainer sends his string of horses out on the gallops i looked round the familiar faces my friend george frobisher who is an old sweetheart but an absolutely hopeless advocate was being fobbed off with a nuisance at kingston county court young erskinebrown who wears striped shirts and what i believe are known as chelsea boots was turning up his wellbred nose at an indecent assault at lambeth and saying he would prefer a little civil work adding that he was sick to death of crime i have very little patience with erskinebrown a person who is tired of crime i told him quite candidly is tired of life your dangerous and careless at clerkenwell is on the mantelpiece mr hoskins albert said hoskins is a gloomy fellow with four daughters hes always lurking about our clerks room looking for cheques as ive told him often enough crime doesnt pay or at any rate not for a very long time when a young man called maclay had asked in vain for a brief i invited him to take a note for me down at the old bailey at least hed get a wig on and not spend a miserable day unemployed in chambers our oldest member uncle tom also asked albert if there were any briefs for him not in the least expecting to find one to my certain knowledge uncle tom hasnt appeared in court for fifteen years when he managed to lose an undefended divorce case but as he lives with a widowed sister a lady of such reputed ferocity that she makes she who must be obeyed sound like mrs tiggywinkle he spends most of his time in chambers he looks remarkably well for you arent actually expecting a brief uncle tom are you erskinebrown asked i cant like erskinebrown time was uncle tom started one of his reminiscences of life in our chambers time was when i had more briefs in my corner of the mantelpiece erskinebrown than youve seen in the whole of your short career at the bar now he was opening a brown envelope i only get invitations to insure my life its a little late for that albert told me that the robbery was not before before mr justice everglade in number i court he also told me who was prosecuting none other than the tall elegant figure with the silk handkerchief and gold wristwatch leaning against the mantelpiece and negligently reading a large cheque from the director of public prosecutions guthrie featherstone mp he removed the silk handkerchief dabbed the end of his nose and his small moustache and asked in that voice which comes over so charmingly saying nothing much about any important topic of the day in world at one agin me rumpole are you agin me he covered a slight yawn with the handkerchief before returning it to his breast pocket just come from an allnight sitting down at the house i dont suppose your robberyll be much of a worry only possibly to young jim timson i told him and then gave albert his orders for the day mrs rumpoles gone down to see her father in horsham how is wystan no better is he uncle tom sounded as gently pleased as all old men do when they hear news of illness in others much the same uncle tom thank you and young nick my son master nick albert had always been fond of nick and looked forward to putting him through his paces when the time came for him to join our stable in chambers hes breaking up today so hell need meeting at liverpool street then he can watch a bit of the robbery were going to have your son in the audience id better be brilliant guthrie featherstone now moved from the fireplace you neednt bother old darling its his dad he comes to see oh louche rumpole distinctement tauchil featherstone talks like that then he invited me to walk down to the bailey with him apparently he was still capable of movement and didnt need a stretcher even after a sleepless night with the gas mains enabling bill or whatever it was we walked together down fleet street and into ludgate circus featherstone wearing his overcoat with the velvet collar and little round bowler hat i puffing a small cigar and with my old mac flapping in the wind i discovered that the gentleman beside me was quietly quizzing me about my career at the bar youve been at this game a long while rumpole featherstone announced i didnt disagree with him and then he went on you never thought of taking silk rumpole qc i almost burst out laughing not on your nelly rumpole queer customer thats what theyd be bound to call me im sure you could with your seniority i had no idea then of exactly what this featherstone was after i gave him my view of qcs in general perhaps if i played golf with the right judges or put up for parliament they might make me an artificial silk or at any rate a nylon it was at that point i realized i had put up a bit of a black sorry i forgot you did put up for parliament yes you never thought of rumpole qc featherstone had apparently taken no offence never i told him i have the honour to be an old bailey hack thats quite enough for me at which point we turned up into newgate street and there it was in all its glory touched by a hint of early spring sunshine the old bailey a stately law court decreed by the city fathers an edwardian palace with an extensive modern extension to deal with the increase in human fallibility there was the dome and the blindfold lady well its much better she doesnt see all thats going on that in fact was our english version of the palais de justice complete with murals marble statues and underground accommodation for some of the choicest villains in london terrible things go on down the bailey horrifying things why is it i never go in the revolving door without a thrill of pleasure a slight tremble of excitement why does it seem a much jollier place than my flat in gloucester road under the strict rule of she who must be obeyed these are questions which may only be partly answered in the course of these memoirs at the time when i was waving a cheerful umbrella at harry the policeman in the revolving door of the old bailey extension my wife hilda was at her daddys bedside at the horsham general arranging her dozen early daffs and gently probing so she told me that evening on the subject of his future and mine ill have to give up you know i cant go on forever crocked up im afraid said wystan nonsense daddy youll go on for years i imagine hilda did her best to sound bracing whilst putting the daffs firmly in their place no hilda no theyll have to start looking for another head of chambers this gave hilda her opportunity rumpoles the senior man apart from uncle tom and he doesnt really practise nowadays your husband the senior man wystan looked back on a singularly uneventful life how time flies i recall when he was the junior man my pupil you said he was the best youngster on bloodstains youd ever known hilda was doing her best for me rumpole yes your husband was pretty good on bloodstains shaky though on the law of landlord and tenant what sort of practice has rumpole now i believe today its the old bailey hilda was plumping pillows doing her best to sound casual and her father showed no particular enthusiasm for my place of work its always the old bailey isnt it most of the time yes i suppose so not a frightfully good address the old bailey not exactly the swi of the legal profession sensing that daddy would have thought better of me if id been in the court of appeal or the chancery division hilda told me she thought of a master stroke oh rumpole only went down to the bailey because its a family he knows it seems theyve got a young boy in trouble this appealed to daddy he gave one of his bleak smiles which amount to no more than a brief withdrawal of lips from the dentures son gone wrong he said very sad that especially if he comes of a really good family that really good family the timsons was out in force and waiting outside number i court by the time i had got on the fancy dress yellowing horsehair wig gown become more than a trifle tattered over the years and bands round the neck that albert ought to have sent to the laundry after last weeks death by dangerous driving as i looked at the timson clan assembled i thought the best thing about them was the amount of work of a criminal nature they had brought into chambers they were all dressed for the occasion the men in dark blazers suede shoes and grey flannels the ladies in tightfitting suits high heels and elaborately piled hairdos i had never seen so many exclients together at one time mr rumpole ah bernard youre instructing me mr bernard the solicitor was a thirtyish perpetually smiling man in a pinstriped suit he regarded criminals with something of the naive fervour with which young girls think of popular entertainers had i known the expression at the time i would have called him a grafters groupie im always your instructing solicitor in a timson case mr rumpole mr bernard beamed and fred timson a kindly man and most innocent robber stepped out of the ranks to do the honours nothing but the best for the timsons best solicitor and best barrister going you know my wife vi young jims mother seemed full of confidence as i took her hand i remembered i had got vi off on a handling charge after the croydon bank raid well there was really no evidence uncle cyril fred introduced the plumpish uncle with the small moustache whom i was sure i remembered what was his last outing exactly carrying housebreaking instruments by night uncle dennis you remember den surely mr rumpole i did dens last little matter was an alleged conspiracy to forge log books and dens doris aunty doris came at me in a blur of hennaed hair and darkish perfume what was doriss last indiscretion could it have been receiving a vast quantity of stolen scampi acquitted by a majority at least i was sure of that and yours truly frederick timson the boys father regrettable but we had a slipup with freds last spot of bother i was away with flu george frobisher took it over and he got three years he mustve only just got out so mr rumpole you know the whole family a family to breed from the timsons must almost keep the old bailey going singlehanded youre going to do your best for our young jim im sure mr rumpole i didnt find the simple faith of the timsons that i could secure acquittals in the most unlikely circumstances especially encouraging but then jims mother said something which i was to long remember hes a good boy he was ever so good to me while dad was away so that was jimbos life head of the family at fourteen when dad was off on one of his regular visits to her majesty its young jims first appearance like at the old bailey fred couldnt conceal a note of pride it was jim boys bar mitzvah his first communion so we chatted a little about how all the other boys got clean away which i told them was a bit of luck as none of them would go into the witness box and implicate jim and bernard pointed out that the identification by the butchers was pretty hopeless well what did he expect would you have a photographic impression of the young hopeful who struck you a smart blow on the back of the head with a cricket stump we talked with that curious suppressed excitement there always is before a trial however disastrous the outcome may be and i told them the only thing we had to worry about as if that were not enough was jims confession to the boy in the remand centre a youth who rejoiced in the name of peanuts malloy peanuts malloy little grass fred timson spoke with a deep contempt old persil white fitted him up with that one didnt he uncle cyril said it as if it were the most natural thing in the world and only to be expected chief detective inspector white bernard explained why should the chief inspector want to fit up your jimbo it was a question to which i should have known what their answer would be because hes a timson thats why said fred because hes the apple of our eye like uncle den told me and the boys mother added being as hes the baby of the family old persild fit up his mother if itd get him a smile from his super as fred said this the chief inspector himself greyhaired and avuncular walked by in plain clothes with a plainclothes sergeant morning chief inspector fred carried on without drawing breath morning fred morning mrs timson the chief inspector greeted the family with casual politeness after all they were part of his daily work and vi sniffed back a good morning chief inspector mr timson well shift our ground remove good friends like hamlet after seeing the ghost i thought it was better to continue our conference in private so we went and sat round a table in the canteen and when we had sorted out who took how many lumps and which of them could do with a choc roll or a cheese sandwich the family gave me the lowdown on the chief prosecution witness the chief inspector put that little grass peanuts molloy into jims painting class at the remand centre fred had no doubt about it jim apparently poured out his soul to peanuts the evidence sounded to my old ears completely convincing and bernard read us a snatch from his file we planned to do the old blokes from the butchers and grab the wages that i reminded the assembled company is what peanuts will say jim told him you think id bring jim up to talk in the nick like that the timsons aint stupid fred was outraged and vi pursing her lips in a sour gesture of wounded respectability added his dads always told him never say a word to anyone youre banged up with bound to be a grass one by one aunty doris uncle den and uncle cyril added their support thats right freds always brought the boy up proper like the way he should be hed never speak about the crime not to anyone he was banged up with specially not to one of the molloys the molloys vi spoke for the timsons and with deep hatred noted grasses that family always has been the molloys is beyond the pale well known for it aunty doris nodded her hennaed topknot wisely peanutss grandad shopped my old father in the streatham coop robbery prewar that was i had a vague memory then of what fred timson was talking about the streatham coop case one of my better briefs a long case with not much honour shown among thieves as far as i could remember then you can understand mr rumpole no timson would ever speak to a molloy so youre sure jimbo never said anything to peanuts i was wondering exactly how i could explain the deep but not particularly creditable origins of this family hostility to the jury i give you my word mr rumpole aint that enough for you no timson would ever speak to a molloy not under any circumstances there were not many matters on which i would take fred timsons word but the history of the streatham coop case came back to me and this was one of them its part of the life of an old bailey hack to spend a good deal of his time down in the cells in the basement area where they keep the old door of newgate kicked and scarred through which generations of villains were sent to the treadmill the gallows or the whip you pass this venerable door and ring a bell youre let in and your names taken by one of the warders who bring the prisoners from brixton theres a perpetual smell of cooking and the warders are snatching odd snacks of six inches of cheese butties and a gallon of tea lunch is being got ready and the cells under the bailey have a high reputation as one of the best caffs in london by the door the screws have their pinups and comic cartoons of judges you are taken to a waitingroom three steel chairs and a table and you meet the client perhaps he is a novice making his first appearance like jim timson perhaps hes an old hand asking anxiously which judge hes got knowing their form as accurately as a bettingshop proprietor whoever he is the client will be nervously excited keyed up for his great day full of absurd hope the worst part of a barristers life at the old bailey is going back to the cells after a guilty verdict to say goodbye theres no purpose in it but as a point of honour it has to be done even then the barrister probably gets the best reaction and almost never any blame the client is stunned knocked out by his sentence only in a couple of weeks time when the reality of being banged up with the sour smell of stone walls and his own chamber pot for company becomes apparent does the convict start to weep he is then drugged with sedatives and agatha christies from the prison library when i saw the youngest timson before his trial that morning i couldnt help noticing how much smaller and how much more experienced he looked than my nick in his clean sports jacket and carefully knotted tie he was well dressed for the dock and he showed all the carefully suppressed excitement of a young lad about to step into the limelight of number i with an old judge twelve jurors and a mixed bag of lawyers waiting to give him their undivided attention me speak to peanuts no timson dont ever speak to a molloy its a point of honour like jim added his voice to the family chorus since the raid on the streatham coop your grandfather dad told you about that did he yes dad told me well dad wouldnt let me speak to no molloy he wouldnt put up with it like i stood up grinding out the stub end of my small cigar in the old oxo tin thoughtfully provided by hms government it was i thought about time i called the meeting to order so jim i asked him whats the defence little jim knitted his brows and came out with his contributionwell i didnt do it thats an interesting defence somewhat novel so far as the timsons are concerned ive got my alibi aint i jim looked at me accusingly as at an insensitive visitor to a garden who has failed to notice the remarkable display of gladioli oh yes your alibi im afraid i didnt sound overwhelmed with enthusiasm dad reckoned it was pretty good mr bernard had his invaluable file open and was reading from that lessthaninspiring document our notice of alibi straight from school on that friday september nd i went up to tea at my aunty doriss and arrived there at exactly at pm my uncle den came home from work accompanied by my uncle cyril at pm when this alleged crime was taking place i was sat round the television with my aunty and two uncles i well remember we was watching the newcomers all very neat and workmanlike well that was it the family gave young jim an alibi clubbed together for it like a new bicycle however i had to disappoint mr bernard about the bright shining alibi and we went through the swing doors on our way into court we cant use that alibi we cant mr bernard look wounded as if id just insulted his favourite child think about it bernard dont be blinded by the glamour of the criminal classes call the uncles and the aunties let them all be crossexamined about their records the juryll realize our jimbo comes from a family of villains who keep a cupboard full of alibis for all occasions mr bernard was forced to agree but i went into my old place in court thinking that the devilish thing about that impossible alibi was that it might even be true so there i was sitting in my favourite seat in court down in the firing line and there was jim boy undersized for a prisoner just peeping over the edge of the dock guarded in case he ran amok and started attacking the judge by a huge dock officer there was the jury solid and grey listening impassionately as guthrie featherstone spread out his glittering mass of incriminating facts before them i dont know why it is that juries all look the same take twelve good men and women off the street and they all look middleaged anonymous slightly stunned an average jury of average people trying an average case perhaps being a jury has become a special profession for specially average people what do you want to do when you grow up my boy be a jury man daddy well done my boy you can work a fivehour day for reasonable expenses and occasionally send people to chokey so as the carefully chosen words of guthrie featherstone passed over our heads like expensive hair oil and as the enthusiastic young maclay noted it all down and the rumpole supporters club the timsons sat and pursed their lips and now and then whispered lies all lies to each other i sat watching the judge rather as a noted toreador watches the bull from the barrier during the preliminary stages of the corrida and remembered what i knew of mr justice everglade known to his few friends as florrie everglades father was lord chancellor about the time when jims grandfather was doing over the streatham coop educated at winchester and balliol he always cracked the times crossword in the opening of an egg he was most happy with international trust companies suing each other on nice points of law and was only there for a fortnights slumming down the old bailey i wondered exactly what he was going to make of peanuts molloy members of the jury its right that you should know that it is alleged that timson took part in this attack with a number of other youths none of whom have been arrested featherstone was purring to a halt the boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled i muttered but the judge was busy congratulating learned counsel for her majesty the queen who was engaged that morning in prosecuting the pride of the timsons it is quite right you should tell the jury that mr featherstone perfectly right and proper if your lordship pleases featherstone was now bowing slightly and my hackles began to rise what was this the old chums league fellow members of the athenaeum i am most grateful to your lordship for that indication featherstone did his wellknown butler passing the sherry act again i wondered why the old darling didnt crawl up on the bench with mr justice everglade and black his boots for him so i imagine this young mans defence is he wasnt ejusdem generis with the other lads the judge was now holding a private conversation a mutual admiration society with my learned friend i decided to break it up and levered myself to my feet i m sorry your lordship was asking about the defence the judge turned an unfriendly eye on me and fumbled for my name i told you he was a stranger to the old bailey where the name of rumpole is i think tolerably well known yes mr er the clerk of the court handed him up a note on which the defenders name was inscribed rumpole i am reluctant to intrude on your lordships confidential conversation with my learned friend but your lordship was asking about the defence you are appearing for the young man timson i have that honour at which point the doors of the court swung open and albert came in with nick a boy in a blazer and a schooltie who passed the boy in the dock with only a glance of curiosity i always thank god when i consider the remote politeness with which i was treated by the reverend wilfred rumpole that i get on extremely well with nick we understand each other my boy and i and have when hes at home formed a strong but silent alliance against the almost invincible rule of she who must be obeyed he is as fond as i am of the sherlock holmes tales and when we walked together in hyde park and kensington gardens young nick often played the part of holmes whilst i trudged beside him as watson trying to deduce the secret lives of those we passed by the way they shined their shoes or kept their handkerchiefs in their sleeves so i gave a particularly welcoming smile to nick before i gave my attention back to florrie and as jim timsons counsel i told his lordship i might know a little more about his case than counsel for the prosecution to which mr justice everglade trotted out his favourite bit of latin i imagine he said loftily your client says he was not ejusdemgeneris with the other lads ejusdem generis oh yes my lord hes always saying that ejusdem generis is a phrase in constant use in his particular part ofbrixton i had hit a minor jackpot and was rewarded with a tinkle of laughter from the timsons and a smile of genuine congratulation from nick mr justice everglade was inexperienced down the bailey he gave us a bare hour for lunch and nick and i had it in the canteen there is one thing you can say against crime the catering facilities arent up to much nick told me about school and freely confessed as im sure he wouldnt have done to his mother that hed been in some sort of trouble that term there was an old deserted vicarage opposite schoolhouse and he and his friends had apparently broken in the scullery window and assembled there for poker parties and the consumption of cherry brandy i was horrified as i drew up the indictment which seemed to me to contain charges of burglary at common law house breaking under the forcible entries act contravening the betting gaming lotteries act and serving alcohol on unlicensed premises crabtree actually invited a couple of girls from the village nick continued his confession but bagnold never got to hear of that bagnold was nicks headmaster the school equivalent of persil white i cheered up a little at the last piece of information then theres no evidence of girls as far as your case goes theres no reason to suppose the girls ever existed as for the other charges which are serious yes yes i suppose they are rather i imagine you were walking past the house on sunday evening and attracted by the noise you went to investigate dad bagnold came in and found us playing poker nick wasnt exactly being helpful i tried another line i know my lord my client was only playing poker in order not to look too pious whilst he lectured his fellow sixth formers on the evils of gambling and cherry brandy dad be serious i am serious dont you want me to defend you no bagnolds not going to tell the police or anything like that i was amazed he isnt whats he going to do well ill miss next terms exeat do extra work i thought i should tell you before you got a letter thank you nick thank you im glad you told me so theres no question of the police the police nick was laughing of course not bagnold doesnt want any trouble after all were still at school i watched nick as he finished his fish and chips and then turned my thoughts to jim timson who had also been at school but with no kindly bagnold to protect him back in court i was crossexamining that notable grass peanuts molloy a skinnier more furtive edition of jim timson the crossexamination was being greatly enjoyed by the timsons and nick but not much by featherstone or chief detective inspector persit white who sat at the table in front of me i also thought that mr justice florrie everglade was thinking that he would have been happier snoozing in the athenaeum or working on his grossepoint in egerton terrace than listening to me bowling fast inswingers at the juvenile chief witness for the prosecution you dont speak the molloys and the timsons are like the montagues and the capulets i put it to peanuts what did you say they were the judge had of course given me my opportunity i smacked him through the slips for a crafty single not ejusdem generis my lord i said nick joined in the laughter and even the ranks of featherstone had to stifle a smile the usher called silence we were back to the business in hand tell me peanuts how would you describe yourself is that a proper question featherstone uncoiled himself gracefully i ignored the interruption i mean artistically are you a latterday impressionist do all your oils in little dots do you abstract painter white squares on a white background do you indulge in watches melting in the desert like dear old salvador dali i dont know what youre talking about peanuts played a blocking shot and featherstone tried a weary smile to the judge my lord neither i must confess do i sit quietly featherstone i muttered to him all will be revealed to you i turned my attention back to peanuts are you a dedicated artist the rembrandt of the remand centre i hadnt done no art before peanuts confirmed my suspicions so we are to understand that this occasion when jim poured out his heart to you was the first painting lesson youd ever been to peanuts admitted it youd been at the remand centre how long couple of months i was done for a bit of an affray i didnt ask you that and im sure the reason you were on remand was entirely creditable what i want to know is what inspired you with this sudden fascination for the arts well the chief screw he suggested it now we were beginning to get to the truth of the matter like his old grandfather in the streatham coop days jim had been banged up with a notable grass you were suddenly told to join the painting class werent you and put yourself next to jim something like that yeah what did he say florrie frowned it was all very strange to him and yet he was starting to get the hint of something that wasnt quite cricket something like that my lord i repeated slowly giving the judge a chance to make a note and you were sent there not in the pursuit of art peanuts but in the pursuit of evidence you knew that and you supplied your masters with just what they wanted to hear even though jim timson didnt say a word to you everyone in court including nick looked impressed di white bit hard on a polo mint and featherstone oozed to his feet in a rescue bid thats great dad thanks nick sorry its not a murder i dont know quite what my learned friend is saying is he suggesting that the police oh its an old trick i said staring hard at the chief inspector bang the suspect up with a notable grass when youre really pushed for evidence they do it with grownups often enough now theyre trying it with children mr rumpole the judge sighed you are speaking a language which is totally foreign to me let me try and make myself clear my lord i was suggesting that peanuts was put there as a deliberate trap by now even the judge had the point you are suggesting that mr molloy was not a genuine amateur painter no my lord merely an amateur witness yes i actually got a faint smile i see please go on mr rumpole another day or so of this i felt and id get invited to tea at the athenaeum what did you say first to jim as you drew your easel alongside dont remember dont you i think we was speaking about the stones what stones are these the judges ignorance of the life around him seemed to be causing him some sort of wild panic remember this was and i was in a similar state of confusion until nick whispering from behind me gave me the clue the rolling stones my lord the information meant nothing to him im afraid a great deal of this case seems to be taking place in a foreign tongue mr rumpole jazz musicians as i understand it my lord of some notoriety by courtesy of nick i filled his lordship in on the scene well the notoriety hasnt reached me said the judge providing the obedient featherstone with the laugh of the year if not the century when the learned prosecuting counsel had recovered his solemnity peanuts went rambling on we was talking about the stones concert at the hammersmith odeon wed both been to it like and well we talked about that and then he said jim said well he said as how he and the other blokes had done the butchers the conversation had now taken a nasty turn i saw that the judge was writing industriously jim said that he and the other blokes had done the butchers florrie was plying his pencil then he looked up at me well mr rumpole is that a convenient moment to adjourn it was a very convenient moment for the prosecution as the evidence against us would be the last thing the jury heard before sloping off to their homes and loved ones it was also a convenient moment for peanuts he would have his second wind by the morning so there was nothing for it but to take nick for a cup of tea and a pile of crumpets in the abc and so home to she who must be obeyed so picture us three that evening finishing dinner and a bottle of claret celebrating the return of the young master at hack hall counsels castle rumpole manor or froxbury court gloucester road hilda had told nick that his grandpa had sent his love and expected a letter and also dropped me the encouraging news that old ch wystan was retiring and quite appreciated that i was the senior man nick asked me if i was really going to be head of chambers seeming to look at me with a new respect and we drank a glass of claret to the future whatever it might be then nick asked me if i really thought peanuts molloy was lying if hes not hes giving a damn good imitation then i told hilda as she started to clear away nick enjoyed the case even though it was only a robbery oh nick i wish youd been there to hear me crossexamine about the bloodstains in the penge bungalow murder nick wasnt born when you did the penge bungalow murder my wife is always something of a wet blanket i commiserated with my son bad luck old boy you were great with that judge i think nick had really enjoyed himself there was this extraordinary judge who was always talking latin and dad was teasing him you want to be careful hilda was imposing her will on the pudding plates how you tease judges if youre to be head of chambers on which line she departed leaving nick and i to our claret and conversation i began to discuss with nick the horrifying adventure of the speckled band youre still reading those tales are you i asked nick well not lately but you remember i used to read them to you didnt i after she had ordered you to bed when you werent too busy noting up your murders and remember we were holmes and watson when we went for walks in hyde park i remember one walk that was odd as i recall it had been our custom ever at a weekend before nick went away to boarding school i lit a small cigar and looked at the great detective through the smoke tell me holmes what did you think was the most remarkable piece of evidence given by the witness peanuts molloy when he said they talked about the rolling stones holmes you astonish me you see watson we were led to believe they were such enemies i mean the families were theyd never spoken i see what youre driving at have another glass of claret stimulates the detective ability i opened another bottle a clatter from the kitchen telling me that the lady was not about to join us and there they were chatting about a pop concert didnt that strike you as strange my dear watson it struck me as bloody rum if you want to know the truth holmes i was delighted to see nick taking over the case theyd both been to the concert well that doesnt mean anything not necessarily i mean i was at that concert were you indeed it was at the end of the summer holidays i dont remember you mentioning it i said i was going to the festival hall i found this confidence pleasing knowing that it wasnt to be shared with hilda very wise your mother no doubt feels that at the hammersmith odeon they reenact some of the worst excesses of the roman empire you didnt catch sight of peanuts and young jimbo did you there were about two thousand fans all screaming i dont know if it helps no if they were old mates i mean jim might really have confided in him all tht same peanuts is lying andrew noticed it youve got the instinct nick youve got a nose for the evidence your career at the bar is bound to be brilliant i raised my glass to nick when are you taking silk shortly after this she entered with news that nick had a dentists appointment the next day which would prevent his reappearance down the bailey all the same he had given me a great deal of help and before i went to bed i telephoned bernard the solicitor tore him away from his fireside and instructed him to undertake some pretty immediate research next morning albert told me that hed had a letter from old ch wystan hildas daddy mentioning his decision to retire i think well manage pretty well with you mr rumpole as head of chambers albert told me theres not much you and i wont be able to sort out sir over a glass or two in pommeroys wine bar and soon well be welcoming master nick in chambers nick well yes i had to admit it he is showing a certain legal aptitude itll be a real family affair mr rumpole like father like son if you want my opinion i remembered alberts words when i saw fred timson waiting for me outside the court but before i had time to brood on family tradition bernard came up with the rolledup poster for a pop concert i grabbed it from him and carried it as unobtrusively as possible into court when jim told you hed done up the butchers he didnt tell you the date that that had happened peanuts was back facing the bowling and featherstone was up to his usual tricks rising to interrupt my lord the date is set out quite clearly in the indictment the time had come quite obviously for a burst of righteous indignation my lord i am crossexamining on behalf of a yearold boy on an extremely serious charge id be grateful if my learned friend didnt supply information which all of us in court know except for the witness very well do carry on mr rumpole i was almost beginning to like mr justice everglade no he never told me when like i thought it was sometime in the summer peanuts tried to sound cooperative sometime in the summer are you a fan of the rolling stones peanuts yes remind me they were still vaguely puzzled the judge was hunting back through his notes sleek as a butler with a dish of peas featherstone supplied the information the musicians my lord and so was jim a fan i ploughed on ignoring the gentlemans gentleman he was yes you had discussed music before you met in the remand centre before the nick oh yes peanuts was following me obediently down the garden path you used to talk about it at school yes in quite a friendly way i was conscious of a startled fred timson looking at his son and of jim in the dock looking for the first time ashamed we was all right yes did you ever go to a concert with jimbo please think carefully we went to one or two concerts together peanuts conceded in the evening yes what would you do call at his home and collect him youre joking oh no peanuts in this case im not joking at all no harm i thought at that stage in underlining the seriousness of the occasion course i wouldnt call at his home your families dont speak you wouldnt be welcomed in each others houses the montagues and the capulets mr rumpole the old sweetheart on the bench had finally got the message i gave him a bow to show my true love and affection if your lordship pleases your lordship puts it extremely aptly i turned back to peanuts so what would you do if you were going to a concert wed leave school together like and then hang around the caffs hang around the caffs cafoys mr rumpole mr justice everglade was enjoying himself translating the answer yes of course the cafays until it was time to go up west if my lord would allow me up to the west end of london together yes so you wouldnt be separated on these evenings you went to concerts together it was one of those questions after which you hold your breath there can be so many wrong answers no we hung around together rumpole breathed a little more easily but he still had the final question the great gamble with all jim timsons chips firmly piled on the red fait vosjeux msieurs et mesdames of the old bailey jury i spun the wheel and did that happen when you went to the rolling stones at the hammersmith odeon a nasty silence then the ball rattled into the hole peanuts said yes that was this summer wasnt it we were into the straight now cantering home in the summer yeah you left school together and hung around the caffs like then we went up the odeon together all the time i told you didnt i peanuts looked bored and then amazed as i unrolled the poster bernard had brought rushed by taxi from hammersmith with the date clearly printed across the bottom my lord my learned friend might be interested to know the date of the only rolling stones concert at the hammersmith odeon this year i gave featherstone an unwelcome eyeful of the poster he might like to compare it with the date so conveniently set out in the indictment when the subsequent formalities were over i went down to the cells this was not a visit of commiseration no time for a sorry old sweetheart but and a deep consciousness of having asked one too many questions all the same i was in no gentle mood in fact it would be fair to say that i was bloody angry with jimbo you had an alibi you had a proper reasonable truthful alibi and joy of joys it came from the prosecution why the hell didnt you tell me jim who seemed to have little notion of the peril he had passed answered me quite calmly dad wouldntve liked it dad whats dad got to do with it i was astonished he wouldntve liked it mr rumpole not me going out with peanuts so you were quite ready to be found guilty to be convicted of robbery just because your dad wouldnt like you going out with peanuts molloy dad got the family to alibi me jim clearly felt that the timsons had done their best for him keep it in the family though it was heavily kid on the irony was lost on jim he smiled politely and stood up eager to join the clan upstairs well anyway thanks a lot mr rumpole dad said i could rely on you to win the day like id better collect me things if jim thought i was going to let him get away as easily as that he was mistaken rumpole rose in his crumpled gown doing his best to represent the majesty of the law no wait a minute i didnt win the day it was luck the purest fluke it wont happen again youre joking mr rumpole jim thought i was being modest dad told me about you he says you never let the timsons down i had a sudden vision of my role in life from young jims point of view and i gave him the voice of outrage which i use frequently in court i had a message of importance for jim timson do you think thats what im here for to help you along in a career like your dads jim was still smiling maddeningly my god i shouldnt have asked those questions i shouldnt have found out the date of the concert then youd really be happy wouldnt you you could follow in dads footsteps all your life sharp spell of borstal training to teach you the mysteries of housebreaking and then a steady life in the nick you might really do well you might end up in parkhurst maximum security wing doing a glamorous twenty years and a hero to the screws at which the door opened and a happy screw entered for the purpose of springing young jim until the inevitable next time weve got his things at the gate mr rumpole come on jim you cant stay here all night ive got to go jim agreed i dont know how to face dad really me being so friendly with peanuts jim i tried a last appeal if youre at all grateful for what i did oh i am mr rumpole im quite satisfied generous of him then you can perhaps repay me why arent you on legal aid its not that leave him leave your dad jim frowned for a moment he seemed to think it over then he said i dont know as how i can you dont know mum depends on me you see like when dad goes away she depends on me then as head of the family so he left me and went up to temporary freedom and his new responsibilities my mouth was dry and i felt about years old so i took the lift up to that luxurious eatery the old bailey canteen for a cup of tea and a penguin biscuit and pushing his tray along past the urns i met a philosophic chief inspector persil white he noticed my somewhat lugubrious expression and tried a cheering dont look so miserable mr rumpole you won didnt you nobody won the truth emerges sometimes inspector even down the old bailey i must have sounded less than gracious the wiley old copper smiled tolerantly hes a timson it runs in the family well get him sooner or later yes yes i suppose you will at a table in a corner i found certain members of my chambers george frobisher percy hoskins and young tony maclay now resting from their labours their wigs lying among cups of old bailey tea buns and choccy bics i joined them wordsworth entered my head and i gave him an airing trailing clouds of glory do we come marvellous win that i was telling them young maclay thought i was announcing my triumph yes rumpole i hear youve had a splendid win old george ever generous smiled genuinely pleased itll be years before you get the cheque hoskins grumbled not in entire forgetfulness and not in utter nakedness but trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home i was thinking of jim trying to sort out his situation with the help of wordsworth you dont get paid for years at the old bailey i try to tell my grocer that if you had to wait as long to be paid for a pound of sugar i tell him as we do for an armed robbery hoskins was warming to a wellloved theme but george dear old george was smiling at me albert tells me hes had a letter from wystan i just wanted to say im sure wed all like to say youll make a splendid head of chambers rumpole heaven lies about us in our infancy shades of the prison house begin to close upon the growing boy but he beholds the light and whence it flows he sees it in his joy i gave them another brief glimpse of immortality george looked quite proud of me and told maclay rumpole quotes poetry he does it quite often but does the growing boy behold the light i wondered or was the old sheep of the lake district being unduly optimistic itll be refreshing for us all to have a head of chambers who quotes poetry george went on at which point percy hoskins produced a newspaper which turned out to contain an item of news for us all have you seen the times rumpole no i havent had time for the crossword guthrie featherstone hes taken silk it was the apotheosis the great day for the labourconservative member for wherever it was one time unsuccessful prosecutor of jim timson and now one of her majestys counsel called within the bar and he went down to the house of lords tailored out in his new silk gown a lace jabot knee breeches with diamante buckles patent shoes black silk stockings lace cuffs and a fullbottomed wig that made him look like a pedigree but not overbright spaniel however guthrie featherstone was a tall man with a good calf in a silk stocking and he took with him marigold his lady wife who was young enough and i suppose pretty enough for henry our junior clerk to eye wistfully although she had the sort of voice that puts me instantly in mind of headscarves and gymkhanas that high pitched nasal whining which a girl learns from too much contact with the saddle when young and too little with the timsons of this world in later life the couple were escorted by albert whod raided moss bros for a top hat and morning coat for the occasion and when the lord chancellor had welcomed guthrie to that special club of queens counsel they came back to chambers where champagne was served by henry and old miss patterson our typist in wystans big room looking out over temple gardens ch wystan our retiring head was not among those present as the party began and i took an early opportunity to get stuck into the beaded bubbles after the fourth glass i felt able to relax a bit and wandered to where featherstone in all his finery was holding forth to erskinebrown about the problems of appearing en travestie i arrived just as he was saying its the stockings thatre the problem oh yes they would be i did my best to sound interested keeping them up i do understand well marigold my wife marigold i looked across to where mrs qc was tinkling with laughter at some old legal anecdote of uncle toms it was a laugh that seemed in some slight danger of breaking the wine glasses that marigold her sisters a nurse you know and she put me in touch with this shop which supplies suspender belts to nurses among other things really this conversation seemed to arouse some dormant sexual interest in erskinebrown yards of elastic for the larger ward sister but it works miraculously youre wearing a suspender belt erskinebrown was frankly fascinated you sexy devil i hadnt realized the full implications i told the qc of rising to the heights of the legal profession i wandered off to where uncle tom was giving marigold a brief history of life in our chambers over the last halfcentury percy hoskins was in attendance and george its sometime since we had champagne in chambers uncle tom accepted a refill from albert its sometime since we had a silk in chambers hoskins smiled at marigold who flashed a row of wellgroomed teeth back at him i recall we had a man in chambers once called drinkwater oh before you were born hoskins and some fellow came and paid drinkwater a hundred guineas for six months pupillage and you know what this drinkwater fellow did bought us all champagne and the next day he ran off to calais with his junior clerk we never saw hide nor hair of either of them again he paused marigold looked puzzled not quite sure if this was the punch line of course you could get a lot further in those days on a hundred guineas uncle tom ended on a sad note and marigold laughed heartily your husbands star has risen so quickly mrs featherstone only ten years call and hes an mp and leading counsel hoskins was clearly so excited by the whole business he had stopped worrying about his cheques for half an hour oh its the pr you know guthries frightfully good at the pr i felt like everglade marigold was speaking a strange and incomprehensible language guthrie always says the most important thing at the bar is to be polite to your instructing solicitor dont you find that mrrumpole polite to solicitors its never occurred to me guthrie admires you so mr rumpole he admires your style of advocacy i had just sunk another glass of the beaded bubbles as passed by albert and i felt a joyous release from my usual strong sense of tact and discretion i suppose it makes a change from bowing three times and offering to black the judges boots for him marigolds smile didnt waver he says youre most amusing out of court too dont you quote poetry only in moments of great sadness madam or extreme elation guthries so looking forward to leading you in his next big case this was an eventuality which i should have taken into account as soon as i saw guthrie in silk stockings as a matter of fact it had never occurred to me leading me did you say leading me well he has to have a junior now doesnt he naturally he wants the best junior available now hes a leader now hes left the junior bar i raised my glass and gave marigold a version of browning just for a pair of knee breeches he left us just for an elastic suspender belt as supplied to the nursing profession at which the qc himself bore down on us in a rustle of silk and drew me into a corner i just wanted to say i dont see why recent events should make the slightest difference to the situation in chambers you are the senior man in practice rumpole henry was passing with the fizzing bottle i held out my glass and the tide ran foaming in it you wrong me brutus i told featherstone you said an older soldier not a better a quotation touchd very apt is it i mean all this will make absolutely no difference ill still support you rumpole as the right candidate for head of chambers i didnt know about being a candidate having thought of the matter as settled and not being much of a political animal but before i had time to reflect on whatever the honourable member was up to the door opened letting in a formidable draught and the head of chambers ch wystan shes daddy wearing a tweed suit extremely pale supported by albert on one side and a stick on the other made the sort of formidable entrance that the ghost of banquo stages at dinner with the macbeths wystan was installed in an armchair from which he gave us all the sort ot wintry smile which seemed designed to indicate that all flesh is as the grass or something to that effect albert wrote to me about this little celebration i was determined to be with you and the doctor has given permission for no more than one glass of champagne wystan held out a transparent hand into which albert inserted a glass of non vintage wystan lifted this with some apparent effort and gave us a toast to the great change in chambers now we have a silk guthrie featherstone qc mp i had a large refill to that wystan absorbed a few bubbles wiped his mouth on a clean folded handkerchief and proceeded to the oration wystan was never a great speech maker but i claimed another refill and gave him my ears you featherstone have brought a great distinction to chambers isnt that nice guthrie marigold proprietorially squeezed her masters fingers you know when i was a young man you remember when we were young men uncle tom we used to hang around in chambers for weeks on end wystan had gone on about these distant hard times at every chambers meeting i well recall we used to occupy ourselves with an old golf ball and mashieniblick trying to get chip shots into the wastepaper baskets albert was a boy then a mere child mr wystan albert looked suitably demure and we used to pray for work any sort of work didnt we uncle tom we were tempted to crime only way we could get into court uncle tom took the feed line like a professional moderate laughter except for rumpole who was busy drinking and then i heard wystan rambling on but as you grow older at the bar you discover its not having any work that matters its the quality that counts here here im always saying we ought to do more civil this was the dutiful erskinebrown inserting his oar now guthrie featherstone qc mp will of course command briefs in all divisions planning contract wystans voice sank to a note of awe even chancery i was so afraid after ive gone that this chambers might become known as merely a criminal set wystans voice now sank in a sort of horror and of course theres no doubt about it too much criminal work does rather lower the standing of a chambers couldnt you install pithead baths i hadnt actually meant to say it aloud but it came out very loud indeed ah horace wystan turned his pale eyes on me for the first time so we could have a good scrub down after we get back from the old bailey now horace rumpole and i mean no disrespect whatever to my soninlaw wystan returned to the oration from far away i heard myself say daddy as i raised the hardworking glass horace does practise almost exclusively in the criminal courts one doesnt get the really fascinating points of law not in criminal work erskinebrown was adding unwanted support to the motion ive often thought we should try and attract some really lucrative tax cases into chambers that im afraid did it just as if i were in court i moved slightly to the centre and began my speech tax cases i saw them all smiling encouragement at me marvellous tax cases make the world go round compared to the wonderful world of tax crime is totally trivial what does it matter if some boy loses a year a couple of years of his life its totally unimportant anyway hell grow up to be banged up for a good five shut up with his own chamber pot in some convenient hole we all prefer not to think about there was a deafening silence which came loudest from marigold featherstone then wystan tried to reach a settlement now then horace your practice no doubt requires a good deal of skill skill who said skill i glared round at the learned friends any fool could do it its only a matter of life and death thats all it is crime its a sort of a game how can you compare it to the real world of off shore securities and deductible expenses all you young men in chambers can learn an enormous amount from horace rumpole when it comes to crime wystan now seemed to be the only one who was still smiling i turned on him you make me sound just like fred timson really whoevers fred timson i told you wystan never had much of a practice at the bar consequently he had never met the timsons erskinebrown supplied the information the timsons are rumpoles favourite family an industrious clan of south london criminals arent they rumpole hoskins added wystan looked particularly pained south london criminals i mean do we want people like the timsons forever hanging about in our waiting room i merely ask the question he was not bad this erskinebrown with a big future in the nastier sort of breach of trust cases do you do you merely ask it i heard the pained bellow of a distant rumpole the timsons and their like are no doubt grist to rumpoles mill wystan was starting on the summing up but its the balance that counts now youll be looking for a new head of chambers are we still looking my friend george frobisher had the decency to ask and wystan told him id like you all to think it over carefully and put your views to me in writing we should all try and remember its the good of the chambers that matters not the feelings however deep they may be of any particular person he then called on alberts assistance to raise him to his feet lifted his glass with an effort of pure will and oifered us a toast to the good of chambers i joined in and drank deep it having been a good thirty seconds since i had had a glass to my lips as the bubbles exploded against the tongue i noticed that the featherstones were holding hands and the brand new artificial silk was looking particularly delighted something and perhaps not only his suspender belt seemed to be giving him special pleasure some weeks later when i gave hilda the news she was deeply shocked guthrie featherstone head of chambers we were at breakfast in fact nick was due back at school that day he was neglecting his cornflakes and reading a book by general acclaim im sorry hilda looked at me as if shed just discovered that id contracted an incurable disease he can have the headaches working out alberts extraordinary bookkeeping system i thought for a moment yes id like to have been head of chambers and then put the thought from me if only you could have become a qc she was now pouring me an unsolicited cup of coffee qc ct thats enough to keep me busy ct whatevers ct counsel for the timsons i tried to say it as proudly as i could then i reminded nick that id promised to see him off at liverpool street finished my cooling coffee stood up and took a glance at the book that was absorbing him expecting it to be perhaps that spinechilling adventure relating to the footprints of an enormous hound to my amazement the shocker in question was entitled simply studies in sociology its interesting nick sounded apologetic you astonish me old bagnold was talking about what i should read if i get into oxford of course youre going to read law nick were going to keep it in the family hilda the barristers daughter was clearing away deafeningly i thought perhaps ppe and then go on to sociology nick sounded curiously confident before hilda could get in another word i made my position clear ppe thats very good nick thats very good indeed for gods sake lets stop keeping things in the family later as we walked across the barren stretches of liverpool street station with my son in his school uniform and me in my old striped trousers and black jacket i tried to explain what i meant thats whats wrong nick thats the devil of it theyre being born around us all the time little mr justice everglades little timsons little guthrie featherstones all being set off to follow in fathers footsteps we were at the barrier shaking hands awkwardly lets have no more of that no more following in fathers footsteps no more nick smiled although i have no idea if he understood what i was trying to say im not totally sure that i understood it either then the train removed him from me i waved for a little but he didnt wave back that sort of thing is embarrassing for a boy i lit a small cigar and went by tube to the bailey i was doing a long firm fraud then a particularly nasty business out of which i got a certain amount of harmless fun
