a wild night in galway a wild night in galway ray bradbury we were far out at the tip of ireland in galway where the weather strikes from its bleak quarters in the atlantic with sheets of rain and gusts of cold and still more sheets of rain you go to bed and wake in the middle of the night thinking you heard someone cry thinking you yourself were weeping and feel at your face and find it dry then you look at the window and think why yes its just rain the rain always the rain and turn over sadder still and fumble about for your dripping sleep and try to get it back on we were out as i said in galway which is grey stone with green beards on it a rock town and the sea coming in and the rain failing down and we had been there a month solid working with our film director on a script which was with immense irony to be shot in the warm yellow sun of mexico some time in january the pages of the script were full of fiery bulls and hot tropical flowers and burning eyes and i typed it with choppedoff frozen fingers in my grey hotel room where the food was criminals gruel and the weather a beast at the window on the st night a knock at the door at seven the door opened my film director stepped nervously in lets get the hell out and find some wild life in ireland and forget this damn rain he said all in a rush what rain i said sucking my fingers to get the ice out the concussion here under the roof is so steady im shellshocked and have quite forgot the stuffs coming down four weeks here and youre talking irish said the director hand me my clay pipe i said and we ran from the room where said i johnny murphys pub said he and we blew along the stony street in the dark that rocked gently as a boat on a black flood because of the tiltydancing streetlights above which made the shadows tear and fly uneasy then sweatrng rain faces pearled we struck through the pub door and it was warm as a sheepfold because there were the townsmen pressed in a great compost heap at the bar and johnny murphy yelling jokes and foaming up drinks johnny cried the director were here for a wild night a wild night well make it said johnny and in a moment a slug of john jamieson was burning lace patterns in our stomachs to let new light in i exhaled fire thats a start i said we had another and listened to the rollicking jests and the jokes that were less than halfclean or so we guessed for the brogue made it difficult and the whisky poured on the brogue and thus combined made it doubledifficult but we knew when to laugh because when a joke was finished the men hit their knees and then hit us theyd give their limb a great smack and then bang us on the arm or thump us in the chest as our breath exploded wed shape the explosion to hilarity and squeeze our eyes tight tears ran down our cheeks not from joy but from the exquisite torture of the drink scalding our throats thus pressed like shy flowers in a huge warmmouldy book the director and i lingered on waiting for some vast event at last my directors patience thinned johnny he called across the seethe its been wild so far all right but we want it wilder i mean the biggest night ireland ever saw whereupon johnny whipped off his apron shrugged his meatcleaver shoulders into a tweed coat jumped up in the air and slid down inside his raincoat slung on his beardy cap and thrust us at the door nail everything down till i get back he advised his crew im taking these gents to the damnedest evening ever little do they know what waits for them out there he opened the door and pointed the wind threw half a ton of icewater on him taking this as no more than an additional spur to rhetoric johnny not wiping his face added in a roar out with you here we go do you think we should i said doubtful now that things seemed really letting go what do you mean cried the director what do you want to do go freeze in your room rewrite that scene you did so lousily today no no i said and slung on my own cap i was first outside thinking ive a wife and three loud but lovely children what am i doing here eight thousand miles gone from them on the off side of gods behind do i really want to do this then like ahab i thought on my bed a damp box with its pale cool windingsheets and the window dripping next to it like a conscience all night through i groaned i opened the door of johnny murphys car took my legs apart to get in and in no time we shot down the town like a ball in a bowling alley johnny murphy at the wheel talked fierce half hilarity half sobering king lear a wild night is it youll have the grandest night ever he said youd never guess would you to walk through ireland so much could go on under the skin i knew there must be an outlet somewhere i yelled the speedometer was up to onehundred kilometres an hour stone walls raced by on the right stone walls raced by on the left it was raining the entire dark sky down on the entire dark land outlet indeed said johnny if the church knew but it dont or then maybe it does but figures the poor buggars and lets us be where what youll see said murphy the speedometer read my stomach was stone like the stone walls rushing left and right up over a hill down into a valley does the car have brakes i wondered death on an irish road i thought a wreck and before anyone found us strewn wed melt away in the pounding rain and be part of the turf by morn whats death anyways better than hotel food cant we go a bit faster i asked its done said johnny and made it that will do it nicely i said in a faint voice wondering what lay ahead behind all the slatestone weeping walls of ireland what happened somewhere in this drizzling land were there hearthfleshed peachfuzz renoir women bright as lamps you could hold your hands out to and warm your palms beneath the raindrenched sod the flinty rocks at the numbed core of living was there one small seed of fire which fanned might break volcanoes free and boil the rains to steam was there then somewhere a baghdad harem nests awriggle and aslither with silk and tassel the absolute perfect tint of women unadorned we passed a church no we passed a convent no we passed a village slouched under its old mens thatch no stone walls to left stone walls to right no yet i glanced over at johnny murphy we could have switched off our lights and driven by the steady piercing beams of his forwarddirected eyes snatching at the dark flickering away the rain wife i thought to myself children forgive me for what i do this night terrible as it might be for this is ireland in the rain of an ungodly time and way out in galway where the dead must go to die the brakes were hit we slid a good ninety feet my nose mashed on the windshield johnny murphy was out of the car were here he sounded like a man drowning deep in the rain i looked left stone walls i looked right stone walls where is it i shouted where indeed he pointed mysteriously there i saw a hole in the wail a tiny gate flung wide the director and i followed at a plunge we saw other cars in the dark now and many bikes but not a light anywhere a secret i thought oh it must be wild to be this secret what am i doing here i yanked my cap lower rain crawled down my neck through the hole in the wall we stumbled johnny clenching our elbows here he husked stand here ill be a moment swig on this to keep your blood high i felt a flask knock my fingers i got the fire into my boilers and let the steam up the flues its a lovely rain i said the mans mad said murphy and drank after the director a shadow among shadows in the dark i squinted about i had an impression of midnight sea upon which men like little boats passed on the murmurous tides heads down muttering in twos and threes a hundred men stirred out beyond it has an unholy air good god whats it all about i asked myself incredibly curious now johnny said the director wait whispered johnny this is it what did i expect perhaps some scene like those old movies where innocent sailing ships suddenly flap down cabin walls and guns appear like magic to fire on the foe or a farmhouse falls apart like a cereal box long tom rears up to blast a projectile five hundred miles to target paris so here maybe i thought the stones will spill away each from the others the wails of that house will curtain back rosy lights will flash forth and from a monstrous cannon six a dozen ten dozen pink pearly women not dwarfirish but willowy french will be shot out over the heads and down into the waving arms of the grateful multitude benison indeed whats more manna the lights came on i blinked for i saw the entire unholy thing there it was laid out for me under the drizzling rain the lights came on the men quickened turned gathered and we with them a mechanical rabbit popped out of a little box at the far end of the stony yard and ran eight dogs let free from gates yelping ran after in a great circle there was not one yell or a murmur from the crowd of men their heads turned slowly watching the rain rained down on the illuminated scene the rain fell upon tweed caps and thin cloth coats the rain dripped off thick eyebrows and thin noses the rain beat on hunched shoulders i stared the rabbit ran the dogs ran at the finish the rabbit popped into its electric hatch the dogs collided on each other barking the lights went out in the dark i turned to stare at the director as i knew he must be turning to stare at me i was thankful for the dark the rain so johnny murphy could not see our faces come on now he shouted place your bets we were back in galway speeding at ten oclock the rain was still raining the wind was still blowing the ocean was smashing the shore with titanic fists the highway was a river working to erase the stone beneath as we drew up in a great tidal spray before the pub well now said johnny murphy not looking at us but at the windshield wiper beating palpitating there well the directors and i had bet on five races and had lost between us two or three pounds it worried johnny i won a great deal he said and some of it i keep telling you over and over i put down in your names both of you that last race i swear to god i bet and won for all of us let me pay you no johnny thanks i said but you lost what in the states nine dollars its all right johnny i said my numb lips moving he took my hand and pressed two shillings into it i didnt fight him thats better he said now one last drink on me we had the drink and walked back to my hotel my director saw me to the door before going on his way to his house alone wringing out his cap in the hotel lobby he looked at me and said it was a wild irish night wasnt it a wild night i said he left i hated to go up to my room so i sat for another hour in the reading lounge of the damp hotel and took the travellers privilege a glass and a bottle provided by the dazed hallporter i sat alone listening to the rain and the rain on the cold hotel roof thinking of ahabs coffin bed waiting for me up there under the drumbeat weather i thought of the only warm thing in the hotel in the town in all the land of eire this night the script in my typewriter this moment with its sun of mexico its hot winds blowing from the pacific its mellow papayas its yellow lemons its fiery sands and its women with dark charcoalburning eyes and i thought of the darkness beyond the town the light flashing on the electric rabbit running the dogs running and the rabbit gone and the light going out and the rain falling down on the dank shoulders and the soaked caps and trickiing off the noses and seeping through the tweeds going upstairs i glanced out of a steaming window there on the road riding by under a street light was a man on a bicycle he was terribly drunk for the bike weaved back and forth across the road as the man vomited he did not stop the bike to do this he kept pumping unsteadily blearily as he threw up i watched him go off down the road into raining dark then i went on up to die in my room
