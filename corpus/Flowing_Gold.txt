 flowing gold by rex beach to the one whose faith enthusiasm and devotion constitute a neverfailing source of inspiration my wife sweetheart and partner flowing gold chapter i room service at the ajax is of a quality befitting the newest the largest and the most expensive hotel in dallas while the standard of excellence is uniformly high nevertheless some extra care usually attaches to a breakfast ordered from the governors suite most elegant and most expensive of all the suites hence the waiter checked over his card and made a final fluttering examination to be sure that the chilled fruit was chilled and that the hot plates were hot before he rapped on the door a voice loud and cheery bade him enter would the gentleman wish his breakfast served in the parlor or no the gentleman would have it right in his bedroom but first where were his cigarettes he hoped above all things that the waiter had not forgotten his cigarettes some people began their days with cold showers nothing less than a cruel shock to a languid nervous system an atrocious practice the speaker called it a relic of barbarism a fetish of ignorance much preferable was a hygienic stimulating cigarette which served the same purpose and left no deleterious aftereffects the pajamaclad guest struck a light inhaled with abundant satisfaction and then cast a hungry eye over the contents of the rubbertired breakfast table he too tested the temperature of the melon and felt the cover of the toast plate splendid he cried nice rooms prompt service a pleasantfaced waiter why i couldnt fare better in my best club thanks to you my first impression of dallas is wholly delightful he seated himself in a padded boudoir chair unfolded a snowy serviette and attacked his breakfast with the enthusiasm of a perfectly healthy animal is this your first visit here sir absolutely dallas is as foreign to me as lhasa it is the baghdad of my dreams and its streets are strange perhaps they are full of adventure for me i hope so anything exciting can happen in a town where one has neither friends nor acquaintances eh you are a wellread man i take it i why at any rate you have heard it said that this is a small world yes sir good i merely wish to deny authorship of the saying for it is false this is a large world what is more it is a world full of cities like dallas where men like you and me heaven be praised have neither friends acquaintances nor relatives in that respect it is a fine world and we should devoutly give thanks for its dallases and its dalsatians jove this ham is delicious the waiter was accustomed to morning talkers but this gentleman was different he had an air of consequence and his voice so deep so well modulated so pleasant invested him with unusual distinction probably he was an actor but no not in the governors suite more likely he was one of the big men of the standard or the gulf or the texas to make sure the waiter inquired may i ask if you are in oil sir in oil bless me what a nauseating question at this hour of the day most everybody here is in oil we turn dozens away every day were that full its the boom im in oil myself in a small way of course its like this sometimes gentlemen like well like you sir give me tips they drop a hint like about their stocks and ive done well in a small way of course it doesnt cost them anything and some of them are very kind youd really be surprised oh not at all the occupant of the governors suite leaned back in his chair and smiled widely as a matter of fact i am flattered for it is evident that you are endowed with the moneymaking instinct and that you unerringly recognize it in others very well i shall see what i can do for you but while we are on the subject of tips would you mind helping yourself to a dollar out of my trousers pocket the waiter proceeded to do as directed but a moment later announced apologetically heres all i find sir its mostly pennies he exposed a handful of small coins look in my coat if you will but the second search resulted as had the first strange murmured the guest without rising i must have been robbed i remember now a fellow crowded me as i left my train um m robbed at the very gates of baghdad dallas is a city of adventure please add your tip to the check and make it two dollars id like to have you serve me every morning for i cannot abide an acid face at breakfast it sours my whole day calvin gray finished his breakfast smoked a second cigarette as he scanned the morning paper then he dressed himself with meticulous care he possessed a tall erect athletic form his perfectly fitting clothes had that touch of individuality affected by a certain few of new yorks exclusive tailors and when he finally surveyed himself in the glass there was no denying the fact that he presented an appearance of unusual distinction as he turned away his eyes fell upon the scanty handful of small coins which the waiter had removed from his pocket and for a moment he stared at them reflectively then he scooped them into his palm and with a smile announced to his image it would seem that it is time for us to introduce ourselves to the management he was humming a tune as he strode out of his richly furnished quarters the governors suite at the ajax is on the mezzanine floor at the head of the grand staircase as gray descended the spacious marble steps he saw that the hotel was indeed doing a big business for already the lobby was thickly peopled and at the desk a group of new arrivals were plaintively arguing with a bored and supercilious room clerk some men possess an effortless knack of commanding attention and inspiring courtesy calvin gray was one of these before many moments he was in the managers office explaining suavely now that i have introduced myself i wish to thank you for taking care of me upon such short notice it was the only space we had if you wish ill have your rooms changed as soon as have you something better haviland the manager laughed and shook his head scarcely that suite is our pet and our pride theres nothing to beat it in the whole southwest it is very nice may i inquire the rate twentyfive dollars a day quite reasonable mr gray beamed his satisfaction it is the only suite we have left weve put beds in the parlors of the others and frequently we have to double up our guests this oil excitement is a blessing to us poor innkeepers i presume its oil that brings you here gray met the speakers interrogatory gaze with a negative shake of the head and a smile peculiarly noncommittal no he declared im not in the oil business and i have no money to invest in it i dont even represent a syndicate of eastern capitalists on the contrary i am a penniless adventurer whom chance alone has cast upon your hospitable grand staircase these words were spoken with a suggestion of mock modesty that had precisely the effect of a deliberate wink and mr haviland smiled and nodded his complete comprehension i get you said he and youre right the lease hounds would devil you to death if you gave them a chance now then if theres any way in which i can be of service there is grays tone was at once businesslike please give me the names of your leading bankers i mean the strongest and the most well discreet during the next few minutes gray received and swiftly tabulated in his mind a deal of inside information usually denied to the average stranger the impression his swift searching questions made upon the hotel manager was evident when the latter told him as he rose to go dont feel that you have to identify yourself at the banks today if we can accommodate you cash a check or the like thank you the caller shook his head and smiled his appreciation of the offer your manner of conducting a hotel impresses me deeply and i shall speak of it to some of my eastern friends live executives are hard to find it is impossible to analyze or to describe that quality of magnetic charm which we commonly term personality nevertheless it is the most potent influence in our social and our business lives it is a gift of the gods and most conspicuous successes in whatever line are due to it now and then comes an individual who is cold even repellent and yet who rises to full accomplishment by reason of pure intellectual force or strength of character but nine times out of ten the man who gets ahead be he merchant banker promoter or crook does so by reason of this abstract asset this intangible birthright gray possessed that happy quality it had made itself felt by the waiter who brought his breakfast and by the manager of the hotel its effect was equally noticeable upon the girl behind the cigar counter where he next went an intimate word or two and she was in a flutter she sidetracked her chewing gum completely ignored her other customers and helped him select a handful of her choicest sixtycent havanas when he finally decided to have her send the rest of the box of fifty up to his room and signed for them she considered the transaction a tribute to her beauty rather than to her ability as a saleswoman her admiring eyes followed him clear across the lobby even the blase bellcaptain by virtue of his calling a person of few enthusiasms and no illusions edged up to the desk and inquired the name of the distinguished stranger from the noth gray appeared to know exactly what he wanted to do for he stopped at the telephone booths inquired the number of the leading afternoon newspaper and put in a call for it when it came through he asked for the city editor he closed the soundproof door before voicing his message then he began rapidly city editor well im from the ajax hotel and i have a tip for you im one of the room clerks listen calvin gray is registered here got in last night on gum shoes gray calvin gray better shoot a reporter around and get a story you dont well other people know him hes a character globe trotter soldier of fortune financier hes been everywhere and done everything and you can get a great story if youve got a man clever enough to make him talk but he wont loosen easily oil i suppose but sure under cover mystery stuff another big syndicate probably oh thats all right im an old newspaper man myself dont mention it all american cities these days are much the same character atmosphere distinctiveness have been squeezed out in the general mold for all calvin gray could see as he made his first acquaintance with dallas he might have been treading the streets of los angeles of indianapolis of portland maine or of portland oregon a california brightness and a florida warmth to the air a new england alertness to the pedestrians a manhattan majesty to some of the newer office buildings these were the most outstanding of his first impressions into the largest and the newest of these buildings gray went a white tile and stone skyscraper the entire lower floor of which was devoted to an impressive banking room he sent his card in to the president and spent perhaps ten minutes with that gentleman he had called merely to get acquainted so he explained he wished to meet only the heads of the strongest financial institutions he had no favors to ask as yet and he might have no business whatever with them on the other hand well he was a slow and careful investigator but when he moved it was with promptitude and vigor and in such an event he wished them to know who he was meanwhile he desired no publicity and he hoped his presence in dallas would not become generally known it might seriously interfere with his plans before he left the bank gray had met the other officers and from their manner he saw that he had created a decided impression upon them the bank president himself walked with him to the marble railing then said id like to have you wait and meet my son lieutenant roswell hes just back from overseas and the boy served with some distinction a fathers pride you understand was lieutenant roswell in france gray inquired quickly oh yes hell be in at any minute a shadow of regret crossed the callers face im sorry but ive arranged to call on the mayor and ive no time to lose what unit was your son with the ninetyeighth field artillery the shadow fled mr gray was vexed at the necessity for haste but he would look forward to meeting the young hero later and meanwhile roswell senior said warmly if we can be of service to you please feel free to call upon us i dare say wed be safe in honoring a small check he laughed pleasantly and clapped his caller on the back a fine man gray decided as he paused outside the bank and here was another offer to cash a check the second this morning good address and an expensive tailor certainly did count with them as capital a man could take a profit at any time grays fingers strayed to the small change in his trousers pocket and he turned longing eyes back toward the bank interior without doubt it was a temptation especially inasmuch as at that moment his wellmanicured right hand held in its grasp every cent that he possessed this was not the first time he had been broke on the contrary during his younger days he had more than once found himself in that condition and had looked upon it as an exciting experience as a not unpleasant form of adventure to be strapped in a mining camp for instance was no more than a mild embarrassment but to find oneself thirtyeight years old friendless and without funds in a city the size of dallas well that was more than an adventure and it afforded a sort of excitement that he believed he could very well do without dallas was no openhanded frontier town it was a small new york where life is settled where men are suspicious and where fortunes are slow in the making he wondered now if hard fast living had robbed him of the punch to make a new beginning he wondered too if the vague plans at the back of his mind had anything to them or if they were entirely impracticable here was opportunity definite concrete and spelled with a capital o here was a deliberate invitation to avail himself of a short cut out of his embarrassment a mere scratch of a pen and he would have money enough to move on to some other dallas and there gain the start he needed enough at least so that he could tip his waiter and pay cash for his coronas business men are too gullible any how it would be a good lesson to roswell and haviland why not calvin gray started he recoiled slightly the abstracted stare was wiped from his face for an officer in uniform had brushed past him and entered the bank that damned khaki again those service stripes they were forever obtruding themselves it seemed was there no place where one could escape the hateful sight of them his chain of thought had been snapped and he realized that there could be no short cut for him he had climbed through the ropes taken his corner and the gong had rung it was now a fight to a finish with no quarter given he squared his shoulders and set out for the hotel where he felt sure he would find a reporter awaiting him chapter ii the representative of the dallas post had anticipated some difficulty in interviewing the elusive calvin gray whoever he might be but luck appeared to be with him for shortly after his arrival at the hotel the object of his quest appeared mr gray was annoyed at being discovered he was in fact loath to acknowledge his identity having just returned from an important conference with some of the leading financiers of the city his mind was burdened with affairs of weight and then too the mayor was expecting him luncheon probably hence he was in no mood to be interviewed usually mr grays secretary saw interviewers however now that his identity was known he had not the heart to be discourteous to a fellow journalist yes he had once owned a newspaper in alaska incidentally it was the farthestnorth publication in the world alaska the reporter pricked up his ears he managed to elicit the fact that mr gray had operated mines and built railroads there that he had been forced into the newspaper game merely to protect his interests from the depredations of a gang of political grafters and that it had been a sensational fight while it lasted this item was duly jotted down in the reportorial memory alaska was a hard country quite so but nothing like mexico during the revolution mexican sugar and mahogany it transpired had occupied mr grays attention for a time as had argentine cattle yucatan hennequin and an engineering enterprise in bolivia not to mention other investments closer to home once the speaker had become reconciled to the distasteful necessity of talking about himself he suggested an adjournment to his rooms where he would perhaps suffer less embarrassment by reason of his unavoidable use of the personal pronoun gray noted the effect upon his visitor of the governors suite and soon had the young man at ease with a corona between his teeth then followed a full threequarters of an hour during which the visitor discoursed in his very best style and his caller sat spellbound making occasional hieroglyphic hen tracks upon his note paper and congratulating himself upon his good luck in striking a man like this in one of his rare talkative moods gray had set himself deliberately to the task of selling himself to this gentleman of the press and having succeeded he was enough of a salesman to avoid the fatal error of overselling alone at last a sardonic grin crept over his features so far so good now for the rest of those bankers and the mayor gray was working rapidly but he knew no other way of working and speed was essential it seemed to him not unlikely that delay of the slightest might force him to turn in desperation to a length of lead pipe and a mask for a man must live as yet he had no very definite plans he had merely undertaken to establish himself in a position to profit by the first opportunity whatever it might be and opportunity of some sort would surely come it always did what is more it had an agreeable way of turning up just when he was most in need of it gray called at several other banks that morning he strode in swiftly introduced himself with quick incisiveness and tarried only long enough to fix himself indelibly in the minds of those he had come to see then he left there are right and wrong ways of closing a deal or of ending an interview and gray flattered himself that he possessed terminal facilities he was very busy always a bit pressed for time always a moment late his theory of constant forward motion never permitted an awkward pause in conversation on the street his long legs covered the ground at something less than a run his eyes were keenly alert his face set in purposeful lines pedestrians turned to look after him at the mayors office he was denied admission to the chief executive but insisted so peremptorily as to gain his end once inside he conveyed his compliments with such a graceful flourish that his intrusion assumed the importance of a ceremony and the peoples choice was flattered he inferred that this calvin gray made a practice of presenting his formal respects to the dignitaries of all the large cities he visited and deemed it a favor to them no doubt it was if he so considered it for he appeared to be fully aware of his own importance after all it was an agreeable practice since no man in public life can risk offending people of importance his honor unbent gray turned a current jest upon texas politics into a neat compliment to the citys executive they laughed formality vanished personal magnetism made itself felt the call ended by the two men lunching together at the city club as gray had assumed it would and he took pains that the bankers upon whom he had called earlier in the morning should see him in company with the mayor he returned to his hotel that afternoon pretty well satisfied with his efforts and hopeful that some of the seed he had sown broadcast would be ripe for the reaping erelong but he received an electric shock as he approached the desk for the bell captain addressed him saying mr haviland wishes to see you at once in his office indeed anything important very important sir ive been waiting for you to come in there was something ominous about this unexpected summons or perhaps about the manner of its delivery at any rate suspicion leaped into grays mind so haviland was wise quick work that evidently he had investigated through those mysterious sources of information available to great hotels or perhaps some one had seen and recognized him well that was the way his luck had run lately every break against him now grays shoulders lifted in a shrug of resignation there was nothing to do except wave aside the blindfold and face the firing squad like an officer and a gentleman but it was a pity that the crash had come so soon fortune might have given him at least a short interval of grace haviland was probably in a cold rage at the discovery of the fraud and gray could only hope that he wouldnt get noisy over it for scenes were always annoying and sometimes they ran to unfortunate lengths there was a curious brightness to the imposters eyes a reckless mocking smile upon his lips when he stepped into the managers office and stood beside the desk he declined havilands invitation to be seated it seemed more fitting that a man should take sentence on his feet have you seen the post the manager inquired no haviland handed him a copy of the leading afternoon paper and grays eyes flashed to the headline of an article reading calvin gray hero of sensational exploits in dallas adventures read like page of romance famous financier admits large oil interests behind him from the opening paragraph gray judged that he had impressed the reporter even more deeply than he had supposed but he took no satisfaction there from for haviland was saying ive read the whole story but i want you to tell me something more about yourself what do you wish to know were you in france over the visitors face there came a subtle change whereas upon entering he had worn an expression of careless defiance now he appeared to harden in every fiber and to go on guard i have been many times in france i mean during the war did you serve there was a pause i did grays eyes remained fixed upon his interrogator but they had begun to smolder then youre colonel gray colonel calvin gray quite so the speakers voice was harsh and it came with an effort but you didnt read that in the post come whats the idea out with it the interview had taken an unexpectedly disagreeable turn gray had anticipated an unpleasant moment or two but this well it was indeed the crash calamity had overtaken him from the very quarter he had least expected and most dreaded and his mind raced off at a tangent a dozen unwelcome queries presented themselves strange what circles we move in haviland was saying do you know who owns the controlling interest in this hotel surely you must know or can guess think a moment its somebody you met over there and have reason to remember a sound escaped from the throat of colonel gray not a cry but rather a gasp of amazement or of rage aha haviland grinned in triumph i thought his guest leaned forward over the desk with face twitching passion had driven the blood from it and his whole expression was one of such hatred such fury the metamorphosis was so startling that the hotel man stiffened in his chair and stared upward in sudden amazement nelson gray ejaculated nelson by god so hes here during the moment that haviland sat petrified gray turned his head slowly his blazing eyes searched the office as if expecting to discover a presence concealed somewhere they returned to the hotel mans face and he inquired well where is he haviland stirred i dont know what youre talking about whos nelson after a second he exclaimed good lord i thought i had a pleasant surprise for you and i was gracefully leading up to it but i must have jazzed it all up i was going to tell you that the hotel and everything in it is yours eh why the ajax is one of the dietz chain herman dietz of cincinnati owns it he left for the north not an hour ago at the last minute he heard you were here read this story in the paper and had bellboys scouring the place for you you must know why he wanted to see you and what he said when he found that hed have to leave before you came in colonel gray uttered another exclamation this time an expletive of deep relief he fought with himself a moment then murmured an apology sorry you gave me a startdecidedly herman dietz eh well well you made me think for a moment that i was a guest in the house of some other friend friend exactly gray was himself again now he ran a loosening finger between his collar and throat quite a start ill admit but some of my friends are great practical jokers they have a way of jumping out at me and crying boo when i least expect it umm i see mr dietz told me that he was under lifelong obligation to a certain colonel calvin gray something to do with passports i once rendered him a slight favor he doesnt regard the favor as slight he was about to be imprisoned for the duration of the war and you managed to get him back home merely a matter of official routine i felt sure he was a loyal american citizen exactly but he makes more of the incident than you do and he gave me my instructions so what can i do for you on his behalf you have only to ask gray pondered the unexpected offer he was still a bit shaken for a moment ago he had been more deeply stirred even than haviland suspected and the emotional reaction had left him weak after all the hollow pretense of this day a genuine proffer of aid was welcome and the temptation to accept was strong herman dietz was indeed indebted to him and he believed the old germanamerican would do anything lend him any amount of money for instance that he might ask for gray wondered why he had not thought of dietz before he came to texas it would have made things much easier but the offer had come too late it seemed to him at this moment he could see no means of profiting by it without wrecking the flimsy house of cards he had that very day erected and exposing himself to ridicule to obloquy as a rank fourflusher the scarcely dry headlines of that afternoon paper ran before his eyes famous financier admits large oil interests behind him probably there were other things in the body of the article that would not harmonize with an appeal to haviland for funds nor sound well to mr dietz once he learned the truth the more gray pondered the matter the more regretfully he realized that he had overplayed his hand as it were here was a situation indeed to be occupying the most expensive suite in the hotel of a man who wished to lend him money to be unable to pay one days rent therefore and yet to be stopped from accepting aid there was a grim irony about it for a fact then too the seed he had sown in banking circles and his luncheon with the mayor haviland had a sense of humor it would make a story too good to keep the new oil operator the magnificent and mysterious new york financier a deadhead at the ajax oh murder well name your poison isnt there something anything we can do for you haviland repeated there is decidedly gray smiled his warm appreciation of the tender if it is not too great a drain upon the dietz millions you may keep a supply of cut flowers in my room im passionately fond of roses and i should like to have my vases filled every morning you shall dwell in a perfumed bridal bower gray paused at the door to light one of those sixtycent cigars and between puffs observed please assure mr dietz that his obligation is squared and that i am deeply touched i shall revel in the scent of those flowers that evening when calvin gray formally and faultlessly attired strolled into the ajax dining room he was conscious of attracting no little attention for one thing few of the other guests were in evening dress and also that article in the post which he had read with a curiously detached amusement had been of a nature to excite general notice the interview had jarred upon him in only one respect viz in describing him as a typical soldier of fortune no doubt the reporter had intended that phrase in the kindest spirit nevertheless it implied a certain recklessness and instability of character that did not completely harmonize with grays inchoate undeveloped banking projects bankers are wary of anything that sounds adventurous or they pretend to be as a matter of fact gray had learned enough that very day about texas bankers to convince him that most of them were good game gamblers and that a large part of the dividends paid by most of the local institutions of finance were derived from oil profits however the newspaper story as a whole was such as to give him the publicity he desired and he was well content with it its first results were prompt in coming even while the head waiter was seating him another diner arose and approached him with a smile gray recognized the fellow instantly one of that vast army of casuals that march through every active mans life and disappear down the avenues of forgetfulness after customary greetings had been exchanged the newcomer coverly by name explained that he had read the post article not five minutes before and was delighted to learn how well the world had used gray he was dining alone with alacrity he accepted an invitation to join his old friend and straightway he launched himself upon the current of reminiscence in answer to grays inquiry he confessed modestly enough oh im not in your class old man im no modern gil blas as the paper calls you no wall street money barons are eating out of my hand and i have no international interests reaching from the yukon to the plate but i stand all right in little old dallas im the v p of our biggest jewelry house and business is great after their order had been given he recited in greater detail the nature of his success gray was interested texas is booming he said at the conclusion of the story im told the new oil towns are something like our old mining camps except that they are more so the same excitement the same quick fortunes only quicker and larger believe me its fine for the jewelry business look here coverly drew from his pocket a letter written in a painfully cramped hand upon cheap note paper and this he spread out for his companion to read theres an example in point the letter which bore the ranger postmark ran as follows dere sir your store has bin rekomend to me for dimons and i want some for my wife and dauter send me prises on rings of large sises yours truley gus briskow umm who is mr briskow coverly shrugged probably some nester who never saw a hundred dollars all in one place until recently when they strike oil they buy diamonds nice large yellow ones as a rule then as the money continues to flow in they pay off the mortgage and buy a bank or an interest in one in heavens name introduce me to the opulent gus briskow i wish i might but i dont expect to make his acquaintance the head of our firm is away and i havent a man id dare trust to send out into the field usually i handle these inquiries myself when the victim cant tear himself away from contemplating the miraculous flow of liquid gold long enough to come here i take an assortment of gems with me and beard the nouveau riche right on his derrick floor why ive carried as much as a hundred thousand dollars worth of merchandise on some of my trips coverly sighed regretfully tough luck too bad youre not a good jewelry salesman i am gray declared i can sell anything as for diamonds ive bought enough in my time to know their value coverly laughed in ready agreement with this statement gad im sore at missing this sale you neednt miss it ill go dont kid an unfortunate im not joking if its worth while pack up your saffron solitaires all that you dare trust me with and ill be your gentlemanly representative worth while good lord id probably get a tenthousanddollar order very well its settled grays decision had been quickly made opportunity had knocked he was not one to deny her admission no matter how queer her garb a hundred thousand dollars worth of gems the very figures intrigued him and diamonds are readily negotiable there would be a natural risk attached to the handling of so large an amount a thousand things might happen to a treasure chest of that size gray began to believe that his luck had changed where does mr briskow live he inquired out beyond ranger somewhere but im going to visit that field anyhow this will give me an excuse nonsense the jeweler did not like to have fun poked at him for some time he refused to take the offer seriously and even when his host insisted that he would enjoy the lark he expostulated why the idea is ridiculous you calvin gray the financier peddling jewelry ha outside of the fact that you wouldnt couldnt do it its not the safest thing in the world to carry a small fortune in stones through the oil fields of course you insure it against theft thats the point we cant have you ever heard of highjackers thats the texas term for holdup men robbers well the country is full of them excellent there no longer is any question about my going gray announced firmly i am bored i am stale a thrill of whatever sort would stir my blood animated by purely selfish motives i now insist upon a serious consideration of my offer first you say i wouldnt couldnt i assure you that i would could and shall provided i can qualify as a salesman coverly admitted without much argument that anybody could probably effect a sale in this instance if the diamonds were plainly marked with their prices it would be a mere question of displaying the goods that was not the point gray was a rich a busy man the idea was fantastic why youre offering to do this as an accommodation to an old friend and your time is probably worth more than our whole profit on the sale would amount to my time is worth nothing if you hesitate to intrust this kings ransom to me ill go personally responsible for its value thats fair isnt it dont be silly how could i pay you if you did go umm this idea it seemed had not occurred to mr gray it was plain that money meant nothing to him you see we couldnt permit i have it well divorce friendship and sentiment entirely from the discussion and reduce it to a strictly business basis you shall ease your conscience by paying my traveling expenses the emotional suspense that i undergo shall be my reward ill take my commission in thrills this offer evoked a light laugh from grays guest youd get enough of em he asserted ill advance a mild one on account at this moment notice the couple dining at the third table to your left gray lifted his eyes what do you see a rather welldressed hardfaced man and a decidedly attractive woman brunette theres a suggestion of repressed widowhood about her its the gown probably i am not yet in my dotage and i had seen her before i saw you shes living here i dont know much about her but the man goes by the name of mallow no thrill yet hes been hanging about our store for the past month making a few purchases and getting acquainted with some of the clerks wherever i go lately there he is ill wager if i took tonights train for ranger hed be on it and still my pulses do not leap wait i got a sort of report on him and its bad i believe and so does the chief of police that mr mallow has something to do with the gang of crooks that infests this country one thing is certain theyre not the native product and our holdups arent staged by ropechokers out of work calvin gray turned now and openly stared at the object of coverlys suspicions there was an alert interest in his eyes youve cinched the matter with me he declared after a moment get out your diamonds tomorrow im going to take the night train to ranger later that evening after his guest had gone gray took occasion deliberately to put himself in mallows way and to get into conversation with him this was not a difficult maneuver for it was nearly midnight and the lobby was wellnigh deserted moreover it almost appeared as if the restless mr mallow was seeking an acquaintance for the better part of an hour the two men smoked and talked and had coverly overheard their conversation his blood would have chilled and he would have prematurely aged for his distinguished host calvin gray the worldlywise suave man of affairs actually permitted himself to be pumped like a farmers son it would have been a ghastly surprise to the jeweler to learn how careless and how confiding his friend could be in an off moment he would have swooned when gray told about his coming trip to ranger and actually produced the misspelled briskow letter for the edification of his chance acquaintance any lingering doubt as to his friends honesty of purpose would have vanished utterly had he heard mallow announce that he too was going to ranger the very next night a curious coincidence truly and grays expression of pleasure at the prospect of such a congenial traveling companion the agitated coverly no doubt would have phoned a frantic call for the police then and there once gray was in his rooms however his manner changed and into his eyes there came a triumphant glitter hastily he rummaged through one of his bags and from a collection of trinkets souvenirs and the like he selected an object which he examined carefully then took into the bathroom for further experiment his step was springy his lips were puckered he was whistling blithely when he emerged for at last those vaguely outlined plans that had been at the back of his mind had assumed form and pattern his luck had turned he had made a new start mallow was indeed a crook and gray blessed the prompt good fortune that had thrown both him and coverly in his way it had been a busy day he was well content with its fruitage chapter iii old tom parker was a type he was one of a small class of men at one time common to the west but now rapidly disappearing a turbulent lifetime spent in administering the law in a lawless region had stamped him with the characteristics of a frontier officer viz vigilance caution selfrestraint sangfroid for more than thirty years he had worn a badge of some sort and in the serving of warrants and other processes of law he had covered first in the saddle or on buckboard later in pullman car or automobile most of that vast region lying between the arkansas and the pecos the cimarron and the sabine virtually all of what is now texas and oklahoma he still spoke of the latter state by the way as the territory and there were few corners of it that he had not explored long before it ceased to be a haven of hunted men that is what tom parker had been a hunter of men and time was when his name had been famous but he had played his part the times had caught up with and passed him and no longer in the administration of justice was there need of abilities like his hence the shield of his calling had been taken away now tom did not reckon himself obsolete he was badgergray to be sure and stiff in one knee a rheumatic legacy of office inherited by reason of wet nights in the open and a toodiligent devotion to duty but in no other respect did he believe his age to be apparent his smokeblue eyes were as bright as ever his hand was quick realization that he had been shunted upon a side track filled him with surprise and bewilderment it was characteristic of the man that he still considered himself a bulwark of law and order a de facto guardian of the peace and that from force of habit he still sat facing the door and never passed between a lighted lamp and a window among the late comers to wichita falls where he lived tom was known as a quietspoken emotionless old fellow with an honorable past but with a gift for tiresome reminiscence quite out of place in the new and impatient order of things and none but oldtimers and his particular cronies were aware of the fact that he had another side to his character it was not generally known for instance that he was a kind and indulgent father and had a daughter whom he worshiped with blind adulation this ignorance was not strange for miss barbara parker had been away at college for four years now and during that time she had not once returned home there was a perfectly good reason for this protracted separation of father and daughter since old tom was no longer on pay it took all he could rake and scrape to meet her bills and railroad fares are high that hudson river institution was indeed a finishing school not only had it polished off barbara but also it had about administered the coup de grace to her father there had been a ranch over near electra with some shallow production from which tom had derived a small royalty this was when barbara parker went east and before the burkburnett wells hit deep sand but income from that source had been used up faster than it had come in and bob as tom insisted upon calling her would have had to come home had it not been for an interesting discovery on her fathers part viz the discovery of a quaint device of the law entitled a mortgage mortgages had to do with a department of the law unfamiliar to tom his wit his intelligence and his dexterity of hand having been exercised solely in upholding the dignity of the criminal branch but once he had realized that a mortgage so called was no more than a meaningless banking term used to cloak the impulsive generosity of moneyed men he availed himself of this discovery and was duly grateful tom carried on a nominal fireinsurance business but as a matter of fact the tiny tworoomed frame structure that bore his painted sign was nothing more or less than a loafing place for him and his rheumatic friends and a place in which the owner could spend the heat of the day in a position of comfort to his stiff leg that is to say asleep in a highbacked office chair his feet propped upon his desk it was here that tom could usually be found and when one of those hateful statements arrived from the east he merely roused himself put on his wide gray hat limped around to the bank and pledged more of his oil royalties or signed another mortgage what insurance policies he wrote were brought to him by his old pals the money derived there from he sent on to bob with love and an admonition to be a good girl and study hard and hurry home because he was dying to see her this office by the way no longer suited tom it was becoming too noisy and he would have sold it and sought another farther out had it not been mortgaged for more than it was worth so too was the house where he lived amid the dirt and disorder of all bachelor establishments now old tom would have resented an accusation of indolence the bare implication of such a charge would have aroused his instant indignation and tom parker indignant was a man to shun as a matter of fact he believed himself sadly overworked and was forever complaining about it the time came however when he was forced to shed his habit of slothfulness as completely as a snake sheds its skin and that was during the week before bobs arrival then indeed he swept and he dusted he mopped and he polished he rubbed and he scrubbed trying his best to put the house in order never in all his life had he labored as he did then for four years of batching will make a bears nest out of the most orderly house but he was jealous of his task and he refused to share it with other hands pots and pans rusty from disuse or bearing the accumulated evidence of many hastily prepared meals he took out in the back yard and scrubbed with sand leaving his bony knuckles skinned and bleeding from the process he put down a new carpet in bobs room no easy task for a man with an ossified knee joint incidentally the damn thing kept him awake for two nights thereafter he nailed up fresh curtains or they looked fresh to him at her windows and smashed a perfectly good thumbnail in doing so this and many other abominable duties he performed but love means suffering and every pang gave old tom a thrill of fierce delight for bob was coming the lonely hungry aching wait was over constant familiarity with the house had mercifully dulled the occupants appreciation of its natural deterioration and the effects of his neglect so when he finally straightened his aching back and regarded the results of his heroic efforts it seemed to him that everything shone like new and that the place was as neat and as clean as on the day bob went away probably hercules thought the augean stables were spotless and fragrant when he had finished with them and perhaps they were but tom parker was no demigod he was just a clumsy old man unaccustomed to indoor doings and his eyes at times during the last few days had been unaccountably dim as for instance while he was at work in barbaras chamber he did not sleep much on the night before the girls arrival he sat until late with the framed photograph of barbaras mother on his knee and tried to tell the dead and gone original that he had done his best for the girl so far and if he had failed it was because he knew nothing about raising girls and nature hadnt cut him out to be a father anyhow he had been considerably older than barbaras mother when he married her and he had never ceased to wonder what there had been in him to win the love of a woman like her or to regret that fate had not taken him instead of her heaven knows his calling had been risky enough but that was how things went sometimes the wheat was taken and the chaff remained and in the morning tom was up before daylight and had his dishes washed and his things in order long ere the town was awake then he went down to the office and waited with the jumps repeatedly he consulted his heavy gold watch engraved with the admiration and gratitude of the citizens of burlingame november fifth it was still two hours of train time when he locked up and limped off toward the station but it was well to be there early of course he met judge halloran on the street he always did and of course the judge asked when bob was coming home the judge always did that too old tom had lied diligently to the judge every day for a month now for he had no intention of sharing this day of days with a tiresome old pest and now he again made an evasive answer mendacity is at once the lowest and the commonest form of deceit the judge indignantly announced you know perfectly well when shes coming damn you honest i dont not exactly but the judge was unconvinced youve been as mysterious as a bootlegger for the last week but i could always read you like a book tom parker you know all right mrs halloran wants to come over and fix things up for her she said so this oh i got everything fixed tom hastily declared ha what did i tell you the judge glared tom could have bitten his tongue for that slip your pitiful attempts to mislead barbaras admirers expose you to ridicule and offend those of us who tolerate you out of regard for her the judge had a nice texas drawl and he pronounced it reegyad youre on your way to the train at this moment and i propose to accompany you what would i be going to the train for now tom inquired in a deceitfully mild tone inwardly he was raging and he cursed the judge for a meddlesome old fool hmm thought youd sneak down there unobserved probably there was a pause then the speaker went on in an altered tone dyou suppose she has forgotten all her native accomplishments tom i wonder if she can still ride and rope and shoot or if those thinblooded eastern schoolmaams have taught her that such things are unladylike and coarse pshaw you never forget how to do those things she could handle a horse or a rope or a gun as well as you at your best better tom declared with swelling pride halloran wagged his white head in agreement an unusual procedure inasmuch as he never agreed with tom on any subject which offered possible ground for disagreement a wonderful girl and ill wager they havent spoiled her even you couldnt spoil bob he raised his red belligerent eyes and fixed them upon his old friend but there was now a kindly light in them you made a real son of her didnt you tom almost i was mighty disappointed because she was a girl but i dont know as a boy could of turned out much better well judge i got to be moving you are neither grammatical nor precise snapped judge halloran you mean we must be moving he linked arms with tom and fell into step with him he clung to that rigid arm moreover despite toms surly displeasure not until a friend stopped them for a word or two was the distracted parent enabled to escape from that spidery embrace then indeed he slipped it as a filibustering schooner slips its moorings and made off as rapidly and as unobtrusively as possible judge halloran stared after the retreating figure then he showed his decayed teeth in a smile bob is coming home today and the old mountain lion is on edge he explained i must warn the boys to stay away from the station and give him his hour poor tom he has held his breath for four years tom parker had heard of children spoiled by schooling of daughters educated away from their commonplace parents and rendered disdainful of them but never for one instant did he fear that his girl was that sort he just knew better he could no more have doubted bobs love for him than his for her orgods love for both of them such love is perfect absolute he took no thought therefore of the changes time and poverty had wrought in his appearance bob wouldnt notice he bet she wouldnt care if he was plumb ragged they were one and indivisible she was his just like his right arm she was his boy and his girl his sondaughter the old gunman choked and his tonsils ached abominably he hoped he wasnt in for another attack of quinsy sore throat but why lie to himself the truth was he wanted to cry and he wanted to laugh at the same time and the impulses were crossed in his windpipe he shook his watch like a childs rattle to be sure it was still running barbara did not disappoint her father on the contrary she was perhaps more deeply moved than he at their meeting at sight of him she uttered a strangled little cry then she ran into his arms and clung there tightly her cheek pressed against his breast it was only upon occasions like this that bob kissed her father for she had been reared as a boy and taught to shun emotional display boys kiss their mothers she snuggled close and tom could feel her whole body shaking but she kept her head averted to conceal a distressingly unmasculine weakness it was a useless precaution however for tom was blind his eyes were as wet as hers and tears were trickling down the seams in his wrinkled face oh daddy it has been a long time those were the first words either of them had spoken tom opened his lips then he closed them he patted barbara clumsily and finally cleared his aching throat with a loud harrumph he dashed the tears from his eyes with the heel of one harsh palm then leveled a defiant glare over her head directed at anyone who might be looking on at his weakness it was a blurry glare however andnot nearly so ferocious as he intended it to be after several efforts he managed to regain control of his vocal powers well son he cried huskily then harrumph barbaras clutch tightened appreciatively such a long long time still with her cheek pressed close against him she ran a small gloved hand into the pocket of his coat and brought forth a bandana handkerchief which she thrust into his palm saying its a good thing im home for youve caught another cold havent you now blow your nose barbara was anything but boyish to look at quite the opposite in fact she was delightfully feminine from the crown of her smart little traveling hat to her dainty french heels and although her suit was not expensive it was worn with an air and was perhaps as fetching as any that had ever come to wichita falls it gave the impression of perfectly setting off a figure and a personality that required no setting off she had the parker eyes of quenchless blue well son theres a boom on and the town has grown some but i guess things here are about the same as when you left em tom spoke with pride and satisfaction as he paid the driver took barbaras suitcase and opened the gate for her the girl turned from her first long appraising gaze at the modest home no change indeed the paint on the house was peeling gutters had rusted out some of the porch flooring had rotted through the yard was an unkempt tangle of matted grass and weeds and neglected shrubbery the sight of it was like a stab to her for she remembered the place as it had been and the shock was akin to that of seeing a loved one in the garb of a tramp but she smiled up at the gray face above her tom too was as seedy as the premises and she nodded it hasnt changed a mite she said bravely a moment later she paused upon the threshold tense thrilled apparently speechless tom was reminded of a trim little wren poised upon the edge of its nest this time it was more difficult to counterfeit an exclamation of joy but the catch in bobs voice the moisture in her eyes was attributed by her father to gladness at the sight of old familiar things this was pay for the thought and the love and the labor expended truly why everything is right where it belongs how wonderfully youve kept house you must have a perfect jewel of a girl dad i let aunt lizzie go bout three years back tom explained she got shiftless and i been sort of batching it since clean though aint it barbara turned blindly she walked to the center table and buried her face in a bouquet of wild flowers garnered from the yard she held it there for a moment before she spoke you didnt even forget that i love bluebonnets did you dad pshaw i aint had much to do but remember what you like son whats the matter business bad bobs face was still hidden oh no im busy as usual but now youre home ill probably feel like doing more i got a lot of work left in me yet now i got somebody to work for so you fixed everything with your own hands sure i knew how you like the place to look and well a man gets used to doing without help the kitchens clean too side by side the two moved from room to room and once the girl had regained control of herself she maintained an admirable selfrestraint she petted and she cooed over objects dear to her she loved every inch of everything she laughed and she exclaimed and with her laughter sunshine suddenly broke into the musty threadbare interior for the first time in four years bobs room was saved for the last and old tom stood back glowing at her delight he could not refrain from showing her his blackened thumbnail the price of his carpentry for he hoped shed kiss it and she did not until she had shooed him out and sent him downstairs smiling and chuckling at her radiant happiness did she give way to those emotions she had been fighting this long time then her face grew white and tragic oh daddy daddy she whispered what have i done to you tom parker had raised his girl like a son and like a son she took hold of things but with a daughters tact her intuition told her much but she did not arrive at a full appreciation of the family affairs until she had the house running and went down to put his office in order then indeed she learned at what cost had come those four expensive years in the east and the truth left her limp she went through toms dusty disordered papers ostensibly rearranging and filing them and they told her much what they did not tell her she learned from judge halloran and other old cronies who came in to pay their garrulous compliments tom was mortgaged to the hilt his royalties were pledged a crow could not pick a living out of his insurance business such a condition was enough to dismay any girl who had never seriously considered money matters and who had returned home to take up a life of comparative ease and superlative enjoyment where she had left it off but bob said nothing to her father she knew every one of his shortcomings and they endeared him to her quite as a sons faults and failures deepen a mothers love but she knew too that he was cantankerous and required careful handling toms toes were tender and he forever exposed them where they were easily trodden upon therefore the girl stepped cautiously and never even referred to his sacrifices which would have cruelly embarrassed both of them but something had to be done and quickly a new hand needed to mend the family fortunes barbara determined to lend that hand a great change had come over the town and the whole country round about a change which the girl believed afforded her an opportunity to prove that she was not a mere daughter not an ornament and a drag but a real sondaughter such as tom considered her wichita falls was overcrowded with oil man drawn thither by the townsite strike at burkburnett a few miles northwest and excitement was mounting as new wells continued to come in central north texas was nearing an epochmaking petroleum boom for ranger away to the south had set the oil world by the ears and now this new sand at burk lent color to the wild assertion that these north counties were completely underlaid with the precious fluid at any rate the price of thirsty ranch lands was somersaulting and prosperity was apparent in the homes of all barbaras girl friends her admirers of the opposite sex could talk of little except leases and bonuses and production they were almost too busy making money to call upon her barbara knew something about oil for she had watched the drilling of every one of those shallow wells that had kept her in college and what is more she knew most of the property owners in this part of the state in that advantage she believed lay her chance of accomplishment after a fortnight of careful consideration she decided to enter the oil business and deal in leases good idea tom declared when she had made known her plan the towns so full of scamps it looks like rodeo day and most of em are doing well if they can make good it seems like an honest firm could do better well be partners dad you run the insurance and ill be the lease hound say toms eyes brightened ill put a desk right alongside of mine a little feller just your size and a nice lounge in the back room where you can lay down when youre tired you been away so long it seems like i cant have you close enough another thought presented itself and he manifested sudden excitement i tell you ill get a new sign painted too tom and bob parker real estate and insurance oil propties and leases gosh its a great idea son his smile lingered but a moment later there came into his eyes a halfregretful light barbara read his thought almost before he was aware of it and rising she laid her hand upon his shoulder wistfully she said im awfully sorry too dad eh that i disappointed you so by not being a boy but it wasnt my fault and maybe ill show you that a daughter can help as much as a son chapter iv a year before this story opens the town of ranger texas consisted of a weatherbeaten rundown railroad station a blacksmith shop and a hitching rail town enough incidentally for the limited number of people and the scanty amount of merchandise that passed through it ranger lay in the dry belt considered an almost entirely useless part of the state where killing droughts were not uncommon and where for months on end the low flinty hills radiate heat like the rolls of a steel mill in such times even the steep tortuous canyons dried out and there was neither shade nor moisture in them the few farms and ranches round about were scattered widely and life thereon was a grim struggle against heartbreak by reason of the gaunt gray everpresent specter of the drought of late this particular region had proven itself to be one of violent extremes of extreme dryness during which flowers failed to bloom the grass shriveled and died and even the trees refused to put forth leaves or more rarely of extreme wetness when the country was drowned beneath torrential rains sometimes during unusual winters the heavens opened and spilled themselves choking the narrow watercourses washing out roads and destroying fields changing the arid arroyos into raging river beds at such times life for the country people was scarcely less burdensome than during the droughts for the heavy bottom lands became quagmires and the clay of the higher levels turned into putty or a devilish agglutinous substance that rendered travel for man or beast or vehicle almost impossible there appeared to be no law of average here in dry times it was a desert lacking wholly however in the beauty the mystery and the spell of a desert in wet times it was a gehenna of mud and slush and stickiness and entirely minus that beauty and freshness that attends the rainy seasons in a tropic clime it was a land peopled by a hardbitten race of nesters come from god knows where and for god knows why starved in mind and body slaves of a hideous environment from which they lacked means of escape geologists had claimed for some time that there must be coal in these north texas counties a contention perhaps based upon a comfortable belief in the law of compensation upon a theory that a region so poor aboveground must of necessity contain values of some sort beneath the surface but as for other natural resources they scouted the belief in such other parts of the state yielded oil for instance but here the formation was all wrong who ever heard of oil in hard lime nevertheless petroleum was discovered and among the fraternity that dealt in it ranger became a word of contradiction and of deep meaning aladdin rubbed his lamp and lo a magic transformation occurred one of those thrilling dramas of a dramatic industry was played a gypsy camp sprang up beside the blacksmith shop and as the weeks fled by it changed into a village of wooden houses then into a town and soon into a city of brick and iron and concrete the railroad became clogged with freight a tidal wave of men broke over the town wagons giant motor trucks caterpillar tractors towing long strings of trailers lurched and groaned and creaked over the hills following roads unfit for a horse and buggy straddling derricks reared themselves everywhere their feet were set in garden patches in plowed fields in lonely mesquite pastures and even high up on the crests of stony ridges one day their timbers were raw and clean the next day they were black and greasy advertising the fact that once again the heavy rock pressure far below had sent another fountain of fortune spraying over the top then pipe lines were laid and unsightly tank farms were built ranger became a mobilization point a vast concentration camp for supplies and amid its feverish activity there was no rest no sundays or holidays the work went on at top tension night and day amid a clangor of metal a ceaseless roar of motors a bedlam of hammers and saws and riveters men lived in greasy clothes breathing dust and the odors of burnt gas mainly eating poor food and drinking warm fetid water when they were lucky enough to get any at all this was about the state of affairs that calvin gray found on the morning of his arrival he and mallow had managed to secure a pullman section on the night train from dallas the fact that they were forced to carry their own luggage from the station uptown to the restaurant where they hoped to get breakfast was characteristic of the place en route thither they had to elbow their way through a crowd that filled the sidewalks as if on a fair day mallow was well acquainted with the town it appeared and during breakfast he maintained a running fire of comment some of which was worth listening to ever hear how the first discovery was made well the t p company had the whole country plastered with coal leases and finally decided to put down a fifteenhundredfoot wildcat the guy that ran the rig had a hunch there was oil here if he went deep enough but he knew the company wouldnt stick so he faked the log of the well as long as he could then he kept on drilling against orders refused to open his mail for fear hed find he was fired and the job called off he was a thousand feet deeper than hed been ordered to go when blooie over the top she went with fourteen hundred barrels desdemonas the name of a camp below here but they call it hog town more elegant down there the derricks actually straddle one another and they have to board them over to keep from drowning one another out when they blow in fellow in dallas brought in the first well and it was so big that his stock went from a hundred dollars a share to twelve thousand all in a few weeks of course he started a bank funniest people i ever saw that way usually when a rube makes a winning he gambles or gets him a woman but these hicks take their coin and buy banks rangers a real town everything wide open and the law in on the play that makes good times show me a camp where the gamblers play solitaire and the women take in washing and ill show you a dead village the joints here have big signs on the wall gambling positively prohibited and underneath the games are running high wide and fancy refined humor i call it there were nine killings one day but thats above the average the last time i was in town a couple of tool dressers got into a row with a laundryman claimed theyd been overcharged six cents it came to a shooting and we buried all three of them two cents apiece that was their closing price the cost of living is high enough but it isnt expensive to die here in this vein ran mallows talk from the first he had laid himself out to be entertaining and helpful and gray obligingly permitted him to have his way when they had finished breakfast he even allowed his companion to hire an automobile and driver for him they shook hands finally the best of friends mallow wished him good luck and gravely voiced the hope that he would have fewer diamonds when he returned gray warmly thanked his companion for his many courtesies and declared they would soon meet again thus far the trip had worked out much as gray had expected now as his service car left the town and joined the dusty procession of vehicles moving countryward he covertly studied its driver and was gratified to note that the fellow bore all the earmarks of a thorough scoundrel what conversation the man indulged in strengthened that impression the briskow farm it appeared lay about twenty miles out but twenty miles over oilfield roads proved to be quite a journey during the muddy season the driver declared it might well take a whole day to make that distance now that the roads were dry they could probably cover it in two or three hours if the car held together traffic near ranger was terrific and how it managed to move even at a snails pace was a mystery for to sit a car was like riding a bucking horse if there had been the slightest attempts at road building they were now invisible and the vehicular streams followed meandering wagon trails laid down by the original inhabitants of prepetroleum days which had not been bettered by the ceaseless pounding of the past twelve months up and down over armored ridges and into sandy arroyos along leaning hillsides and across dobe flats baked brick hard by the sun the current of travel roared and pounded with reckless disregard of tire and bolt and axle in the main it was a motordriven procession there were to be sure occasional teams of fine imported draft horses but for every head of live stock there were a dozen huge trucks and for every truck a score of passenger cars these last were battered and gray with mud and their dusty occupants were of a color to match for they drove blindly through an asphyxiating cloud even the thirsty vegetation beside the roads was coated gray and was so tinder dry that it seemed as if a lighted match would explode it the sun glared cruelly and the pyramidal piles of iron pipe chained to the groaning trucks and plunging trailers were hot enough to fry eggs upon but neither they nor the steaming radiators gave off more heat than the soil and the rocks detours were common testimony to mans inherent optimism but each was worse than the other the roadbeds everywhere were rutted torn broken up as if from longcontinued heavy shell fire from every ridge skeleton derricks were in sight as far as the eye could reach the scattered ones whose clean timbers gleamed in the sunlight testifying to dry holes the blackened ones usually in clumps indicating production magic word there were a few crossroads settlements hitchrail towns unpainted and ramshackle but nowhere was there an attempt at farming for this part of texas had gone hog wild over oil abandoned straw stacks had settled and molded cornfields had grown up to weeds what few head of cattle still remained lolled near the artificial surface tanks all but dried into mud holes it was a farm of this character that grays driver finally pointed out as the briskow ranch the house an unsightly storyandahalf affair stood at the back of what had once been a cultivated field and the place was distinctive only in the fact that it gave evidence of a good water well or a capacious reservoir in the form of a vivid green garden patch and a few flourishing peach trees immediately behind the residence welcome relief to the eye nobody answered grays knock at the front door so he walked around the house over the garden fence grown thick with brambles he beheld two feminine figures or rather two faded sunbonnets topping two pairs of shoulders and as he drew nearer he saw that one woman was bent and slow moving while the other was a huge creature wide of hip and deep of bosom whose bare arms burnt to a rich golden brown were like those of a blacksmith and who wielded her heavy hoe as if it were a toy she was singing in a thin nasal uncultivated voice evidently they were the briskow help therefore gray made his presence known and inquired for the master or mistress of the place the elder woman turned exposing a shrewd benevolent face and after a moment of appraisal said im miz briskow indeed the visitor smiled his best and announced the nature of his errand lawsy me mrs briskow planted her hoe in the soil and turned her back upon gray allie yore pa has gone an done it again heres another of his fool notions the women regarded each other silently their facial expressions hidden beneath their bonnets then the mother exposed her countenance a second time and said mister this is allegheny our girl miss allegheny briskow lifted her head nodded shortly and stared over the hoe handle at gray her gaze was one of frank curiosity and he returned it in kind for he had never beheld a creature like her gray was a tall man but this girls eyes met his on a level and her figure if anything was heavier than his nor was its appearance improved by her shapeless garment of faded wash material her feet were incased in a pair of mens cheap brogans that gray could have worn drops of perspiration gleamed upon her face and her hair what little was visible beneath the sunbonnet was wet and untidy altogether she presented a picture such as some painter of peasant types might have sketched garbed appropriately in shawl and sabots she would have passed for some european plowwoman of amazonian proportions allegheny it was a suitable name indeed for such a mountainous person her size was truly heroic she would have been grotesque ridiculous except for a certain youthful plasticity and a suggestion of tremendous vigor and strength that gave her dignity her ample illfitting dress failed to hide the fact that her robust body was well even splendidly molded grays attention however was particularly challenged by the girls face and eyes it was a handsome countenance cut in large bold features but of a stony immobility the eyes were watchful brooding sullen they regarded him with mingled defiance and shyness for an instant then they avoided his she averted her gaze she appeared to be meditating ignominious flight the mother abandoned her labor wiped her hands upon her skirt and said with genuine hospitality come right into the house and rest yourself pa and buddyll be home at dinner time by now a fuller significance of this strangers presence had struck home and she laughed softly as she led the way toward the dwelling dimons for allie and me eh land sakes pas up to something new every day lately i wonder what next as gray stepped aside for the younger woman to precede him his curiosity must have been patent for allegheny became even more selfconscious than before and her face flamed a fiery red as yet she had not spoken there were three rooms to the briskow residence bedrooms all with a semidetached ramshackle whitewashed kitchen at the rear and separated from the main house by a narrow gallery into the front chamber which evidently did service also as a parlor mrs briskow led the way by now she was in quite a flutter of excitement for the guest she drew forth the one rocking chair a patent contraption the rockers of which were held upon a sort of track by stout spiral springs its seat and back were of cheap carpet material stretched over a lacquered frame and these she hastily dusted with her apron then she seated herself upon the edge of the bed and beamed expectantly allegheny had carelessly brushed back her sunbonnet exposing a mane of damp straight brown hair of a quantity and length to match her tremendous vigor of limb but she remained standing at the foot of the bed too ill at ease to take a chair or perhaps too agitated to see one she was staring straight ahead her eyes fixed a foot or two over the callers head gray ignored her manifest embarrassment made a gingerly acquaintance with the chair of honor and then devoted his attention to the elder woman at every move the coiled springs under him strained and snapped alarmingly we dont often see jewelry peddlers the mother announced but sakes alive things is changin so fast we get a new surprise most every day i spose you got those rings in that valise she indicated grays stout leather sample case precisely said he if you have time id like to show them to you mrs briskows bent figure stirred she uttered a throaty chuckle and her weary face lined with the marks of toil and hardship flushed faintly her misshapen hands tightly clasped themselves and her faded eyes began to sparkle gray felt a warm thrill of compassion at the agitation of this kindly worn old soul and he rose quickly as he gained his feet that amazing chair behaved in a manner wholly unusual and startling relieved of strain the springs snapped and whined there was a violent oscillation of the back a shudder convulsed the thing and it sprang after him much as a tame rabbit thumps its feet upon the ground in an effort to bluff a kitten the volunteer salesman spread out his dazzling wares upon the patchwork counterpane then stepped back to observe the effect ma briskows hands fluttered toward the gems then reclasped themselves in her lap she bent closer and regarded them fixedly the junolike daughter also stared down at the display with fascination after a moment allegheny spoke and her speaking voice was in pleasing contrast to the nasal notes of that interrupted song are them real dimons she queried darkly oh yes and most of them are of very fine quality pa never told us a word breathed the mother hes allus up to some trick please examine them i want you to look them all over gray urged mrs briskow acted upon this invitation only after she had dried her hands and then with trepidation gingerly reverently she removed a ring from its resting place and held it up to the light my aint it sparkly she gasped after an ecstatic pause again the girl spoke her eyes fixed defiantly upon gray you could fool us easy cause we never saw real dimons weve allus been too pore the man nodded i hope youre not disappointed in them and i hope you are going to see and to own a great many finer ones weve never seen noth anything nor been anywhere yet it was mrs briskow speaking but were goin were goin lots of places and were goin to see everything wuth seein so pa says anyhow the children is first off pas goin to take us to the mountains the mother faced the visitor at this announcement and for a moment she appeared to be gazing at a vision for her wrinkled countenance was glorified youve seen em havent you mister mountains a great many allegheny broke in i dunnos these dimons is just what i expected em to be they are and they aint im kind of disappinted gray smiled that is true of most things that we anticipate or aspire to its the tragedy of accomplishment to find that our rewards are never quite up to our expectations do they cost much oh decidedly the prices are all plainly marked please look them over ma briskow did as urged but the shock was paralyzing delight admiration expectancy gave place to horrified amazement at the figures upon the tags she shook her head slowly and made repeated sounds of disapproval tse tse tse why your pas crazy plumb crazy although the mothers principal emotion for the moment was aroused by the price marks on the price tags allegheny paid little attention to them and began vainly fitting ring after ring to her fingers all were too small however most of them refused to pass even the first joint and gray realized now what gus briskow had meant when he wrote for rings of large sises eventually the girl found one that slipped into place and this she regarded with complacent admiration this onell do for me she declared and its a whopper gray took her hand in his as yet it had not been greatly distorted by manual labor but the nails were dull and cracked and ragged and they were inlaid in deep mourning i dont believe youll like that mounting he said gently its what we call a mans ring this is the kind women usually wear he held up a thin platinum band of delicate workmanship which allegheny examined with frank disdain image this onell do for me she declared and its a whopper pshaw id bust that the first time i hoed a row of taters she declared i got to have things stout for me but gray protested in even a milder voice you probably wouldnt want to wear expensive jewelry in the garden miss briskow held her hand high admiring the play of light upon the facets of the splendid jewel then she voiced a complacent thought that has been variously expressed by other women better circumstanced than she if we can afford to buy em i reckon we can afford to wear em not until gray had suggested that her days of work in the fields were probably about ended did the girls expression change then indeed her interest was arrested she regarded him with a sudden quickening of imagination she revolved the novel idea in her mind from what my driver has told me about the briskow farm he ran on you wont have to work at anything unless you care to allie continued to weigh this new thought in her mind that it intrigued her was plain but she made no audible comment chapter v for perhaps half an hour the women tried on one piece of jewelry after another exclaiming admiring arguing then the mother realized with a start that meal time was near and that the menfolks would soon be home leaving allie to entertain their guest she hurried out and the sound of splitting kindling the clatter of stove lids the rattle of utensils came from the kitchen gray retired to the patent rocker miss briskow settled herself upon a straightbacked chair and folded her capable hands in her lap an oppressive silence fell upon the room evidently the duties of hostess lay with crushing weight upon the girl for her face became stony her cheeks paled her eyes glazed the power of speech completely failed her and she answered gray with nods or shakes of her head the most that he could elicit from her were brief yeps and nopes it was not unlike a spirit reading or a ouijaboard seance he told himself in terms of the oil fields that here was a dry well that the girl was a duster having exhausted the usual commonplace topics in the course of a monologue that induced no reaction whatever he voiced a perfectly natural remark about the wonder of sudden riches he was in a way thinking aloud of the changes wrought in drab lives like the briskows by the discovery of oil he was surprised when allegheny responded ma and me stand it all right but its an awful strain on pa said she indeed the girl nodded hes got more nutty notions gray endeavored to learn the nature of pas recently acquired eccentricities but allie was flushing and paling as a result of her sudden excursion into the audible eventually she trembled upon the verge of speech once more then she took another desperate plunge he says folks are going to laugh at us or with us and and rich people have got to act rich they got to be elegant she laughed loudly abruptly and the explosive nature of the sound startled her as greatly as it did her hearer hes going to get somebody to teach buddy and me how to behave i think hes right gray said quietly why hes sent to fort worth for a piano already and for a lady to come out for a coupla days and show me how to play it there was another black hiatus in the conversation we havent got a spare room but im quick at learnin tunes she could bunk in with me for a night or two gray eyed the speaker suspiciously but it was evident that she was in sober earnest and the tragedy of such profound ignorance smote the man sharply here was a girl of at least average intelligence and of sensitive makeup a girl with looks too in spite of her size and no doubt a full share of common sense perhaps even talents of some sort yet with the knowledge of a child for the first time he realized what playthings of fate are men and women how completely circumstance can make or mar them and what utter paralysis results from the strangling grip of poverty history hints that during the middle ages there flourished an association known as comprachicos childbuyers which traded in children the comprachicos bought little human beings and disfigured their features distorted their bodies fashioned them into ludicrous grotesque or hideous monstrosities for king and populace to laugh at and then resold them soft immature faces were made into animal likenesses tender unformed bodies were put into wicker forms or porcelain vases and allowed to grow then when they had become things of compressed flesh and twisted bone the wicker was cut the vase was broken leaving a man in the shape of a bottle or a mug that is precisely what environment does in the case of allegheny briskow poverty the drought the grinding hardships of these hardscrabble texas counties had dwarfed the intellect the very soul of a splendid young animal or so at least gray told himself it was a thought that evoked profound consideration now that the girl was beginning to lose her painful embarrassment she showed to somewhat better advantage and no longer impressed him as bovine stolid almost stupid he could not but note again her full young figure her wellshaped wellpoised head and her regular features and the pity of it seemed all the greater by reason thereof he tried to visualize her perfectly groomed clad in a smart gown molded over a wellfitting corset with her feet properly shod and her hair dressed but the task was beyond him probably she had never worn a corset never seen a pair of silk stockings he thought too of what was in store for her and wondered how she would fit into the new world she was about to enter not very well he feared might not this prove to be the happiest period of all her new life he asked himself as yet the wonder and the glory of the new estate left room in her imagination for little else the mold was broken but the child was not conscious of its bottle shape nevertheless the shape was there when that child learned the truth when it heard the laughter and felt the ridicule what then he could not bring himself to envy allegheny briskow first off ma and me are goin over to dallas to do some tradin the girl was saying after that were goin to the mountains your mother mentioned mountains yep her and pa have allus been crazy about mountains but they never seen em thats the first thing ma said when number one blowed in when we saw that oil go over the crown block and when they told us that black stuff was really oil ma busted out cryin and said shed see the mountains after all then she wouldnt mind if she died pa he cried too wed allus been so pore you see mas kind of marked about mountains been that way since she was a girl she cuts out stories and pictures of em and thats how me and buddy came to be named allegheny and ozark but we never expected to see em the drought burned us out too often allegheny and ozark quaint names times must have been hard the remark was intended only as a spur hard there was a pause slowly the girls eyes began to smolder and as she went on in her deliberate way memory set a tragic shadow over her face ill say they was hard nobody but us nesters knows what hard times is out west of here they went three years without rain and all around here people was starvin grown folks was thin and tired and children was sickly they was too peaked to play why we took in a hull family wagonfolks their hosses died and they couldnt go on so we kep em til we burned out i dont know how we managed to get by except that pa and buddy are rustlers and i can do more n a hired man we never had enough to eat stuff just wouldnt grow the stock got bonier and bonier and finally died count of no grass and the tanks dryin out and all the time the sun was ablazin and the dust was ablowin and the clouds would roll up and then drift away and the sun would come out hotter n ever day after day month after month we waited eighteen i think it was people got so they wouldnt pray no more and the preachers moved away i guess we was as bad off as them pore folks in beljum why even the rattlesnakes pulled out of the country somehow the papers got hold of it and bimeby some grub was shipped in and give around but us briskows didnt get none pad die before hed beg the girl was herself now she was talking naturally feelingly and her voice was both deep and pleasing the thinner ma got the more she talked about the mountains where there was water cool clear water in the criks and timber on the hills timber with green leaves on it and grass that you could lay down in and smell i guess ma was kind of feverish we was drier n a limeburners boot when the rain did come ill never forget we all stood out in it and soaked it up it was wonderful to get all wet and soaky and not with sweat then on top of that the oil came too it must have been wonderful yep now were rich and buyin dimons and pianos and goin to dallas for pretty fixins seems kinda dreamy allegheny briskow closed her eyes her massive crown of damp disordered hair drooped backward and for a moment gray was able unobserved to study her she had revealed herself to him suddenly in the space of a few moments and the revelation added such poignancy to his previous thoughts that he regarded her with a wholly new sympathy there was nothing dull about this girl on the contrary she had intelligence and feeling there had been a rich vibrance in her voice as she told of that frightful ordeal a dimness had come into her eyes as she spoke of her mother gabbling feverishly of the green hills and babbling brooks she had yearned maternally at mention of those wretched little children no there was a sincere emotional quality concealed in this young giantess and a sensitiveness quite unexpected gray remained silent until she opened her eyes then he said when you and your mother come to dallas to do your shopping wont you let me take you around to the right shops and see that you get the right things then prompted by the girls quick resentment he added hastily at the right prices allies face cleared why thats right nice of you she declared i i reckon wed be glad to gus briskow was a sandy angular man a ring of air holes cut in the crown of his faded felt hat showed a head of hair faded to match the color of his headgear his greasy overalls were tucked into boots and a ragged josephs coat covered his flannel shirt both the man and his makeup were thoroughly typical of this part of the country except in one particular pa briskow possessed the brightest the shrewdest pair of blue eyes that calvin gray had ever seen and they were surrounded by a network of prepossessing wrinkles he came directly in to greet his visitor then said i never expected youd come way out here an bring your plunder with you ma says you got a hull gripful o dimons i have indeed gray pointed to the glittering display still spread out upon the varicolored counterpane briskow approached the bed and gazed curiously silently down at the treasure then his face broke into a sunshiny smile he wiped his hands upon his trousers legs and picked up a ring but instead of examining the jewel he looked at the price mark after which his smile broadened ozark had entered behind his father and his sister introduced him now he was a year or two younger than allegheny but cast in the same heroic mold they formed a massive pair of children indeed and as in her case a sullen distrust of strangers was inherent in him he stared coldly resentfully at gray mumbled an unintelligible greeting then rudely turned his back upon the visitor and joined his father the elder briskow spoke first and it was evident that he feared to betray lack of conservatism for he said with admirable restraint likelylookin lot of trinkets eh bud bud grunted after a moment he inquired of gray how much is that hull lot wuth mister close to a hundred thousand dollars brother and sister exchanged glances the father considered briefly smilingly then he said with oil at three an a quarter it wouldnt take long for a twelvehundred barler to get the hull caboodle would it is your well producing twelve hundred barrels a day huh briskow junior grinned at his sister exposing a mouth full of teeth as white and as sound as railroad crockery but his next words were directed at gray we got four wells and the porest one is makin twelve hundred barl the guests mental calculations as to the briskow royalties were interrupted by an announcement that dinner was ready whereupon the father announced mister it looks like youd have to stay overnight with us cause i got important business after dinner an i wouldnt trust ma to pick out no jewelry by herself them prices would skeer her to death were ignorant people and we aint used to spendin money so itll take time for us to make up our minds kin you wait ill stay as long as youll keep me gray declared heartily a moment later having learned that a place at the table had been set for his driver as well as himself gray stepped out to summon the man and to effect the necessary change in his arrangements he was not surprised to find the chauffeur with nose flattened against a pane of the frontroom window his hands cupped over his eyes ignoring the fellows confusion at being discovered gray told him of his change of plan and instructed him to drive back to ranger and to return late the following afternoon then he led the way toward the kitchen that stay at the briskows turned out to be less irksome than the visitor had anticipated for the afternoon was spent with buddy examining the briskow wells and others near by it was an interesting experience and gray obtained a deal of firsthand information that he believed would come in handy buddys first mistrust was not long in passing and once gray had penetrated his guard the boy was won completely the pendulum swung to the opposite extreme and erelong suspicion changed to liking then to approval and at last to open extravagant admiration and gray liked the youthful giant too once the latter had dropped his hostility and had become his natural self for ozark was a lad with temper and with temperament they got along together swimmingly in fact they grew thicker than thieves in the course of time the elder man soon became conscious of the fact that he was being studied analyzed even copied the sincerest form of flattery and it pleased his vanity buddys mind was thirsty his curiosity was boundless questions popped out of him at every step and every answer every bit of information or of philosophy that fell from the visitors lips he pounced upon avidly examined then carefully put away for future use he was like a magpie filling its nest grays personal habits mannerisms tricks all were grist for buddys mill the strangers suit for instance was a curiosity to the boy who could not understand wherein it was so different from any other he had ever seen young briskow attributed that difference to the fact that it had probably come from a bigger store than any he had known it amazed him to learn in answer to a pointed question that it had been cut and fitted to the wearer by expert workmen it disappointed him bitterly to be informed that there was not another one exactly like it which he could buy and the visitors silk shirt with double cuffs and a monogram on the sleeve fancy fixins like this buddy confessed he had always associated with womenfolks but if gray wore them there could be nothing disgraceful nothing effeminate about the practice there was a decided thrill in the prospect of possessing such finery all initialed with huge silken o bs life was presenting wholly novel and exciting possibilities to the youth when gray offered him a cigarette buddy rudely took the gold case out of his hand and examined it then he laughed in raucous delight gosh i never knew men had purty things i im goin to get me one like that do you like it gee its swell good ill make you a present of it buddy stared at the speaker in speechless surprise what what for he finally stammered because you admire it why its solid gold aint it to be sure how much dit cost my dear fellow gray protested you shouldnt ask questions like that you embarrass me buddy examined the object anew then he inquired say whyd you offer to gimme this ive just told you gray was becoming impatient it is a custom in some countries to present an object to one who is polite enough to admire it nobody never give me a present buddy said not one that i wanted i never had nothing that i didnt have to have and couldnt get along without this cigareet case is worth more n all the stuff i ever owned an im sure obliged to you he replaced the article in grays hand eh wont you accept it why not i oh i dunno gray pondered this refusal for a moment before saying perhaps you think im trying to make a good impression on you so youll buy some diamonds mebbe buddy averted his eyes he was in real distress umm i ought to punch your head gray slipped the case into young briskows pocket i dont have to bribe people some day youll realize that i like you honest cross my heart the boy laughed in frank delight his brown cheeks colored his eyes sparkled gosh said he i like you for some time thereafter he remained red and silent but he kept one big hand in the pocket where lay the gold cigarette case there was a wordless song in buddy briskows heart for he had made a friend and such a friend the briskow children possessed each others fullest confidence hence ozark took the first occasion to show his gift to allegheny and to tell her in breathless excitement all about that wonderful afternoon he said hed a mind to lick me an i bet he could a done it too the boy concluded lick you hunh oh hes hardboiled thats why i like him hes been round the world and speaks furrin language like a natif that suit of clos was made for him an hes got thirty others all better n this one shoes too made special in new york forty dollars a pair whats he doin here if hes so rich it was the doubting female of the species speaking drummers is terrible liars buddy flew to the defense of his hero hes doin this to hep a friend told me all about it im goin to have thirty suits shoes dont cost forty dollars clos dont cost that much allie regarded her brother keenly understandingly then she said somberly it aint no use buddy what aint it aint no use to wish mebbe you can have thirty suits if the wells hold out but they wont look like his and me too were too big buddy an the more money we got the more clos we put on the more folks is goin to laugh at us it shames me to go places with anybody but you he wouldnt laugh hes been all over the world the boy asserted then after some deliberation i bet hes seen bigger people than us as a matter of fact alleghenys sensitiveness about her size had been quickly apparent to gray and during that day he did his utmost to overcome it but with what success he could not know buddy was his body and soul that much was certain he made the conquest doubly secure by engaging the young behemoth in a scuffle and playfully putting him on his back defeat at other hands than grays would have enraged ozark to the point of frenzy it would have been considered by him an indignity and a disgrace now however he looked upon it as a natural and wholly satisfactory demonstration of his idols supreme prowess and he roared with delight at being bested gray promptly taught him the wrestling trick by which he had accomplished the feat and flattered the boy immensely by refusing to again try his skill the older man when he really played could enter into sport with tremendous zest and he did so now he taught buddy trick after trick they matched each other in feats of strength and agility they wound up finally on opposite sides of the briskow kitchen table elbows planted fingers interlocked straining furiously in that muscleracking jointcracking pastime of the lumber camps known as twisting arms here again gray was victorious until he showed buddy how to gain greater leverage by changing the position of his wrist and by slightly altering his grip whereupon the boys superior strength told they were red in the face out of breath and soaked with perspiration when pa briskow drove up in his expensive new touring car by this time buddys admiration had turned to adulation he had passed under the yoke and he gloried shamelessly in his captive state at supper time he appeared with his hair wetly combed in imitation of grays he wore a necktie too and into it he had fastened a cheap brass stickpin much as gray wore his during the meal he watched how the guest used his knife and fork and made awkward attempts to do likewise but a table fork was an instrument which heretofore buddy had looked upon as a weapon of pure offense like a whalers harpoon and conveniently designed either for spearing edibles beyond his reach or for retrieving fragments of meat lurking between his back teeth he even did some hasty manicuring under the edge of the table with his jackknife pa briskow was scarcely less observant than his son he watched grays every move he sounded him out adroitly he pondered his lightest word after the supper things had been cleared away and the dishes washed the entire family adjourned to the front room and again examined the jewelry it was an absorbing task they did not hurry it not until the following afternoon in fact did they finally make their selections and then they were guided almost wholly by the good taste of their guest gray did not exploit them on the contrary his effort was to limit their extravagance but in this he had little success for pa briskow had decided to indulge his generous impulses to the full and insisted upon so doing the check he finally wrote was one of five figures by this time the visitor had become aware of arousing a queer reaction in allegheny briskow he had overcome her diffidence early enough he had unsealed her lips he had obtained an insight into her character but once that was done the girl retired within herself again and he could get nothing more out of her he would have believed that she actually disliked him had it not been for the fact that whatever he said she took as gospel that wherever he chanced to be there she was her ears open her somber meditative eyes fixed upon him evidently she did not actually dislike him he decided finally that she was studying him striving to analyze and to weigh him to her own complete satisfaction before trusting him further than she had when it drew near the time for him to leave and he announced that the driver of his hired car had been instructed to return for him there was protest loud and earnest from the briskows father and son buddy actually sulked at being denied the pleasure of driving his hero to town in the new car and told about a smooth place on a certain detour where he could get her up to sixty mile an hour if it was longer shed do a hundred he declared pa briskow was worried for the security of the diamonds and assured gray that it was unsafe to trust those servicecar drivers but the latter seeing a threat to his carefully matured plans refused to listen theres one thing you can do for me he told them you can give me a pint of cream cream what for the family regarded him with amazement im fond of it if you have no cream milk will do pshaw ill put up a hull basket of lunch for you mrs briskow declared buddy go kill a rooster an you allie get them eggs out of the nest in the garden an a jar of them peach preserves while i make up a pan of biscuits protest was unavailing when the others had hurried away pa briskow said i been studyin you mister gray and i got you down as a firstclass man when ma and allie come over to dallas to get rigged out id like you to help em they aint never been futher from home than cisco thats thirty mile ill pay you for your time grays hearty acceptance of the first and his prompt refusal of the second proposal pleased the speaker bein rich is mighty fine but gus briskow shook his head doubtfully it takes a lot of thinkin and i aint used to thinkin some day mebbe ill get you to give me a hand in figgerin out some worries business worries no i got enough of them an more comin but it aint that were goin to have a heap of money and he looked up with straightforward eyes we aint goin to lose it if i have my way weve rubbed along half starved all our lives an done without things till were well look at us i reckon weve made you laugh oh i bet we have ma an me can stand it but mister i dont want folks to laugh at my children and theres other things i dont want to happen to em buddys a wild hoss and hes got a streak of the old nick in him and allie aint broke no better n him i got a feelin there may be trouble ahead an sometimes i most wish wed never had no oil in texas chapter vi well did you land them hicks it was grays driver speaking through the gloom of early evening he was guiding his car back toward ranger the road was the same they had come but darkness had invested it with unfamiliar perils or so it seemed for the headlights threw every rock and ridge into bold relief and left the holes filled with mysterious shadows the vehicle strained its motor raced its gears clashed noisily as it rocked along like a dory in a boisterous tide rip only now and then did a few rods of smooth going permit the chauffeur to take his attention from the streak of illumination ahead long enough to light another cigarette a swift maneuver the dexterity of which bespoke long practice yes and i made a good sale the passenger declared with pride he announced the size of the briskow check jever see a dame the size of that gal a short laugh issued from the driver shed clean up in vaudeville wouldnt she why she could lift a ton in harness and hoein the garden with their coin its like a woman i heard of they got a big well on their farm and she came to town to do some shoppin somebody told her shed ought to buy a present for her old man so she got him a new handle for the ax gawd a few miles farther on the fellow confessed i wasnt crazy about comin for you tonight not after i got a flash at whats in that valise no youre takin a chance stranger nothing new about that gray remained unperturbed his left arm was behind the driver with it he clung rigidly to the back of the seat as the car plunged and rolled frequently we are in danger when we least suspect it now you for instance me the man at the wheel shot a quick glance at his fare you probably take more chances than you dream of how so umm these roads are a menace to life and limb the country is infested with robbers oh sure thats what i had in mind joyridin at night with a hatful of diamonds is my idea of a suckers amusement of course we wont get it of course one never does sure but if we should theres just one thing to do indeed gray was pleasantly inquisitive but it was plain that he suffered no apprehensions and that is sit tight and take your medicine i never take medicine the chauffeur shrugged his shoulders well i do when its put down my throat i been stuck up really twice tame as a house cat me both times i spose ill get nicked again sometime and you wont offer any resistance not a one cull im relieved to be assured of that for a second time the driver flashed a glance at his companion it was a peculiar remark and voiced in a queer tone yes why because gray slightly shifted his position there was a movement of his right hand the one farthest away from the man at the wheel and simultaneously his left arm slipped from the back of the seat and tightly encircled the latters waist he finished in a wholly unfamiliar voice because my good man you are now held up for the third time and it would distress me to have to kill you the driver uttered a loud grunt for something sharp and hard had been thrust deeply into that soft sensitive region overlying his liver and now it was held there it was unnecessary for gray to order the car stopped its brakes squealed it ceased its progress as abruptly as if its front wheels had fetched up against a stone wall hey what the dont try to heel me with your elbow gray warned sharply now up with em you know thats nice the faces of the men were close together grays was blazing the drivers was stiff with amazement and stamped with an incredulous grimace paralyzed for the moment with astonishment he made no resistance not even when he felt that long muscular left arm relax and the hand at the end of it go searching over his pockets gray was grim mocking some vibrant evil quality to his voice suggested extreme malignity at full cock like that unseen weapon the muzzle of which was buried beneath the drivers short ribs ah you go armed i see a shoulder holster as i suspected i knew you had nothing on this side seizing his victims upstretched right hand with his own left he gave it a sudden fierce wrench that all but snapped the wrist and at the same instant he reached across and snatched the concealed weapon from its resting place he flung the chauffeurs body away from him there was a sharp click as he swiftly jammed the barrel of the automatic back and let it fly into place the entire maneuver had been deftly executed even yet the object of the assault was speechless now then the passenger faced about in his seat and showed his teeth in a smile it is customary to permit the condemned to enjoy the last word what have you to say for yourself i got this to say its a hell of a joke the man exploded do i act as if i were joking if you think its funny to jab a gun in a mans belly when he aint lookin a gun my simple friend you have or had the only gun in this party and you may thank whatever gods you worship that you didnt try to use it for i would have been rough with you oh very rough i might even have made you eat it now inasmuch as you may be tempted to embellish this story with some highly imaginary details i prefer that you know the truth this is the gun i used to stick you up with a rigidly outthrust thumb gray prodded the driver in the side simple isnt it and no chance for accidents the speakers shoulders were shaking well ill be damned not a doubt of it chuckled the other especially if you follow in the course you have chosen and a similar fate will overtake your pal mallow by the way is that his right name never mind i know him as mallow a shallow trusting man and i hope a better judge of diamonds than of character as for me i look deeper than the surface and am seldom deceived in people witness your case for example i knew you at once for a crook it might save you several miles of bad walking to tell me where mallow is waiting to highjack me no i dunno what youre ravin about growled the unhappy owner of the automobile but believe me ill have you pinched for this how sharper than a serpents tooth is ingratitude and what bad taste to prattle of prosecution i shant steal your car it needs too much overhauling and i abominate cheap machines it is true that im one pistol to the good but in view of the law against carrying lethal weapons surely you wont prefer charges against me for removing it from your person oh not that it seems to me that im treating you handsomely for i shall even pay you the agreed price for this trip provided only you tell me where you expect to meet mr mallow go to hell very well oblige me now by getting out and make it snappy the driver did as directed gray pocketed the automatic slipped in behind the steering wheel and drove away into the night followed by loud and earnest objurgations he was still smiling cheerfully when a mile farther on he brought the car to a stop and clambered out passing forward into the illumination of the headlights he busied himself there for several moments before resuming his journey for the first time in a long while calvin gray was thoroughly enjoying himself here was an enterprise with all the possibilities of a firstclass adventure and of the sort moreover that he was peculiarly qualified to cope with it possessed enough hazard to lend it the requisite zest it was sufficiently unusual to awaken his keenest interest he experienced an agreeable exaltation of spirit but no misgivings whatever as to the outcome for he held the commanding cards little remained it seemed to him except to play them carefully and to take the tricks as they fell he had not the slightest notion of permitting mallow to lay hands upon that case of jewels there was no mistaking the road but gray did not bother to stick to the maintraveled course when detours or short cuts promised better going for he knew full well that mallow would be waiting if at all in some place he was bound to pass it was an ideal country for a holdup lonely and lawless derrick lights twinkled over the mesquite tops and occasionally the flaming red mouth of some boiler gaped at him or the foliage was illuminated by the glare of gas flambeaux vertical iron pipes at the ends of which the surplus from neighboring wells was consumed in what seemed a reckless wastage occasionally too a belated truck thundered past but the traffic was pretty thin at last however he beheld some distance ahead the white glare of two stationary lights the road was narrow and sandy here and shut in by banks of underbrush as he drew nearer a figure stepped out and stood in silhouette until his own lights picked it up the figure waved its arms and called attention to the car behind evidently broken down here then the drama was to be played gray brought his machine on at such a pace and so close to the man in the road that the latter was forced to step aside then he swung it far to the right brought it back with a quick twist of the steering wheel and killed his motor he was now in the ditch and outside the blinding glare of the opposing headlights the stalled machine was in the full illumination of his own lamps contrary to grays expectations the car in the road was empty and the man who had hailed him was a stranger as the latter approached he inquired whats wrong out of gas i guess anyhow i the speaker noted that there was but one new arrival where he had expected two and the discovery appeared to nonplus him momentarily he stammered involuntarily he turned his head gray looked in the same direction but without changing his position and out of the corner of his eye he glimpsed a new figure emerging from the shadows behind him very clever but at least his unexpected maneuver with his own car had made it necessary for both men to approach him from the same side while the first stranger continued to mumble gray sat motionless keenly conscious meanwhile of that other presence closing in upon him from the rear he simulated a violent start when a second voice cried dont move ive got you covered my god gray twisted about in his seat and exposed a startled countenance a masked man was standing close to the left running board and he held a revolver near grays head the apparition appeared to paralyze the unhappy traveler for he still tightly clutched the steering wheel with both hands just sit still the cloth of the mask blew outward as the words issued through the slits two malevolent eyes gleamed act pretty and you wont get hurt why its its mr mallow gray hitched himself farther around in his seat and leaned forward in justifiable amazement as i live its you mallow both highwaymen were in front of him now and shoulder to shoulder he made sure there were no others behind them shut up mallow snapped frisk him tony and the command was cut short by a startled throaty cry a hoarse sound of astonishment and rage and simultaneously a strange a phenomenal thing occurred an unseen hand appeared to strike down both mallow and his accomplice where they stood and it smote them moreover with appalling force and terrifying effect one moment they were in complete mastery of the situation the next they were groveling in the road coughing sneezing barking retching blaspheming poisonously baffled fury followed their first surprise mallow tore the mask from his face and groped blindly for the weapon he had dropped but before he could recover it pain mastered him and he fell back clawing at himself rubbing at his eyes that had been stricken sightless he yelled tony yelled then upon the startled night there burst a duet of squeals and curses a hideous medley of mingled pain and fright at once terrifying and unnatural both bandits appeared to be in paroxysms of agony from tony issued sounds that might have issued from the throat of a woman in deadly fear and excruciating torment mallows face had been partially protected hence he was the lesser sufferer nevertheless his eyes were boiling in their sockets his lungs were ablaze ungovernable convulsions ran over him the men understood vaguely what had afflicted them for they had seen gray lift one hand from the wheel and out of that hand they had seen a stream of liquid or a jet of aqueous vapor leap it was too close to dodge it had sprung directly into their faces vaporizing as it came and at its touch at the first scent of its fumes their legs had collapsed their eyes had tightly closed and every cell in their outraged bodies had rebelled it was as if acid had been dashed upon them destroying in one blinding instant all power for evil with every breath now a new misery smote them but worse than this torture was the monstrous nature of their afflictions it was mysterious horrible they believed themselves to be dying and screamed in abysmal terror of the unknown gray squeezed again the rubber bulb that he had carried in his hand these last several miles ejecting from it the last few drops of its contents then he opened the car door stepped out of it and stood over his strangling victims he kicked mallows revolver off the road and holding his breath relieved the other highjacker of his weapon this he flung after the first then he withdrew himself a few paces and lighted a cigarette for a raw pungent odor offended his nostrils both of the bawling bandits reeked of it but their plight left him indifferent they reminded him of a pair of horses he had seen disemboweled by a bursting shell but he felt much less pity for them his lack of concern made itself felt finally mallow who was the first to show signs of recovery struggled to his feet and clawed blindly toward the automobile he clung to it sick and shaking profanely he appealed for aid so it is mr mallow gray said fancy meeting you here a stream of incoherencies issued from the wretched object of this mockery tony the other man stifled his groans rose to his knees and with his hands clasped over his eyes shuffled slowly away as if to escape the sound of grays voice better quiet down and let me do something at once if you wish to save your sight the latter suggested otherwise i wont answer for the result and you neednt tell me how it hurts i know this proffer of aid appeared to throw the sufferers into new depths of dismay they called to him in the name of god they were harmless now and anyhow they had intended to do him no bodily harm they implored him to lend succor or to put them out of their distress gray fell to work promptly the bottle of cream he had begged from ma briskow he now put to use with this soothing liquid he first washed out their eyes the membranes of which were raw and spongy and excruciatingly sensitive to light then he bandaged them as best he could with compresses wet in it youll breathe easier as time goes on he announced youll cough a good deal for a few days but where you are going that wont disturb anybody your eyes will get well too if you take care of them as i direct but meanwhile let me warn you against lifting those bandages advise me as they dry out and ill wet them again a blessed relief stole over the unfortunate pair they were still sick and weak but in a short time the acuteness of their suffering had diminished sufficiently for gray to help them into the back seat of his car and resume his journey sarcastically he referred to the sample case on the tonneau floor if those diamonds are in your way ill take them in front with me if not ill ask you to keep an eye on them or let us say keep a foot on them if you should be foolish enough to heave them overboard or try to renew your assault upon me i would be tempted to break this milk bottle in that event my dear mallow youd go through life with a tin cup in your hand and a dog on a string tony groaned in abject misery of body and soul mallow cursed feebly what is that devilish stuff the latter queried it was plain from his voice that he meditated no treachery oh i was going to tell you it is a product of german ingenuity designed i believe for the purpose of quelling riotous and insurrectionary prisoners it was efficacious also in taking pill boxes and clearing out dugouts and the like with some care one is safe in using it in an ordinary ammonia gun the sort policemen use on mad dogs forgive me if i say that you have demonstrated its utility in peace as well as in war if there were more highjackers in the world the device might be commercialized at some profit but alas my good mallow your profession is not a common one cut out the kidding mallow growled then he fell into a new convulsion of coughing the car proceeded for some time to the tune of smothered complaints from the miserable figures bouncing upon the rear seat before gray said i fear you are a selfish pair of rascals have you no concern regarding the fate of the third member of your treasurehunting trio evidently they had none too bad its a good story whatever their indifference to the welfare of the chauffeur they still had some curiosity as to their own for mallow asked what are you going to do with us what would you do if you were in my place id listen to reason meaning hell you know what he means tony cried feebly so you do me the honor to offer a bribe gray laughed pardon my amusement it sounds callous i know but frankly your unhappy condition fails to distress me well how much do you offer all we got a coupla thousand a temptation truly mallow addressed his companion irritably have a little sense he dont need money calvin gray had never been more pleased with himself than now for matters had worked out almost exactly according to plan a compliment indeed to his foresight and to his executive ability he loved excitement he lived upon it and much of his life had been devoted to the stagemanagement of sensational exploits like this one as a boy plays with a toy so did gray amuse himself with adventure and now he was determined to exact from this one the last particle of enjoyment and whatever profit it afforded within a few minutes of his arrival at ranger the town was noisy with the story for he drove down the brightly lighted main street and stopped in front of the most populous cafe there he called loudly for a policeman and when the latter elbowed his way through the crowd gray told him in plain hearing of all enough of his experience to electrify everybody he told the story well he even made known the value of his diamond stock mercilessly he pilloried the two blindfolded bandits when he drove to the jail the running boards of his car were jammed with inquisitive citizens and those who could not find footing thereon followed at a run laughing shouting acclaiming him and jeering at his prisoners having surrendered custody of the latter he dressed their eyes once more and explained the sort of care they required then he made an appeal from the front steps of the jail adjuring the mob to disperse quietly and permit the law to take its course nothing like this had occurred during the brief busy life of the town it was a dramatic incident but the manner in which this capable stranger had handled it and the discomfiture he had brought upon his assailants appealed more to the risibilities than to the anger of ranger admiration for him displaced indignation at the highjackers cries for vengeance upon them were drowned in noisy appreciation of their captor gray became a popular character men clamored to shake his hand and complimented him upon his nerve the editor of the local newspaper dragged him protesting to the office and there interviewed him gray was covered with confusion reluctantly he made known his identity and retold the whole story of his trip this time beginning at his meeting with coverly in dallas he displayed the bewildering contents of his sample case now guarded by a uniformed arm of the law and explained how he had volunteered his services out of pure love of adventure then how he had played into mallows hands while aware of his malign purpose at all times this was more than a local story it was big enough for the wire gray sat at the editors elbow while that enthusiastic gentleman called dallas and gave it to the papers there he was escorted to the railroad station by an admiring crowd he was cheered as he passed smiling into his pullman car chapter vii coverly was at the station when grays train arrived at dallas the next morning he was suffering intense excitement and he deluged his friend with a flood of questions meanwhile flourishing the morning papers all of which appeared to have devoted much space to the ranger episode he hugged gray and he pumped his hand he laughed and he chattered he insisted upon hearing the whole story without delay on their way uptown the returning hero gave it to him together with gus briskows check at the size of the latter coverly gasped didnt i say you were a good salesman and mallow you got him didnt you i told you he was a crook just the same old man you ran a terrible risk and i feel mighty guilty why those fellows would have killed you probably why didnt you take along a policeman or somebody and miss all the fun miss my pay for the trip i agreed to take my commission in thrills the jeweler was frankly curious werent you frightened frightened no gray shook his head ive never been really afraid of anything or anybody so far as i recall ive never been able to understand the necessity of being frightened i dare say the capacity for enjoying that particular emotion was omitted from my makeup the result of some peculiar prenatal influence probably im sorry too for fear must have a fascination and i like unusual sensations speaking of your commissions how am i going to pay you not for the sale you made although i wouldnt have done as well but for the loss you saved the firm and for the risk you ran gray felt a momentary desire to have done with pretense to confess his true condition and to beg not only a suitable reward for his services but also as large a loan as coverly could spare it is hard to maintain an attitude of opulence on less than nothing it would be so much easier to have done with this counterfeit gesture and trust to a straightforward appeal but he dared not yield to the impulse you may give me anything you see fit he declared and i shant embarrass you by refusing on the contrary go as strongly as you possibly can coverly actually appeared to be relieved at this statement but he inquired curiously what have you got up your sleeve you dont need money obviously not but i know a needy object of charity a worthy case i assure you i can scarcely call him a friend but i used to admire him greatly and he is still an agreeable companion a man at once capable extravagant entertaining dissipated he is in a bad way temporarily and can scarcely afford even the bare necessities of life it is only with my help in fact that he maintains its luxuries your money shall go to him and with every dollar of it that he squanders there shall arise an earnest orison to you the jeweler was delighted good he cried i detest the deserving poor as heartily as you do and now id like to open a bottle of champagne with our breakfast on the very day that the new sign tom and bob parker went up over the door of the insurance office at wichita falls the junior partner announced well dad the firm gets busy at once im off for dallas tonight what for tom was dismayed by such a prompt manifestation of energy ill have to tell you barbara perched herself upon her fathers desk and began speaking with a note of excitement in her voice i heard henry nelson was in town so i went to the bank this morning to see him hes such a big man in the oil business i thought he might help me he was there but in conference with his father and another man there were several people waiting so i sat down when the man they were talking to came out it was pete that driller who put down the first well for us he was glad to see me and we had quite a talk but i noticed he was fidgety he said he was running a rig over near burk and had a fishing job on his hands with all the excitement and everybody running double towers and trying to beat the other fellow down to the sand it struck me as queer that a contract driller like pete would be here in wichita in conference with bell and henry nelson when he ought to be out on the lease fishing for a lost bit it didnt sound right the more i got out of him the queerer it sounded for he had all the fishing tools he needed so i accused him of being a fraud i told him id bet he had a showing of oil and was trying to borrow money to buy the offset or to get the nelsons to buy it and carry him for an interest whered you pick up this lingo tom inquired you talk like them wild men at the westland hotel barbara laughed delightedly didnt i put down all our shallow wells if i didnt i thought i did anyhow i spent most of my time around the rigs and pete used to call me his boss well that wretched man turned all colors when i accused him and tried to shush me he said i mustnt talk about things i knew nothing about somebody might overhear me he declared the outfit he was working for were no good and wouldnt pay a driller a bonus if he made a well for them he was sick of making other people rich and getting nothing for himself it was time the drilling crews shared in the profits hed see that nobody froze him out again if he had to spoil the hole he wound up by denying everything and i pretended to swallow it but when he had gone i went over my maps and located the lease where hes drilling three of the adjoining tracts are owned by the big companies so that eliminated them but the twenty to the west belongs to knute hoaglund henry was glad to see me when my turn came to go in and i bet he was glad tom declared barbaras smooth cheeks flushed faintly he is too busy and too rich to think about girls he wasnt too busy and too rich to inquire about you most every day since he got back from the war i didnt forget to call him colonel and that pleased both him and bell then i told them that i proposed to become a rich and successful oil operator and wanted their advice how to begin old bell was amused but henry i beg pardon colonel nelson was shocked he couldnt bear to think of women and of me especially in business he might have become disagreeably personal if his father hadnt been there dunnos i care much for henry tom said mildly oh hes all right but i hate bell it makes anybody mad to be laughed at henry was more diplomatic he tried to convince me that the oil game is altogether a mans business and that no woman could succeed at it it is a contest of wits he explained youve got to outguess the other fellow youve got to know everything hes doing and keep him from knowing anything youre doing the minute he knows as much as you do hes got it on you that seemed to prove to henry that no woman could win at it for men are such superior creatures they know so much more than a woman can possibly learn their wits are so much keener i was duly impressed i asked him to call this evening for i did so wish to have him teach me what little i was capable of learning but he couldnt come because he had been called to dallas unexpectedly that was my cue in my most sweetly girlish manner i said oh indeed do you expect to see knute hoaglund while youre there two hectic spots had come into bobs cheeks during this recital she was teetering upon the desk now like a nodding japanese doll and her blue eyes were dancing i heard old bells chair creak and i saw him shoot a quick glance at henry henry admitted casually that he might drop in on knute why youll be wasting time i told him even more sweetly for dad and i have that twenty west of burkburnett well youd have thought i had stuck a hatpin into bell and henrys mouth actually dropped open think of it colonel henry nelson the hero of whateveritis with his imperial mouth open and nothing coming out of it not even the imperial breath bob rocked backward and kicked up her neatly shod feet she hugged herself and snickered with a malicious enjoyment not wholly christianlike but we aint even got an option it takes money to lease closein stuff tom was bewildered of course and they realized that or bell did as soon as hed had time to collect himself but it was too late then he had betrayed himself and he knew it oh he was sore hed have flung me out if id been a man i got mad too and i told him it made no real difference whether i was bluffing or not the jig was up so far as he was concerned i reminded him of what henry had just said that the oil business is a game of wits and that when you know what the other fellow is doing you have him licked i admitted that he could probably keep me from getting the lease but i could also keep him from getting it bell nearly had a stroke at that threat henry behaved very decently throughout i think it must have pleased him to find that somebody in wichita besides him had the courage to defy his father anyhow he said bob has beaten us at our own game she knows enough now to place that lease in half an hour and i think wed better take her in otherwise shell wire knute and hell probably protect her for an interest that made me feel awfully fraudulent but his smarty remarks about women in the oil business still rankled so i just sat pretty and blinked like a little owl bell swore in his best and most horrible manner he swore but he gave in bob laughed again a bit hysterically thats about all dad they agreed to put up the money and carry me us i mean for a quarter interest if i can get the lease from knute hoaglund so im leaving on the night train son i im darned if i dont believe well make a go of this business tom parker declared with a little cry barbara flung herself into his arms the publicity calvin gray received from his exploit at ranger could be nothing except agreeable to one of his temperament gratefully he basked in his notoriety meanwhile continuing assiduously to cultivate the moneyed men of dallas his sudden leap into prominence aroused curiosity among the wives and families of the latter and he became the recipient of some social attentions he accepted every invitation and so well did he carry himself in company so ornamental and engaging was he as a dinner guest that he was soon in great demand he possessed accomplishments too that increased the respect of his masculine acquaintances for instance he displayed a proficiency at golf quite unusual in men of athletic training and they argued that any man who could do par whenever he felt like it must be either a professional or a person of limitless leisure and limitless leisure means limitless funds gray studiously maintained his air of financial mystery he was in and out of offices always purposeful always in a hurry but always with sufficient time to observe the strictest niceties of polite behavior it was a part of his plan to create an atmosphere of his own to emphasize his knack for quick decisive wellcalculated action the money he received from coverly enabled him to maintain the posture he had assumed he spent it with his usual prodigality receiving little direct benefit but making each dollar look like four extravagance with him was an art money ran out of his pockets like water but although he was already in a position to borrow he did not do so he merely marked time deriving a grim amusement at the way his popularity grew as his currency dwindled it was a game enjoyable so long as it lasted egotistical he knew himself to be but it was a conscious fault to tickle his own vanity filled him with the same satisfaction a cat feels at having its back rubbed and he excused himself by reasoning that his deceit harmed nobody meanwhile with feline alertness he waited for a mouse to appear he was relieved one day to receive a telegram from gus briskow asking him to meet ma and allie at the evening train and get them a hotel he managed to secure a good suite at the ajax and it was with genuinely pleasurable anticipation that he drove to the station dismay smote him however at first sight of the new arrivals ma briskow resembled nothing so much as one of those hideous crayon enlargements he had seen in farmhouses atrocities of an art long dead for she was clad in an oldfashioned basque and skirt of some stiff nearsilk material and her waist which buttoned far down the front and terminated in deep points served merely to roof over but not to conceal a peculiarity of figure which her farm dress had mercifully hidden gray discovered that mas body alas bore a quaint resemblance in outline to a gourd a tiny black bonnet with a wide surcingle of ribbon tied under her chin was ornamented with a sort of centerpiece built of rigid artificial fruit and flowers her hair in brave defiance of current styles was rolled into a high pompadour beneath that pompadour however her face was aglow with interest and her eyes gleamed almost as brightly as did the brandnew lavalliere and the bar pin with its huge sixcarat center diamond if the mothers appearance was unusual the daughters was startling what with her size and the barbaric latitude of color she had indulged herself in alleghenys getup screamed in the general store at cisco whence it had originated it had doubtless been considered a sport costume for there was a skirt of huge blue and white checks a crepe waist of burnt orange and over that a vegetablesilk sweater with the broadest greenest stripes gray had ever seen a violent offensive green it was and the sweater was too tight her hat was large and floppy and adorned with preposterous purple blooms one of her hands was gloved but upon the other she wore her splendid solitaire she shone it as a watchman shines his flashlight they were enough to daunt a stronger man than calvin gray these two he could well imagine the sensation he and they would create in the lobby of the modish ajax but his first surprise was succeeded by a gentle pity for ma briskow greeted him rapturously and in alleghenys somber eyes he detected a look of mingled suffering and defiance she knew somehow or other that she was conspicuous grotesque and her soul was in agony at the knowledge before he had spoken a half dozen words to her gray realized that this girl was in torture and that it had required a magnificent courage on her part to meet him as bravely as she did he was ashamed of himself amusement at their expense did him no credit and he determined to relieve her pain and to help her attain the likeness of other women if it was in his power to do so it was a tribute to his inherent chivalry that he rose to the occasion and welcomed the women with a cordiality that warmed their hearts enthusiastically he took charge of mas lunch basket against allies muttered protest he despoiled her of her bilious nearleather suitcase he complimented them upon their appearance and showed such pleasure at seeing them again that they surrendered gratefully to him by the time he had them in a taxicab they were as talkative as a pair of magpies of course they had to know all about the holdup and his manner of telling the story made them feel that they had played an important part in it arrived at the hotel he swept them along with him so swiftly that they had no time in which to become dismayed or selfconscious and finally he deposited them in their rooms quite out of breath and quite delighted he left them palpitating with excitement at the wonders he proposed unfolding for them on the morrow allie answered his phone call about eight oclock the next morning ready for breakfast he inquired why we et at daylight she told him in some astonishment i been ridin since then indeed putting roses in your cheeks eh with whom did you go oh one of the elevator men b but gray sputtered deeply shocked why miss briskow theyre negroes riding with a nigger my heavens where did you go nowhere just up and down it was a moment before the man could speak then he said in a queerly repressed voice that is quite different ill run down and get a bite and join you in no time seems awful funny not to have any housework to do in the morning ma briskow confessed as they left the ajax a hotel would spoil me in no time i couldnt keep her from makin up the beds allie announced gray took the elder womans hand in his and scolded her gently smilingly he lectured her on the art of doing nothing and voiced some elemental truths about living mr briskow has but one idea and that is to surround you two and buddy with the advantages and luxuries you have been denied he reminded her you owe it to him to get the most out of your money and you mustnt begin by making hotel beds and robbing some poor woman of her livelihood not one person in ten really knows how to live for it isnt an easy task and the saddest thing about the newly rich is that they wont learn they refuse to enjoy their wealth i propose to help you good people get started if youll permit me it is not with contrition but with pride that i recommend myself to you as one of the greatest living authorities upon extravagance idleness and the minor vices of the prosperous the mother nodded a bit vaguely thats kind of like pa talks he sent you this and says to tell you its our first spendin spree and act accordin from her pocket she drew a folded check made out in blank to calvin gray and signed by gus briskow so i assume that im to pay the bills very well the sky is the limit eh thats it of course i dont need anything for myself this dress and bunnit are good enough but allies got to have new fixins from the inside out i spose her thingsll eat up the best part of a hundred dollars wont they the speakers look of worried inquiry bespoke a lifetime of habitual economy were not going to buy what you need but what you want youre going to have just as many pretty things as allie ma was panicstricken at this suggestion when gray insisted she demurred when he told her that one nice dress would cost at least a hundred dollars she confessed why i dont spose all the clos ive had since i was married cost much more n that ill spend at least a thousand on you before noon he laughed mrs briskow gasped she rolled her eyes and fanned herself she appealed to allegheny but it was evident that the latter had kept her eyes open and had done some thinking for she broke out passionately you make me sick ma itll take all pa can afford and then some to make us look like other people i never knew how plumb ridiclous we are till not that gray protested you know were ridiclous she cried fiercely were a couple of sows ears and all pas royalties cant make us into silk purses but mebbe we can manage to look like silk if we spend enough gray determined that the girl should not be disappointed if he could help it so he went directly to the head saleswoman of the first store and asked her to assume the role of counselor where circumstance compelled him to relinquish it explaining that in addition to hats gowns shoes and the like both ma and allie needed a variety of confidential apparel with which he had only the vaguest acquaintance although the woman agreed to his request he found before long that his trust in her had been misplaced not only did she threaten to take advantage of her customers ignorance but also to grays anger she displayed a poorly veiled contempt for and amusement at his charges allegheny was not long in feeling this she had entered the establishment aquiver with hope and anticipation this was her great adventure she was like a timid child enraptured at sight of its first tinseled christmas tree to have that ecstacy spoiled to see the girls tenderest sensibilities wounded by a haughty clerk enraged the man who played santa claus abruptly he resumed charge of the briskow purchases and it gave him a pang to note how allegheny ran to him with her hurt as it were but matters did not progress as well as he had expected allies disappointment at the death of her dream she hid under an assumption of indifference she merely pawed over the pretty things shown her and pretended to ignore the ridicule she and her mother excited but her face was stony her eyes were hopeless miserable for once in his life calvin gray was at a loss and knowledge of that fact caused him to chew savagely at his cigar to his bewildered companions he remained enthusiastic effervescent but behind their backs he glowered at the wellgroomed customers and cursed the snickering models who paraded their wares engaged thus he became aware of a stranger who looked on at the pitiful little comedy without amusement she was a pretty thing gray stared at her openly and his scowl vanished when she moved away he made a sudden decision excused himself and followed her he was gratified at the manner in which she accepted his breathless apology for speaking to her at the poise with which she listened while he made himself and his companions known to her and explained the plight in which he found himself you can save the reason of a distracted man and add to the happiness of two poor bewildered women if you will he concluded earnestly it isnt a funny situation its tragic what do you wish me to do the girl inquired its a lot to ask i know but wont you help them buy the things they need and save them from further humiliation at the hands of these highbrow clerks and lowbrow customers i i want to punch somebody in the nose i was sure you did that is what attracted my attention you are a person of taste if you will pardon a perfectly obvious compliment from a total stranger and they need such a womans guidance but they need even more a little bit of feminine tact and sympathy look he showed gus briskows blank check the whole store is theirs if they wish it think what that ought to mean to two poor starved creatures who have never owned enough clothing to wad a shotgun the girl is stunning all she needs is the right sort of things impulsively gray seized the speakers hand i knew it he cried i can choose gowns for her but how can i tell her the sort of well corsets she ought to wear how can i select for her things a bachelor is presumed to know nothing about havent you an hour or two in which to play fairy godmother i have all day the young woman confessed i merely came in to yearn over the pretty things o messenger from heaven he cried more hopefully would it appear presumptuous if i asked you in return for this favor to select the very prettiest gown in this shop for your very own the offer was refused pleasantly but firmly id be paid ten times over by the fun of spending oodles of money even if it were not my own but would they consent to have a stranger if you will permit a tiny deceit im sure they will i shall burden my conscience with a white lie and pretend that you are a friend to whose judgment i have appealed my poor conscience is scandalously overburdened but that girl is suffering i thought they must have struck oil ive seen others like them without further ado gray hurried his new acquaintance back to the dress department then in his easiest manner introduced her to the briskows she flashed him a look of amusement as he glibly made her known as miss good he had invited miss good to join their picnic immediately upon hearing that ma and allie were coming to dallas and she had been overjoyed miss good as they could see possessed unerring good taste but what was more she had a real genius for finding bargains as a bargain hunter miss good was positively unique ma briskow pricked up her ears at this soon she and the newcomer had their heads together and within a few minutes gray realized that his experiment was a success the stranger possessed enthusiasm but it was coupled with common sense and before her sunshiny smile even alleghenys sullen distrust slowly began to thaw she drew gray aside finally and said its all right theyre perfect dears and now the best thing you can do is to take yourself off he agreed promptly but cautioned her against economy that bargainhunting remark was only a bait remember gus briskow wants them to have everything and be everything they should be regardless of expense why both he and i would like nothing better than to have allegheny look like you if that were possible miss good eyed the speaker curiously who are you she inquired what are these nesters to you i am nobody they were kind to me and im interested in their future are you a fortune hunter mr gray i am grays face instantly lighted i am the most conscienceless fortune hunter you ever met but i am hunting my own fortune not allie briskows you neednt laugh shes very unusual and but i dare say you wouldnt tell me anyhow if i have excited your curiosity i am delighted gray declared please let me return at lunch time and gratify it i promise to talk upon that subject which every man can discuss to best advantage himself and i pledge myself not to ask one single question about you miss good not one he bowed ceremoniously over her hand although as you can imagine im dying to ask a thousand chapter viii the luncheon hour was long in arriving and when it did come around calvin gray regretted that he had elected to play a game of makebelieve with miss good for she rigidly held him to his promise and however adroitly he undertook to ascertain who or what she was she foiled him it gave her a mischievous pleasure to evade his carefully laid conversational traps and what little he learned came from ma briskow briefly it amounted to this miss good was what the elder woman called home folks but she had been schooled in the east moreover she was in the oil business this last bit of intelligence naturally intrigued the man and he undertook to gain further illumination but only to have the girl pretend that he knew all about it he accepted this checkmate with the best possible grace but revenged himself by assuming the airs and privileges of a friend more intimate even than miss good had implied a pretense that confused and even annoyed her for some reason this counterfeit pleased him it was extremely agreeable even to pretend a close acquaintance with this girl the luncheon went off gaily enough then gray was again banished with instructions to return at closing time you took a mean a malicious advantage of an offer intended only to spare your feelings and you havent any he told miss good when they had a chance for a word alone i have no feelings none or youd see that im perishing of curiosity she shook her head and her blue eyes laughed at him provokingly curiosity is fatal only to cats it is good for people i shall find out all about you how by crossexamining the briskows perhaps but theyre waiting to have you tell them what you know ive seen to that if they ask any questions ill invent a story ill act confused selfconscious ill make them think you are a much dearer friend than i have pretended so far dearer even than i can hope you ever will be that wouldnt be fair there are occasions when everything is fair perhaps these store people know something nothing whatever then for heavens sake release me from my pledge gray spoke desperately when i return permit me to ask those thousand questions and what others occur to me wont you the girl pondered this request briefly then smiled very well if you are still curious when you see me ill tell you who i am a bargain ill be back early more seriously gray declared i must tell you right now how perfectly splendid i think you are you have completely renewed my belief in human kindness and im sure your name must be miss good but a disappointment awaited calvin gray when late that afternoon he returned to the store miss good had gone at first he refused to believe ma briskows statement but it was true she had disappeared as quietly and as unobtrusively as she had appeared and what was more annoying she had left no word whatever for him this was practical joking for a certainty and gray told himself that he abhorred practical jokes it was a jolt to his pride to have his attentions thus ignored but what irked him most was the fact that he was stopped by reason of his deceit from making any direct inquiries that might lead to a further acquaintance with the girl mrs briskow however was in no condition either to note his dismay or to volunteer information upon any except one subject to wit corns human hearts were of less concern to her for the time being than human feet and hers were killing her she began a recital of her sufferings as intimate as agonizing and as confidential as if gray were a practicing chiropodist what she had to say about tight shoes was bitter in the extreme she voiced a gloomy conviction that the alarming increase in suicides was due to bunions the good woman confessed that she dearly loved finery and had bought right and left with reckless extravagance but all the merchandise in this department store was not worth the anguish she had endured this day with her stiff little bonnet tilted carelessly over her wrinkled forehead she declared emphatically that she would gladly swap all her purchases at this moment for a tub of hot water where is allie gray inquired lord knows shes someres around bein worked over by a couple of women gettin her hair washed an her finger nails cured an i dunno what not mercy me the things miss good had em do to her an the money weve spent allies gone hog wild the complaint ended in a stifled moan induced perhaps by some darting pain then without further ado ma briskow unbuttoned one shoe and removed it whew she leaned back in her chair wiggled her stockinged toes and feebly fanned herself but wait till you see her i cant scarcely reconize my own flesh an blood i never seen such a change in a human person gray pretended to listen as the good woman babbled on but he was thinking about the girl who had disappeared he was surprised at the keenness of his chagrin he had seen miss good but a short time and she had made no effort whatever to excite his interest nevertheless she remained a tantalizingly vivid picture in his mind it was extraordinary so engrossed was he in his thoughts that he did not notice allegheny briskow until she stood close beside him then indeed he experienced a shock for it was difficult to recognize in this handsome modish young woman the awkward illdressed country girl he had seen at noon allie was positively stunning she was completely transformed from the soles of her wellshod feet to the tip of her french coiffure and what was more astonishing she had lost much of her selfconsciousness and carried herself with a native grace that became her well why allie gray exclaimed youre wonderful let me see you he stood off and gazed at her while she revolved before him sakes alive whod ever spose youd look like that the mother exclaimed miss good told me id look nice but i didnt believe her do i youre wonderful allie gray said it with conviction honest you aint laughin at me the amazons voice quavered cant you see look at yourself im proud of you i she said allegheny twisted her hands she cast an appealing glance at her mother but the latter was staring at her in open amazement slowly nodding her head and clucking tse tse tse it was an approving cluck and it had a peculiar effect upon the girl alleghenys tears started she turned suddenly and hid her face in her hands gray crossed quickly to her side saying there weve overdone it the first day and youre tired i aint tired his sympathy brought audible sobs the girls shoulders began to heave well i am the mother complained im wore to the bone allie you dry up an stop that snivelin so we kin go home and i kin let my feet swell an scream youre not too tired i hope to have dinner with allie and me in the big dining room at the ajax gray said gayly youll be all right after an hours rest and i want to show her off if her nose isnt too red i aint seen that girl cry in ten years ma declared in mingled wonderment and irritation why she didnt cry when number one blowed in allie spoke between her sobs there wasnt nothin to cry for then but miss good said i id look jest as purty as other folks when i got fixed up an he says i do gray decided that all women are vain nevertheless it surprised him to discover the trait so early in allegheny briskow it was on the second day thereafter that gus briskow appeared at the hotel he came unexpectedly and he still wore his rough ranch clothes after an hour or more spent with his wife and daughter he went down to grays room and thanked him for the assistance he had rendered the two women followed a few moments of desultory conversation then he put an abrupt question mr gray youre a rich man aint you i am so considered umm dunnos im glad or sorry indeed what difference can it make to you a lot its like this my boy buddy has took a turrible shine to you an he cant talk about nothin else i was sort of hopin yes buddys ignerunt he can read an write an figger some but hes got about the same company manners as a steer an hes skeered of crowds when he sees strangers hes liable to charge em or else throw up his head an his tail an run plumb over a cliff hed ought to go to school but he says hes too big an hed have to set with a lot of little children him an allies alike that way it rars em up on their hind feet to be laughed at get a tutor for them a what when gray had explained the meaning of the word mr briskows face cleared thats what i figgered on but i didnt know what you called em thats why im sorry youre so well off y see id of paid you anything id of doubled whatever youre gettin the speaker raised a hopeful gaze he paused as if to make sure that his hearer was beyond temptation i thought mebbe him and youd like to travel some go to furrin places see the hull world i kin afford it thank you for the compliment but i got some big deals on an buddys got to learn enough sos to hang onto whats comin to him an allie he needs a man like you to learn him an be an example it would be a payin job mister gray it was in a voice graver than usual that the younger man spoke briskow youre sensible enough to understand plain talk im not a fit man to teach buddy what he ought to know in fact im about the worst person you could select how so because im a good deal of a rotter i couldnt permit buddy to make a mess of his life such as ive made of mine the father sighed i spose you know but well im disappinted but it wasnt hully on that account i come to dallas ma told me over the telephone how nice you been an what you done for her n allie so i says to myself ill square things by givin him a chance to make some money gray stirred slightly in his chair and regarded the speaker more keenly when oil come in at ranger nobody thought it would get out our way but ma had a dream a lot of dreams about oil on our farm so i got an outfit to come there an drill folks thought we was crazy and we didnt expect theyd find much ourselves a few barl a day would of looked big but i allus had ambitions to be good an rich so i got options on quite a bit of acreage it didnt take no money at the time cause land was what people had most of along with the rest theres a hundred an sixty right next to ours hill stuff that wouldnt feed a goat its wuth a lot of money now but the options most run out when does it expire saturday thats tomorrow gus briskow nodded its cheap at a thousand dollars an acre an it costs two hundred of course youll take it nope why not per one thing i got a lot of other land just as good an mebbe better an i been takin it up out of the royalties that come in we got enough sure money in sight to do us but i promised ma to play safe an we cant take everything you kin have that option mister gray for nothin you kin sell the lease inside of a week an make fifty thousand dollars or you kin hold it an make mebbe a million all itll cost you is thirtytwo thousand dollars i dont make a cent out of it thirtytwo thousand dollars not much is it it aint nothin to a man like you gray nodded and smiled queerly as he thanked the nester then from his pockets he removed several crumpled wads of currency and a handful of silver these he counted before saying what capital i have is entirely liquid its all in cash there is eightyseven dollars and fortythree cents it is every dollar in the world that i possess huh gus briskows bright eyes searched the smiling countenance before him youre jokin i thought you said you was rich i am rich i dont owe a nickel and wont until my hotel bill is due day after tomorrow im in full possession of all my faculties im perfectly healthy and cheerful i know men who would pay a million dollars for my health alone and another million to enjoy my frame of mind thats two million well doggone me there was a pause then the speaker brightened mebbe youll take buddy after all you kin set your own wages gray shook his head there are two good reasons why i couldnt accept even if i wished ive told you one im too fond of you briskows to risk ruining buddy whats the other one a purely personal reason i have a definite something to do here in texas before i can accomplish it i shall have to make a lot of money but that i shall do easily i make money rapidly when i start you gotta git goin afore long briskow allowed his eyes to rove about the spacious governors suite specially with only eightyseven forty that is nearly eightyseven dollars more than i had when i arrived three weeks ago i was an utter stranger here today i know everybody worth knowing in a business way and some of them are my friends if you could learn buddy to make friends like that but gray raised his hand i derive a certain amusement from my own peculiar characteristics and capabilities but i should detest them in another well you sure need money and i kin hep you out thank you but i shant borrow if the time were not so short i could probably turn this lease you so kindly offered me but something else will happen along briskow sighed i could of sold it myself thought i had it sold to a bunch from wichita but they tricked me i offered it the day you was at our house for eighty thousand and nelson more n half agreed to who briskow looked up at the tone of this inquiry one of the fellers from wichita falls i spose he knowed the option was about run out anyhow hes been holdin me off from day to day till its too late now fer me to what is his name gray broke in sharply names nelson bell nelsons son bells hardboiled but henry nelson thats him gray rose from his chair and strode swiftly to the window he stood there staring down into the street for a moment before saying curtly go on you know them nelsons i know henry hes hardboilder n his old man they got a lot o money behind em too much money to act like he done with me i sure hate to see him git that evans lease for next to nothin after the way he done id call it cheatin but well i cant hanle it the man at the window wheeled suddenly and his face was white his brows were drawn down by god he cried tensely he wont get it wheres that option i got it right here briskow handed over a paper an i got the hull title abstrack too had it all ready for nelson when he had swiftly scanned the document gray said this deal means little to you briskow but it means much to me and ill make it worth something to both of us at first i thought the time was too short but i work best when i work fast youve had your chance and failed now then step aside and let a man run who knows how mr roswell president of the bank where gray had first made himself known was a shrewd forceful man who had attained a position in business and arrived at a time of life when he could well afford to indulge his likes and his dislikes those likes and dislikes were strong for his was a positive character as is the case with most successful men who pride themselves upon their cold caution and business acumen and mr roswell did so pride himself he really was a person of impulse and intuition played a much larger part in his conduct of affairs than he would have acknowledged such people make mistakes but they also make friends occasionally they read character wrong but they inspire loyalty and big institutions are founded upon friendship and loyalty as well as upon stability and fair dealing roswell had liked gray upon their first meeting and that liking had deepened owing to that fact he had neglected to secure a report upon him assuring himself that there was always time for such formalities he was cordial today when gray strode into his office bringing gus briskow with him the banker listened with interest to what he was told then he studied the map that briskow spread upon his desk showing the location of his own and other nearby wells that looks like a sure thing roswell said finally as sure as anything in oil can be what is on your mind id like to get the opinion of the banks oil expert gray told him this was a matter easily disposed of the expert was summoned and he rendered a prompt opinion he knew the property he considered it a cheap lease at a thousand dollars an acre it was proven stuff and within thirty days it would probably treble in value when he had gone the banker smiled well gray said he i knew youd land something good youre a hustler youll make a fortune out of that land gray handed him gus briskows option and the assignment thereof the ink upon which was scarcely dry theres the joker it expires tomorrow night and it will go to the nelsons theyve doublecrossed mr briskow then dont let them get away with it take it yourself it is now three oclock and this is the golfing season in new york gray told him i couldnt reach my associates and get any action before monday no funds of your own available not enough at such short notice well that lease is worth one hundred and sixty thousand dollars isnt it the banker nodded im going to sell it before six oclock for eighty thousand i know people here who will take it but ive come first to you get together a little syndicate right here in the bank and buy it ill agree to take it off your hands within thirty days at one hundred and sixty thousand dollars in other words it is worth to me eighty thousand dollars to have you carry it for a month is your guaranty any good that is for you to determine assume that it is not and ill better my first offer ill undertake to sell off the land in twenties right here in dallas double your money and divide the profits thereafter with you it is a safe speculation and a quick one you know i can put it through mr roswell considered briefly before replying theres no use denying that weve made money on deals like this everybody has so its nothing new theres a big play on ranger stuff and we couldnt lose but i know nothing about you except the little youve told me when i go into a deal i put my trust more in the man than the proposition and i trust my own judgment of human character more than that of strangers gray said quickly so do you thirty days is a long time with me and the oil business is just my speed permit me to remind you that time is flying and that i have given myself only three hours in which to turn this property i intend to beat nelson and apply that beating on account of an old score this is more than a mere business deal i like your energy the banker confessed and im inclined to bet some of my own money on you now he pushed a button on his desk lets see if there are any others here who feel as i do it was early evening when gus briskow returned to his wifes and his daughters rooms at the ajax he slipped in quietly and sank into a chair mercy me i thought you was run over ma briskow exclaimed i feel like i was the nester declared with a grin say mister gray sold the evans lease an we got more money than ever then mebbe you can afford a new suit allie told him you look like sin her father nodded but his mind was full of the incidents of that afternoon and he began at once to recount them he told the story badly but in a language that the women understood he had not gone far however when the girl interrupted him to exclaim wait why pa you mean to say mister gray aint got no money he had less n a hundred dollars an him livin here like a king with everybody bowin an scrapin ignoring the effect upon allie of this intelligence he continued his recital all i done was set around while him an them bank people talked it over he said finally then they got their lawyer in an he examined the title papers seemed like hed never git through but he did an they signed some things an we come out an mister gray told me id made fortyeight thousand dollars goodness me ma briskows eyes widened why that evans place aint wuth the taxes its more n likely wuth a million but think him tellin me id made fortyeight thousand dollars it give me a jolt an i says i didnt make it i told him id fell down an turned the hull thing over to him its you thats made fortyeight thousand i says what allie inquired sharply then when her father had repeated himself she asked with even greater intensity whad he say to that he didnt take it did he he laughed kinda queer an says all i got to do to give him a good nights rest is to wire henry nelson the deals closed an him with less n a hundred dollars allie spoke again in great relief lord you give me a turn her expression altered her lips parted in a slow smile so hes pore eh pore as we was well i declare she rose and turned her back upon her father no he aint pore briskow said irritably not now he aint i says its his deal an his money an we got plenty an i stuck to it allie wheeled suddenly at this announcement she uttered a cry of protest then what are you talkin about she roughly demanded we had some argyment an i got kinda riled finally he says if i feel that way well go pardners he wouldnt listen to nothin else an thats how it stands he made twentyfour thousand an i you you fool gus briskow looked up with a start to find his daughter standing over him her face ablaze her deep bosom heaving he stared at her in frank amazement doubting his senses never had allegheny used toward him a word a tone like this never had he seen her look as she did at this moment he could not believe his eyes for the girl had become a scowling fury and she seemed upon the verge of destroying him with her strong hands a task she was amply able to accomplish allieallie the mother gasped she too was aghast you youre talkin to your pa you give him twentyfour thousan dollars give it to him whad you do it for whad you allies voice failed her completely she groped at her throat uttering unintelligible animallike sounds why allie youre mad and after all he done for me an you mrs briskow cried accusingly you oughter be ashamed sure didnt he make us twentyfour thousan dollars where we wouldnt of got nothin an us rich as we are an him broke im supprised at you a harsh exclamation burst from the girl to the astonished parents it sounded like an oath but it could not have been then she swung herself heavily about and rushed blindly into the next room slamming the stout metal door behind her with a crash that threatened to unhinge it well i be darned gus briskow turned a slack empty face upon the partner of his joys i i never sposed that girl would turn out greedy the mothers countenance slowly wrinkled into lines of grief and worry she wrung her hands and rocked from side to side i dunno whats come over the child she moaned tearfully she behaves so queer over them silk stockins an corsets an lingeries an things that she skeers me sometimes im afeerd shes goin crazy or something chapter ix no industry can boast a history more dramatic more exciting than that of oil from the discovery of petroleum on through the development of its usefulness and the vast expansion of its production the story is one of intense human interest and not even the story of mining has chapters more stirring or more spectacular the average man has never stopped to consider how close he is to the oil business or how dependent he is upon it from babyhood when his nose is greased with vaseline to the occasion when a motor hearse carries him on his last journey there is not often a day when he fails to make use of mineral oil or some of its byproducts ocean liners and farmers plows are driven by it it takes the rich man to his office and it cleans the shopgirls gloves it gives us dominion over the air and beneath the waters of the sea we live in a mechanical age and without oil our bearings would run hot and civilization as we know it would stop it is the very blood of the earth oil production is a highly specialized industry and it has developed a type of man with a type of mind quite as characteristic as the type of machinery employed in the drilling of wells the latter for instance appears at first glance to be crude and awkward but as a matter of fact it is amazingly ingenious and extremely efficient and your oilfield operator is pretty much the same nor is there any business in which practical experience is more valuable as a result most of the big oil men especially those engaged in production are graduates of the school of hard knocks they are bigfisted harshhanded fellows who are as thoroughly at home on the thribble board of a derrick as at a desk or a directors table and they are quite as colorful as the oil fields themselves their lives are full and vigorous of all the oil excitements that which occurred in north texas was perhaps the most remarkable at any rate the world has never witnessed such scenes as were enacted there the california gold rush the great alaskan stampede the diamond frenzies of south africa and of australia all were epic in their way but none bred a wilder insanity than did the discovery of oil in the red river district for one thing the time was ripe and conditions were propitious for the staging of an unprecedented drama the enormous wastage of a worlds war resulting in a cry for more production a new level of high prices for crude rumors of an alarming shortage of supply the success of independent producers large and small all these and other reasons too caused many people hitherto uninterested to turn their serious attention to petroleum the country was prosperous banks were bulging with money pockets were stuffed with profits poor men had the means with which to gamble and rich men were looking for quicker gains inasmuch as the world had lived for four years upon a steady diet of excitement it was indeed the psychological moment for a spectacular boom the strike at ranger lit the fuse the explosion came with the first gush of inflammable liquid from the fowler farm at burkburnett then indeed a conflagration occurred the comprehensive story of which can never be written owing to the fact that no human mind could follow the swift events of the next few tumultuous months no brain could record it chaos came life in the oil fields became a phantasmagoria of ceaseless action and excitement a fantastic stereopticon that changed hourly burk was a sleepy little town dozing amid parched wheat fields the paint was off it nothing much more exciting than a crop failure ever happened there the main topic of conversation was the weather and as mark twain said everybody talked about it but nothing was done within sixty days this soporific village became a roaring bedlam every town lot was leased derricks rose out of chicken runs boilers panted in front yards mobs of strangers surged through the streets and the air grew shrill with their bickerings from a distance the sky line of the town looked like a thick nest of lattice battle masts and at night it blazed like coney island the blacklime territory farther south had proven too expensive for individual operators and small companies to handle but here the oil was closer to the surface and the ground was easily drilled hence it quickly became known as a poor mans pool then too experienced oil men and the large companies who had seen townsite booms in other states kept away surrendering the place to tenderfeet and to promoters of these thousands came and never was there a harvest so ripe for their gleaning naturally a little country town like this could not hold the newcomers therefore wichita falls became their headquarters here there were at least a few hotels and some sort of office quarters sheds beneath which the shearing could take place and there the herd assembled of course the cougars followed and oh the easy pickings for them a fresh kill daily warm meat with every meal such hunting they had never known hence they gorged themselves openly seldom quarreling among themselves nor even bothering to conceal the carcasses of their prey it was easier to pull down a new victim than to return to the one of the day before rooming houses slept their guests in relays canvas dormitories sprang up on vacant lots the lobbies of the hotels were packed with shouldering maniacs until they resembled wheat pits the streets were clogged with motor cars and the sidewalks were jammed like subway platforms store fronts were knocked out and the floor space was railed off into rows of tiny bullpen brokers offices and in these companies by the hundred were promoted stock in them was sold on the sidewalks by ballyhoo men with megaphone voices it seldom required more than a few hours to dispose of an entire issue for this was a credulous and an elated mob and its daily fare was exaggeration stock exchanges were opened up where amid frenzied shoutings went on a feverish commerce in wildcat securities shopgirls matrons housemaids gambled in shares quite as wildly as did the unkempt disreputables from the oil fields or the newcomers spilled out of every train people trafficked not in oil but in stocks and in leases the values of which were entirely chimerical but this speculative frenzy was by no means local burkburnett became a name to conjure with and there was no lack of conjurers these latter spread to the four points of the compass and the printing presses ran hot to meet their demands a flood of money flowed into their pockets while this boom was at its height a new pool vaster and richer was penetrated and the world heard of the northwest extension of the burkburnett field a veritable lake an ocean of oil then a wilder madness reigned daily came reports of new wells in the extension with a flush production running up into the thousands of barrels there appeared to be no limit to the size of this deposit and now the oldline operators who had shunned the townsite boom bid feverishly against the promoters and the tenderfeet for acreage farms and ranches previously all but worthless were cut up into small tracts and drilling sites and these were sold for unheardof prices up leaped another forest of skeleton towers some ten miles long and half as wide but this was the open range with nothing except the sky for shelter so towns were knocked together queer greasy ramshackle settlements of flimsy shacks and so quickly were they built that they outran the law which is ever deliberate the camps of the blacklime district which had been considered hell holes were in reality models of order compared with these mushroom cities of raw boards tar paper and tin gambling joints dance halls and dens more vicious flourished openly and around them gathered the scum and the flotsam that crests a rising tide winter brought the rains and existence in the new fields became an ugly and a troublesome thing roads there were none and supplies became difficult to secure the surface of the land melted and spinning wheels churned it traffic halted vehicles sank horses drowned between rains the sun dried the mud the wind whirled it into suffocating clouds sandstorms swept over the miserable inhabitants tornadoes thick with a burden of cutting particles harried them until they cursed the fate that had brought them thither but in wichita falls where there was shelter overhead and pavements underfoot the sheep shearing proceeded gayly of the men engaged in this shearing business none perhaps had gathered more wool in the same length of time than the two members of the firm of mcwade stoner mr billy mcwade junior partner was a man of wide experience and some accomplishments but until his arrival at wichita falls he had never made a conspicuous success of any business enterprise the unforeseen invariably had intervened to prevent a killing either a pal had squealed or the postal authorities had investigated or a horse had fallen anyhow whenever victory had perched upon his banner something always had happened to frighten the bird before its wings were fairly folded mr mcwade had finally determined to wipe off the slate and commence all over accordingly he had selected a new field and in order to make it a real standing start he had likewise chosen a new name he had arrived at wichita falls with one suit of clothes and nothing more except an assortment of contusions ranging in color from angry red to blackandblue these same being the direct result of repeated altercations with roughshod members of a train crew these collisions mcwade had not sought on the contrary when for instance outside the yards at fort worth his unobtrusive presence on the blind baggage had been discovered he had done his best to avoid trouble he had explained earnestly that he simply must leave the city by that particular train the circumstances were such that no other train would do at all so he declared when he had been booted off he swung under and rode the trucks to the next stop there a man with a lantern had searched him out much as a nigger shines the eyes of a possum and had dragged him forth he was dragged forth at the second stop and again at the third finally the train was halted far out on a lonely prairie and a large brakeman with gold teeth and corns on his palms held a knee upon mr mcwades chest until the train started ignoring the hoarse warning breathed into his dusty countenance along with the odor of young onions the traveler argued volubly but with no heat that it was vitally necessary to his affairs that he continue this journey without interruption then when the brakeman rose and raced after the departing train he sprang to his feet and outran him mcwade was lithe and nervous and fleet he managed to swing under the last pullman at the same instant his captor reached its rear platform it is probable that a blithe determination even such as this would have eventually succumbed to repeated discouragements but at the next stop a watering tank aid came from an unexpected quarter from the roof of the car another knight of the road signaled and thither mcwade clambered kicking off the clutching hand of his former enemy the second traveler was a robust man deliberate but sure of movement and his pockets were filled with nuts and bolts this ammunition he divided with his companion and such was their unerring aim that they maintained their sanctuary for the remainder of the journey on the way in to wichita falls the stranger introduced himself as brick stoner he was a practical oil man a driller and a sort of promoter too it was his last pro motion he confided that had made it necessary for him to travel in this fashion he had many practical ideas had mr stoner as for instance the use to be made of a stick with a crook in it or a lath with a nail in the end armed thus he declared it was possible for a man on the roof of a sleeping car to pick up a completely new wardrobe in the course of a nights ride provided the upper berths were occupied and the ventilators were open mr stoner deeply regretted the lack of such a simple aid but agreed that it was better to leave well enough alone mcwade warmed to his traveling companion and they talked of many things such as money and finance sudden riches and ways and means this led them back naturally to a discussion of stoners latest promotion he called it the lost bull well and the circumstances connected therewith he related with a subtlety of humor rare in a man of his sorts the nature of the story appealed keenly to mcwade and it ran like this stoner had been working in the louisiana gas fields near the scene of a railroad accident three bulls had strayed upon the right of way with results disastrous to a freight train and fatal to themselves after the wreckage had been cleared away the claim agent settled with the owner of the bulls and the carcasses were buried in an adjoining field this had occurred some time prior to stoners arrival in fact it was only by chance that he heard of it one day in passing the spot stoner noticed a slight depression in the ground filled with water through which occasional bubbles of gas rose being of an inquisitive turn of mind he had amused himself with some experiments and found that the gas was inflammable moreover it gave off an odor not unlike that of natural gas it was a phenomenon of decomposition new to the driller and it gave him a great idea he went to town and very cautiously told of his discovery a gas seepage with traces of oil his story caused a sensation and he led several of the wealthiest citizens to the spot then watched them in all gravity while they ignited the gas smelled it tasted the soil they were convinced they appointed stoner their agent to buy the farm under cover which he did at a nice profit to himself this profit he spent in riotous living while a rig was being moved upon the ground not until the derrick was up and the crew in the presence of the excited stockholders came to spud in was the true source of that gas discovered then the enterprise assumed such a bad odor that bystanders fled and mr stoner was forced to leave the state without his baggage this had been the nature of mcwades and stoners meeting on the roof of that swaying pullman they laid the corner stone of their partnership arrived at wichita falls stoner went into the field and mcwade obtained employment in a restaurant it was a position of trust for upon him developed the entire responsibility of removing the traces of food from the used dishes and drying them without a too great percentage of breakage it kept mcwade upon his feet but anyhow he could not sit with comfort and it enabled him in the course of a week to purchase a change of linen and to have his suit sponged and pressed this done he resigned and went to the leading bank where he opened an account by depositing a check drawn upon a chicago institution for fifty thousand dollars mcwade made it a practice always to have a few blank checks on hand airily but in all earnestness he invited the texas bank to verify the check at its convenience so many were the strangers in wichita falls so great the rush of new customers that the banks had no means of investigating their accounts except by wiring at their own expense this was saturday afternoon which gave mcwade two days of grace so he pocketed his new pass and check books then mingled with the crowd at the westland hotel he bought leases and drilling sites issuing local checks in payment thereof nobody could question the validity of those checks with the evidence of fifty thousand dollars deposited that very day and on sunday he sold them by the time the wichita falls bank opened its doors on monday morning he had turned his last lease and had made ten thousand dollars a few days later he and stoner incorporated their first company this was at the height of the townsite boom and within a few hours mcwade had sold the stock thereafter prosperity dogged the pair and before long they had made reputations for themselves as the only surefire wildcat promoters in town mcwade possessed the gift of sidewalk oratory stoner posed as the practical field man whose word upon prospects was final he it was who did the investigating the experting his partner was the ballyhoo but competition grew steadily keener other promoters followed their lead and it became necessary to introduce new and original methods of gathering an audience mere vocal persuasiveness did not serve to arrest the flow of pedestrians and so mcwades ingenuity was taxed but he was equal to the task seldom did he fail of ideas and once he had the attention of a crowd the rest was easy one morning he and his partner provided themselves with some dice and several hundred dollars in gold coin with these they began shooting craps on the sidewalk in front of their office now gambling was taboo hence the spectacle of two expensively dressed eminently prosperous men squatting upon their heels with a stack of double eagles before them caused a sensation and people halted to witness their impending arrest soon traffic was blocked the gamblers remained engrossed in their pastime as well they could having thoughtfully arranged the matter with the policeman on duty gravely they breathed upon the cubes earnestly they called upon little joe long liz ada and the rest silently they exchanged their stacks of gold pieces as they won or lost calvin gray but just arrived from dallas looked on at the game with some curiosity not divining its purpose until mcwade pocketed the dice then mounted a box at the curb and began loudly now gentlemen that is one way of making money but it is a foolish and a hazardous way there is a much saner safer method and im going to tell you about it dont pass on until you hear me for i have a most incredible story to relate and youll be sorry you missed it there was a ripple of appreciative laughter but the crowd pressed closer as the orator continued youve all heard about these doodlebugs who go around locating oil with a divining rod havent you and you dont believe in them of course you dont neither do i i cant put any trust in willow twigs but well all admit that there are forces of nature that we dont understand who can explain the principle of magnetic attraction for instance what causes the glowing splendor of the aurora borealis what force holds the compass needle to the north what makes a carpet tack jump onto a magnet like the speaker paused and stared hard at a member of his audience who had passed a humorous remark at his expense just like ill jump you stranger if you dont keep your trap closed i say who can read those secrets who can harness those forces the man who can has got the world by the tail and a downhill pull now then for the plot of my story and it will pay you to do a week of listening in the next five minutes awhile ago an eminent scientist unknown to me or to my partner mr stoner came into our office which is at your backs one flight up second door to the right and showed us an electrical device he has been working on for the last eight years he claimed he had it perfected and that it would indicate the presence of oil on the same principle that one mineral attracts another oil is a mineral said he and i think ive got its magnetic complement i believe my invention will work ill bet a thousand dollars it wont i told him but what do you think that pilgrim did he took me up then he bet stoner another thousand that id made a bad bet mcwade grinned in sympathy with the general amusement we arranged a thorough test we took him blindfolded through the field and believe me or not he called the turn on fortythree wells straight and never missed it once call it a miracle if you choose but it cost brick and me two thousand iron men and ive got ten thousand more that says he can do the trick for you ill let a committee of responsible citizens take a dozen fivegallon cans and fill one with oil and the rest with water and set them in a row behind a brick wall my ten or any part of it says his electric wiggle stick will point to the one with the oil what do you say to that heres a chance for a quick cleanup who cares to take me on from the edge of the crowd gray watched the effect of this offer divining rods he well knew were as old as the oil industry but he was surprised to see that fully half of this audience appeared to put faith in the claim and the other half were not entirely skeptical a man at his side began reciting an experience of his own mcwade now introduced the miracle worker himself and gray rose on tiptoe to see him a moment then he smiled widely for the eminent scientist was none other than mr mallow mallow a bit pallid and pasty as if from confinement and with eyes hidden behind dark goggles with a show of some embarrassment the inventor displayed his tester a sufficiently impressive device with rubber handles and a resistance coil attached to a dry battery which he carried in his pocket gray looked on as the comedy was played out it transpired that professor mallow had tested among other properties the newest mcwadestoner lease a company to drill which had just been formed under the title of the desert scorpion and he really judged from the behavior of his machine that a remarkable pool underlaid the tract he was willing to risk his reputation upon the guaranty that the first well would produce not less than three thousand barrels a day he was interested in the outcome only from a scientific standpoint he owned not one single share of stock then mcwade resumed his sway over the crowd and soon shares in the desert scorpion were selling rapidly shortly after lunch mallow and the two partners were seated in the office upstairs their work done for the day another successful promotion had gone to the credit of mcwade and stoner all three were in a triumphal mood mallow was recounting a story that had just come to his ears remember that old silver tip that took a stand in front of the owl drug store a few days back he called his company the star of hope stoner nodded he had a good piece of ground right adjoining the moon petroleum tract three wells down to the sand i wondered how he ever got hold of it he didnt thats the big laugh he didnt own that land at all he just had himself a map drawn with the numbers changed his ground was a mile away he sold his stock in two days thirtyfive thousand shares then he blew some coaloil john who had plunged for about three shares got to studying his own map found there was something wrong and let up a squawk but silver tip had faded like the mists of early morn thirtyfive stronger than he was snappy work eh mcwade frowned his disapproval something ought to be done to stop those crooks or theyll kill us legitimate promoters you cant sting a crowd too often in the same spot there came a knock at the door and in answer to an invitation to enter it opened the next instant both mcwade and stoner sat erect in their chairs with eyes alert and questioning for at sight of the stranger mallow had leaped to his feet with a smothered exclamation and now stood with his back to the desk and with his head outthrust in a peculiar attitude of strained intensity chapter x well well mallow the callers face broke into an engaging smile as he crossed the threshold still wearing dark glasses eh im afraid you didnt heed my instructions mallow spoke huskily what the hell you doing here following the excitement merely i shall open an office and spend a good deal of my time in wichita falls i hoped id find you here for this morning i heard you describe your invention and admiration overcame me i felt constrained to congratulate you upon your scientific attainments marvelous my dear doctor or is it professor mallow the speaker laughed heartily wont you introduce me to these let us say magnetic forces of nature that you have discovered he indicated the two partners what do you want mallow barked momentary agitation has robbed our professor of his habitual politeness a not unusual phenomenon of the preoccupied scientific mind these words were directed at mcwade and stoner my name is gray perhaps doctor mallow has made mention of me so youre the lad that threw pepper in his eyes brick stoner stared at the newcomer with undisguised interest he rose as did mcwade ill say weve heard of you your names getting as common as safetyrazor blades youve been cleaning up havent you umm moderately calvin gray shook hands with the promoters then to the agitated mallow who still peered at him apprehensively he said come come let down your hammer uncoil listen you the other burst forth i beat that thing out im clean and i dont intend to go back youre a strong guy and you got a bunch of kale and youre a getter but the taller they come the harder they fall you can be had the speaker was desperate his face was flushed with anger the tone of his voice was defiant and threatening gray helped himself to a chair crossed his legs and lit a cigar mcwade and stoner neither moved nor spoke my dear mallow you wrong me in the newcomers voice there was no longer any mockery i gave you credit for more intelligence we played our little farce and it is done the episode is closed so far as i am concerned i supposed you understood that much i helped you and i came here to enlist your help you helped me mallow showed his teeth in a snarl precisely think a moment was it not odd that i failed to appear against you that the case was never pressed the prosecution dropped i spose you were afraid to go through thought id get you gray shook his head impatiently afraid of you oh mallow had i feared your majestic wrath do you think i would have arranged for that doctor to see you every day and paid his bill who pray sent in those good things for you to eat there was a pause did you i did again there was silence why for one thing i was sorry for you i really was i had caused you and tony a great deal of suffering and i cannot bring myself to inflict actual suffering upon anyone without doing my best to alleviate it then again i had nothing against you personally we merely clashed in the course of business mallow allowed himself to sink back upon the desk he turned his dark goggles upon his friends in a blind stare of bewilderment well ill be damned he said finally mallow thought we had helped to spring him it was mcwade speaking thats why he beat it up here and thats how we happened to put him to work i dont get you yet the man in glasses muttered i cant understand why whats the odds why he done it stoner inquired sharply any man that can squirt my eyes full of tobasco and me with a six gun on him is all right and him with a bottle of milk duly made and provided the field member of the firm slapped his thigh and laughed loudly then to forget the whole fracas and shake hands on it thats handsome mr gray im here to say theres a lot of boys going to lay off you like you was a cactus the object of this commendation was pleased gratitude is rare he murmured i thank you now then i was thinking of making friend mallow a business proposition but perhaps i can interest you also in doing something for me ill pay well were live ones stoner asserted it is business of a confidential nature all the talking we do is on the street were promoting wildcats but i guess we know as much about the good wells as the big companies themselves and when it comes to actual drilling ive forgotten more than all these boll weevils will ever learn what can we do for you for one thing i wish to hire the brightest oil scout in the district but i dont want him nor anyone else for the time being to suspect that hes working for me i will double his salary to watch one operator perhaps he could appear to be in your employ furthermore i intend to do considerable secret buying and selling and i will need several dummies moral character unimportant all i insist upon is absolute loyalty and obedience to my orders during the silence that followed gray felt the three men staring at him curiously youre after big game i take it mcwade inquired mildly the biggest in these woods one man did you say one man some grudge perhaps perhaps a yacht is too expensive for most men but they dont burn money as fast as a grudge this one will take his last dollar or mine were a legitimate firm you know grays eyes twinkled as he exclaimed exactly if i have caused you to infer that i shall employ anything except legitimate means to effect my purpose it is my error at the same time my proposition is not one that i could well afford to take to the ordinary conservative type of broker now then how about you mallow would you care to work for me the latters pale face broke into a grin i am working for you he declared ive been on your pay roll now for five minutes whats more if itll save money to croak this certain party and be done with it why maybe that can be arranged too my new wiggle stick may not find oil every crack but i bet i can make it point to half a dozen men who gray lifted an admonitory hand patience it may come to something like that but i intend to break him first can i arrive at terms with you gentlemen write your own ticket mcwade declared and mr stoner echoed this statement with enthusiasm very well details later now i shall give myself the pleasure of calling upon my man and telling him exactly what i intend doing the speaker rose and shook hands with the three precious scoundrels when the door had closed behind him mcwade inquired now what do you make of that going to serve notice on his bird say hes the hardest guy i ever saw stoner declared admiringly mallow spoke last but he spoke with conviction you said it brick i had his number from the start hes a master crook and itll pay us all to string with him henry nelsons activities in the oil fields did not leave him much time in which to attend to his duties as vicepresident of his fathers bank for what success he and old bell nelson had had since the boom started was the direct result of the younger mans personal attention to their joint operations that attention was close their success already considerable promised to be enormous but of late things had not been going well the turn had come with the loss of the evans lease and that misfortune had been followed by others contrary to custom it was henry and not bell who had flown into a rage at receipt of gus briskows telegram announcing a slipup in the deal a sale to calvin gray that message in fact had affected the son in a most peculiar manner for days thereafter he had been nervous almost apprehensive and his nervousness had increased when he secured the back files of the dallas papers and read those issues which he had missed while out of town since that time he had made excuses to avoid trips into the ranger field and had conducted much of his work over the telephone perhaps for that reason it was that trouble with drilling crews had arisen and that one well had been jimmed perhaps that explained why a deal as good as closed had gotten away why a certain lease had cost fully double what it should have cost and why the sale of another tract had not gone through be that as it may it was this generally unsatisfactory state of affairs that accounted for the junior nelsons presence in wichita falls at this time he and bell had spent a stormy forenoon together he was in an irritable mood when early in the afternoon a card was brought into his office nelson could not restrain a start at sight of the name engraved thereon his impulse was to leap to his feet but the partition separating him from the bank lobby was of glass and he knew his every action to be visible he allowed himself a moment in which to collect his wits then he opened slightly the desk drawer in which he kept his revolver and gave instructions to admit the caller nelson revolved slowly in his chair he stared curiously at the newcomer and his voice was cold unfriendly as he said this is quite a surprise gray not wholly unexpected i hope entirely i knew you were in texas but i hardly expected you to present yourself here gray seated himself for a moment the two men eyed each other the one stony forbidding suspicious the other smiling suave apparently frank to what am i indebted for this honor nelson inquired with a lift of his lip my dear colonel would you expect me to come to wichita falls without paying my respects to my ranking officer my immediate superior bosh all that is over forgotten forgotten the callers brows arched incredulously you are a busy and a successful man the late war lives in your mind only as a disagreeable memory to be banished as quickly as possible but henry nelson stirred impatiently come come dont lets waste time but i retain distinct recollections of our great adventure and always shall that means i infer that you refuse to close the chapter as if he had not heard this last remark gray continued easily it is a selfish motive that brings me here i come to crow it is my peculiar weakness that i demand an audience for what i do i must share my triumphs with some one else they taste flat and since you are perhaps the one man in texas who knows me best or has the slightest interest in my doings it is natural that i come to you this guileless confession evoked a positive scowl what have you done the banker sneered except get your name in the papers i have made a large amount of money for one thing and i am having a glorious time now that evans lease for instance oh youve come to crow about that not loudly but a little i turned the greater part of that land for as much as five thousand dollars an acre odd that we should have come into competition with each other on my very first undertaking isnt it fascinating business this oil all one needs to succeed is experience and capital what do you know about the business nothing absolutely nothing but i am learning luck i find is a good substitute for experience and i certainly am lucky as for capital of course i was blessed in having unlimited money with which to operate you inferred as much i take it of course yes colonel i have the money touch and everything i have put my hand to has turned out well nelson burst forth in sudden irritation what are you getting at you know i dont care a damn what youre doing how much money youre making strange inasmuch as practically every dollar i have made has come out of you indirectly for a moment nelson said nothing then just what do you mean by that exactly what i said ive cut under you wherever possible when you wanted acreage i bid against you and ran the price up until you paid more than it was worth that which i secured i managed you so youre the one back of that nelsons amazement destroyed the insecure hold he had thus far maintained upon himself furiously he cried youre out to get me thats it eh i am indeed and half my satisfaction in doing so will be in knowing that you know what im up to one needs steady nerves and a sure touch in any speculative enterprise he darent wabble im going to get your nerve nelson im going to make you wabble youre going to think twice and doubt your own hunches and make mistakes and i i shall take advantage of them of course i shall do more than merely well by god i knew you had the gall of the devil but see here gray dont you understand what i can do to you i dont want any trouble with you but one word from me and of course you want no trouble with me but alas my dear colonel you are going to have it oh a great deal of trouble more trouble than you ever had in all your life either you are going broke or i am you see i have all the advantage in this little game for i will pay a dollar for every dollar i can cause you to lose and that is too high a price for you to meet if i should go bankrupt which of course i shant it would mean nothing to me while to you the speaker shrugged you havent my temperament no the advantage is all mine grays tone changed abruptly for your own good remove your hand from the neighborhood of that drawer i am too close to you for a gunplay good now about that one word from you you wont speak it for that would force me to utter nasty truths about you and you would suffer more than i this being your home town where you are respected and the truth is nasty isnt it colonel nelson had grown very white during this long speech he rose to his feet and laid one shaking hand upon his desk as if to steady himself his tongue was thick in his mouth as he said hoarsely id like to think you are crazy but youre not almost a compliment coming from you you think you can beat me want to make it a money fight do you well ill give you a bellyful every dollar ive got will go to smash you smash you splendid gray was on his feet now and he was smiling icily one or the other of us will be ruined and then perhaps we can resort to those methods which both of us would enjoy using of the two i believe i am the more primitive for the mere act of killing does not satisfy me ive come a long way to sink my teeth into you now that theyre in theyll stay so long as youre willing to fight clean ill are you gentlemen going to talk forever the inquiry came in a womans voice both nelson and gray turned to behold a smiling animated face framed in a crack of the door miss good calvin gray strode forward took the girls hands in his and drew her over the threshold my dear miss good i have rummaged half the state looking for you i hope im not interrupting i recognized you and the girl turned her eyes to henry nelson but at sight of his face her smile vanished oh im sorry she cried let me run out gray held her hands more firmly never do you think i shall risk losing you again colonel nelson and i had finished our chat and were merely exchanging pleasantries cross your heart cross my heart and hope to die gray laughed joyously and again shook the girls hands yes colonel gray was just leaving nelson managed to say colonel are you a colonel too the girl inquired and gray bowed i was and you knew each other abroad we came to know each other very well we were in fact commissioned at the same time and place but colonel nelson received his a moment earlier than i received mine therefore he outranked me now then permit me to retire while you and he oh theres nothing confidential about what i have to say its good news for my partner and im sure hed love to share it to nelson she announced pete has a showing of oil the vicepresident of the bank murmured something which was lost in grays quick inquiry partner are you a partner of colonel nelsons after a fashion we own a twentyacre lease west of burk that is i have a quarter interest and henry is putting down a well i drove out there and his driller told me it is looking good gray turned a keenly inquisitive gaze upon his enemy and what he saw or fancied he saw gave him the thrill of a new discovery it may have been no more than intuition on his part but something convinced him that his acquaintance with miss good deeply displeased the man if he knew henry nelson as well as he believed he did it was more than disapproval more than mere personal dislike that smoldered in the latters eyes this was luck in his warmest tone he cried congratulations my dear colonel however badly you have fared in the ranger district fortune favors you here but why only a quarter interest you put too low a price upon your blessings ill better that arrangement why i was ready to offer miss good a full half of all i have when she played a heartless jest upon me ran away disappeared ill admit i was piqued i was deeply resentful but nelson interrupted this flow of extravagance miss good he said curiously why does he call you that bob a secret a little game of pretense gray declared nastily for the sake of our friendship colonel dont tell me her real name and rob me of the pleasure of hearing it from her own lips come miss good enough of money making and oil wells and stupid business affairs i am going to bear you away upon my arm even at the risk of displeasing my superior officer ha lucky the war is over now then your promise grays impetuosity his buoyancy robbed his speech of boldness nevertheless barbara parker flushed faintly she was ill at ease she felt sure she had erred in interrupting these two men she was glad of an excuse to leave gray lingered a moment long enougn for his eyes to meet those of the banker in his there was a light of triumph of mockery as he said a pleasant interview wasnt it colonel and now we understand each other perfectly a fair fight and no quarter asked henry nelson stood motionless as he watched his two callers leave the bank together then slowly he clenched his muscular hands and from his lips there issued an oath better left unwritten chapter xi it was several moments after they had left the bank before bob parker could manage to slip a word in edgewise so rapid so eager was grays flow of conversation so genuine was his pleasure at again seeing her finally however she inquired curiously what was it you said to henry nelson as i came out no quarter asked her escort stared down at her his brows lifted his tone betrayed blank astonishment no quarter asked bless me what are you talking about then his face cleared now i remember i said i had found quarters at last the town is so crowded you know i didnt want him to feel bound to put me up i abhor visiting dont you are you really good friends i felt very queer the instant after i had walked in but i was bursting with good news and i couldnt see henrys face until too late then it seemed to me nelson and i are scarcely good friends we never were chummy but we were thrown together in france and saw a lot of each other at first my respect for him was not great for he is a difficult person to understand but as my understanding grew so did my respect he is a remarkably capable man and a determined fighter admirable qualities in a soldier my call today was in the nature of a ceremonial umm theres a ceremony before every duel the salute i thought i could hear the ring of steel gray laughed off the suggestion merely the jingle of officers spurs i assure you we amateurs cling to the regular army pomp and practice frankly i love it i admire the military method a rule for every occasion a rigid adherence to form no price too high for a necessary objective and the army code ironclad and exacting honors difficult and disgrace easy one learns to set great store by both youve no idea miss good how precious is the one and howhideous is the other you mustnt call me miss good any longer the girl told him my name is barbara parker oh i like that im more generally known as bob even better it sounds tomboyish its not it is tom parkerish father insisted on calling me that and it stuck hes a mans man and my being a girl was a total surprise to him it completely upset his plans so i did my best to remedy the mistake and learn to do and to take an interest in the things he was interested in those were miss parker looked up from beneath her trim velvet hat and her blue eyes were defiant all that people like you disapprove of all that you probably consider undignified and unladylike such as riding roping shooting riding unladylike its very smart and why do you say people like me there are no people like me you know what i mean youre not a westerner you are what a cowpuncher would call a swell easterner ignoring grays grimace of dislike she went on deliberately exaggerating her musical texas drawl you are a person of education and culture you speak languages you have the broad a and if you had to go unshaven it would be a living death you are rich too and probably play the piano people like that dont admire cowgirls the man laughed heartily in spite of my broad a and my safety razor im as much of a mans man as your father frankly i dont admire cowgirls but i do admire you and everything you say about yourself adds to that admiration if your father is tom parker well i congratulate you upon an admirable taste in the selection of parents do you know him barbara eagerly inquired no but i know of him and i know what he stands for i think we have many things in common and i venture to say that he is going to like me barbara smiled this vibrant stranger had an air about him and an irresistible magnetism it was flattering to receive marked attentions from a person of his age and consequence the girl felt an access of importance and the tone of his voice his every look assured her that she had indeed challenged his deepest interest she colored faintly as he ran on so youre a partner of henry nelsons he doesnt deserve it and our friendship ceases i shall now hate him yes henceforth he and i shall be enemies i love to be flattered but please dont become henrys enemy the most dreadful things happen to them he pretends to be a friend but in reality he is a suitor a detestable suitor and the ties of business bind you closer i see it all i i consider it abominable grays tone was as gay as his demeanor had been thus far nevertheless he was probing deliberately and the result appeared to verify his earlier suspicions calm as he had appeared to be during that interview in the bank in reality he had been and still was in a state of intense nervous excitement his mind was galloping the effect of that clash had been to rouse in him a keen exaltation and a sense of resistless power if henry nelson was seriously interested in this girl he reasoned here then was another weapon ready shaped a rapier aimed at his enemys breast and all he had to do was grasp it that promised to be a pleasant undertaking nor had he any doubt of success for barbara parker had aroused his liking so promptly that reason and experience told him they must be in close sentimental accord even had she proven less responsive he would still have been confident of himself for few women remained long indifferent to his zeal once he deliberately set about winning them to build upon that subtle involuntary attraction therefore and to profit by it appeared advisable nay necessary for henceforth all must be grist that came to his mill in view of his declaration of war he could afford to scorn no advantage however direct or indirect its bearing tell me about the briskows barbara demanded of course im dying to do so but gray looked at his watch even the good must lunch no doubt you abhor the public eating places but alas i do so does everybody who tries them but our cook has been speculating in shares and yesterday she stalked majestically from the kitchen she was a wretched cook anyhow but we couldnt afford a better one were very poor dad and i were poor not poor any longer i hope oh that well it is exciting isnt it dad has gone out there to see it so yes ill lunch with you and be duly grateful where shall we go barbaras brows drew together in a frown of consideration and gray told himself that she was even more charming when serious than when smiling wherever we go well be sorry we didnt go somewhere else we might try the professors place hes a greek scholar left his university to get rich quick in the oil fields but failed he started a sandwich and pie counter a good one and it pays better than a pumper but wed have to sit on high stools and be scowled at if we didnt gobble our food and make room for others then there is ptomaine tommys cafes are good and bad by comparison after youve been here a few days youll enjoy tommys then i vote for his poison palace the very name has a thrill to it on their way to the restaurant gray said pa and ma and allie briskow and the tutoress have gone to the mountains mas beloved mountains and they appear to be living up to her expectations the mountains i mean the old dear writes me every week and her letters are wonderful even outside of the spelling she hasnt lost a single illusion she has a soul for adventure has ma shes hunting for caves now keeps her ears open to hear if the ground sounds hollow wants to find a mysterious cavern and explore it with her heart in her mouth she revels in the clean green foliage and the spring brooks she says the trees are awful crowded in places and theres no dust on them and allie has a tutor the best money could secure and by the way you wouldnt have known the girl after you got through with her that day that was only the beginning too she fills the eye now and shes growing growing gray chuckled not physically but mentally psychologically intellectually i said she had possibilities yes more than i gave her credit for but what they are where they will lead her i dont know im a foolish person miss parker for i take an intense interest in the affairs of other people especially my friends my favorite dissipation is to share the troubles of those whom i like and right now im quite as worried over allie as her father is you see she has outdistanced her parents already the dream part is wearing off and her new life is a reality she is confronted with the grim and appalling necessity of adapting herself to a completely new and bewildering set of conditions im not sure that she will be equal to it i presume you mean that she is sensitive supersensitive and ambitious thats the trouble if she were dull and conceited she could be both happy and contented but shes bright and she lacks egotism so shell never be either adversity would temper a girl like her prosperity may spoil her there is a boy too isnt there oh buddy hes away at school hell make a hand or well if he doesnt ill beat the foolishness out of him ive assumed complete responsibility for buddy and hell be a credit to me there was a tone in grays voice when he spoke of the briskows that gave barbara parker a wholly new insight into his character it was with a feeling that she knew him and liked him better that she said you think a lot of those nesters dont you more than they believe and more than i would have thought possible he readily declared im a lonesome institution theres nobody dependent upon me i owe no bills no gratitude and ive canceled the obligations that others owe me youve no idea how unnecessary i am it gives me a pleasing sense of importance therefore to feel that i fill a place in somebodys affairs wichita fallss facilities for public entertainment reflected perhaps as correctly as anything else the general chaos consequent upon its swift expansion into a city such hotels as had been capable of caring for the transient trade of prepetroleum days were full and carried waiting lists like exclusive clubs rooming houses and private dwellings were crowded a new and modern fireproof hotel was stretching skeleton fingers of steel skyward but meanwhile the task of sheltering and especially of feeding three times a day the hungry hordes that bulged the sides of the little city was a difficult one to wrest possession of a cafe table for two at the rush hour was an undertaking almost as hazardous as jumping a mining claim but calvin gray succeeded and eventually he and bob found themselves facing each other over a discolored tablecloth reading a soiled menu card to a perspiring waiter it was in some ways an ideal retreat for a teteatete for the bellowed orders the rattle of crockery the voice of the hungry food battlers and the clash of their steel made intimate conversation easy gray noted with approval the ease with which his dainty companion adapted herself to the surroundings and remarked upon it after four years in the east it took me a little while to get used to it she confessed the wichita i left was a quiet town the one i came home to was a madhouse at first the excitement frightened me for i felt as if i were being run over tossed aside but now that ive fallen in with the chase why i think it is splendid just what are you doing and how do you do it gray wanted to know barbara was glad to tell him about her brief but eventful experience since that morning at the nelson bank when she had executed her coup and she recited the story with enthusiasm having no capital to go on she explained ive merely bought and sold on commission so far but im not always going to be a broker im making good and some day dad and i will be big operators ive been able to buy a car and most of my time im out in the field they tell me im as good an oil scout as some of the men working for the big companies but of course im not i merely have an advantage drillers tell me more than theyd tell a man of course with your father along youre safe in going anywhere but to go through the fields alone oh dad doesnt go what gray looked up incredulously but bob nodded her head vigorously dad hates automobiles they frighten him so i go out alone while he runs the office extraordinary but my dear girl its dangerous naturally i avoid burk and the northwest extension after dark even the scouts do that but it wouldnt pay anybody to highjack me no i go right in on the derrick floors and hobnob with the drillers talk about their wives and their families discuss croup and fishing jobs sometimes they let me taste the sand and even show me the logs of their wells it amused them at first to think of a girl playing the game singlehanded most men however rough have a sense of chivalry you know and are better sports than they realize now well theyre beginning to respect my business ability they have learned that i keep my mouth closed and that ill treat them squarely some of them would fight for me i tell you it is the greatest experience the most thrilling adventure a girl ever had you are a brave child and i admire your courage gray declared but im not im afraid of everything that other girls are afraid of leaning forward confidentially the girl continued im a hollow sham mr gray but dad doesnt know it after i learned how badly he wanted me to be a boy and how he had set his heart on teaching me the things he thought a son of his should know i had a secret meeting with myself and i voted unanimously to fill the specifications if it killed me so i began a fraudulent life im in earnest for instance i abhor guns but i learned to shoot with either hand until well im pretty expert and roping i can build a loop jump through it do straight and fancy catches like a cowboy i worked at it for months years it seemed to me i knew very well it was a ridiculous waste of time but ill never forget how proud dad was when i learned the butterfly that was my reward horses used to frighten me blue but i learned to ride well enough in fact it has been a keen disappointment to him that i wont enter the frontier day contests hed like nothing better than to see me win the buckinghorse match think of it and im so timid i cant look an oat in the face barbara attempted a shy laugh but there was a quaver to her voice and when gray continued to stare at her gravely sympathetically her face quickly sobered now you understand why my father doesnt think it necessary to go along on my trips through the oil fields it has never occurred to him that im anything but bob parker his boy mind you he is lost in admiration of me and i rule him like a slave i think he is great too and he is he is the dearest gentlest sweetest father in the world and i wouldnt have him learn the hideous truth about me for anything for a moment barbaras listener studied her thoughtfully then he said im immensely flattered that you like me well enough to make me your confessor now im going to confess to you that i also am an arrant coward please dont joke you have become quite a famous character and if the stories i hear are true the stories one hears are never true i have my share of physical courage perhaps thats a common elementary virtue like generosity gratitude sympathy the most mediocre people are blessed that way oh generosity and gratitude are divine qualities gray shook his head positively impulses heart impulses not brain impulses they have nothing to do with character now im deathly afraid of one thing what pray ridicule you see im egotistical and ostentatious oh very disgustingly vain in fact if i were unconscious of it id be unbearable but it amuses me as much as it amuses others and that takes the curse off of it i am delighted at some of my own antics i love to swagger and i adore an audience but to be laughed at by others would kill me ridicule scorn im insensible to anything except those youre a queer man grays gaze became fixed there was a peculiar light almost a glitter in his eyes he talked on as if voicing some engrossing thought of course im vindictive thats a part of the swashbuckling character it goes with the ruffles the jack boots and the swagger it is a luxury of which i am extremely jealous bringing his attention back to the girl he smiled and his manner changed abruptly there ive proved it all by talking about myself when im interested only in you however it is sometimes easier to sell a thing by frankly decrying it than by covering up its bad points and im trying desperately to make a good impression upon you now then im tremendously interested in what you have told me about yourself and im sure you are a better oil man oil girl than you have led me to suppose but these are no times for social pleasantries we are living in bedlam there is nothing in the air but business oil profits you are a business woman and if we are to become as well acquainted as i hope we will it must be the result of a common business interest so then for a bargain i am going to enter this field in a large way if you will take me for a client i will buy and sell through you whenever possible perhaps we can even speculate together now and then ill guarantee you against loss what do you say why its a splendid opportunity for me and i know of some good things im overflowing with information in fact for instance barbara hurriedly produced her oil map and shoving aside the dishes in front of her she spread it upon the table there is a wildcat going down out here that looks awfully good as she indicated a tiny circle marked into the corner of one square gray noted that there was a dimple at the base of her finger the scouts dont think much of it but i happen to know it is on a structure and has a good showing of oil the driller is a friend of mine and he has told me that his casing is set hell tip me off when he intends to drill through and if you like well go out there and see what happens if it comes in it will mean a big play on surrounding property prices will double treble my theory is this grays head was close to the speakers but although he pretended to listen to her words and to follow the tracings of her finger with studious consideration in reality his attention was fixed upon the tantalizing curve of her smooth cheek and throat in some perplexity of spirit he asked himself why it was that mere proximity to this wholly sensible and matteroffact young creature filled him with such a vague yet pleasurable excitement he realized that he was not easily thrilled feminine beauty feminine charm were nothing new nevertheless at this moment he experienced an intense elation an eagerness of spirit such as he had not felt since he was in the first resistless vigor of youth and his voice when he spoke carried an unconscious quality strange to his ears it was the more bewildering because nothing had happened to awaken such feelings he had met this unworldly inexperienced prairie girl but twice and on her part she had betrayed no particular attraction for him as a matter of fact she probably considered him an old man young girls were like that of course that was absurd he was right in his prime youth sang through his veins at this moment and yet she must like him he must have somehow impressed her that was fortunate in view of her relations with henry nelson luck was coming his way and she would undoubtedly prove useful the last thing calvin gray contemplated was a sentimental woman complication but on account of this girls peculiar knowledge it seemed to him the part of wisdom to cultivate her to see as much of her as possible if you will come over to the office ill show you how i think that pool lies barbara was saying and gray came to with a start it was midafternoon when he left the parker office at least he thought it must be midafternoon until he consulted his watch and discovered that to all intents and purposes he had completely lost two hours an amazing loss truly there was no lack of youthful vigor in calvin grays movements at any time but now there was an unusual lightness to his tread and his lips puckered into a joyous whistle it had been a great day a day of the widest extremes a day of adventure and romance and that is what every day should be chapter xii if gray cherished any lingering doubts as to the loyalty of mallow erstwhile victim of his ruthlessness or of mcwade and stoner the wildcat promoters those doubts vanished during the next day or two as a matter of fact the readiness nay the enthusiasm with which they fell in with his schemes convinced him that he had acted wisely in yielding to an impulse to trust them at first when he divulged his enemys identity they were thunderstruck mere mention of henry nelsons name rendered them speechless and caused them to regard their employer as a harmless madman but as he unfolded his plans in greater detail they listened with growing respect the idea seized them finally in the first place it was sufficiently fantastic to appeal to their imaginations for they saw in gray a lone wolf with the courage and the ferocity to single out and pull down the leader of the herd and what was more they scented profit to themselves in trailing with him then too the enterprise promised to afford free scope for their ingenuity their cunning their devious business methods and that could be nothing less than pleasing to men of their type but early enough he made it plain that he intended and would tolerate no actual dishonesty crooked methods were both dangerous and unsatisfactory he told them hence the fight must be fair even though merciless to annoy to harass to injure and if possible actually to ruin the banker that was his intention to accomplish those ends he was willing to employ any legitimate device however shrewd however smart his entire fortune and his associates of course greatly exaggerated its size would be available for the purpose and when he sketched out the measures he had in mind the trio of rogues realized that here indeed was a field wide enough for the exercise of their peculiar gifts they acknowledged too a certain pleasure in the comfortable assurance that they would involve themselves in no illegal consequences at their first council of war gray gave each of them a number of definite things to do or to have done the while he sought certain facts when they assembled for a second time it was to compare to tabulate and to consider an amount of information concerning the activities of henry nelson that would have greatly surprised that gentleman had he been present to hear it for one thing there had been prepared a comprehensive list of the nelson holdings together with maps showing their acreage and production the location of drilling wells the ownership of adjoining properties and the like there was also a considerable amount of data concerning the terms of the nelson leases renewal dates and such matters gray was forced reluctantly to admit that his enemy was more strongly intrenched than he had supposed careful study of the data showed that the nelson acreage had been well selected and that it was scientifically checkerboarded throughout the various fields what was more significant was the amount of proven or semiproven stuff it took work and money to get together that group of leases brick stoner declared after he had checked them off thats one of the best layouts in texas and theyre shaped up to put over a big deal if they want to they lack production said gray sure but theyll have it before long lookit the wells theyre putting down and thats going down around em the former speaker chewed his cigar thoughtfully for a while then i dont believe they contemplate a big deal theyre not that sort henry nelson is selfish and suspicious and im told that bell wouldnt trust anybody im informed also that every dollar they have made has gone back into new leases and wells and that they intend to hold everything for themselves it is rumored quietly that they are overextended i wouldnt care how thin i was stretched if i had their gamble mcwade asserted all they have to do is to sit tight the law of average will pull them out what do you intend to do to begin with i intend to stretch them even thinner so thin theyll break if that is possible you cant load them up with more property certainly not but i can make them drill more wells offsets eh stoner studied the map a bit doubtfully you cant make em offset dry holes and if they strike oil in their wells the other fellers will have to do the offsetting true i can of course prevent them from extending their renewals i can cost them a pretty penny just by forcing them to a rigid adherence to the terms of their leases and agreements and what do you mean offsets mallow inquired how you going to break a man by bringing in wells alongside of his property thatll make him rich can you beat that stoner inquired mallows been selling oil stock and experting wells for us with the marvelous magnetic finder and he dont know an offset from a headache post certainly i know why professor is it possible we have been deceived in you an offset is the thing that sets off to one side of the crown block and its a light blue the same as a formation its the shape of a syncline only bigger dont get funny you drill an offset well to keep a man from sucking all the oil out from under your land right said gray wells as you know are drilled as close to the side lines as the law allows when oil is found the adjoining landowner can compel his lessee to put down a well to offset every one that threatens to draw oil from beneath his property thats what ive just been telling you many an operator has gone broke offsetting wells in order to protect his leases especially if he has a number of neighbors who all start drilling promptly that is one of the many production troubles and theres a saying that trouble begins when the oil starts you said it but to offset the nelsons sos to cripple em brick stoner shook his head it aint hard to borrow money for good offsets most any bank will lend it is hard for anybody who is overextended to borrow possibly my plan wont work but to annoy to harass to embarrass to stretch them thin its all a part of the game people are never as well off as we think they are the nelsons are close to the sand in a number of places i want to procure the adjoining acreage for every well they make ill force them to drill six more the day they strike oil ill have a string of derricks every two hundred feet along their side lines it was mallow who spoke next that will cost you dollar for dollar boss have you got chips enough to match their stack i dont have to invest dollar for dollar my money will go for leases and ill let drilling contracts fiftyfifty sixtyforty seventythirty anything to get quick action other peoples money will do the work for me remember im not after oil im after a man ill say you are stoner looked up from a frowning contemplation of the maps and if youll take a chance ill show you how you can drill one well and cost them three that is provided you hit as the others leaned over his shoulder he explained heres a square block of four twenties separate leases all of em and the nelsons own three you can cop the fourth twenty drill right at the inside corner where all the lines cross if you pull a duster youll be out and injured maybe twentyfive thousand but if it comes wet theyll have to protect those three leases with three offsets it aint a badlooking piece of ground youll have about a onetothree chance of making a well how many companies have you gentlemen promoted gray inquired twentytwo and from a shoestring every well went down or is going down and every dollar we got right here on the street and all of them are dry are they not mcwade spoke up defensively sure they were all wildcats of the wildest kind but we dont deal in oil we sell stock every issue weve put out has gone above par at some time or other and thats playing the game square with our customers aint it we see that they have a chance to get out with a profit if they hang on its their own fault thats how weve built up a clienteel it wouldnt hurt your reputation to bring in a wet well for a change would it both partners agreed that it would not ill buy this twentyacre lease and you can promote a company to drill ten of it stoner says its a onetothree shot mcwade blazed with enthusiasm at the suggestion take a piece of the stock yourself mr gray and well put it over in a day with your name at the top of the list it will ballyhoo itself not a share your amiable proposition brings me directly to another point which has a bearing upon our main campaign law is a dry subject but i must bore you with a brief dissertation upon a provision of one statute which has doubtless escaped your notice it has escaped the notice of most people even of henry nelson i believe you realize that all but a few texas oil companies are not organized as corporations but as joint stock associations in effect declarations of trust we oughta know it stoner said it saves paying a big corporation tax and lets you sell all the fullpaid nonassessable stock you want to issue regardless of what the property is worth oh we got wise to that muy pronto why these here texas laws are the bunk them fellows at austin if they had their way would make it impossible to promote a legitimate enterprise on a paying basis theyd make you turn in cash or property the equivocal thereto every time you organized wouldnt that be sweet this jointstock arrangement is the only way to beat the game its a shrewd device and my hats off to the guy that invented it very true very well expressed but in the statute governing the procedure there is wrapped up a bundle of bad news for it is provided that any officer or stockholder may become personally liable for the entire debt of the association there is going to be a lot of sleep lost over that fact when the truth becomes known you mean if i got stock in a company thats blowed up and im living in oshkosh all pretty that i can be hooked for the debts some crook runs up here in texas precisely this intelligence brought no consternation to the partners on the contrary mcwade the optimist grinned widely goes to show you we have been playing the game along safe and legitimate lines said he we dont own a share in any of our own enterprises and if we have to pick up a few now and then to boost the market we drop them again as if they were hot its a pretty thought though why i can see years of activity ahead of brick and me buying up the debts of defunct oil companies and collecting in full from prosperous strangers hither and yon for heavens sake dont let it get out i wont at least until after i have accumulated a number of potential judgments against henry nelson he has had his share of cats and dogs of course and some day i hope to lead them back to his doorstep if they return at the right moment they may prove an embarrassment who knows got anything else up your sleeve behind mallows dark glasses his eyes could be dimly seen and they were active with curiosity plenty but we have enough here to start on first i want these various leases then i want a company promoted and a well started on that twenty we talked about for some time longer the conspirators busied themselves over the details of their plans and gray was beginning to feel some satisfaction at his rate of progress when an interruption occurred that threatened to delay action and even to rob him of the services of the two partners that interruption took the form of a call from a group of highly excited and indignant purchasers of stock in the desert scorpion company that promotion in which professor mallow had assisted on the morning of grays arrival these stockholders swarmed into the office bringing with them an air of angry menace they were noisy they all talked at once from out of the confusion it soon became apparent that they had a real grievance and one which called for immediate satisfaction moreover it was made plain that the callers cared little what form that satisfaction took whether tar and feathers or a rope and a lamppost they had been sold victimized flimflammed skinned the scorpion had stung them and the poison was boiling in their veins briefly the swindle was this investigation had shown that the land owned by the desert scorpion was not where it had been represented to be but more than a mile distant therefrom chance alone had brought forth the truth the hour of vengeance had struck calvin gray withdrew quietly from the hubbub and asked mallow can that be true the eminent scientist shrugged out of the corner of his mouth he murmured why not it all looks alike me wade and stoner were not in the least dismayed by this amazing intelligence as a matter of fact the former assumed an air of even greater geniality than usual and nodded a careless agreement to every accusation hurled against him right you are men absolutely right we were victimized but were tickled to death to rectify the error mighty fortunate mistake as a matter of fact brick out with the old check book and give these birds back their money with alacrity mr stoner cleared off his desk and seated himself pen in hand step up and get a dollar a share just what you paid fair enough i calls it the banks are open and the checks are good immediately the repurchase of stock began but anger and suspicion still smoldered there were dissatisfied mutterings one investor a field man in greasy overalls spoke out well get ours all right dont worry but how about the other suckers theres fifty thousand shares out what you going to do about that buy it back know where you can get any more maybe well pay a dollar and a half a share for all you can get tomorrow what you heard me breast up boys and get your money back our offer stands a dollar a share today a dollar and a half tomorrow there was a stir among the indignant speculators the man for whom stoner was writing a check inquired whats the idea why not a dollar and a half now stoner and mcwade exchanged a meaning glance it was not lost upon their attentive audience but the latter shrugged and smiled provocatively thats our business he declared lightly you ghost dancers want your money back and were giving it to you youre letting up a holler that you were robbed so come and get it the faster you come the better itll suit us scorpion stock will close at a dollar and a half or better tomorrow night bluff somebody growled stoner finished his signature with a nourish blotted it then he hesitated he flung down his pen and turned defiantly upon his partner crying this aint fair to these men mac theyre customers of ours and we owe em the chance to make a killing its up to us to tell em the truth mcwade was angry his indignation flamed vigorously he denied the charge of unfairness a spirited argument ensued with stoner asserting that the firm was morally obligated to protect its clients to a greater extent than merely by returning their money and with mcwade as stoutly maintaining that all obligations moral and legal were canceled with the repurchase of the stock meanwhile it became evident that the alarming rumor about desert scorpion was rapidly spreading for other investors were climbing the stairs now and the office was becoming crowded the later arrivals were in time to witness mcwade finally defer to his partner and to hear him announce that a rare stroke of fortune had favored purchasers of this particular issue of stock for the land which really belonged to the company had turned out to be much better than that which it owned certain information from the field had arrived that very day which was bound to send the stock to two dollars if anybody wanted to sell the promoters would be glad to buy and they would advance their price on the morrow as mcwade had promised so here was a chance for those present to turn a pretty penny by getting busy at once frankly however he advised his hearers to hang on and make a real cleanup the information which was not yet public had nothing to do with the fact that doctor mallow had experted both properties with his scientific device and pronounced the new acreage much richer than the old this latter was merely corroborative evidence and in view of the fact that some people put no credence in socalled doodle bugs he merely offered the record of the tester for what it was worth his original bet of ten to one still held by the way and once again he repeated that those who wished to sell out would be accommodated with the greatest alacrity only they mustnt return later and squawk mcwade confessed that he was neither angry nor offended at the recent attitude of suspicion he was merely amused it made him laugh the idea of his firm turning a crooked trick when it was an established institution as strong as gibraltar and as conservative as a national bank was ridiculous he and stoner could point with pride to an unbroken record of successes and to a list of satisfied investors as long as a santa fe timetable desert scorpion stock would go to two dollars and five would get you ten if you didnt think so now then step lively the refunding of money halted there was a deal of noisy argument some of the disgruntled investors still insisted upon selling out others decided to hold on even a few asked to repurchase the stock they had turned in and this they were reluctantly permitted to do at an advance of fifty per cent when the last caller had disappeared gray inquired curiously how are you going to make good on your assertion that the stock will rise easy said stoner ill change into my old clothes put four mud chains on my car and drive up to the exchange in a hurry then give some gabby guy a tip to grab desert scorpion for me at a dollar and a half all he can get after that ill shoot out of town on high with the cutout open there will be a string of cars after me inside of half an hour and the stock will be up before i can get back well make good all right mcwade asserted those customers are in luck dealing with a house like us all they expect is a chance to get out with a profit and sting the next fellow they dont want oil they want a run for their money and a quick turn we give it to them and do they always buy your issues i aint saying they do sometimes theyre cold until you put on the indian sign but all you have to do when stock dont sell is to raise the price oh if you know how it aint hard to make an honest dollar in the oil business mr mcwade smiled with conscious satisfaction im sure of it gray said heartily there is so little competition chapter xiii ma briskow always had been known as a woman without guile but of late she had developed rare powers of dissimulation she was in fact leading a double life and neither her husband nor her daughter suspected the extent of her deception to the patrons of the burlington notch hotel she was merely a drab indistinct washedout old woman unmarked except by a choice of clashing colors in dress to her family she remained what she always had been nobody dreamed that she was in reality a bandit queen the leader of a wild unfettered band of mountaineers but that is what she was and worse at times yes ma had slipped the leash she was a robber baroness she dwelt in a rocky fastness whatever that was surrounded by a crew of outlaws as desperate as any that ever drew cutlass and dagger and she ruled them not only by native strength of character but also by the aid of other forces for she was on friendly terms with the more prominent wood sprites fairies and the like and they brought her wisdom moreover she had learned the language of dumb animals and could talk to squirrels beetles porcupines frogs all this as may be surmised had come about as the result of mas early reading a haphazard choice of story books in which were tales of treasure trove of pirates of wronged maidens and gallant squires romantic stories peculiarly designed to stir a cramped imagination like hers it was from them that she had gained her ideas of the world her notions of manners even her love of the mountains and that unquenchable desire to see them that she had confided to calvin gray he it was by the way who had selected the notch for these texas nesters it had proved a happy choice for the hotel sat upon the top of the world and beneath it lay outspread the whole green and purple vastness of the earth the briskows were entranced of course and once they had established themselves here they never thought of moving nor did it occur to them that there might be other mountains than these other hotels as good as this to them burlington notch became merely a colloquial name for paradise and life in the great hotel itself a beautiful dream the place was famous the country over as a health resort and indeed it must have possessed miraculous curative properties otherwise gus briskow strong and vigorous as he was could never have survived the shock of receiving his first weeks bill it was with conflicting emotions that he had divided the sum at the foot of the statement into seven parts and realized the daily ransom in which he and his family were held it had given him a feeling of tremendous importance and extreme insignificance he spoke feelingly that night about the high cost of loafing but ma showed such dismay at the mere suggestion of leaving that he had resigned himself and thereafter the sight of his weekly bill evoked nothing more than a shudder and a prayer a prayer that none of his wells would go dry overnight but lifelong habits of prudence are not easily broken the notch hotel was altogether too rich for gus briskows blood so he sought a more congenial environment he found it in the village in a livery stable there amid familiar odors and surroundings both agreeable and economical he spent most of his time leaving ma to amuse herself and allie to pursue the routine of studies laid down by her tutoress now ma had not gone wild all at once her atavism had been gradual the result of her persistent explorations she had never seen a real waterfall for instance and the first one proved so amazing that she was impelled to seek more after which she became interested in caves and before long her ramblings had taken her up every watercourse and into every ravine in the neighborhood this sense of treading untrodden ground roused in ma a venturesome spirit of independence an unsuspected capacity for adventure and when the wealth of her discoveries failed to awaken interest in her family she ceased reporting them and became more solitary than ever in her habits every morning she slipped out of the hotel meandered through the grounds apparently without purpose but in reality pursuing a circuitous route and taking sudden twistings and turnings to throw pursuers off the scent ever deeper into the wilderness she penetrated but with the sly caution of an old fox returning to its lair for she was always being followed by wicked people such for instance as minions of the law members of the black hand foreign spies gendarmys and detectifs having baffled them all she laughed scornfully flung deceit to the winds then hurried straight to the fastness and there uttered the tribal call at the sound her gypsy band came bounding forth to meet her and she gave them her royal hand to kiss raising them graciously when they knelt giving a kind word here or a sharp reprimand there they were the fiercest gypsies in the world and quarrelsome too they were forever fighting among themselves and crying curse you jack dalton take that and plunging swords into one another but they had good hearts and they loved ma and were devoted to her lost cause she could handle them where others would have failed having accepted their homage and heard the details of their latest raids against her enemy the false duke of dallas he whose treachery had made her what she was she assumed her throne and held formal court the throne was a low flat rock beside a stream and usually ma removed her shoes and stockings and paddled her feet in the water while she gave audience to visiting potentates those enlarged joints never seemed to ac commodate themselves wholly to the sort of shoes allie made her wear court let out when mas feet had become rested after which there were less formal affairs of state to settle these out of the way it was time for the queens recreations which took the form of singing dancing conversations with animals visits with the invisible fairy folk who lived in flowers arid gave them their pretty smells ma never had any trouble putting in the whole day in some such manner as this evening came all too soon as a matter of fact then it was that she bade goodby to her faithful subjects and prepared once more to fare forth and mingle in the cunning guise of an old woman with the followers of the false and lying duke of dallas but courage patience the day of reckoning was at hand when she would come into her own and the world would recognize her as the wronged but rightful princess pensacola thus would ma briskow spend one morning another perhaps she would be an altogether different character but always she was young and beautiful and full of grace and only when it came time to go did she assume the disguise of an aged wrinkled bent old woman sometimes she ran miles and miles at a stretch darting springing like a fawn rushing through the soft green leaves leaping rock and rill her laughter echoing her bare limbs flashing her gold hair streaming her scanty silken draperies whipped to shreds behind her by the very swiftness of her going oh the ecstasy of that the excitement of course ma did not actually run neither did her bare limbs flash being incased in flannels and her hair was not gold it was gray what little there was of it no she ambled a bit perhaps where the grass was short and the ground smooth then she stood still closed her eyes and ran and leaped and swayed and darted with her arms anybody can do it at other times she defied gravitation a secret accomplishment all her own which she manifested in this wise she would begin to jump higher and higher and the higher she jumped the lighter she became until finally she weighed no more than a thistledown and the effort of leaping became a pure joy and an exhilaration having attained this perfect state of buoyancy she would set out upon wonderful journeys springing lightly as far as it pleased her to spring soaring gracefully over obstacles and deriving a delirious pleasure from the sensation one cannot appreciate the enjoyment to be had from this method of locomotion without trying it and always when ma came back to earth and opened her eyes there were the great smiling mountains the clear clean waters foaming over the rocks and underfoot was the cool green grass not that hot hard dobe clay she had always known trees too beautiful whispering trees with smooth leaves instead of burrs and spines and stickers nor was there the faintest choking smell of dust no sand blowing up her nose and smarting her eyes ma briskow had never dreamed that the world was so clean she blessed god for making oil to lie in the rocks of the earth and she prayed that none of them hotel people would discover her retreat but of course somebody did discover it mr delamater the dancing instructor for one stumbled upon it while ma briskow was in the midst of one of her imaginary games and he reported his discovery to the day clerk what ails that old dame anyhow he inquired after recounting mas peculiar behavior not a thing in the world except money the clerk declared doubtfully mr delamater shook his handsome auburn head people with good sense dont act like that she was doing an isadora duncan when i saw her dancing if you care to call it that anyhow her hair was hanging she was flapping her arms and jiggling up and down delamater laughed at the memory theres a big awkward bird sort of a crane or buzzard of some kind that dances i never saw one but she reminded me of it and she sang gee it was fierce did she see you scarcely i dont mind being alone with allie delamaters teeth shone in a smile then seeing his reflection in a convenient mirror he studied it with complacent favor he tried the smile again and getting it to his better satisfaction concluded dont mind it a bit but a bosky dell with a mad woman is my idea of no place to be allie the clerk lifted his brows so allie has it gone as far as that del oh you know how it is a lesson every day soft music arm around the waist a kind word the girl is human im probably different to anything that ever came into her young life look at my wardrobe shes not so bad to take either and yet the immaculate speaker frowned father smells like a horse and mothers a nut gee it would take some coin to square that thats one thing theyve got asserted the clerk nothing but mr delamater debated further think of marrying the powerful katrinka ill admit it has its points if anything went wrong with the bank roll allie could make a good living for both of us suppose for instance the old statue of liberty slipped and fell allie could jump over to bedloes island and take a turn at holding the torch ifi theyve got the coin you say they have i think ill have to see more of her you wont see any more than you do shes hitting on all four what is she up to all day i dont know working studying exercising rehearsing for the movies i guess she has worn that companion of hers down to a frazzle she has her own masseuse in the bath department she rides a horse three days a week and every morning she takes a long walk ive got it mr delamater slapped his thigh road work shes getting ready to take on dempsey he laughed musically if she marries me her days of labor will be over it will mean for her the dawn of a new life provided of course those oil wells are what you say they are kidding aside though i dont dislike the girl and ive a notion to give her a chance what the clerk said was true allie briskow was indeed in training both physical and mental and the application the energy she displayed had surprised not only her parents who could but dimly understand the necessity of selfculture but also mrs ring the instructress mrs ring a handsome middleaged woman whose specialty was the finishing of wealthy young ladies had been induced to accept this position partly by reason of the attractive salary mentioned in calvin grays telegram and partly by reason of the fact that she needed a rest she had met the briskows in dallas only a short time before their departure for the north and although that first interview had been a good deal of a shock to her almost as much of a shock as if she had been asked to tutor the offspring of a pair of chimpanzees nevertheless she had nerved herself to the necessary sacrifice of dignity after all allegheny was only an overgrown child in need of advanced kindergarten training and in the meantime there was the prospect of a season at burlington notch the latter was in itself a prospect alluring to one suffering from the wear and tear of a trying profession after some hesitation mrs ring had accepted the position feeling sure that it would rest her nerves but never had the good woman suffered such a disillusionment allie she soon discovered was anything but a child or rather she was an amazing and contradictory combination of child and adult what mrs ring had taken to be mental apathy inherent dullness was in reality caution diffidence the shyness of some wild animal nor was that the most bewildering of the teachers surprises allie possessed character and will power for some time she had accepted mrs rings tutorship without comment or question calvin gray had recommended it therefore she obeyed blindly but one day after they had become settled in the mountains she came out with a forceful declaration she knew full well her own shortcomings so she declared and she was not content to learn a few things day by day she demanded intensified training education under forced draught they took green country boys durin the war during the war dont drop your gs my dear during the war and learned em taught them taught them to be soldiers in six months well im strong as a horse and ive got a brain and im quick at pickin i mean i pick up things quick you pick them up quickly quickly is an adverb quick is an allies dark eyes grew darker imperiously she cried all right but let me say this my own way it wont be right or elegant but youll understand and thats what we got to have first off a good understanding after ive said it you can rub it down and curry it i been watching you like a hawk miz ring and youre just what he said you was you got everything i want but i cant go so slow i got to get it quick quickly you been teaching me to read and talk and how to laugh and how to set sit but we been playing we got to work oh i know im forgetting everything for a minute miz ring i gotta learn how to act pretty and talk pretty and look pretty and i gotta learn how quick you are a finelooking girl as it is allegheny oh i guess i look dressed up but im awkward im stiff as a hired hand and i fall over my feet look at em biggest live things in the world without lungs i got to get slim and graceful ill teach you a settingup routine if you wish although it is scarcely in my line goodness knows you dont need physical culture but i do cried the girl very well riding is a smart accomplishment can you ride a horse pshaw i can carry a horse youd look well in a habit and with baths massage dancing and a little diet i dare say you can reduce ill starve allie asserted fiercely but that aint half enough you gotta give me more studyin i got callouses on my hands and im used to work well get up at daylight good heavens mrs ring exclaimed faintly you learn me how to do the sittingup things first off then ill do em alone ride me hard miz ring ill remember ill work you wont have to tell me twice but i gotta make speed i aint got the time other girls have my dear child all this cannot be done in a day a week a month how long you allow it will take the elder woman shrugged years perhaps years real culture social accomplishments are the results of generations of careful training im not a miracle worker but why this impatience i got i have i have a reason i cant take a generation id be too late too late for what but allie refused to answer well start in today and well work double tower till one of us plays out what dyou say at first mrs ring took this energetic declaration with some reserve but before long she realized with consternation that allie briskow was in deep earnest and that this was not a soft berth instead of obtaining a rest she was being worked as never before allie was a thing of iron she was indefatigable and her thirst for knowledge was insatiate it grew daily as she gained fuller understanding of her ignorance there was a frantic eagerness to her efforts almost pitiful as time went on she began to hate herself for her stupidity and to blame her people for her condition she was a harder taskmaster than her teacher most things she apprehended readily enough but when she failed to learn when mental or physical awkwardness halted progress then she flew into a fury her temper appalled mrs ring at such times allie was more than disagreeable hate flamed in her eyes she beat herself with her fists she kicked the furniture and she broke things once she even butted her head against the wall uttering language meanwhile that all but caused her companion to swoon mrs ring resigned after this final exhibition but lacking the courage to face allie in a mood like that she went to gus briskow it is simply impossible to remain she told him already im a physical wreck for i never get a moments rest the salary is attractive but allegheny is too much for me she saps every ounce of vitality i have she keeps me going every hour and her terrific tempers are actually dangerous she dont ever get mad at you does she oh no and she repents quickly enough as a matter of fact i am afraid she is overdoing her studies but theres no holding her back youre kinda worked up miz ring mebbe i can make it pleasanter for you in what way may i ask well by payin you more you are generous the salary we agreed upon isnt low yesm no maam i wouldnt feel right to accept more try it maam for a little while mebbe it wont bother you so much after you get used to it allie likes you and i i am interested in her she is progressing too in fact i have never seen anyone learn more rapidly but she is so unusual still perhaps i am the one perhaps it is my duty under the circumstances with this disposition to compromise the father had little difficulty in dealing so the daily routine was continued allie applied herself to the cultivation of the ordinary social niceties with the same zeal that she followed her studies and her physical exercises fortunately these exercises afforded outlet for the impatience and the scorn that she felt for herself otherwise there would have been no living with her as it was she showed herself no mercy daylight found her stirring her swedish drill she took with a vigor that fairly shook the floor and having finished this she donned sweater and boots and went for a swift walk over the hills at this hour she had the roads to herself and was glad of it for she felt ridiculous at breakfast although she had a ravenous appetite she ate sparingly the day was spent in reading aloud in lessons in deportment voice modulation conversation and the like in learning how to enter and how to leave a room how to behave at a tea or a reception how to accept and how to make an introduction how to walk how to sit how to rise allie did sums in arithmetic she studied grammar and geography and penmanship in short she took an intensified commonschool course here was where her tutoress had trouble for when the girls brain became weary or confused she relieved her baffled rage in her most natural way the while mrs ring stopped her ears and moaned it was a regimen that no ordinary woman could have endured it would have taxed the strength of an athlete late in the afternoon allie went riding and here was one accomplishment in which she required no coaching frequently she vented her spite upon her horse and more than once she brought it home with its mouth bleeding and its flanks white with lather she rode with a magnificent recklessness that finally caused comment among the other guests allie was sitting alone in her room one evening fagged out from a hard day some people were talking on the veranda outside her window and she heard one say the girl can look really stunning exactly i dont understand where she gets her looks for her parents are impossible wouldnt you know what they were allie needed no clearer indication of who was under discussion instinctive resentment at the reference to her father and mother was followed by amazement delight at the compliment to herself the first she had ever received she leaned forward straining to hear more what mattered it how these contemptuous outsiders referred to her parents they agreed that she was stunning which was their way of saying that she was pretty nay more beautiful perhaps shes a glorious rider the first speaker was saying she passed me the other day going like sin with her face blazing and that big lively chestnut running flat the way she took that curve above the devils slide brought my heart into my mouth the breathless eavesdropper felt a hot wave of delight pour over her her very flesh seemed to ripple like the fur of a cat when it is stroked oh shes a picture mounted seems to have complete confidence in herself and the strength of a giantess too but my god when shes on her feet and have you heard her talk evidently the other speaker had for there came the sound of low laughter a sound that stabbed allie briskow like a bayonet and left her white and furious she sat motionless for a long time and something told her that as long as she lived she would never forget never forgive that laughter she was unusually silent and somber for the next three or four days she went through her exercises without vim at her studies she was both stupid and sullen when mrs rings patience was exhausted and her frayed nerves finally gave out allie rounded upon her with a violence unparalleled those previous exhibitions of temper were tame as compared with this one the girl spat scorn and bitterness and hatred she became a volcano in active eruption in a panic mrs ring sought out gus briskow and again resigned by this time however the novelty of her resignation had largely worn off for seldom did more than two weeks elapse without a hysterical threat to quit but this one required more than the usual amount of persuasion and it was not without long and patient pleading coupled with the periodical raise that the father induced her to change her mind gus told himself somberly that the price of alleghenys education was mounting so rapidly that it might be the part of economy to take mrs ring in as a full partner in the briskow oil wells he decided after some consideration to wire calvin gray and offer to pay his traveling expenses if he would come to burlington notch for a few days chapter xiv one accomplishment that allegheny mastered with gratifying ease was dancing it came naturally to her for both she and buddy were full of music at first she had been extremely selfconscious professor delamater had found her to be as heavy as stone and as awkward as a bear but later as her embarrassment became less painful she relaxed she regained her power of speech also and in time she voiced an eager desire to learn all there was to learn having quickly schooled her in the simpler forms of ballroom dancing delamater suggested a course in the deeper intricacies of fancy dancing youre getting on he told her one day that last was splendid top hole absolutely delamater who was quite thoroughly american affected at times an english turn to his conversation believing that it gave him an air it went particularly well he thought with light trousers spats and an afternoon coat cut close at the waist dont fool me panted the redfaced juno you must have iron feet my word spoof you indeed not for worlds if you know what i mean i shall expect to see you in the ballroom every evening but allies confidence forsook her at this id be scared stiff folks would laugh they havent got havent anything to do but laugh at other folks and i dont like to be laughed at laugh at you fancy that youre too modest delamater adopted the cooing note of a dove pon my word youre too modest if you could hear the things i hear he paused not knowing exactly what to say he had heard but his vagueness the very eloquence of his hesitation caused allies face to light up this was the second compliment paid her since her arrival at the notch therefore when the phonograph resumed its melodious measures she yielded herself with abandon to the arms of her partner and her red lips were parted her somber eyes were shining that day she began a course of exhibition dancing it was on that afternoon that delamater had told the clerk of discovering ma briskow alone in the woods there was an open golf tournament at the notch prominent amateurs and professionals were competing and the hotel was crowded to its capacity with players fashionable followers of the game and a small army of society reporters and sport writers this being the height of the season social doings at the resort were featured in all the large eastern papers for famous names were on the register and the hotel switch was jammed with private cars allie briskow was in one of her trying moods today for the outofdoors called to her sounds of laughter and gayety strains of music had distracted her from her studies her monotonous routine had become hopelessly unbearable all at once from her window she could see young people hear young voices and envy flamed in her soul those girls were her age those men easy immaculate different from anything she had ever seen except calvin gray they too were young and they courted those girls contemplation of the chattering throngs showed allie more clearly than ever the chasm separating her from these people and reawakened in her that black resentment which at times made her so difficult to manage she was thankful that her mother had disappeared and that her father was at the livery stable she hoped they would stay away all day at least they were safe from ridicule she wondered if she might not induce them to dine in their rooms that evening and thus spare herself the embarrassment she always suffered when she accompanied them into the public dining room it seemed to her that whenever they went to dinner gus in his baggy pepperandsalt sack suit his loose laydown collar and his widetoed shoes ma in one of her giddy gaudy dinner dresses it seemed as if the entire assemblage was stricken dumb and as if every eye was turned upon them in mockery and amusement even the waiters allie felt sure noted the difference between the briskows and the other guests and only with difficulty concealed their contempt the occasional presence of mrs ring handsome dignified unruffled intensified that contrast and fairly shouted the humiliating announcement that here were three nobodies who wanted to be somebodies but never could invariably when they went out in public together mrs ring made allie feel as if she belonged to a lower cruder order of animal life as if she were an inhabitant of another sphere and yet mrs ring was poor she worked for wages allie could not understand this phenomenon thought of it now caused her resentment to kindle of course it was the lot of the hapless tutoress to select such a moment as this in which to sweetly chide the girl for some lapse of form allie exploded she reduced the elder woman to tears then ashamed of herself she flung blindly out of the room crashing the door to behind her she decided to dance her anger away it was some consolation to know that she could dance as well or better than those slim and pampered beauties outside her window some consolation even though she never expected to have a chance of proving it delamater was especially agreeable today more than usually nattering not for some time did his scholar become conscious of the subtle change in his demeanor and even then its significance awoke only a shadowy contentment allie hated herself too thoroughly today to believe that anybody could really approve of her as for him he entirely misconstrued the meaning of her silent acceptance of his flattery they had become well acquainted by now and were on a basis of easy familiarity nevertheless it came as a shock to allie to be called by her first namesuch a shock that she missed a step and trod on delamaters foot they came to a pause the dancing master was tall and slim his face was on a level with hers and now he smiled into it saying my mistake my dear i reckon it was the girls eyes were glowing queerly and the man was amused at her evident agitation his first word had thrown the poor thing into a flurry they began to dance again and after a moment with a gently rising inflection delamater murmured you heard what i called you he approved of the sachet that allie used and he became acutely conscious of the jewels resting in the palm of his left hand the girl was rich and she was different unusual ever since she had learned to yield herself to his embrace he had been conscious of her strong physical attraction and now it got the better of him you dont care he said with his lips close to her ear humph im not caring for anything or anybody today somebody has hurt my little girl allie threw back her head and stared at him with quick suspicion your little girl she repeated it is the lot of any man in the heat of his desire to make mistakes and delamater erred gravely at this moment he kissed allie without warning he kissed her full and fair upon her red halfopen lips for the briefest instant of amazement the two stood motionless in the middle of the polished floor while the phonograph brayed on then allie shook herself free of her partner and in the same movement she smote him a mighty slap that sent him reeling delamater saw stars the constellation of orion gleamed in dazzling splendor within his tightly shut lids he collided with a chair and went sprawling with a cry he scrambled to his feet what the hell he growled savagely allies face was chalky breathlessly curiously she inquired whad you do that for what did i do it for say you ought to be complimented tickled to death delamater rubbed his cheek and glared at her by god i wish you were a man oh dont worry i wont touch you again who the hell would after that allie opened her lips to speak but he ran on more angrily as the pain bit into him thought i meant it eh why you lumbering ox then you aint in love with me or or anything love the speaker uttered an unpleasant sound indicative of scorn wake up sister what dyou take me for why your mother talks bird talk and your dad lives in a box stall and eats oats with his knife here i kid you along a little bit slip you a little kiss as i would any girl and you you delamater stuttered impotently love i guess im the first regular fellow that ever gave you a chance delamater was surprised when his pupil turned her back upon him strode to the nearest window and flung it open as if for air his surprise deepened when she faced him again and moved in his direction her expression caused him to utter a profane warning but she continued to bear down upon him and when she reached out to seize him he struck at her as he would have struck at a man to those who are familiar with burlington notch it will be remembered that the hotel is pitched upon a slope and that the rooms on the first floor of the east wing are raised a considerable distance above the lawn the windows of these east rooms overlook the eighteenth green and during tournaments they are favorite vantage points of golf widows and enthusiasts who are too old to follow the competitors around the course today they were filled for an international title was at issue and herring prince of amateurs was playing off the final round of his match with the dour scotch professional mcleod a highly enthusiastic gallery accompanied the pair a crowd composed not only of spectators but also of officials defeated players newspaper writers camera men caddies and the like they streamed up the final fairway behind the gladiators and for the moment they were enveloped in gloom for herring had sliced off the seventeenth tee and a marvelous recovery together with a good approach had still left his ball on the edge of the green while mcleod man of iron had laid his third shot within three feet of the flag it meant a sure four for the latter with not less than a five for herring one of those golfing miracles a fortyfoot putt would halve the match to be sure but in tournament golf miracles have a way of occurring on any except the deciding hole sympathy usually follows the amateur therefore it was a silent throng that ranged itself about the gently undulating expanse of velvet sod in the shadow of the east wing herring had played a wonderful match he stood for all that is clean and fine in golf the end of the balcony was jammed nearly every window framed eager faces amid a breathless intensity of interest the youthful contender tested the turf with the head of his club and studied the run of the green a moment then he took his stance and swung his putter smoothly the ball sped away taking a curving course and followed by five hundred pairs of eyes it ran too swiftly herring in desperation had overplayed but no it lost momentum as it topped a rise then gathered speed all but died at the edge of the cup and toppled in amid a salvo of handclaps and roar of bravo that was nerve courage skill that was golf the miracle had happened another hole to decide the match quickly the crowd became still again as mcleod his teeth set upon the stem of his pipe his stony face masking a murderous disappointment stepped forward to run down his four the silence was broken by a cry out of the air overhead came the sound of a disturbance and every face turned a most amazing thing was in the way of happening a phenomenon unique in the history of tournaments for a man was being thrust forth from one of the hotel windows perhaps twentyfive feet above the ground a writhing struggling kicking man with fawncolored spats he was being ejected painlessly but firmly and by a girl a grimfaced young woman of splendid proportions for a moment she allowed him to dangle then she dropped him into a handsome dorothy perkins rosebush he landed with a shriek briefly the amazon remained framed in the casement staring with dark defiance down into the upturned faces her deep bosom was heaving her smoky hair was slightly disarranged she allowed her eyes to rest upon the figure entangled among the thorns beneath her then she closed the window nothing like this had ever occurred in scotland the mighty mcleod missed his putt and took a five as allie briskow passed through the lobby with her head erect and her fists clenched she heard the sound of a great shouting outside and she believed it was directed at her she fled into her room and flung herself upon her bed sobbing hoarsely mrs ring was waiting on the veranda for gus briskow when he returned to the hotel about dark he had learned to dread the sight of her on that veranda for it was her favorite resigning place what gus called her quitting spot and it was evident tonight that she was in a quitting mood a mood more hysterical than ever before it was some time before he could get at the facts and even then he could not fully appreciate the enormity of the disgrace that had overwhelmed allies instructress she chucked the dancin teacher out of a winder he repeated blankly what for goodness knows mr briskow something he said or did i couldnt make out precisely i found her in a dreadful state and i tried to comfort her i did really but oh if you could have heard her where she learned such language i dont know my ears burn but that isnt the worst you should hear what he must of said something pretty low down briskow spoke quietly his bright blue eyes were hard i reckon shell tell me you dont understand chattered the woman she flung the man bodily out of the window and into a bed of thorns it nearly killed him he was painfully lacerated and bruised and right in the middle of a golf game it did something dreadful i dont know what just as the worlds champion caught the ball or something if hes crippled ill get him that much easier said briskow and at the purposeful expression upon his weatherbeaten face mrs ring uttered a faint bleat of terror she pawed at him as he undertook to pass her oh my heavens what are you going to do depends on what he said to allie the woman wrung her hands what people what savages youre going to shoot him i suppose just because yesm the father nodded you got it right motif an all just because you cant i shant permit it i ill call the police dont do that maam ive stood a lot from you in one way or another but its murder you you cant mean it moans issued from the speaker what ever possessed me to accept this position its unendurable and ill be involved ive saw your last raise miz ring do you think id stay after this its bad enough to be made ridiculous the whole hotel is in laughter laughter at me i dare say as much as at her imagine hurling a fullgrown man from a window i dont hear nobody laughing briskow swung his head slowly from side to side but to contemplate murder whats more i dont intend to hear nobody laugh by god now i come to think about it there aint agoin to be no laughing at all around here gus continued slowly to swing his head like a bear shes my kid he pushed past mrs ring still muttering my kid there aint agoin to be no laughing at all going directly to the desk he asked for the manager then stood aside hat in hand until the latter made his appearance the manager began a hasty and rather mixed apology on behalf of the hotel for what had occurred in the dancing room but his tone of annoyance was an accusation in itself it was plain that to his mind the catastrophe on the eighteenth green outweighed in importance whatever may have led up to it that was something actually tragic something frightful appalling it involved the good name of the hotel and affected the worlds golf title very unfortunate he lamented we havent heard the last of it by any means mcleod may file a protest and there is something to be said on both sides rather a nice question in fact probly so the father agreed an i got something to say about it too get that dancin perfessor off the place quick or ill kill him the manager recoiled his startled eyes searched briskows face incredulously i beg pardon i aint heard my kids side of the story yet but im goin to see her now so you better get word to that jumpin jack in a hurry that is if you want to save him he is discharged of course for we tolerate no rudeness on the part of our employees or our guests for that matter but i believe he is suffering some effects from the shock i couldnt well ask him to go before itll take me probly twenty minutes talkin to my girl thatll give him time if he moves fast but i may get through in fifteen at the door to his suite gus briskow paused to wipe his countenance clean of the expression it had worn for the last few minutes and when he entered it was with his usual friendly smile allie and her mother were waiting they were white and silent gus kissed his daughter before saying dont worry honey he wont bother you no more allie averted her face mrs briskow inquired did you see the skunk no i give him a few minutes to clear out hadnt we better leave too ventured allie ohh in mas eyes was such bleak dismay such a piteous appeal that gus shook his head what fer we got nice quarters and your ma likes it here theyre laughing at me i heard em hollering they wont laugh long no youre learnin fast and were all havin a nice time only one thing im kinda tired of that miz ring i let her go but ill get you another she quit eh umm not exactly i i dont blame her ive been mighty mean but i couldnt help it pa when you put a wild horse in a pen it dont do to prod him and throw things and thats what theyve done to me i bite and kick like any bronc when youre hurt constant you get spells when youve got to hurt back ive been rotten to her and now this coming on top of it whad that dancin dude do anyhow allie related her experience with professor delamater she told it all up to the burst of shouting that followed her through the lobby you should of heard em yelling clapping their hands i she choked her voice failed her miserably she concluded i wish to god wed never struck oil youre just wore out dearie her mother said comfortingly and briskow agreed he assured her that all would be well all was not well however the next morning when gus briskow was about to leave the hotel as usual professor delamater having departed hurriedly the evening before with fully four minutes of his twenty to spare he was stopped by the manager who requested him to give up his rooms the texan was bewildered he could not understand the reason for such a request aint i paid my bills he queried the manager assured him that he had he was profoundly regretful as a matter of fact but it so happened that the briskow suite had been reserved early in the season and the party who had made the reservation had just wired that he was arriving that day he was a gentleman of importance it was indeed unfortunate the management appreciated mr briskows patronage they hoped he and his family would return to the notch sometime mebbe you got some other rooms that would do us gus ventured it was too bad but the hotel was overcrowded later perhaps now at that very moment the lobby was filled with tournament golfers who were leaving on the morning train and briskow knew it he studied the speaker with an expression that caused the latter extreme discomfort it was much the same expression he had worn the night before when he had served warning upon delamater lemme get this right he said you can talk straight to me bein ignerunt i aint got the same feelins as these other folks got i got a shell like a land turtle it is quite customary i assure you no offense my dear sir thats how i figgered just bouncin a lowdown var mint aint offense enough to be throwed out about when you pay your bills you quite misapprehend fired eh it ll go hard with ma shes gainin here and she likes it thats why i never told her you was chargin us about double what you charge these rich folks the manager stiffened i regret exceedingly sir that you take it this way but there is nothing more to be said is there it was with a heavy heart and a heavy tread that briskow returned to his room ma took the announcement like a death blow for it meant the end of all her dreams all her joyous games of pretend her mountains those clean green friendly mountains that she loved with a passion so intense that she fairly ached those and her caves her waterfalls her gypsy band were to be taken from her she was to be banished exiled she did not weep a great deal but she seemed suddenly to grow older and more bent listlessly laboriously she began to pack and her husband noticed with a pang that her hands shook wretchedly as for allie she told herself that this was the end she had tried to make something of herself and had failed she had crucified herself she had bled her body and scourged her soul only to gain ridicule and disgrace there was no use of trying further gray had been mistaken in her and her misery her shame at the realization was intolerable there was no facing him after this allie decided to do away with herself chapter xv gus briskow was waiting at the cashiers desk for his bill when the bustle of incoming guests told him that the morning train had arrived probably it had brought that gentleman of importance to whom the manager had referred to hell with people like that manager the texan muttered he would take his family back home and chance no more humiliations like this and to think that he had allowed that dancing monkey to escape when he could have shot him as well as not briskows chain of thought was broken by a slap on the back that nearly drove him through the cashiers window then by a loud cheery greeting the next moment he found himself actually embraced by gus could not believe his eyes by calvin gray the latters affectionate greeting his frank delight at seeing the texan caused people in the lobby to center amused attention upon them and induced those behind the desk to regard briskow with new respect gus you precious pirate my but im glad to see you ma and allie are well i know they couldnt be otherwise here great place isnt it nothing in this country or europe that compares with it and ive sent dozens of my friends here i came north on business and couldnt bear to go back without seeing you come give me a welcome for ive traveled across three states to get here the two stood hand in hand gray beamed approvingly gus too was smiling but earnestly he said im right glad to see you mr gray for were in trouble trouble what sort not illness no were leavin been throwed out the younger mans face sobered dont joke he cried sharply i aint joking feller insulted allie and she throwed him out of a window exactly its in the morning paper they dont seem to think it was reefined so they throwed us out nonsense why it is a corking story and allie was splendid she gave the championship to herring who deserved it thereby delighting every golfer on this side of the atlantic jove that girl is developing and im going to hug her if theres no window handy throw you out why theres some mistake surely briskow shook his head in greater detail he made known the facts when he had finished his halting recital calvin grays face was flushed with anger there was a dark frown between his eyes well see he muttered wait here or go back and tell ma to commence unpacking then he was gone for perhaps ten minutes gus waited nervously he was amazed finally to see gray approaching arm in arm with the manager both were laughing the hotel mans face was radiant with good humor to the departing guest he said genially you are not going to leave us after all mr briskow on the contrary we are going to keep you at the notch as long as youll stay stupid misunderstanding on my part and i apologize im going to ask you to move but into a better suite the very best one we have and the rate will be the same come what do you say when he was met by a stammered protest he insisted forcefully i shant take no for an answer my dear sir we simply refuse to let you leave the best we have is yours and i guarantee that you will be made comfortable he offered to extend you the courtesies of the house make you guests of the hotel gray added but i knew you wouldnt accept dunnos i want to stay at all gus murmured angrily we aint no bettern we was a half hour ago to be sure but ive made you better known you are too shy you didnt afford my friend here the pleasure of making your acquaintance and i had to tell him the sort of person you really are serves you right gus for being so exclusive gad i think ill give you a few lessons in democracy now then come along im dying to see ma as the father trotted down the hall beside his swiftly striding deliverer he gasped howd you do it nothing simpler i merely showed mr whatshisname that he was making an ass of himself ive spent a fortune here know the owners too nice chap that manager but he has no business running a hotel and i so informed him hell probably annoy you to death with his attentions hell let you play shinny in the halls if you want to now wait the speaker laid a finger upon his lips his eyes were dancing he knocked sharply at the briskow door and cried baggage ready maam there was a stir from within the door was slowly opened by a bent pathetic figure of grief ma gray cried and he held out his arms perhaps it was his virile personality radiating confidence security or perhaps it was gus briskows shining face that told the story whatever the fact ma briskow uttered a thin broken wail then walked into those open arms and laid her head upon grays breast she clung to him eagerly and the tears she had been blinking so hard to restrain flowed silently ohnh we aint goinaway she said we aint goin away of course not gus misunderstood the manager merely wanted you to move into a larger finer suite and he is positively distressed at the thought of your leaving the poor man is dashing about collecting an armful of roses for you and allie he wants to come in person and apologize there was another sound and gray looked up to see allie standing in the doorway to her bedroom with one hand she clutched the jamb the other was pressed to her bosom she was staring at him as at an apparition the girl was quite colorless there was a look almost of fright in her eyes and when he came toward her she swayed weakly her hands when he took them were icy it shocked him to see how worn how weary she had grown it was several hours later in the parlor of the new suite a spacious sunny room fragrant with flowers and cheerful with brilliant cretonnes gray and briskow were talking allie and her mother could be seen in their bedrooms putting away the last of their belongings grays eyes had been drawn at frequent intervals to the younger woman for the change in her became the more amazing the more he observed her and he was still striving to reconcile this creature to the picture he had held in his mind in a few months allie had become almost a stranger to him it was a marked and yet a subtle change that had come over her she was anything but a polished young woman of course nevertheless she had been modified toned down vastly improved and not until her first queer emotion at seeing him had disappeared was the full extent of that improvement manifest to the newcomer he wondered why she had acted so oddly at first surely she did not fear him no allies face at this moment was alight with supreme joy and satisfaction she appeared to be quite as happily at her ease as ma who was singing steadily in a thin rusty voice gray sent the father away on some pretext finally then he called to allie come in here and talk to me i am a guest and i demand entertainment he observed with silent approval her carriage as she entered the room and accepted the chair he offered her faint trace of the nesters daughter here i want a good chance to look at you allie colored faintly i guess im not much to look at hmm you dont in the least resemble that girl i found hoeing in the garden you are terribly thin spinach said allie dieting eh yes spinach and water and a rubber suit sometimes i have a party and eat a whole soda cracker it isnt too high a price to pay for beauty beauty the fading rainbows pride we men should thank heaven for womens courage in pursuing it it is all that makes this world an attractive dwelling place for nice people sometimes i think its kind of wicked to spend so much time and money that way but i guess its all right i want to look as good as other people im in a mood for quotations is beauty vain because it will fade then are earths green robe and heavens light vain pride even vanity is less of a vice than slovenliness my dear now then do you like mrs ring allie nodded i like her but i hate her she makes me feel awful mad because she cant understand that i aint i am not mad at her but at myself i dont hardly know how to explain it if i was her id hate me like i do would you like to have her remain oh i would she knows everything and she makes me learn but she wont stay i just found out that shes been quitting every few weeks and pas been raising her wages no the disgrace and our being thrown out my dear girl let me assure you once for all there is no suggestion of disgrace about this affair you behaved with spirit and those who have heard about it admire you i have talked with a number of them and i know i had a talk with mrs ring also and she will remain if you wish her to do so youre a a good man aint arent arent you mr gray you fix everything not a good but a convenient man my specialty is making things easier for my friends are these other folks these rich ones around the hotel like you oh much nicer than i gray laughed you must meet some of them allies face whitened at this suggestion please sir im scared very well as you wish tell me what are you going to do with me this afternoon i dunno allie looked blank i dont do anything but study i spose i got to study nothing of the sort you have circles under your eyes now from overwork and this is your vacation i am a visitor a restless visitor i abhor being asked to make myself at home and i never do i demand amusement do you know what id like to do best of all allie did not know id like to sit here and smoke while you show me all your pretty dresses ah those dark eyes brighten youre dying to show them to me arent you would you honest cross my heart but remember i have a color sense and im not easily pleased ill probably condemn some of them allie breathed deeply oh gee she said run along and try them on then ill borrow a pair of puttees and well go for a ride for the next two hours allegheny briskow was in heaven never had she dreamed of anything like this to have calvin gray alone all to herself ma as usual had disappeared and to discuss with him exciting questions of dress and good taste that she could not discuss with her own people to meet his occasional hearty approval well it was enough to make a girl drunk with happiness gowns that he liked became precious she hated those that he condemned her fingers grew clumsy with haste her cheeks burned he said she wore her clothes well that she carried herself well he approved of her liked her god above and to think that she had contemplated suicide of course she was pitifully ignorant as yet and she had not even learned to talk as he talked but there were books she would study oh the fury with which she would apply herself after this she would beat the contents of those books into her head with her fists if necessary she would show him how fast she could learn she would astonish him her heart sang at the thought that she was rich richer than he that would count too for men liked money where is ma gray inquired when the last gown had been paraded and when allie appeared in her riding suit out with the fairies i suppose she wont tell pa or me where she goes or what she does says its all foolishness perhaps she will tell me for i believe in fairies gray said seriously allie smiled at him i reckon she will folks tell you most anything you want them to i reckon this was the busiest hour of the afternoon gray had purposely ordered the horses sent around at a time when he knew that the veranda the walks and the tennis courts would be filled for ever since his interview with the hotel manager a plan had been shaping in his mind and already he had dropped a few words a hint or two here and there that were calculated to stimulate interest in allie briskow it gratified his craving for the theatric now to lead the girl out before so many curious eyes for himself he knew that he commanded attention and as he noted the lines of this young juno he could find nothing in her that needed betterment allies suit was the latest smartest thing in riding habits and it set off her magnificent figure as nothing else could systematic exercise and hard work like the final touch of a skilled sculptor had given it beauty and refinement harmony and proportion had destroyed the impression of unusual size how deep was her bosom how smooth and flowing were her curves how superbly tall she was as a thing of flesh and blood she made these other women look like females of an insignificant race it thrilled him pleasantly to observe the confidence with which she swung herself into the saddle and the instant mastery she exercised over her restless mount no timidity there no need of assistance no absurd hampering skirts and artificial posture either but a seat astride as befits anyone who chooses to honor the king of fourfooted creatures under cover gray noted allies effect upon her attentive audience and he smiled if only he could spend a few days here he would make her a woman to be sought after by some of the best people she refused to meet them eh well that would be as it was to be weve been having supper in our rooms lately she told him when they returned at dark youre going to eat with us ain arent you i am to be sure but not in your rooms he declared id rather youd rather do exactly what would please me now wouldnt you yes sir then run along and put on that dinner dress that i liked best and tell ma to look her prettiest too well not spoil this day it was seventhirty when gray in evening clothes appeared at the briskow suite allie told herself there had never been a man so handsome so distinguished so godlike as he god she now felt sure must wear full dress gus briskow beamed as the visitor smiled approvingly at his daughter she is purty aint she dont look much like the girl i sent to dallas for fixins allie is more then pretty shes regal such another peerless queen only could her mirror show but her head is turned already gus dont spoil her the speaker stood with arms folded and head lowered while he studied the girl impersonally allie wore an expensive black lace dress sleeveless and sufficiently low of neck to display her charms plain a little too somber gray declared she can afford colors ornaments jove id like some time to see her in something oriental something barbaric the next time im in new york ill select a gown ma briskow entered at the moment greatly flustered and extremely selfconscious and here certainly was no lack of ornamentation or of color ma wore all her jewelry and her dress was an elaborate creation of brilliant jade green from one shoulder of which depended a filmy streamer of green chiffon in her desire to gild the lily she had knotted a roman scarf about her waist a scarf of many colors of red of yellow of purple of blue of orange a very spectrum of vivid stripes and it utterly ruined her it lent her an air of extreme superfluity it was as if she had put on everything except the bedspread you said to look my nicest she bubbled so i done the best i could you are lovely both of you but this is my party isnt it i can do anything i please gray looked from one to the other in eager inquiry then let me fix you my way ma briskow your face is too sweet too gentle to be spoiled your charm is in your simplicity here i have it with swift impetuosity he untied the scarf and whipped it from mas waist watch me now and youll see im right with his penknife he cut the threads that held the chiffon streamer in place and removed it voila even so little and we see an adorable motherly person richly but unostentatiously gowned dont you agree with me without pausing for an answer he wheeled upon the daughter and drew her into the range of a pier glass now close your eyes and keep them closed around allies hips he flung the scarf drew it snug and smooth then knotted it next he snatched the length of chiffon and bound it about her head his touch was deft and certain a moment and it had been fashioned to suit him then he stood back and eyed the tout ensemble gorgeous he cried genuinely enthusiastic that was the touch i defy any costumer to better it open your eyes oh gypsy princess and what do you see it it sort of makes a difference doesnt it allie said a difference gray flung aloft his hands in exaggerated despair heaven help me i am inspired i have a flash of genius a divine impulse and with a magic pass i work a miracle i transform you from something somber dark morose into a creature of life of passion of allurement he groaned and you stand there like a stalagmite why girl look at yourself darned if she dont look like a pitcher i seen somers on an almanac gus declared aha a man with a soul a human being who sees beauty where i see it an artist with my fire gray burst into infectious laughter and the others joined him this proved to be an evening when people really did turn their heads as the briskows were shown to their table but for once allie suffered no embarrassment for she felt sure they were looking at calvin gray and in the shining glory of his presence she knew that she and her parents were invisible it was the sort of situation in which gray appeared to best advantage so he talked incessantly during the meal and in a key that kept his companions unconscious of their surroundings on their way out they passed the entrance to the ballroom and paused to look in the beat of the music swayed allie unconsciously then before she knew it grays arm was around her waist and he was guiding her out upon the floor oh nno she gasped she stumbled but he drew her closer saying im proud of you and i want you to show these people that you dance even better than you ride allie rose to the challenge about midnight calvin gray strolled outdoors for a breath of fresh air before retiring he glowed with the consciousness of a worthy deed well done he had come to the notch expecting to spend one night but events of the last few hours had induced him to change his plans and he now made up his mind to stay several days he was burning to be back in the oil fields to be sure every hour away from them was an hour wasted and although he told himself it was his feud that drew him he knew better as a matter of fact when he thought of texas it was of wichita falls and when he visualized the latter place it was to picture a cottage with the paint off or a small office with the sign tom and bob parker real estate and insurance he had been eagerly selfishly counting the hours until his return but here it seemed was work to be done a task that he alone could accomplish and his decision to remain had been made final when allie briskow told him with tremulous earnestness that he had saved her life when she confessed that she had intended to kill herself and why naturally gray had put no faith in that wild declaration nevertheless it was plain that the girl that all three briskows needed a friend to guide them he sighed with resignation but reflected that inasmuch as he had put his hand to the plow he must turn the furrow after all he could well afford to spare a week to put that girl on the road to happiness chapter xvi from the day of their first meeting henry nelson and calvin gray had clashed no two people could be more different in disposition and temper hence it was only natural that every characteristic every action of the one should have aroused the others antagonism nelson was a cool selfish calculating plodder with little imagination and less originality he thought in grooves his was a splendid type of mind for a banker he had but one weak point viz a villainous temper a capacity for blind vindictive rage a weakness truly for a man who dealt in money but a weakness that lent him a certain humanity and without which he would have been altogether too mechanical too colorless too efficient nature seldom errs by making supermen a drab man in many ways nelson was extraordinary mainly in this that his mind followed straight obvious channels and that never except under the urge of extreme passion did he depart from the strictly logical line of action in this of course he was superior to the average person who too frequently undertakes the unusual calvin grays ebullience his dash his magnificence of demeanor could be nothing less than an affront to such a man nelson could see in him only a pompous braggart an empty arrogant strutter age and easy success had not improved the bankers apoplectic turn of mind hence grays defiant declaration of war his impudent assurance that the recent misfortunes to the house of nelson were the direct results of his own deliberate efforts had proven almost unendurable in the first place nelson could not imagine a man making such a declaration it was new to his entire experience and contrary to his code it was unconservative therefore it staggered him it was in fact a phenomenon so unique as to leave him numb he told himself that it must have been the act of a madman or a fool under no circumstances could he conceive of himself warning an enemy of his intentions on the contrary when he undertook to crush a rival he went about it slyly secretly in the only regular and proper way as a matter of fact it had come as a disagreeable surprise to learn that his former comrade at arms cherished any resentment whatever toward him for he had thought his tracks were well covered what left the banker actually gasping however that which he came back to with unfailing astonishment was grays effrontery in coming to wichita falls to boast of his accomplishments that bespoke such contempt such supreme selfconfidence in his ability to wreak further damage that nelson wanted to shout aloud his rage and his defiance following the departure of his two callers on that day of the meeting in the bank nelson closed his desk and went home he could work no more for several days thereafter he was an unpleasant person to do business with on mature consideration what amazed him as much as anything else was the fact that gray had made good in so short a time and in such a big way evidently however it was only another story of a lucky break and an overnight fortune a common occurrence these days but it was doubly unfortunate under the circumstances for already nelson was carrying a load equal to his strength and he told himself that he could not afford to be distracted even temporarily by the irresponsible actions of a maniac one never could tell what a madman would do and gray had confessed himself a madman a fanatic of the most dangerous type there was but one course of action open viz to eliminate him destroy him without delay that was no easy task even in these lawless times but the stakes were too high to permit of half measures there must be a way one would have to be careful of course not to put oneself too much in the power of unscrupulous people and alas the world was full of unscrupulous people it was a pity that people could be so unscrupulous as to take advantage of a bargain made in good faith that was blackmail however the prestige of the nelson name was great the power of its money was potent and henry believed that he could protect himself from eventualities after cautious deliberation he sent word to one of his men in the ranger field that he wished to see him the man came promptly and when he left henry nelsons house after a conference he carried with him a perfectly clear idea why he had been sent for this despite the fact that he had not been told in so many words he knew for instance that a certain calvin gray had become a menace to his employers so dangerous that it was worth to them a substantial fortune to be rid of him and that while henry nelson could under no circumstances countenance anything illegal anything savoring of violence nevertheless if some accident should befall gray if some act of god should put an end to him there would be no disposition on henrys part to question the divine origin of that calamity furthermore the speaker had made it plain that if providence did take a hand in some such mysterious manner he would then be in a position amply to reward his employee for many acts of loyalty that had apparently passed unrecognized for instance profitable deals were forever coming up new acreage was constantly being acquired and it would be easy to carry a third party for an interest which was bound to make that third party rich all this was expressed with admirable vagueness but the man understood so much accomplished nelson went to dallas and there undertook to learn something about the size of calvin grays profits who was behind him and the extent of their backing and what his prospects were he followed every avenue of information he even went so far as to hire an investigator and send him north to look up grays record and to follow his tracks as far back as possible nelson was reconnoitering behind the enemys lines and testing the strength of his position when he returned home gray was gone whither he could not learn as the days passed without further developments nelson began to believe that he had had a bad dream and that gray had merely been talking to hear his own voice he devoutly hoped that such would prove to be the case a time came however when his apprehensions were roused afresh and it was barbara parker who rekindled them she had come to the bank with an excellent proposition and was doing her best to sell it in the course of her conversation she referred to gray in a manner that gave nelson cause for thought ive looked this lease over bob was saying and ive seen the books it has been producing a hundred and fifty barrels a day steadily production like that is cheap at a thousand dollars a barrel it is worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars henry why is it offered for seventyfive bob shrugged how did a boll weevil like this jackson ever make even a hundredandfiftybarrel well in the first place where did he get the money to drill he is sick of the game i suppose and would be satisfied to get his money back with a reasonable profit it is a find really looks so for a fact how did you get on to it bob purely by chance through a man named mallow a scientist of some sort with a magic tester the girl laughed dont know him mallow is as queer as the rest of his kind and i put no faith in his story until i investigated but the well is there and doing a hundred and fifty barrels as regular as clockwork youll have no trouble in selling it then youre not interested interested yes indeed nelson nodded im quite excited as a matter of fact but i cant handle it at this particular time frankly im glad you cant barbara told him for now i can sell it to mr gray gray henry looked up quickly if you wanted it for him why did you bring it to me because mr mallow insisted he felt sure youd jump at it besides mr gray is away and prompt action is necessary ill wire him at once and ask him to accept my judgment will he do so the girl colored faintly at the tone of this inquiry perhaps i think he believes in me and thats more than you do its mighty flattering to a girl to have a man like mr gray believe in her why i am practically his agent he buys and sells through me whenever he can hes buying and selling is he he said something about entering this field in a big way hes in bobs eyes were sparkling oh things are looking up for dad and me mr gray is a real miracle man isnt he when this question evoked no response the girl inquired curiously tell me are you and he such good friends as he says you are does he say we are good friends umm well he speaks admiringly of you and if people admire me i love them he thinks you are a remarkably capable person a determined fighter i think he called you that should be high praise coming from a fellow officer he probably outlined his plans to you he did nelson spoke dryly i assumed that he was relying on your judgment and taking your tips why how so because he has bought so much land alongside of yours where barbara was surprised i why i supposed you knew after a moment of hesitation she said i think id better keep my mouth closed just the same he couldnt have done better than to follow your lead that is the first compliment i ever paid you henry ive paid you enough and i do believe in you bob but im not the flattering kind hes a great ladies man i wonder if he is going to make me jealous you jealous coming from wichitas most emotionless banker from the cold county croesus that speech is almost a a declaration miss parker laughed frankly why henry my haughty little nose is turning up i can feel it but alas it proves your insincerity if you had faith in my judgment youd pick up this snap with some hesitation the man said were in deep bob awfully deep and things havent gone as well as they should lately its temporary of course but it would require an extraordinary effort at this time to take on anything new thats the worst of this oil game it takes so much money to protect your holdings it doesnt pay to prospect land for the benefit of your neighbor the risks are too great gray has been pretty attentive to you hasnt he thats a part of the man he is attentive to everybody i have received more candy and flowers and delightful little surprises than in all my short neglected life i didnt know you liked candy i dont but i adore getting it the thought counts i dont care much for canaries either i have such bad luck with them but he sent me the dearest thing from new york a tiny mechanical bird with actual feathers and it sings it is a really truly yellow canary in a beautiful gold cage and when you press a spring it perks its head opens its beak flirts its tail and utters the most angelic song it must have cost a fortune couldnt you love a man who would think of a present like that hmm could you oh im joking of course bob said seriously we are merely business associates mr gray and i but he has the faculty of taking his personality into his business and thats why i know he is bound to make a great success some day nelson said with an effort at lightness when we have finished with this infernal oil excitement and the fever has subsided perhaps ill have a chance to well to play ladies man it wont last long im sure it wont laughed the girl youd never make a go of it henry i mean this boom wont last these fools think it will but it wont while it does last we busy men have no time for anything else no chance to think of anything no room in our minds the speaker stared gloomily into space he shook his head when a fellow is worried about important matters he neglects the little things to me that is the tragedy of this oil excitement it devours everything fine in us i wonder if the little things of life arent after all the most important mind you im not hinting i dont want your attentions i wouldnt have time for them anyhow for im just as feverish as anybody else but in the midst of all these new concerns these sudden millions this overnight success our ambitious schemes we are forgetting the things that really count gentleness courtesy love home children theyre pretty big henry candy and roses and yellow canaries too but the speaker rose briskly i didnt come here to talk about them i came here to sell you an oil well sorry you cant take it when she had gone nelson sat in a frowning study for some time so it was not all a bad dream what could be grays object in buying acreage adjoining his was it faith in his nelsons judgment a desire to ride to success on the tail of his enemys kite or did it mean a war of offsets drilling operations the instant a well came in more likely the latter if the maniac really meant what he had said that promised to be an expensive and a hazardous undertaking on grays part that was playing the game on a scale too big for the fellows limited resources and yet it might be well to study the maps yes and it was like grays effrontery to pay deliberate court to bob parker knowing his rivals feelings toward the girl another insult the upstart certainly possessed an uncanny dexterity in pricking armor joints but what if gray were in earnest bob had become a wonderfully desirable creature she was the most attractive girl in wichita falls it was a thought that had not previously presented itself to henry wilson and it disturbed him now he was glad indeed that he had sent to ranger for that field man in and around the office of mcwade stoner these were busy days what with a couple of new wildcat promotions and a well going down on semiproven ground that lease which cornered into the nelson holdings and to which stoner had called attention it had been easy to sell stock in the latter enterprise and now the deeper went the hole the higher rose the hopes of the promoters stoner himself was directing operations and he had named the well avenger number one today he and his partner had been listening to mallow who concluded an earnest discourse with these words nelson and her are pardners in one deal and hes stuck on her if anybody can put it over shes the one if he buys that well itll be the biggest laugh this town ever had mcwade declared buy it a hundred and fifty barrels in the heart of settled production for seventyfive thousand i bet hell buy it think the boss will stand for that kind of a deal why not they cant hang it on him and heaven knows im honest he said nothing crooked mallow snorted say i bet you believe in santa claus grays a great man and what makes him great is that he does his own crooked work stoner was inclined to agree with mallows measure of their associate thats how i got him figgered his honesty talk didnt go far with me and i dont believe hell kick at anything hes willing to pay any price to break this banker but you cant bankrupt a feller unless you rip his coin loose you cant ask him to please loosen if we make a well of the avenger well force him to shoot maybe a hundred thousand right away and that may cramp him for a while but suppose he makes the turn and hits it like we do weve made him that much stronger havent we gray plans to keep him spending faster than he can get it in and thats all right if it works but if mallow can bilk him for seventyfive thousand at one fell swipe well ill bet my best gold tooth that the boss will stand the shock like a man i think youve both got gray all wrong said mcwade hes too smart to be crooked this was a statement so absurd that mallow proceeded to riddle it it was upon its face a contradiction for none but smart men could be crooked and the laws of logic proved the converse to be equally true stoner sat in frowning silence while the argument raged but he broke in finally ive always wanted to pull a real salting job just to show how easy it is to gyp the cagy ones not an oilcan job like this but something big this looks like the piscological moment lay off i tell you mcwade cried were a legitimate firm solid as gibraltar and safe as a church thats our motto and weve got to live up to it i came into wichita on the roof of a pullman im going out in a drawingroom me and sin are strangers nothing sinful about my idea mac one fall or two wont break nelson weve got to spill him hard if we can pick up a few pennies ourselves in the process why thats legitimate the dealer is entitled to his percentage aint he now listen everybodys getting set for a big play over in arkansas as you know salting away cheap acreage and waiting for some of the wildcats to come in well last year i had a tool dresser from up there nice boy but he got pneumonia and it turned into the con so i took him home hes back on his farm now coughing his life away and doing a little bootleggin to keep body and cough together hes got a big place but its all run down and so poor you couldnt raise a dust on it with a bellows it would be a christian act to help him sell that goat pasture for enough to go to some nice warm country where hed get well and they couldnt extradite him of course if youve got a scheme that is perfectly safe mcwade ventured charitably and our bit was worth it i been thinking we might help the boy sell that farm to nelson how mallow too was curious nelsons lungs are healthy he wouldnt cough a nickel unless the place had oil on it i meant to tell you its got oil on it best indications i ever saw theres a drinking well only the water aint fit to drink till you skim off the rainbow then theres a wonderful seepage into the creek you can see the oil oozing out from under the bank in one place certainly is pretty stoners hearers were intent they exchanged puzzled glances mallow was the first to speak come on whats the joker i aint saying youd murder the guy for that farm but if its as good as that hed of died of the plague or something and left it to you long before this in a way im getting ahead of my story stoner continued imperturbably the oil aint actually visible but it will be if when and as henry nelson gets ready to buy it easy enough to pour oil into a water well i suppose but that wouldnt fool a child as for salting running water a creek show me theres a lot for you to learn in this business mallow the point is can we lay nelson against a bunch of acreage like that you could lay me against it if it looks like you say it does mcwade declared this bootlegger being half dead and non compost mentis would help put it over with a man like nelson hed set him in a draught while he was signing the option ill guarantee the seepage to last for a month even if he has the well bailed out every day and the creek will carry oil for half a mile would your onelunged friend know how to play in would he it was his idea and all that kept us off of it last year was the fact that the oil would have to be hauled about thirty miles and we didnt have the price between us to hire a truck for some time the trio discussed the various angles of stoners proposition endeavoring if possible to devise some natural way of intriguing the interest of henry nelson on this score mcwade had fewer apprehensions than did his companions his contention being that it mattered not how the matter was brought to the bankers attention so long as the property would stand investigation nelson was bound to be suspicious anyhow and a sale depended entirely upon the character of the oil showing mcwades coolness toward the enterprise it transpired was occasioned not by a loftier sense of rectitude than his associates displayed but by lingering doubts as to the profits involved not until brick declared that his tubercular friend would accede to any arrangement he saw fit to make did the junior partner fall in with the proposal if its a fair square deal all around im for it the latter finally agreed but we cant afford to have any guy squawking that we did him up especially if hes only got one lung to holler with were a legitimate firm and weve got to treat our clients right i think a fiftyfifty split would be reasonable stoner too thought that would be about right and so it was left mallow was highly enthusiastic this will be a great surprise to gray he said with animation its mighty lucky hes got a gang like us to help him chapter xvii to learn that her mountain retreat had been invaded and that she had been spied upon filled ma briskow with dismay but when allie found fault with her behavior the elder woman burned with resentment were queer enough the girl said without you cutting up crazy and making folks talk if you want to dance for goodness sake hire somebody to lear to teach you same as i did mrs briskow had silently endured her daughters criticism up to this point but now her lips tightened and there was a defiant tilt to her head who says i want to dance she demanded i can dance good enough what was you up to the other day that delamater man said you was acting plumb nutty i wasnt doin anything where do you go every day ma you stay around nice and quiet till miz ring or i look the other way then youre gone i kinda visit around who dyou visit with you dont know anybody nobody ever speaks to us you aint in earnest about those fairies and things are you it aint anybodys business where i go or what i do ma declared in sullen exasperation i aint bothering anybody am i dont say aint say isnt for once in her patient life the mother flamed into open rebellion dont dont me she cried youre gettin the dont habit off miz ring an nothin i say or do is right any more you mind your own isnts an ill handle my aints i got places where i go an things i do an i dont bother nobody i guess we got enough money so i can do things i want to as long as i dont bother nobody why dont you take pa along hed go then people mind your own business the old woman snapped she flounced out of the room leaving allie amazed and indignant at this burst of temper that day ma briskow abandoned her mountain fastness she took her faithful retainers with her and led them farther up the ravine to a retreat that was truly inaccessible she moved them bag and baggage of course there was a scene the children cried the women wailed the men wept but she told them that traitors had betrayed their hiding place to the dastardly duke of dallas and any moment might bring his cutthroat crew upon them some of the younger bloods were for remaining and selling their lives dearly but ma would not hear to it it was quite an undertaking to move a whole nomad tribe for there were all the household belongings the rattle the sheep the goats the milkwhite arabian steeds the butter and eggs and homemade preserves and all the paraphernalia of a warlike people it is surprising how stuff accumulates in a mountain fastness but she managed the retreat with conspicuous ability ma led the long caravan into the bed of a running stream so that there would remain not a single footprint to guide pursuers then she sat in her saddle and gazed back at the silent camping place trap her eh come upon her unprepared would they ha ha she laughed scornfully and tossed her head of midnight hair as she pictured the dukes rage at finding he had been foiled again and by a mere slip of a girl this was a good game and exciting too fetch pa briskow along indeed why these wild mountain folk would kill him in their present mood they would rend a stranger hip from thigh if they dreamed for instance that she their queen was married here was a new thought and mas imagination leaped at it if these passionate people suspected that she had contracted a secret marriage with the the earl of briskow their jealousy would know no bounds they would probably slay pa ma shuddered at the horrid vision of what would happen to pa this was truly thrilling later on in the morning mrs briskow discovered that she possessed another amazing accomplishment viz the ability to walk on a ceiling upside down like a fly it was extremely amusing for it enabled a person to see right into everything pa and allie looked very funny from above the next day when she stealthily slipped out of her french window she found calvin gray idly rocking on the veranda he welcomed her appearance and pretended not to see her embarrassment at the meeting he was glad of this chance for a visit with her alone perhaps she was going for a walk and would take him along ma was annoyed and suspicious she liked gray but she was as wary as a trout and she refused to be baited she would allow him to walk with her but lead him to the retreat well hardly the man was piqued for suspicion irked him it was a tribute to his patience and to his knack of inspiring confidence that ma finally told him about allies criticism and her resentment thereat i got my own way of enjoyin myself an i dont care what people think she declared with some heat quite right its none of their darned business ma she thinks im kind of crazy an i guess i am but it comes from livin so long in the heat an the drought an allus wantin things i couldnt have allus bein sort of thirsty in the head when you want things all your life an never have em you get so you play youve got em the man nodded you had a hard time your life was starved im so glad the money came in time you see i never had time to play or a good place to play in even when i was a little girl but this is like like books ive read are these mountains what you thought they would be oh theyre better ma breathed its too bad allies got to spoil everthing i shall speak to her we wont let her spoil anything now tell me how you play but ma flushed faintly and for some time longer she refused her confidence it didnt matter it was all an old womans foolishness nobody would understand gray was not insistent nevertheless before long they were on their way toward the glen it was a glorious morning the forest was beautiful and as the two strolled through it mas companion told her many things about trees and flowers and birds and bees that she had never dreamed of now grays natural history was shockingly inaccurate nevertheless it was interesting and it was told in a manner both whimsical and sprightly he made up outrageous stories and he took no shame in seriously recounting experiences of his own that ma knew were wholly imaginary she told him finally sakes alive youre as crazy as i am this he denied with spirit forests were enchanted places and trolls dwelt in the mountains there was no question about that most people never took time to see them that was all now as for him he had actually beheld naiads and dryads nixies and pixies at play at least he had practically been upon the point of seeing them ma herself must have come across places they had just left but probably she had lacked the patience to await their return or the faith to woo them into being there were little woods people too no bigger than your thumb whose drinking goblets were acorn cups and whose plates were shiny leaves he showed her how to set a fairy tablecloth with her handkerchief and with toadstools for seats in a reckless burst of confidence ma told him how it felt to walk upside down like a fly and to go bounding through the woods like a thistledown gray had never tried it but he was interested then finally alas the inconsistency of woman she told him all about her hidden band of mountaineers now this was something he could understand this was more his speed he insisted upon making the personal acquaintance of those bold followers of hers and upon hearing the whole sad story of the princess pensacola the history of her struggle against the wicked duke of dallas moved him he wove new details of his own into it and before ma knew it he was actually playing the part of the duke the duke it appeared was a hard and haughty man but at heart he was not all bad when he had listened to the story of his victims wrongs and more fully appreciated the courage the devotion of her doughty followers he was touched for her sake and theirs he proposed a truce to this ruinous struggle what kind of a truce well he refused entirely to renounce his claim to the throne but they might share it he was a handsome man and no wickeder than the general run of dukes he would make a becoming husband to the beauteous princess and if she set her mind to it she could probably make a better person of him thus would the warring factions be united thus would the blessings of peace descend but the princess raised her slim jeweled hand and spoke thus too late your honor i been married to his royal highness the earl of briskow and it serves you right the way you done both of us the duke fell into a great rage at this he refused to believe it and threatened to annul the marriage oh you cant do that tittered the princess we was married by the royal justice of the peace and we got two children here was a blow the duke was crushed until a happy thought came to him if cruel fate prevented him from claiming the princess pensacola for a bride he would take her for a mother he had always wanted a mother anyhow lack of maternal care it was that accounted for his wildness it was enough to ruin any duke and mothers were much nicer than wives they were much harder to get also lord i wish you meant it ma exclaimed in a matteroffact tone i wish allie was a real princess mebbe gray broke in with a laugh there youve spoiled the play the duke has fled mrs briskows wrinkled face beamed think of a gret big man like you playin pretend with a foolish old woman like me i thought you had more sense i live in my own land of pretend just as you do why i have a real princess of my own honest gray nodded the princess of wichita falls would you like to hear about her well shes small and dainty as princesses should be and her eyes are like bluebells ma they are brave honest eyes that can laugh or cry the sort of eyes that make a mans head swim when he looks into them too long she carries herself like a great lady and shes very cool and business i mean princesslike to men but in reality shes just an adorable feminine creature who wants to be loved when she laughs two deep dimples come into her cheeks marks of royal favor some people may consider her too stern too matteroffact but she isnt in her boudoir there is scent and sachet and frilly ribbony things that nobody ever sees and flowers from me she loves roses best of all and she says she buries her face in them i send her roses mostly so they can kiss her cheeks for me a tiny yellow love bird in a tiny yellow cage sings her awake every morning i taught it the song it warbles but shell never understand what the little bird is trying to say ma briskow had listened with rapt attention now she inquired does she love you didnt i tell you this was my game of pretense gray said gayly do you really think that an adorable creature whose head is full of girlish notions and youthful ideals could care for the worldly wicked old duke of dallas i am old ma and ive gone the gait pshaw you aint any such thing well perhaps im a better lover than i believe who knows fortunately however it is all just an amusing game the speaker rose and looked at his watch it is lunch time mother briskow and im famished as the two entered the hotel grounds gus and allie hurried to meet them and the latter exclaimed irritably its about time you showed up weve been looking everywhere for you at sight of her husbands face ma inquired in sudden anxiety whats wrong gus its buddy allie declared taint serious briskow said and it is too hes left school run away here mr gray see what you make out of it gray read aloud the letter that was handed to him a letter from the principal of the institution that he himself had recommended stating that ozark had disappeared without doing the college authorities the courtesy of leaving an address inasmuch as he had never expressed the slightest dissatisfaction with his surroundings the writer was at a loss to explain the reason for this disappearance as to ozarks safety there was no immediate cause for apprehension for he had taken with him three trunks of clothing a highpowered touring car and a belgian police dog but certain of the young mans exploits that had come to light since his departure aroused grave doubts in the principals mind of his moral wellbeing whats it mean the mother inquired it means that buddy has taken a vacation how much money has he hes got plenty gus declared more n is good for him if if what ma queried gus halted it was allie who answered if hes done what we think hes done gone away after some woman some woman ma stared blankly from one face to another buddy in love why he never wrote me nothing about bein in love reading a further message in her husbands expression she cried fiercely hes a good boy he wouldnt take up with with nobody that wasnt nice what makes you think its a girl i didnt say girl ma i said woman buddys been writin to me and whats the difference mebbe hes in love with some nice young woman an theyve run away to git married buddys hansome and they got nice women everywhere love with all his money and him only up to fractions allegheny laughed scornfully gus briskow wiped his face with a nervous hand im most sick over it he confessed the perfessor has written me a coupla times about him buddys gone kinda wild i guess drinkin an drinking gray interrupted sharply why didnt you tell me so you gave him unlimited money in spite of my warning he wanted his own bank account his share of the royalties made him feel more like a man he said i i never learned how to say no to him or allie ma an i allus said no to each other but it was allus yes to them we never had much to give em noway drinking eh gray was frowning the woman part i dont care so much about hell probably get over that if it isnt too serious but whisky thats different im responsible for that boy in a manner of speaking i adopted him because well because he flattered me by pretending to admire me it was a unique experience i took buddy for my own will you let me handle this matter the speaker looked from one parent to the other and they saw that his face was grimly set give me my way and ill bring that young rascal to time or he shrugged he smiled faintly give me permission to treat him as if he really were my own will you you got my leave said the father but ma briskow bristled dont you dast to hurt him she cried again gray shrugged this time with resignation as you will i was wild myself i think i know what he needs you cant beat anything into buddys head it was allie speaking after all hes grown up and what right has anybody got to interfere with him spose it is a woman spose she is after his money its his men can get what they want by payin for it an hour a day a week of happiness aint that worth all buddy ll have to pay id pay id go through torture the rest of my life allegheny briskow the mother exclaimed well i would the girls voice broke a sudden agitation seized her in passionate defiance she went on whats the use of wanting something all your life and never getting it whats money for if you cant buy the one thing you want worst of all thats where men have got the best of it they can buy love i wish i was a man i wish i was buddy id have my day my week and as much more as i could pay for id have happiness that long if it broke my heart but im a girl it was with a sudden interest that gray studied the speaker here was a side to the briskow character that he had not suspected and it gave him a new light upon buddy for brother and sister were much alike it showed him more clearly the size of the task he had volunteered to undertake he heard the father speaking and reluctantly withdrew his eyes from allies flaming face he likes you mr gray an mebbe you could keep him from spoilin his hull life thats what hes liable to do an im skeered he wouldnt listen to me boys dont listen to their fathers ill find him gus and ill make him listen to me if it is drink ill break him of it if it is a woman ill break him of that too for it cant be more than a passing fancy noting the tragic concern that wrinkled ma briskows face he put an arm about her saying more gently now now i wont deny you the luxury of worrying ma dear that is a mothers divine prerogative but rest assured buddy shant do himself any great harm now then lets get to a longdistance phone it was perhaps two hours before gray reported to gus briskow they dont know much more at the school than was written in that letter he has been going a rather lively pace lately it seems did you find out anything about the the woman nothing definite i have put detectives on the case and they will report to me at wichita falls as soon as they uncover his trail ill go to buddy at once you goin to leave us i must ive just received a telegram from my my agent about the purchase of a well it is a matter that cant wait i cant thank you for all you done for us we was in bad shape till you come now now everything is straight again thats my job gus to do little odd favors for those i love you must stay here for ma is happy and this place is making a girl of her allie is doing wonders with herself too by the way she neednt be lonely any more ive talked to some of the guests and they want to make friends with her shell find them nice people and you must make her meet them halfway perhaps shell become interested in some decent young fellow id like that wouldnt you would ye the tone of this inquiry caused gray to glance more keenly at the speaker but briskows bright eyes told him nothing why naturally allie is becoming more attractive every day and she is going to make something of herself she is going to do us all proud as soon as he was alone gray eagerly reread his telegram from wichita falls it was from barbara parker the first by the way that he had ever received and he smiled at the girls effort to be thoroughly businesslike and at the same time to convey the full urgency of her message why had she economized on words when every one was precious to him buy that well of course he would if she so earnestly desired it but what was better by far than the prospect of a profitable purchase was the fact of her personal interest in him when it came to the last line of her message bob had plunged into a tenword riot of extravagance the bird is darling i have named him after you gray wondered if these words really meant what they seemed to imply or if it was merely her bubbling enthusiasm that spoke well he would soon find out already he had wasted too much time on the briskows a mans duty ever lies in the way of his desire but once he had rounded up buddy perhaps the family would be able to take care of itself he hoped so for it was assuming the character of a liability it was late that night the southbound flyer had gone through the briskows were sitting in the pleasant parlor of their handsome suite but they were like three mourners ma and pa were soberly discussing the news about buddy allegheny was staring in somber meditation at nothing the girl was bitter rebellious for never had she felt so utterly alone as at this moment to that question which monotonously repeated itself she could form no answer did he care or was it all pity just his way she heard his name and her own mentioned and she became attentive whats that he wants me to meet these people halfway she inquired what for i dont like em he says youll git to like em an theyll git to like you he says youre goin ahead tremendous and well all be proud of you mebbe youll meet some nice young feller he said that did he allies voice was sharp nnot exactly but he asked em to be nice to me he fixed it all up is that it i got lots of money some man ll make love to me and ill ill fall in love with him is that what he said he didnt put it that way what he said was more allegheny rose with an exclamation of anger well i wont meet em hed better mind his own business why allie the mother exclaimed in mild reproach i wont i hate em i hate everybody him with his high an fancy ways the girl choked he looks down on us the same as other folks does an i dont blame him he acts like we was cattle an we are her own scorn appeared to whip the speaker into a higher frenzy now hes gone off to spoil buddys doins buttin in thats what it is if i knew where buddy is id warn him id tell him to look out id tell him to grab his chance when it comes along if it takes all the briskow money all the briskow wells hes lucky buddy is it dont make any difference who he took up with if he loves her never but once before had the briskows seen their daughter in a mood like this and that was on the occasion of their first visit to dallas now they sat numb and speechless as she raved on playin with us to amuse himself its a game with him he aint got anything better to do why he even shows us how to dress with a touch he says i work miracles i transfer transform you from something dark an an

goin to pay dear for our money before we get through an him with a princess in wichita falls the mother quavered chapter xviii there are many arguments against industry much is to be said against its wholesale practice for one thing habitual diligence of whatever sort begets other habits hard to break habits that persist in plaguing a man during his periods of indolence and perhaps during his whole life early rising is one of the most annoying of these habits while it cannot be said that tom parker had ever labored arduously at anything nevertheless he had followed his calling faithfully and the peculiar exigencies of that calling had made of him a light and fitful sleeper he had so often used the earth as a mattress and his saddle as a pillow that sunup invariably roused him and as a consequence he liked to tell people that he could do with less sleep than any man in texas that was in fact one of his pet complaints it was true that old tom never slept long but it was also true that he slept oftener than any man in texas he was up and dressed by daylight and until breakfast time he engaged himself in purposeless and noisy pursuits this futile energy however diminished steadily until about ninethirty after which his day was punctuated by a series of cat naps as a broken sentence is punctuated by dots and dashes that small room at the rear of his office barbara had cleared of its dusty accumulations of its saddles and saddlebags its rusty winchesters its old newspapers and disorderly files and had transformed into a retreat for him she had overcome his inherent prejudice against innovations of any sort by arguing gravely that the head of every firm should nay must have a private sanctum tom approved of the change after he became accustomed to it for he was subjected to fewer irritating distractions there than elsewhere before long in fact he acquired the ability to doze placidly through almost any sort of business conference in the outer office it was his practice to sleep from ninethirty until eleven when bob fetched him a glass of orange juice with a spike in it this refreshing beverage filled him with new energy to tackle the issues of the day and thereupon began a routine as fixed as some religious ritual first he smacked his lips then he cleared his throat loudly several times after which his chair creaked as he massaged his rheumatic leg promptly upon the count of twenty he emerged from the inner office slamming the door energetically behind him whether bob was alone or engaged with clients old toms air was always the same it was that of a busy man weighted with grave responsibilities he frowned he muttered hurriedly got to see a man back in an hour anybody calls tell em to wait this took him to the front door which he also slammed behind him there being a certain force and determination to the sound of a slamming door then he limped down the street to judge hallorans office the judge usually had the checkerboard out and set when tom arrived afternoons passed in much the same manner and night found tom if not actually exhausted from the unceasing grind at least pleasurably fatigued thereby and ready for an afterdinner doze he considered himself seriously overworked this morning bob was alone at her desk when he came out and something about her appearance caused the old warrior to look twice he was exactly on time but the judge could wait he was a cranky old scoundrel anyhow was judge halloran and it would do him good to cool his heels for a few minutes tom paused with his hand upon the door knob my goodness son youre all dressed up he said as he noted bobs crisp white dress the rose upon her bosom the floppy hat that framed her face church sociable somers no dad whats going on nothing in particular you certainly are sweet toms bleak gray face softened then some vague regret peered forth from his eyes certainly are sweet but but what the girl smiled up at him oh i dont know seems like you aint quite the same boy you was youre changing lately somehow getting more like your mother every week i like that of course he said quickly but id like awful well to see you in your ranch clothes again i bet youve clean forgot how to ride and rope and you know very well i havent im a little bit rusty perhaps but remember im a pretty busy girl these days i know tom sighed im wore out too what dyou say we close up the ol factory and take a rest lets get us a couple of broncs and go up to the territory for a spell used to be a lot of wild turkeys in a place i know itd do us a lot of good why dad we cant do that and besides those turkeys were killed out years ago umm i spose so aint much left to shoot at but tin cans come to think of it there was a pause i dont reckon you could hanle a six gun like you used to bob you think not try me sometime and see said the girl apparently tom believed there was no time like the present for he slid his right hand under the left lapel of his coat and when he brought it away there was a large singleaction colts revolver in it a massive weapon upon the motherofpearl handle plates of which were carved two steers heads those steers heads tom had removed from a gun belonging to a famous bad man suddenly deceased and there was a story that went with them now see here bob protested one of these new policemen will pick you up some day pshaw nobody wouldnt pick me up just for totin a gun the old man declared with practiced fingers he extracted the shells one by one i feel right naked without a sixshooter i feel like id cast a shoe or something i wish youd give up carrying it lessee you do a few tricksbob do the roll remember she dont stand cocked miss parker rose to her feet and took the weapon she balanced it in her hand then she spun it rolled it fanned it went through a routine of lightninglike sleightofhand that tom had taught her long before lessee you do a few shots her father urged when she handed it back to him in here sure its our shanty drive a few nails or ill tell you kill that bear and save that tenderfoots life tom pointed to a winchester calendar on the rear wall which bore the lithographic likeness of an enraged grizzly upon the point of helping himself to a hunter why wed have the whole town running in go on son make it speak bears is easy killed nonsense reluctantly tom reloaded his weapon and thrust it back into its shoulder holster regretfully he murmured doggone we never have any more fun he turned toward the door where are you going dad i got to see a man back in an hour anybody calls you know you wont be back in an hour where are you going i got to see what is it bob hesitated i wish youd stay here i think mr gray arrived this morning and i expect him in tom decided that he had made judge halloran wait long enough he should have been in the old rascals king row by this time so he said briskly wish i could son but i got to see a man mr gray was here several times before he went away but you were always out when her father showed no inclination to tarry barbara spoke with more impatience than she had ever used toward him i want him to meet you dad for he has come back on purpose to take up that jackson well if i devote all my time to business it seems to me you could afford to sacrifice an hour to it just this once that checker game can wait tom parker stiffened sacrifice an hour to business just once that was a blow as if his nose was not at the grindstone day in and day out as if he were not practically chained to this office as if unremitting application to business had not wrecked him worn him to the bone made an insomniac of him that was the worst about children boys especially they twitted their elders they thought they were the whole works they assumed undue importance tom was offended and being a stubborn man he bowed his back tell him to wait he said curtly ill get around to it soon as i can why dad he isnt a man who can wait this deal wont wait either i been talking over that jackson well with with a man and i got him i asked you not to mention it not to a soul it is a very important matter and now tom had not discussed the jackson well except casually with judge halloran but every word that bob spoke rankled so he interrupted with a resentful query aint i equal to hanle an important deal bob acknowledged quickly that he was she had not meant to criticize his ability to conduct negotiations of the very highest importance but she was surprised in view of her earnest request that he had even mentioned this particular matter to anybody she reminded him that insurance was his forte and that their understanding had been that she was to take exclusive charge of their oil business while she was talking tom realized with a disagreeable shock that of late there had been no insurance written none whatever he had given the matter no thought but such was undoubtedly the case and in his daughters words he felt a rebuke now he could not abide rebukes he had never permitted anybody to criticize him for once that unconscious irritation that had been slowly accumulating within him flamed up it was an irritation too vague too formless to put into words especially inasmuch as words did not come easily to tom parker when he was mad without further comment the old man pulled his gray wideawake lower over his eyes and limped out of the room but he did not go to judge hallorans office he was too sore to risk further offense at the hands of one who took malicious delight in antagonizing him so he walked the streets the more he pondered bobs accusation and accusation it surely was the angrier he became not at her of course for she was blood of his blood his other and better self but angry at himself for allowing the reins to slip out of his fingers he was the head of the firm it was due to his ripe judgment and keen common sense that the business ran on his name and standing it was that gave it stability perhaps he had permitted the girl to do more than her share of the work and hence her inclination to take all the credit for their joint success was only natural but it was time to change all that time to turn a big deal without her assistance that was the thing to do handle the jackson lease in his own way and turn it over for a price far in excess of seventyfive thousand dollars anybody could sell things for less than they were worth but it took real ability to realize their full value here was a snap a chance to clean up big money bob said so why not then take over the lease for himself and her pay something down hold it for a few weeks and then resell it at a staggering profit such things were being done tom did not know just how but he could easily find out and there were several thousand dollars in the bank to the firms account if that was not enough to meet the first payment he could probably get bell nelson to give him another mortgage on something or was it he that would have to give the mortgage to bell it didnt matter the thing to do was to jump out to the extension buy the well and show bob that he was as good a business man as she better in fact a bus was about to leave so tom clambered in barbara parker had to acknowledge that she was more than a little bit thrilled at the prospect of seeing calvin gray again she had assured her father glibly enough that there was nothing going on that day but there was it was something to realize that a mere telegram from her had brought a man of mr grays importance clear across the country and that he was coming straight to her what mysterious magic lay in the telegraph ever since their first meeting he had awakened in her a sort of breathless excitement the precise significance of which she could not fathom and that excitement now was growing hourly it could not mean love bob flushed at the thought for she had no intention of falling in love with anybody she was too young the world was too new and too exciting for that and besides her life was too full her obligations were too many to permit of distractions agreeable or disagreeable nor for that matter was gray the sort of man to become seriously interested in a simple person like her he was complex manysided cosmopolitan his extravagant attentions were meaningless and yet one could never tell men were queer creatures perhaps little prickles ran over bob she felt her whole body galvanize when she saw gray coming he entered as she knew he would enter with the suggestion of having been blown thither upon the breast of a gale he was electric he throbbed with energy he was bursting with enthusiasm and his delight at seeing her was boyish bob colored rosily at his instant and extravagant appreciation of her effort to look more pleasing than usual but embarrassment followed her first thrill she could not believe his compliments were entirely genuine therefore she took refuge behind her coolest her most businesslike demeanor for a while they talked about nothing although to each the other was eloquent then bob came as quickly as might be to the matter she had wired him about he listened with smiling lips and shining eyes but he heard only the bare essentials of her story for his thoughts were galloping his mind was busy with new impressions of her other voices than hers were in his ears that was his rose at her breast she had been pleased at his coming otherwise she would not have paid him the girlish compliment of wearing her best evidently she cared for him or was she merely impressed flattered women had called him romantic whereas he knew himself to be theatric he wondered if she i told jackson youd be out to look at the well and the books today bob was saying he wont wait an hour longer splendid i came the instant you telegraphed dropped everything in fact some of my men are waiting to see me but i havent even notified them of my arrival important business too nevertheless i hurried right here they can wait gray laughed gladly jove how becoming that hat is i hired the bestlooking car i could find and it will be here in a minute i told myself i had earned a day with you and i wouldnt spoil it by permitting you to drive ive so much to talk to you about business of all sorts that i scarcely know where to begin now bob had expected to drive to the northwest ex tension with gray nothing else had been in her mind her field clothing was even laid out ready for a quick change but a sudden contrariness took hold of her she experienced a shy perversity that she could not explain oh im sorry i cant go i simply cant she declared he was so obviously disappointed that her determination gained strength she was surprised at her own mendacity when she explained the utter impossibility of leaving the office and told a circumstantial fib about a title that had to be closed with people from out of town the more she talked the more panicky she became at thought of being for hours alone with this forceful this magnetic this overwhelming person strange in view of the fact that she had been looking forward to it for days in order finally to get him away before she could change her mind she promised to hurry through her affairs and then drive out and bring him home there was no time to lose jackson was growing impatient it was a wonderful deal there were other days coming when gray had gone and bob was alone she drew a deep breath her pulse was rapid she was tingling as if from some stimulating current what a man what an effect he had upon people what a fool she had been not to go the road to burkburnett is well surfaced for some distance outside of wichita falls therefore gray leaned back with eyes closed as the car sped over it picturing again his meeting with barbara recalling her words of greeting puzzling over the subtle change in her demeanor at the last perhaps he had frightened her he was given to overenthusiasm this would be a lesson queer how women interfere with business here he was going at things backward whirling out to the oil fields when he should be with mcwade and stoner they would probably be distracted at his nonarrival but this was business too and she would drive out to get him there would be the long ride back far away across the undulating prairie fields the horizon was broken by a low dark barricade the massed derricks of the townsite pool so thickly were they grouped that they resembled a dense forest of high black pines and not until gray drew closer could he note that this strange forest was leafless by now the roads were quagmires and the unceasing current of traffic had thickened and slowed down until grays car rocked and plunged through a hubdeep channel of slime there was but one route to the extension and it led through the very heart of burkburnett there were no detours around the town no way of beating the traffic therefore vehicles no matter how urgent their business were forced to fall in line and allow themselves to be carried along like chips in a stream of tar burk was a onestory town or at least most of its buildings projected only one story above the mud and that mud was mixed with oil leakage from wells pipe lines storagetanks had made the mass underfoot doubly foul and sticky and where it was liquid it shone with iridescent colors mud was everywhere on the sidewalks inside the stores on walls and signboards on the skins and clothing of the people through the main street the procession of cars plowed then out across the railroad tracks and toward the open country beyond when it came to a halt as it frequently did above the hum of idle motors could be heard the clank of pumps the fitful coughing of gasengines the hiss of steam this of course was soon drowned in a terrific din of impatient horns a blaring brazen snarl at the delay the whole line roared metallic curses at the cause of its stoppage even the railroad right of way had been drilled switch engines shunted rows of flats almost between the straddling derrick legs grays driver had been dumb thus far now he broke out abruptly speaking about mud i was crossing this street on a plank the other day when i saw a brannew derby lying in the mud and picked it up underneath it was a guys head hullo i said youre in pretty deep aint you the feller looked up at me and said this aint bad youd ought to see my brother im standing on his shoulders the chauffeur laughed loudly at his own humor some country i call it but the suns out so it will be blowing sand tomorrow when burkburnett had been left behind another and a vaster island of derricks came into view it marked the burkwaggoner pool part of the northwest extension so called the car was waiting its turn to cross a tiny toll bridge spanning a sluggish creek the bed of which ran seepage oil from the wells beyond when the driver grumbled aloud four bits to cross a fortyfoot bridge theres a graft for you one old nester above here tore a hole in his fence opposite a wet place in the road and charged us half a dollar to drive through his pasture but it was cheaper than getting stuck he had to carry his coin home in an oat sack after a few weeks somebody got to wondering why that spot never dried out and come to investigate wha dyou think i seldom think when i am being entertained his passenger declared well that poor stupid had dammed the creek and every night he shut the gate and flooded his road if the clustered derricks of the townsite pool were impressive there was something positively dramatic about the extension burkburnett had been laid out in lots and blocks and the drilling had followed some sort of orderly system but here were no streets no visible plan this had been a wheat field and as well after well had come in derricks drilling rigs buildings tanks piles of timber and casing had been laid down with complete disregard of all save the owners convenience overnight new pipe lines were being laid for hours counted here and the crude had to find outlet fuel had to be brought in these pipe lines were never buried and in consequence the ceaseless flow of traffic was forever forced to seek new channels the place became a bewildering maze through which teams floundered and motor vehicles plunged at random towns had sprung up for this army of workers was isolated in a sea of mud but whereas burk was more or less permanent newtown bradleys corners bridgetown were cities of canvas boards and corrugated iron by day they were mean filthy grotesque by night they became incandescent for every derrick was strung with lights and the surplus supply of gas was burned in torches to prevent it from accumulating in ravines or hollows in explosive quantities they were mardi gras cities day by day this field spread onward toward the red river the whole region smelled of oil fire of course was an everpresent menace newtown for instance had been wiped out several times for it lay on a slope down which a broken pipe line could belch a resistless wave of flame and even yet the place was a litter of charred timber twisted pipe and crumpled sheets of galvanized iron owing to this menace the residents had taken the only possible precaution they had dug in behind each place of business was a cyclone cellar a bombproof shelter into which human bodies and stocks of merchandise could be crowded gray drove directly to the lease he had come to examine and was disappointed to learn that the owner had just left this was annoying bob had assured him that he was expected inquiry elicited from the surly individual in charge no more than the reluctant admission that jackson had been called to the nearest telephone but would be back sometime there was nothing to do but wait gray let his car go then made a cursory examination of the property he could see little and learn less the caretaker agreed that the well was pumping one hundred and fifty barrels a day some evasiveness in this fellows demeanor awoke grays suspicion a sudden telephone call the owners absence when he expected a purchaser probably somebody else was after the property it was decidedly worth while to wait gray was unaccustomed to inattention incivility and had anybody except bob parker put him in this position he would have resented it under the circumstances however he could do nothing except cool his heels as time passed he began to feel foolish by late lunch time he was irritable and as the afternoon wore on he grew angry why didnt bob come as she had promised he had lost a day and days were precious evening found him wandering about aimlessly in a villainous mood but stubbornly determined to see this thing through at whatever cost he had no wish to spend a night amid these surroundings for respectable people shunned these oilfield camps after dark and he knew himself to be conspicuous it would add a ridiculous climax to a trying day to be highjacked to be frisked of his jewelry during the early dusk he returned to the lease only to find even the greasy caretaker gone by this time gray was decidedly uncomfortable and to add to his discomfort he conceived the notion that he was being followed on second thought he dismissed this idea nevertheless he took a roundabout course back toward the main street it seemed odd to be floundering through inky shadows feeling a way through this miry chaos when aloft as far as the eye could see the sky was lit this phantom city of twinkling beacons gave one a sense of acute unreality for it was an empty city a city the work of which went on almost without the aid of human hands the very soul of it was mechanical only here and there where a drill crew was at work did an occasional human figure move back and forth in the glare of lowhung incandescents nevertheless the whole place breathed and throbbed it was instinct with a tremendous vigor from all sides came the ceaseless rhythmic clank of pumps the hiss of gas and steam the gurgling flow of liquid they were the pulse beats the respirations the blood flow of this live thing and its body odor stung the nostrils all night long it panted with its heavy labors as if the jinns that lifted those giant pump beams were vying with one another in a desperate endeavor they were for a fact haste avarice an arduous diligence was in the very air gray stared and marveled for imagination was not lacking in him those derricks with their fires were high altars upon which were heaped ten thousand hopes and prayers altars of avarice towers of greed that is what they were he marvelled too at the extremes these last few days had brought him at the long cry from the luxurious burlington notch to this primitive land of fire worshipers here only a few hours by motor from paved streets and comfortable homes was a section of the real frontier as crude and as lawless as any he had ever seen yonder for instance was the red lion a regular klondike dance hall he looked in for a moment but the sight of hardfaced houris revolving cheek to cheek with men in overalls and boots was nothing new it did remind him of the march of progress however to notice that the bartenders served cocacola instead of hootch hygienic but vain he reflected not at all like the brave old days farther up the street was a flaming theater decorated with gaudy lithographs of women in tights that awoke a familiar echo the grimy figures headed thither might well be miners just in from eldorado or anvil creek gambling was practically wide open too and before long gray found himself in a superheated overcrowded back room with a stack of silver dollars which he scattered carelessly upon the numbers of a roulette table roulette was much like the oil game this was a good way in which to kill an hour absorbed in his own thoughts gray paid little heed to those about him until a large hand picked up one of his bets then he raised his eyes the hand was attached to a muscular arm which in turn was attached to a burly stranger of unpleasant mien gray voiced a goodnatured protest but the fellow scowled and refused to acknowledge his mistake noting that the man was flushed gray shrugged and allowed the incident to pass this bootleg whisky from across red river was of a quality to scatter a persons eyesight for some time the game continued before gray won again and the dealer deposited thirtyfive silver dollars beside his bet again that sunbrowned hand reached forth but this time gray seized it by the wrist he and the stranger eyed each other for a silent moment during which the other players looked on gray was the first to speak if youre not as drunk as you seem he said easily youll excuse yourself if you are you need sobering with a wrench the man undertook to free his hand he uttered a threatening oath the next instant he was treated to a surprise for gray jerked him forward and simultaneously his empty palm struck the fellow a blinding a resounding smack twice he smote that reddened cheek with the sound of an explosion then as the victim flung his body backward gray kicked his feet from under him again he cuffed the fellows face this time from the other side when he finally desisted the stranger rocked in his tracks he shook his head he blinked and he cursed it was a moment before he could focus his whirling sight upon his assailant when he succeeded it was to behold the latter staring at him with a mocking threatening smile the drunken man hesitated he cast a slow glance around the room then muttering hoarsely he turned and made for the door he was followed by a burst of derisive laughter that grew louder as he went gray was in a better mood now than for several hours he had vented his irritation the air had cleared after a while he discovered that he was hungry no longer was he too resentful to heed the healthy warning of his stomach so he left the place chapter xix newtons eating places were not appetizing at best but a meal could be endured with less discomfort by night than by day for at such times most of the flies were on the ceilings the restaurant gray entered was about what he had expected along one side ran a quickorder counter at which were seated several customers across from it was an oilclothcovered table perfectly bare except for a revolving centerpiece one of those silverplated whirligigs fitted with a glass saltandpepper shaker a toothpick holder an unpleasant oil bottle and a cruet intended for vinegar but now filled with some mysterious embalming fluid acting as a preservative of numerous lifelike insect remains here facing an elderly man in a wide grayfelt hat gray seated himself grays neighbor was in no pleasant mood for he whacked impatiently at such buzzing pests as were still on the wing and when a perspiring greek set a plate of soup before him he took umbrage at the presence of the fellows thumb in the liquid the argument that followed angered the old man still further for it arrived nowhere except to prove that the offending thumb was the property of the proprietor of the restaurant and by inference therefore a privileged digit when a departing customer left the door open the elderly diner grumbled bitterly at the draught and draped his overcoat over his bent shoulders dam eskimos he muttered raised in a chicken coop windy as a derrick gray liked old people and he was tolerant of their crotchets irascibility indicates force of character at least so he believed and old folks are apt to accept too meekly the approach of decay here was a spirit that time had not dulled it was like wine soured in an old cask at any rate wine it had been not water and that was something most of the counter customers had drifted out when without warning the screen door banged loudly open and gray looked up from his plate to see his recent acquaintance of the gambling table approaching this time purpose was stamped upon the mans face but whether it was deliberate or merely the result of more drinking there was no telling he lurched directly up to the table and stared across at gray slapped my face didnt you he cried after a menacing moment i did indeed the speaker nodded pleasantly you aint going to slap it again you aint going to slap anybodys what makes you think i wont gray became aware as he spoke that his elderly neighbor had raised to the intruder a countenance stamped with a peculiar expression of incredulity almost of anger at the interruption and that the two remaining counter customers had turned startled faces over their shoulders while the proprietor his arms full of dishes had paused beside the swinging door to the kitchen that which occurred next came unexpectedly the stranger whipped out from under his coat a revolver at the same time voicing a profane answer to the challenge the proprietor uttered a bleat of terror he dropped his dishes and dived out of the room the men on the stools scrambled down and plunged after him as calvin gray rose to his feet it was with a flash of mingled anger and impatience this quarrel was so utterly senseless it served so little purpose my friend he cried sharply if you dont put up that gun one of us will go to a hospital in spite of the intruders haste in drawing his weapon he appeared now to lack the will promptly to use it his laggard spirit required a further scourge so it seemed something more to goad it into final fury it was a phenomenon by no means uncommon for it is not easy to shoot down an unarmed victim by way of rousing his savagery the fellow uttered a bellow then like a warrior smiting his shield with his spear before the charge he swung his heavy weapon smashing at one blow that silverplated merrygoround with its cluster of bottles a shower of toothpicks fragments of glass a spatter of oil and vinegar covered the old man in the end chair and he rose with a cry that drew a swift glance from the desperado gray was upon the point of launching himself over the table when he witnessed a peculiar transformation in his assailant the mans expression altered with almost comic suddenness he lowered his weapon and took a backward step gray too had cause for astonishment for the elderly man was moving slowly toward the disturber his overcoat meanwhile hanging loosely from his left shoulder like a mantle his gray face had grown white malignant threatening he advanced with a queer sidling gait edging forward behind the shelter of his garment as if behind a barricade but what challenged grays instant attention was the certainty of purpose the cold confident menace behind the old fellows demeanor there was something appalling about him he had suddenly become huge and dominant that he had been recognized was plain for the armed man cried agitatedly look out tom i dont want any truck with you the deliberate advance continued in a harsh voice tom answered i dont allow anybody to interfere with me when im eating for every step he shuffled forward the man before him fell back a corresponding distance again the newcomer rasped out his warning and gray too added his voice saying leave him to me old man this is my quarrel as he spoke he moved around the end of the table but the mantled figure halted him with an imperious jerk of the head without in the slightest diverting his steady gaze tom snapped hands off stranger i wont have you buttin in either i dont allow anybody to interfere with me when im eating gray was checked less by the exasperation by the authority in the speakers tone than by the fact that the entire complexion of the affair had changed the ruffian who had entered so confidently was no longer the aggressor a mere look a word a gesture from this aged unknown person had put him upon the defensive more extraordinary still was the fact that his power of initiative was for the moment completely paralyzed and that he was tortured by a deplorable indecision he was furious that was plain nevertheless his anger had been halted in midflight as it were desperation battled with an inexplicable dread he raised his hands now but more in a gesture of surrender than of threat dont come any closer he cried hoarsely dont do it i tell you dont do it there was no longer any thickness to his tongue he spoke as one quite sober when for the third time that malevolent voice repeated i dont allow anybody to interfere with me when im eating the solitary onlooker felt an absurd desire to laugh during intensely dramatic moments nervous laughter is near the surface and there was something rigidly dramatic about the methodical sidling advance of that man half crouched behind his overcoat tom as he had been called gave gray the impression of death itself marching slowly forward to drape that black shroud upon his cowering victim brief as had been the whole episode already passersby had halted staring faces were glued to the front windows of the cafe well they might stare at those two tense figures one advancing the other retreating as if to the measures of some slow dance illustration dont come any closer dont do it i tell you but the tempo changed abruptly the desperados back brought up against the swinging kitchen door it gave to his weight and decision was born of that instant with a cry he flung himself backward the spring door snapped to and swallowed him up with the speed of a camera shutter then followed the sound of his heavy rushing footsteps hell exclaimed the old man i had his buttons counted with the words he let fall his overcoat and there beneath it gray beheld what he had more than half suspected what indeed was ample cause for the quarrelsome strangers apprehension held close to the owners body was what in the inelegant jargon of the west is known as a dog leg the weapon a frontier colts of heavy caliber was full cocked under the old mans thumb the hand holding it was as steady as the blazing eyes above with a smile gray said allow me to congratulate you sir upon a most impressive demonstration of the power of mind over matter a little killin helps those scounrels breathed the whitehaired warrior surgin around wreakin vengeance on vinegar bottles and me with a bad indigestion i dont often permit others to do my fighting but you wouldnt let i dont allow anybody doggedly began the former speaker but the street door burst open a noisy crowd poured into the room a volley of excited questions was raised amid the confusion gray heard his own name shouted and found himself set upon by two agitated friends mallow and stoner they had been combing newtown for him so they declared and were near by when attracted by the excitement on the sidewalk what was the trouble was gray hurt he assured them that he was not and explained in a few words the origin of the encounter but other concerns it seemed occupied the minds of the pair and before he had finished mallow was dragging him towards the door crying breathlessly gee governor you gave us a run weve been coming since noon it was only by the grace of god stoner declared that we heard you were out here and why youd come we managed to get a phone call through to jackson but it was jackson ive been looking for him all the afternoon sure mallow swore he was all right but mac and i dont know him and we figured he might turn a trick anyhow mallow and i jumped the lizzie and looped it boy i tramped on her some until we hit bottom the other side of burk mallow went clean through the top i guess i smashed the whole rear end but we couldnt wait to see theyll have her stripped naked tires cushions and all before we get back motor too probably weve been hitting it afoot on wagons and pipe trucks managed to get a service car finally but it fell open like a book just one of those dam unlucky trips jackson didnt get to you did he mallow inquired anxiously get to me no nor i to him gray spoke impatiently what is this all about simply this governor jacksons well is a setup for nelson we nearly dropped dead when we found out that parker kid had laid you against it why didnt you tell us what are you saying i dont the wells phony dry as a pretzel in what way i saw the oil never mind lay off i think im entitled to an explanation well then its salted impossible i saw it pumping ill say you did mallow chuckled live oil too right out of old mamma earth cheap lease at seventyfive thousand eh its like this the pipe line of the atlantic runs across jacksons lease and one dark and stormy night he tapped it it wasnt a hard thing to do just took a little care and some digging now he runs the oil in pumps it out and sells it back to them hes a regular subsidiary of the great and only atlantic petroleum company it cant last long of course but oh what a well to hand nelson what a laugh it would have been outrageous gray exclaimed i cant believe you are in earnest it is shocking isnt it such dishonesty is incredible and what an unhappy surprise for the company when they finally locate the leak gray clamped a heavy hand upon the speakers shoulder harshly he inquired do you mean to say that miss parker deliberately she dont know anything about it you said she laid me against it no no i merely tipped her to it because shes one of nelsons brokers shes his sweetie stoner added hes going to marry her so mallow thought hed surely fall for it coming from her you youre not fit to mention that girls name either of you grays tone was one of quivering anger if you involve her in your crooked dealings even indirectly ill god what a dirty trick he flung mallow aside in disgust you ought to be shot why governor we wouldnt hurt that kid shes aces i told you my fight with nelson was to be fair and square there followed a moment of silence mallow and stoner exchanged glances what percentage of that goes the former finally inquired one hundred so then its lucky nelson didnt fall but theres no harm done nobodys hurt it is lucky indeedfor me id have felt bound to make good his loss if you had hooked him i presume i ought to expose this swindle expose jackson stoner inquired quickly when gray nodded there was another brief silence before the speaker ventured to say i know this bird nelson and take it from me youre giving him the best of it if i hadnt known him as well as i do i wouldnt of put in with you to break him its all right to trim a sucker once its like letting the blood of a sick man hes better for it but to ride a square guy to death to keep his veins open well i aint in that kind of business now about this jackson you can land him i spose if you try but it would be lower than a frogs foot after him playing square with you what do you mean by that he could have stung you easy couldnt he you surged out here on purpose to buy the lease but he hid out all afternoon to avoid you he is a thief he is stealing hundreds of dollars a day sure from the atlantic that has stolen hundreds of thousands from the likes of him yes millions it was the atlantic that broke the market to sixtyfive cents filled their storage tanks and contracted a million barrels more than they had tankage for then gypped the price to three dollars i cant shed any tears over that outfit lets not argue the ethics of big business the law of supply and demand supply and demand eh ever strike you as queer that crude never breaks as long as the big companies have got their tanks full the price always toboggans when theyre empty and comes back when theyre filled up thats supply and demand with the reverse english aint it say the atlantic and those others play with us outsiders like we was mice when their bellies get empty they eat as many of us as they want then they let the rest of us scurry around and hunt up new fields we run all the risks we spend our coin and when we strike a new pool they burgle us over again stoner was speaking with a good deal of heat big business eh well heres some little business dam little the atlantic leased a lot of scattered acreage i know about and drilled it pulled off their crews at the top of the sand and drilled in with men they could trust it turned out good but they capped their wells wrecked their rigs and of course that condemned the whole territory then they set about buying it all in cheap through dummies doublecrossed the farmers see friend of mine took a chance put down a well on his own the usual thing happened they broke him it took a lot of doing but they broke him one little trick they did was to cock a bit and drop it in the hole that prank cost him sixteen thousand dollars before he could side track the tool he quit finally less n a hundred feet from big pay then having bought up solid for near nothing they came back and started business laughing merrily thats the atlantic a splendid lecture on commercial honesty i am inspired by it and i reverence your scruples but i grope for the moral of the story the moral is mind your own business and and give a guy a chance umm suppose we leave it at that for the present mallow who had remained silent during his friends argument greeted this suggestion with relief he was glad to change the subject good he cried heartily id about as soon face old tom parker like that fellow in the restaurant did as to face jackson hed sink a stillson in my head sure if parker was that old man miss parkers father certainly what dyou think ailed that gunman dyou think he got the flu or something all of a sudden there aint anybody left tough enough to hanker for toms scalp hes pinned a rose on all of those oldtimers and hes deadly poison to the new crop for the first time calvin gray understood clearly the reason for the unexpected outcome of that encounter in the cafe no wonder the strangers trigger finger had been paralyzed barbaras father indeed how stupid of him not to guess on the heels of his first surprise came another thought suppose that old paladin should consider that he gray had shown weakness in allowing another to assume the burden of his quarrel and suppose he should tell his daughter about it that would be a situation indeed i must find him quickly gray declared perhaps hell ride back to town with us it was not a difficult task to locate the veteran officer and tom was delighted at the chance to ride home with his new acquaintance that journey back to civilization was doubly pleasant for mr parker cherished no such feelings as gray had feared and moreover he responded quickly to the younger mans efforts to engage his liking they got along famously from the start and tom positively blossomed under the attentions he received it had been a trying day for him but his ill humor quickly disappeared in the warmth of a newfound friendship and he talked more than was his custom he was even led to speak of old days old combats of which the bloodless encounter that evening was but a tame reminder the pictures he conjured up were colorful a unique and an engaging person he proved to be an odd compound of gentleness and acerbity of kindliness and rancor a quiet guileless stubborn violent old manatarms who would not be interrupted while he was eating he was both scornful and contemptuous of evildoers all needed killing hard luck i call it for a budding desperado to wreck a career of promise the way that wretched fellow did gray told him with a laugh out of all the men in texas to pick you oh he aint a bud hes quite a killer indeed he kills mexicans and niggers and folks without guns mostly lowdown stuff hes got three or four i believe i never could see why the nelsons kep him there was a brief silence i beg pardon said gray hes been on the nelson pay roll for years doing odd jobs that wasnt fit to be done but i guess they got tired of him anyhow hes been hanging around wichita for the last two or three weeks hes been in an out of our office quite a bit your office what for i dunno unless he took a shine to bob not really mr parker uttered an unpleasant sound she never said anything about it but i suspicioned she had to order him out finally id of split his third shirt button if hed stood his ground he knew i had something on him but he couldnt figure just what it was old toms teeth shone through the gloom a man will most always act like that when he dont know just where hes at i knew where i was at all the time only i wanted to see that button plain i allus know where im at later when the journey was over and tom parker had been dropped at his gate gray spoke to his two companions did you hear what he said we did do you believe i was framed both mallow and stoner nodded dont you the former inquired when no answer was forthcoming he said better give us the flag governor were raring to go you mean you know what i mean nelsons so crooked his bedclothes fall off we pulled a boner this time but brick has got another window dressed for him ill think it over said gray chapter xx ozark briskow like his sister allegheny was studying hard and learning rapidly but he had adopted an educational plan a curriculum so to speak far different from hers whereas she lived between book covers and the thousand and one details of her daily existence were governed by a bewildering army of donts buddy had devised his own peculiar system of acquiring wisdom and from it the word dont had been deliberately dropped his excursion into the halls of learning brief as it had been had convinced him that books could teach him only words whereas he craved experiences ideas adventures adventure comes at night pleasure walks by gaslight young briskow told himself that he had missed a lot of late hours and would have to work diligently to catch up but he undertook the effort with commendable courage it is said that all wish to possess knowledge but few are willing to pay the price buddy was one of the minority early he adopted the motto money no object and it provoked him not at all to learn that there is a scale of night prices considerably higher than the scale of day prices to find for instance that a nocturnal highball costs twice as much as one purchased during daylight hours that phenomenon by the way had nothing to do with the provisions of the eighteenth amendment it merely explained why farmers went to bed early they couldnt afford to sit up so buddy decided he had learned a lot since leaving school not only about prohibition but also about speed laws mens fashions facial massage the fox trot and the shimmy caviar silk pajamas bromoseltzer the language of flowers and many of the pleasures and displeasures of the higher intellectual life such as love and insomnia his education was progressing apace for love is the greatest of educators and buddy was in love madly extravagantly in love love it was that accounted for his presence in dallas and his occupancy of the governors suite at the ajax a fellow in love with the most wonderful woman in the world couldnt afford to look cheap in his home town could he of course dallas was not buddys home town but it had been his point of departure into the world and it was the home of his bank account hence some pride of proprietorship was pardonable it gave him such a pleasing sense of importance to adopt the city as his own that he adopted everything and everybody in it in spite of the fact that the train from wichita falls was behind time one morning shortly after buddys arrival he was still abed when calvin gray arrived at the hotel instead of disturbing the slumbers of youth gray went directly to the detective who had telegraphed him and for half an hour or more the two talked later during the course of a leisurely bath and shave the new arrival pondered the information he had received here was a problem having dressed himself he strolled around to coverlys place of business and interviewed the jeweler sure he has bought quite a bit of stuff in the last few days coverly told him he was in only yesterday and ordered a fine piece made up he wanted a ruby heart pierced with a diamond arrow but i got him off that and onto a blue brazilian solitaire were mounting it in a platinum ladys ring what is the price fortyfive hundred and the value is there have you seen the woman coverly nodded the boy is a good picker i dont blame her much either for ive seen a lot of worselooking fellows than buddy hold the ring he may change his mind i say coverly was in dismay are you going to spoil the best sale ive made in two weeks oh ill take it off your hands if he doesnt make some excuse not to deliver it until i say the word you dont know the woman eh never saw her before gray knocked several times at the governors suite before a sleepy response a succession of yawns and mutterings told him that he had been heard the door opened finally and the pride of the briskow family his eyes all but swelled shut his muscular figure splendidly arrayed in futuristic silken pajamas mumbled whats eatin you any the eyes opened wider buddys face broke into a slow smile why mr gray he extended a palm a bit dry and feverish and drew his caller inside dawggone im glad to see you gray entered with a buoyant laugh and a hearty greeting he clapped the young giant heavily upon the back at the blow buddy voiced a sharp cry and seized his head easy over the bumps im carryin a cargo of nitroglycerine and ill let go if you jar me he explained sorry i know how it feels but man alive its afternoon i began to think you were dead buddy led the way into his bedroom piled his pillows together and gingerly lowered himself upon them he showed his strong white teeth in a wide grin and winked meaningly ill be all right directly its this here sim sympathetic booze they talk about have a drink mr gray theres a coupla bottles of real liquor in the closet not this tigers milk you get the caller declined the invitation where the devil have you been buddy we were getting worried who me oh i been lookin around your mother is nearly frantic buddy stirred uneasily pshaw im fine i can take keer of myself nobody dont need to worry about me good now then you young scoundrel im going to order you the sort of breakfast that goes with what ails you and while it is coming up you are going to jump under the shower where dyou get that jump stuff the youth inquired faintly besides im clean but gray had seized the phone and as soon as he had given his order he strode into the bathroom and turned on the water he was out again in a moment then laughingly he dragged the aching texan from his couch under you go he insisted or ill wet down your whole japanese flower garden some pajamas aint they i got a dozen pairs buddy said proudly quick if you think ill consent to hang around a lonesome hotel while you sleep youre mistaken i cant tell you how glad i am to run into you buddy im dying to have a riotous time eh briskow turned an inquiring face to the speaker ive been hibernating in the wilderness sucking my paw and living off my fat like a bear i want you to shown me this town a bath a brisk rubdown and breakfast put buddy in fairly good fettle once more so marked was his improvement in fact that gray envied him his glorious gift of youth flying pretty high arent you the elder man inquired with a wave of the hand that took in the expensive suite well i aint exactly broke true but i know what these rooms cost thats going strong for a lad like you you took em didnt you when you had less n i got ahem it is embarrassing to be held up as an example ive done a good many things buddy that i wouldnt like to see you do if they wouldnt hurt me any more n theyve hurt you id like to tryem another proof that you are still in short pants im a bad person to copy by the way why did you quit school buddy considered his reply then i reckon it was because of them short pants you speak about i cant stand bein laughed at mr gray it comes hard to stand up in a class along with a bunch of children and make mistakes and have a little boy in a lace collar and spring heels snap his fingers and sing out in a sweet soprano oh teecher then have him show you up they put me in with a lot of nursin babes what the hell i weigh a hundred and ninety and i got a beard didnt you learn anything buddy closed a meaning eye and his pleasant features wrinkled into that infectious smile ill tell the world i did after the whistlin squabs was asleep in their nests i went out among the whippoorwills an the bats aint it funny how quick folks can learn to put up with bad grammar when you got a jingle in your jeans i guess ive got enough education to do me anyhow i can write ozark briskow in the lower righthand corner and that seems to get me by you wouldnt consent to go back or have a tutor like allie who me briskow laughed scornfully umm merely a suggestion you are the architect of your own career im fed up on that kind of schoolin mr gray i buddys face reddened he dropped his eyes i dont mind tellin you i its like this i kinda got a girl no the speaker was surprised incredulous sure have shes wonderful shes right here in this hotel buddy youre developing gray exclaimed with apparent admiration i been showin her the sights thats what ails me this morning she lets me take her around to places trusts me you understand she thinks im aces splendid i wish youd ask her to dig up a friend how dyou mean why ask her to find another goodlooking girl for me i assume she is good looking then we can make it a foursome im a great entertainer and while i dont drink i havent the slightest objection to ladies who do dallas i believe is a pretty lively shes a stranger here buddy broke in stiffly his enthusiasm had cooled he regarded gray with veiled displeasure an besides she aint that kind of a girl oh sorry i thought from what you said that headache bottles in your closet too my mistake buddy shell take a drink with me the youth confessed anyhow shes gettin so she will i dont see anything wrong in a woman takin a drink now an then with a man she with a man thats honorable the last words were voiced defiantly hastily buddys caller averred nor do i we shant come to blows over an abstract moral issue like that this is an age of tolerance an age of equality i flatter myself that im quite as lawless and broad minded as the average bachelor of our very smartest set im the speaker gulped im goin to marry her oh fine grays enthusiasm was positively electric he seized buddys hand and crushed it education indeed no use for that now is there i mean im goin to if i can if shell let me let you with your money why shell jump at the chance no doubt you have already asked her or she suspects the lad shook his head she dont have to marry nobody shes got money an estate you think its all right for me to do it simpler men than you have asked that question and wiser men than i have refused to answer as for me ive never had the courage to take the plunge however the worst you can get is a heartbreak and a lifetime of regrets but of course the woman takes some chances too tell me about her well buddy beamed fatuously i dunno hardly where to begin into his voice as he spoke there crept a breathless excitement into his eyes a dumb adoration shes wonderful shes too good for me once and a while they are shes educated too more in your class mr gray i dunno how she stands for me shes the smartest purtiest girl shes young eh shes older n i am i reckon shes mebbe twentyfive i never ast her naturally how did you meet her when where im a terribly romantic old fool gray hitched his chair closer and leaned forward his face keen with interest well sir its a regular story like in a book i was in a restaurant with a coupla fellers an a feller she was with struck her struck her yep he was her brother so she told me anyhow i bounced him i sure spoiled him up a lot she was cryin an she ast me to take her home thats how i got to know her i spose she cottoned to me for takin her part thataway she didnt know the sort of place it was her brother had took her pore kid shes had a hard time an every man she ever knew but me done her dirt even her husband buddy scowled after a moment gray said quietly so shes married she was hes dead or something i was bashful about callin around to see her not havin anything to talk about but school an oil wells but she took an interest right away specially in the wells youd ought to hear the story of her life mr gray its as sad as any novel you see her folks had lots of money but her ma died an her pa was too busy to be bothered so he sent her off to a convent them nuns at the convent was so cruel to her that she run away and went on the stage howd you know i didnt but the stage is the usual refuge for conventbred girls who are abused ive met several did she was the old home in virginia sure mebbe you know her buddy cried perhaps i seem to remember the story what is her name arline montague the elder man shook his head you said something about a marriage i dare say she married some rich john whose family disapproved of the match so many show girls have been deceived like that you cant imagine the prejudice of those fifth avenue parents thats what she done an he went off an joined the french legion of honor an was killed foreign legion no doubt anyhow he never made no pervision for her but she wouldnt of touched a penny of his money if hed left it to her shes that honorable now that the lover had fairly launched himself upon the engrossing life story of his sweetheart he was in deep earnest and his listeners quick understanding his sympathy his grasp of the situation was a spur to further confidences it was a blessing to have a friend so old so wise and so worldly what is the estate you mentioned oh thats her own its all she had to fall back on its bein settled up now an shell have her money before long the old virginia homestead and the slaves good thing she met me when she did for them lawyers had it all tied up in court and wouldnt let go till she paid their fees a providential meeting truly you fixed that up of course and got rid of the wretched bloodsuckers ive done much the same thing more than once now one other question how does she happen to be in dallas i infer from your account that she is a model of virtue and that she accepted your aid only upon the condition that your attentions to her should be characterized by the deepest respect so well then how come that was just a lucky chance shes got some interests here stocks an things belongin to the estate she dunno herself how valuable they are but me comin right from texas an bein in oil an all she ast me to hep her out so i got her to come all that had kep her back was the expense mind you buddys tone became one of deeper admiration she aint blue or anything no siree her lifes been sad but youd never know it shes full of pep allus out for fun an thats what i like about her gee you gotta meet her mr gray well rather but meanwhile we must telegraph your parents not only that you have been found but also the further good news i we better not say anything about my gettin married why not theyd like to know id oughta wired em long ago but you understand miss montague aint exactly ma an allies kind youre not ashamed of her hunh the tone of this exclamation was an eloquent denial then lets have them come on and get acquainted theyll probably take right to her but when this suggestion met with disapproval gray inquired is it because you are ashamed of them of your mother and sister buddy stirred uneasily pshaw no a sudden thought came to him why its this way i havent ast her yet mebbe she wont have me if she says yes ill let em know good well make it for the time being a mere message of reassurance tonight you and miss montague shall dine with me and well go to a theater this arrangement met with young briskows enthusiastic approval and so it was left it was with something more than mere impatience that calvin gray awaited the dinner hour he was angry restless his mind was back in wichita falls whence the message from his detective had abruptly summoned him matters of moment were at issue there and with a love affair of his own upon his mind he could think of no undertaking less to his taste than this of saving a young fool from his folly he could expect no thanks if he succeeded and if he failed he would in all probability incur buddys enmity if not that of the whole briskow family families are like that it would all take time and meanwhile his business was bound to suffer however he was not one to turn back and he remembered with a pang the last look he had seen in ma briskows eyes gray was prepared to find his young friends light o love superficially attractive and she was all of that he was not prepared however to find her quite as good an actress as she appeared to be in spite of the fact that she probably took less pleasure in the meeting than did he she admirably covered her feelings she was delighted flattered buddy had so often spoken of him that she almost felt acquainted she was quite excited at knowing the famous colonel gray she would have recognized him anywhere from buddys glowing description grays heart sank as he studied miss montague she was blond to his suspicious eye a trifle too blond and she wore her hair bobbed she was petite and both in appearance and in mannerism she was girlish nevertheless she was selfreliant and there was a certain maturity to her wellrounded figure a suggestion of weariness about her eyes that told a story following his first critical appraisal gray was vaguely conscious of something familiar about her somewhere within him the chords of remembrance were lightly brushed but try as he would he could not make himself believe that he had ever seen her probably it was the type that was familiar he undertook to make sure by talking show business at the first opportunity she responded with enough spontaneity to give an impression of candor but her theatrical experience was limited and that line of exploration led nowhere whatever the pose she had adopted for buddys benefit it was evident now that she credited his friend with intelligence equal to her own and recognized the futility of deceit therefore she made no attempt to pass as anything except an experienced young woman of the world and gray admired her for it she smoked a good many cigarettes her taste in amusements was broad she had sparkle and enthusiasm she was in fact a vibrant young person and referred gayly to a road house whither buddy had taken her on the night before and where they had danced until all hours she loved to dance the elder man played host in his best and easiest style both at dinner and at the theater then he passed the burden of entertainment over to buddy first cheerfully declaring that he would not be sidetracked and that he intended to impose his company upon the young couple whether they wanted him or not this was precisely to young briskows liking and soon they were speeding out to that road house mentioned earlier in the evening buddy drove with miss montague by his side the while gray sat alone in the back seat of the car quietly objurgating the follies of youth and mournfully estimating his chances of surviving the night frankly those chances appeared pretty slim for buddy drove with a deathdefying carelessness by the time they had arrived at their destination grays respect for the girl had increased she had nerves of steel the resort was run on rather liberal principles a number of flushed and noisy couples were dancing to the music of a colored orchestra it was a hippocket crowd and while there was no public drinking the highpitched volubility of the merrymakers was plainly of alcoholic origin gray realized that he was in for an ordeal for he had become too well known to escape notice consternation filled him therefore at thought of the effect his presence here might have but the music went straight to buddys feet syncopation intoxicated him much as the throbbing of midnight drums and the pounding of tomtoms mesmerizes a voodoo worshiper and he whirled miss montague away in his arms without so much as an apology to his other guest there was nothing conservative about buddys dancing he embellished his steps with capricious figures and when he led his partner back to the table where he had left gray like a sailor marooned upon a thirsty atoll he was red faced and perspiring his enthusiasm was boiling over dawggone he cried now if we had something wet eh these pants is cut purpose for a brace of formfittin flasks but i left em in the room on account of you not drinkin mr gray miss montague the elder man exclaimed i am not a killjoy and i hastily resent buddys accusation i have pursued folly as far as any man of my years i bet him that you were a good fellow the girl said with a smile exactly abstinence comes as much from old age as from principle and i am in my very prime with all vigor i defend myself against the odious charge of virtuousness dyspepsia alone accounts for it you dont object to drinking a wiser man that i has said there are many things which we can afford to forget which it is yet well to learn i have had my day may i claim the next dance in spite of the fact that ozark briskow was compelled to sit out every alternate dance in a distressing condition of sobriety he enjoyed himself for he was playing host to the one woman and the one man for whom he cared most he had dreaded meeting gray fearing the effect of an open confession expecting opposition but gray was broad minded he was a regular guy in the relief of this hour buddy could have worshiped him except for the fact that he was too darned nice to arline nobody had the right to show her attentions as marked as his own gray was a man no woman could help loving before long buddy experienced a new sensation jealousy it was mild to be sure but it hurt a little once miss montagues suspicions had been allayed she too devoted herself to having a good time she rather enjoyed gray and her sense of victory over him she retired to the ladies room finally to powder her nose and when she reappeared it was with added animation and with a new sparkle to her eyes when next it came the elder mans turn to dance with her he caught upon her breath a faint familiar odor only half disguised by the peppermint lozenge that was dissolving upon her tongue and he smiled evidently this charmer maintained herself in a state of constant preparedness and her vanity bag hid secrets even from buddy where had he seen her for the hundredth time he asked himself that question for amid these hectic surroundings that first haunting suggestion of familiarity had become more pronounced but patient delving into the dark corners of his memory was unavailing and her conversation afforded him no clue as time passed the young woman made other trips to the dressing room returning always with an access of brightness and a stronger breath she assumed with gray a coquetry which buddy did not like buddy indeed strongly disapproved of it but that only drove her to more daring lengths she ventured at last to discuss the young millionaire with his friend hes a dear boy isnt he and so innocent hes learning ill say he is he has learned a lot from me delightful task to rear the tender thought but arent you afraid hell learn for instance why you are eating peppermints oho grays petite partner lifted her head and eyed him curiously do you know why i have a suspicion he said with a smile that when a girl deliberately perfumes her breath it is in preparation for the struggle in the cab miss montague laughed unaffectedly say i could like you mr wisenblum in spite of the fact that i ought to hate you hate me but why why shouldnt i because im rather nice i dance well you are and you do youd be a perfect dear if youd only mind your own business buddy is of age and you and i will get along like ham and eggs if youll remember that chapter xxi why the sos mallow voiced this question as he entered grays hotel room early the following evening im in a predicament and i hope you can help me the latter explained im trying to remember something and i cant i have a cold spot in my head mallow deposited his bag with a sigh of relief glad its no worse anybody can cure a cold in the head sit down and light up while i tell you about it in a few sentences gray made known the story of ozark briskows infatuation and the reason for his own interest therein the woman is of the common getrichquick variety he concluded and she wont do she didnt pull the family estate and her fathers slaves and the orange grove on you did she oh no she used that on buddy and he believes it implicitly so implicitly that she warned me to keep off the track she showed her teeth in a nice way ive seen her somewhere in some place where i should not have been but where it must have been in this country too not abroad or id remember her maybe i havent been as wild as you governor this is a big country and ive missed a lot of disreputable joints the former speaker smiled you have trained yourself to remember faces mallow your researches scientific researches my dear professor have led you into quarters which i have never explored i must identify this venturesome little gold digger without delay for buddy yearns to make her all his matrimony is becoming the one object of his life why not let the poor carp have her its tough enough for a dame to get by since prohibition i dont see how they make it with everybody sober chances are shed get the worst of the swap at that not unlikely but that is neither here nor there understand me im no seraph i pose as no model of rectitude and unfortunately for my peace of mind miss montague is a really likable young person but buddy has a mother and a sister and they hold me responsible for him we three are dining downstairs in an hour perhaps you could look in on us sure ill give her the once over mallow agreed if shes anybody in our set ill know her the dinner had scarcely started when gray heard his name paged and left the table in the lobby mallow was waiting with a grin upon his face is that her he inquired that is the girl girl arline montague eh her name is margie fulton and she had her hair up when they built the union pacific nonsense youre mistaken she cant be more than twentyfive thirty at most a woman can be as young as she wants to be if shell pay the price margie had her face tucked up two years ago cost her five thousand bucks i cant believe it you see it every day look at the accordionpleated beauts in the movies why some of those dolls nursed in the civil war those face surgeons have ironed the wrinkles out of many a withered peach and youre dining with margie fulton the suicide blonde i know her kid her what mallows hearer gasped sure she was married to bennie fulton the jockey and they had a boy bennie was ruled off in new orleans and started a gambling house new orleans wait im beginning to remember into grays mind came an indistinct memory the blurred picture of a race track with its shouting thousands a crowded betting ring then more clearly a garish overfurnished room in a southern mansion clouds of tobacco smoke rising in the cones of bright light above roulette and poker tables negro servants in white with trays mint juleps in tall frosted glasses a pretty girl with strawcolored hair youre right he agreed finally she was a comeon thats her she worked the betting ring daytimes and boosted in bennies place at night whenever she was caught she suicided thats how she got her name just what do you mean by that why the usual stuff a bottle of water with a poison label if a mullet threatened to call the police shed cry you have ruined my life then with shaking hand shed pull the old skull bottle and drink herself to death of course the poor leaping tuna usually got the acid out of her hand in time to save her she saw to that gray was laughing silently my dear professor he confessed wisdom of a sort is mine sometimes i grow weary with the weight of my experiences and wonder why the world so seldom shows me something new but beside you i am as a babe tell me what has become of the exjockey husband she divorced him mind you margie was square like most of those comeons shed how dare a guy that so much as looked at her you know the kind i mean and the child where do you suppose she keeps it mallow reflected the last time i saw the little cherub he was singing bass in a bellboys quartette at hot springs he hops bells at the arlington summers and butchers peanuts at the track during the season you know hollers here they come before they start then when the women jump up he pinches the betting tickets out of their laps and cashes them with the bookies could you get hold of this this boy basso and bring him here without letting him or his mother know i can if hes still at hot springs and i saw him there the last time i was up the little darling got me into a crap game and ran in some shaped dice of course it would cost something to get him how much mallow shot his cuff and upon it gravely figured up the probable expense well there would be the fares and the eats and his bit he wouldnt come for nothing hed gyp me for ten dollars but hed probably come for five id offer him three there is a thousand dollars in it if you can produce him within the next fortyeight hours i doubt my ability to sit on the safety valve much longer than that for buddy briskow is rapidly breaking out with matrimonial measles if i throw cold water on him it will only aggravate the disease a thousand dollars mallow cried why for a thousand berries ill bring you his head on a platter ill car the little devil down and lock him in a suitcase the speaker hesitated a moment before concluding its a dirty trick on margie though i know but im thinking of buddy now in heavens name hurry my constitution may survive a few more road houses but my reputation will not that night was a repetition of the one before but with variations and with trimmings for buddy wore his twopint trousers again and this time they were loaded hence gray had a chance to observe him at his best or worst a little liquor went a long way with the boy he derived much effect many byproducts so to speak from even a few drinks and the elder man was forcibly reminded of gus briskows statement that his son had a streak of the old nick in him it was true buddy was indeed like a wild horse artificially stimulated he became a creature of pure impulse and those impulses ran the entire gamut of hilarity he played the drum he wrestled with a burly doorman he yelled whenever he found what he called a good yelling place he demonstrated his ability to sing silver threads among the gold to the accompaniment of a fourpiece orchestra energetically engaged in playing something quite modern and altogether different these and many other accomplishments equally unsuspected he displayed on the way from one lively resort to a livelier he conceived the unique idea that he could swap ends with his touring car in much the same manner that he could turn a nimble cow pony and he tried it happily the asphalt was wet and in consequence the maneuver was not a total failure although it did result in a crumpled mud guard and a runaway milkwagon horses in dallas it appeared were not schooled to the sight of spinning motor cars and the phenomenon filled at least one with abysmal horror gray felt sure that he had visibly aged as a result of that ride and he began to understand why a new crop of wrinkles was appearing about the corners of margie fultons eyes no wonder she was beginning to look a trifle weary fearing that buddy was likely to turn sentimental without warning the elder man monopolized as much of miss montagues time and attention as possible he danced with her frequently and he assiduously devoted himself to winning her favor the result was a tribute to his acting and to his magnetism in a moment of abandon she confided to him that she wished he had buddys money or that he was a marrying man both of buddys flasks had been emptied by this time however so gray was not unduly beguiled by this flattery on the whole it was a horrible night as gray languidly crept into bed about daylight he had the satisfaction of knowing that he had at least excited his young friends open jealousy that might act as a stay on the other hand of course it might have directly the opposite effect one could never tell and it might be the part of wisdom therefore to gain possession of that diamond ring buddy sought him out in the lobby early the next afternoon and after a colorless greeting said queerly would you mind comin up to my room for a minute certainly not id have looked in on you before this if id thought you were up as the two mounted the wide marble stairs gray went on cheerfully not looking your best this morn afternoon my lad as for me i am in a manner of speaking reborn i have taken a new start careful reflection upon the providential outcome of that amazing skid has convinced me that whatever joys or sorrows assail me hereafter however much or little of life is spared me it will be all velvet a touch of mascaro about my temples and i shall look as young as i did yesterday what are we going to do tonight i dunno once inside his spacious suite buddy flung himself into a chair and with trembling fingers lit a cigarette it was evident that he had something to say but either dreaded saying it or knew not where to begin his companion meanwhile pretended to look out upon the street below in reality he was observing the young giant poor buddy he was suffering the latter cleared his throat several times before he managed to say you dont want me to marry arline do you mr gray frankly my boy i do not why there are many reasons whats one i dont think you love her briskow stirred is that why you went an got that dimon ring i had made when this query met with a nod the young texans face flamed and his eyes glowed what in hell he swallowed his anger rose to his feet and made a nervous circuit of the room before coming to a pause at grays side his lips were working there was a tragic a piteous appeal in his eyes his voice shook as he stammered i didnt mean to break out at you mr gray i like you gee i youre kinda like god to me id ruther be like you than well there aint nobody i like like i like you you could get her away from me if you wanted to but you wouldnt do a trick like that would you i was mighty happy till you came you got that ring with you i have it in my pocket i want it buddy extended a quivering hand why im goin to ask her to marry me today if she wont im goin to she will buddy gasped you sure im quite sure she would if you asked her but i dont want you to ask her when an expression of pained reproach leaped into the lads face the speaker explained quickly dont think for a moment that i care for her nor that she has the slightest interest in me it is you that i care for what you just said pleased me touched me i wish you could understand how much i really do care for you buddy wont you wait a few days before you i cant wait you must the men eyed each other steadily for a moment then buddy demanded querulously what have you got against her anyhow you wouldnt believe me if i told you she told me everything there is to tell an i told you i dont care what shes done if she ever done anything shes had a hard time will you wait fortyeight hours no twentyfour gimme that ring when gray made no move the speaker ran on excitedly im a man im of age its none of your business what i do nor pas or mas either it wont do no good for them to come gray went to the door locked it and pocketed the key buddy his voice was firm his face was set you are a man yes although you were only a boy a few weeks ago you are going to act like a man now you goin to try an hold me here the inquiry was one of mingled astonishment and anger for young briskow could scarcely believe his eyes dont do that mr gray i nobody cant make me do anything please dont thats plumb foolish what if i told you that miss montague is buddy interrupted with a harsh cry damn it i said i wouldnt listen to anything against her im tellin you again keep your mouth shut about her the youths face was purple he was trembling his fists were clenched and with difficulty he restrained even a wilder outburst you can have the ring but you lemme out of here quick when this command went unheeded he strode toward the bedroom intending to use the other exit but his caller intercepted him lemme out the young man shouted one of us is going to remain in this room and i think it will be you as gray spoke he jerked off his coat and flung it aside better strip buddy if you mean to try it buddy recoiled a step incredulously he exclaimed you you wouldnt try that this is my room you must be crazy i think i am indeed to endure what i have endured these last two days to make myself ridiculous to be humiliated to risk my business ruin just to save a young fool from his folly impatience resentment anger were in the speakers tone i never ast you you butted in tried to cut me out thats dirty you was lyin when you said have it that way ive run out of patience ozark briskow too had reached the limit of his endurance he exploded momentarily he lost his head and cursed gray vilely for answer the latter moved close and slapped him across the mouth saying fight you idiot buddys low gasping cry had the effect of a roar it left the room echoing then savagely he lunged at his assailant he was blind in him was a sudden maniacal impulse to destroy he had no thought of consequences gray knocked him down it was a blow that would have felled an ox as the youth lay half dazed he heard the other taunting him mocking him get up you lummox and defend yourself youll be a man when i get through with you codes of combat are peculiar to localities in the north woods for instance lumberjacks fight with fist and heel in the southwest when a man is mad enough to fight at all he is usually mad enough to kill as buddy briskow rose to his knees he groped for the nearest weapon the nearest missile something anything with which to slay his hand fell upon a heavy metal vase and with this he struck wickedly as gray closed with him this time they went down together and rolled across the floor the legs of a desk crashed and a litter of writing materials was spilled over them gray was the first to regain his feet but his shirt had been torn half off and he tasted blood upon his lips he had met strong men in his time but never had he felt such a rocklike mass of bone and muscle as now buddy was like a kicking horse his fists were as hard as hoofs and that which they smote they crushed or bruised or lacerated he possessed now the supreme strength of a madman and he was quite insensible to pain he was uttering strange animal sounds shut up gray panted have the guts to keep still youll rouse the he dodged an awkward swinging blow from the giant and sent him reeling buddy fetched up against the solid wall with a crash for gray had centered every pound of his weight behind his punch but the countryman rebounded like a thing of rubber and again they clinched a room cluttered with heavy furniture is not like a boxing ring in spite of grays skill and an agility uncommon in a man of his size it was impossible to stop the others rushes or to avoid them straining with each other they ricocheted against tables and chairs and only the fact that much of the furniture was padded and the floor thickly carpeted prevented the sound of their struggle from alarming the occupants of the halls and the lobby they fought furiously moving the while like two wrestlers trying for flying holds time and again they fell with first one on top and then the other their flesh suffered and they grew bloody the room soon became a litter for its fittings were upset flung about splintered as if the room itself had been picked up and shaken like a dolls house gray managed to floor his antagonist whenever he had time and space in which to set himself but this was not often for buddy closed with him at every opportunity at such times it was the elder man who suffered most in a way it was an unequal struggle for youth ablaze with a holy fire was matched against age stiffened only by stubborn determination neither man longer had any compunctions each fought with a ferocious singleness of purpose buddys face had been hammered to a pulp but gray was groaning he could breathe only from the top of his lungs and the bones of his left hand had been telescoped agonizing pains ran clear to his shoulder and the hand itself was wellnigh useless it was an extraordinary combat certainly the walls of this luxurious suite had never looked down upon a scene so strange as this fight between friends how long it continued neither man knew not a great while surely measured by the clock but an interminable time as they gauged it nor could calvin gray afterward recall just how it came to an end he vaguely remembered buddy briskow weaving loosely rocking forward upon uncertain legs blindly groping for him the memory was like that of a figure seen dimly through a mist of dreams then he remembered calling up his last reserve of failing vigor even as he launched the blow he knew it was a knockout the colossus fell lay motionless it was a moment or two before gray could summon strength to lend succor then he righted an armchair and dragged buddy into it he reeled as he made for the bathroom for he was desperately sick as he wet a towel meanwhile clinging dizzily to the faucet his reflection leered forth from the mirror a battered repulsive countenance shockingly unlike his own he was gently mopping young briskows face when the latter revived buddys eyes were wild he did not recognize this unpleasant stranger until a familiar voice issued from the shapeless lips youll be all right in a few minutes my lad briskow lifted his head he tried to rise but fell back limply for as yet his body refused to obey his will you licked me he declared faintly licked me good didnt you buddy oh buddy it was a yearning cry grays streaked swollen features were grotesquely contorted you wont be mad with me will you want to fight any more the victor groaned my god no you nearly killed me this time buddy managed to gain his feet then i reckon ill go to bed i feel purty rotten gray laughed aloud in his deep relief righto and after ive phoned for a doctor if you dont mind ill crawl in with you chapter xxii on the morning after the fight mallow knocked at grays door then in answer to an indistinct and irritable command to be gone he made himself known its me governor and ive got exhibit a really came the startled query there was a stir from within the lock snapped and the door opened ive got a little friend here that i want you to mallow paused inside the threshold his mouth fell open he stared in frank amazement sweet spirits of niter he gasped what happened to you i was playing tag in the hall with some other old men and one of them struck me my god youre a sight mallow remained petrified i never saw a worse mess come in and close the door i am vain therefore i have a certain shyness about exposing my beauty to the curious gaze pardon me if i seat myself first i find it more comfortable to sit than to stand to recline than to sit stiffly the speaker let himself into an upholstered divan and fitted the cushions to his aches and his pains his bruises and his abrasions he sighed miserably his features were discolored shapeless his lips were cut strips of adhesive tape held the edges of a wound together his left hand was tightly bandaged and the room reeked with the odor of liniment youve been hit with a safe or something mallow declared evidences of some blunt instrument as the newspapers say maybe a pair of chain tongs blunt and heavy yes buddy briskow and i had an argument that big bum did he lay it on you like that say hes got the makings of a champ pride impels me to state that he got the worst of it he is scarcely presentable while i your side won it did now where is the boy hes outside without shifting his astonished gaze mallow raised his voice and cried hey bennie the door opened a trim diminutive figure entered bennie mit my friend colonel gray the youngster a boy of indeterminate age advanced and shook hands there was no mistaking him he was margie fultons son in size in coloring in features i told bennie you could use a bright kid about his age and hes bright it required no clever analysis of the lad to convince gray that he was indeed bright as bright and as hard as a silver dollar he had a likable face or it would have been likable had it been in repose it was twitching now and gray said with a smile go ahead and laugh son the urchins lips parted in a wide grin and he spoke for the first time did the germans do that the effect of his voice was startling for it was deep and husky it was the older mans turn to be astonished he could pass for fifteen on the street mallow said but when he talks i chalk him down for thirtyfive how old are you ben seventeen whats the big idea anyhow the question was directed impudently at the occupant of the divan did you send all the way to hot springs to get a guy you can lick your mother is here in dallas my boy yeah there was a pause hows it breaking for her umm very well i thought shed like to see you bennie cocked his head he eyed the speaker curiously suspiciously come clean he rumbled mallow said you could use me i can i will the boy shrugged all right sharkey i spose itll come out in time only remember ive got twenty coming win or lose of course gray waved toward the dresser upon which was a handful of bills help yourself better make it twentyfive then wait outside please we will join you in a few minutes and dont make it thirty bennies traveling companion sharply cautioned when the door had closed gray gave his friend certain instructions after which he limped to the telephone and called arline montague may i ask you to step down to buddys room he inquired after making himself known oh it will be quite all right we three must have a little talk but he couldnt see you last night he was quite ill really i sat up with him most of there was a longer hiatus then hadnt we better argue that in buddys presence thank you in five minutes then as he and gray prepared to leave mallow said sourly margie is a good little dame in her way and i feel like a like a damnedstool my dear fellow the other told him i understand and id gladly take another beating like this one to escape this wretched denouement when ozark briskow answered grays request for admittance he was deeply embarrassed to find miss montague also waiting his stammered protest was interrupted by her sharp inquiry what is the meaning of all this mystery he said you were too sick to see me permit me to explain gray began as he closed the door behind them buddy and i came to blows over you you were in a manner of speaking an apple of discord between us and the melancholy results you behold jealousy of your charms was not my motive i merely asked buddy to defer a contemplated action he refused i insisted argument failed to budge either of us and the young womans sympathetic regard of grays victim changed to a glare of hostility as she turned upon the speaker crying you brute you ought to be arrested he ast me to wait arline to delay asking you a question which i felt should be more seriously considered in the absence of his family i took it upon myself to to butt in miss montague exclaimed with curling lip quite so i merit your disapproval but not your disdain with some heat buddy declared pa an ma know that i got a mind of my own it wont do em any good to come see here the woman demanded what have you been telling buddy about me i told him all there was to tell quite all i fear you have not been as frank as you would have me believe that in fact explains my connection with the affair believe me when i say that i am interested only in seeing justice done to both of you young people and in making sure that you do not deceive each other it is an impulse of artless youth to trick itself in glowing colors but you should know the whole truth about buddy and he about you if after you are thoroughly acquainted with each other you still maintain a mutual regard i shall have nothing further to say except to beg that i be allowed to show my true friendship for both of you well spring the bad news said miss montague briskow now displayed the first open resentment he had shown since his defeat of the day before you licked me mr gray an i took my medicine he growled you changed my looks but you didnt change my mind im waitin for the folks to come but i aint goin to listen to em let him get this off his chest buddy go ahead with the scandal saint anthony gray bowed suppose we ignore the early convent training and the old kentucky home and agree that they are pleasant fictions like the estate which you are in such imminent danger of inheriting those im sure you will admit are entirely imaginary buddy briskows swollen eyelids opened wider his tumid lips parted and an expression of surprise spread over his dropsical countenance step on it sneered miss montague dish the dirt buddys belief however that your stage career was blasted and your young life laid waste by the scion of a rich new york house should in the interests of truth be corrected he knows i was married true but not to bennie fulton the jockey that is a lie nor that the estimable mr fulton instead of perishing upon the field of glory dodged the draft and is doing as well as could be expected of a jockey who has been ruled off every track in the country and is now a common gambler against whom the finger of suspicion is leveled its a lie the woman stormed of buddy she inquired you dont believe that do you you dont intend to listen to that sort of stuff the object of this appeal was torn by conflicting emotions doubt is a weed that sprouts fastest in dull minds suspicion is the ready armor of ignorance to young briskow came the unwelcome vision of those oil wells was gray telling the truth could it be that arline had made a fool of him but no she was smaller prettier more adorable than ever now that she was whipped by this gale of anger and a girl like that could not be a deceiver buddy longed desperately to believe her refutation of the charge he closed his eyes and made himself believe even now gray was saying if you would tell the boy all he ought to know i would take myself off and have nothing more to say youyou make me sick miss montague cried vibrantly what right have you to preach what kind of a man are you if he believed your lies for a minute id never want to see him again he has been a true friend to me her voice quavered caught in her throat the only true friend i ever had i dont care whether hes rich or poor but men like you are all alike what chance has a girl got against you you want to use his money so you ppoison his mind break a womans heart just bbecause you hate me the last words were sobbed forth miss montague broke down hell hoarsely exclaimed young briskow youre makin her cry gray sighed he stepped to the door opened it and called come in both of you arline montagues shoulders ceased to shake she lifted her blond head alertly then she uttered a breathless exclamation buddy meanwhile had been staring at the door and he was surprised when instead of his family he saw entering a strange man and a boy small of stature but old of face a boy insouciant impudent swaggering it was this boy who spoke first hello momma he cried at sound of that voice buddy recoiled for it was deeper than his own his expression of dismay was no doubt ludicrous at any rate the urchins lively eyes leaped to his face and remained there while a grin spread over his features hully gee rumbled the lad heres another one that ought to be buried mrs fulton it was gray speaking i took the liberty of asking your son buddy briskow heard no more for his ears were roaring her son that voice being little more than a boy himself nothing could have hurt him more cruelly than this his impulse was to flee the room for his world had come down in crashing ruin she had lied she had made a fool of him gray had been right the others were still talking when buddy broke in faintly his battered visage was white his lips were colorless i reckon this ends my part of the entertainment said he slowly he seated himself and bowed his head in his hands for he had become quite ill arline montague margie fulton once the blow had fallen behaved rather well she took bennie in her arms and kissed him then in answer to his quick look of dismay at her agitation she patted him on the shoulder and said its all right son you didnt know didnt know what demanded the lad say he stared angrily from one face to another is it a plant hush you wouldnt understand bennies suspicions now were in full play and his gaze came to rest upon calvin gray his eyes began to blaze you you big bum he cried i might have known you were a doublecrosser hush bennie please ill get you for this the midget was quivering with rage youll look worse n that you you big bum take my key here the mother thrust her room key into the boys hand run along i ill see you in a few minutes to mallow she said take him out please you brought him mallow flushing uncomfortably took bennie by the wrist and dragged him to the door dirty work said the woman when the two had gone her eyes were dark with anger as she stared at gray it must look so to you he agreed frankly i didnt enjoy it bah margie turned to briskow but in his attitude his averted gaze she read the doom of her hopes one final chance remained however and desperately she snatched at it buddy she cried buddy her voice was poignant as she pleaded i couldnt tell you the truth i wanted to i laid awake nights trying to get the courage but i was afraid you wouldnt understand id have told you the whole thing if youd ever given me the chance you know ive been married does it make so much difference that i have a son when the object of her appeal only stirred she went on reproachfully are you going to allow this this man to come between us i wouldnt believe you now if buddy choked im through you mean that the young fellow nodded very well something in the tone of the last words some accent of desperation caused buddy to raise his head he was in time to see margie fumble with her purse and extract something therefrom to buddys eyes it resembled a bottle there is no use fighting any more you have ruined my life my god young briskow yelled in dismay dont do that stop her he leaped to his feet and lunged for the poison vial which was trembling upon arlines lips gray too had been galvanized into action but of an unexpected nature he grappled with buddy and held him look out the latter gasped shes killin herself the texan was weak with horror he could only paw impotently at his captor and cry arline you wouldnt do that for me lemme go arline this is the end moaned the woman still holding the bottle to her lips her despair was tragic nevertheless she did not instantly hurl herself into the hereafter this hesitation at meeting death was only natural perhaps for none but the bravest can leap into the unknown without a moment of farewell drink hearty gray exclaimed over his shoulder meanwhile closing tighter his embrace of the terrified youth buddys struggles suddenly ceased for at last the bottle had been drained the girl was groping blindly toward the nearest chair godlmighty you let her do it he cried hoarsely you you murderer we we gotta get a doctor quick nonsense water wont hurt her and thats all it is shes known as the suicide blonde say youre bursting with information arent you it was miss montague tottering upon the brink of the grave who voiced this explosive inquiry her drooping shoulders straightened she raised her head and flung the empty bottle violently from her her face was deathly white to be sure but not with darting agonies you know everything dont you you make plain the past the present and the future well madame thebes youre under the wire with the horseshoe on your neck with head erect and with firm tread she moved to the door she turned there and blazed forth in bitter scorn her bobbed curls shaking as she spoke take that selling plater back to the car barn where he belongs im off boobs for life i knew you had a jinx on me the minute i saw you for i broke my mirror the day you breezed in seven years bad luck my god youre all of that and more why youd bring bad luck to a church ill beat it now while you give little rollo his bottle and rock him to sleep if he cries tell me and and ill furnish the rock the door slammed to behind the diminutive fury and gray sank feebly into a chair he was laughing silently by jove shes splendid he chuckled buddy i i like that woman it was midforenoon of the next day mrs fulton after a restless night was packing her trunks her room was in disarray what with open suitcases and piles of dresses lingerie shoes and the like strewn carelessly about she had halted her labors for a second time to scan a brief note that had arrived a few moments before and ran as follows dear mrs fulton i am not really such a bad sort as you consider me and im genuinely interested in that boy of yours lets cry quits and have a serious talk about him and perhaps other things sincerely yours calvin gray she was thus engaged when there came a knock and in answer to her voice the writer entered thank you for letting me come up he began im becoming accustomed to dodging chambermaids and scurrying up back stairs but im looking better dont you think theres only one way youd look better to me the woman said unsmilingly and that is laid out please put me at my ease i am physically sore and mentally distressed you sore distressed humph i wouldnt have consented to see you except for what mallow told me after what he said id like to give you a piece of my mind what right have you doing a thing like this do you know what i think of you i do also what mallow thinks of me for he told me you see he believes firmly that i am a well a person of much looser principles than i really am and my protestations of honesty only excite his veiled derision he says hes sorry sorry after spilling the beans mrs fulton i have learned that life is a mixed affair and that most of our actions are the results of conflicting motives yes and that we ourselves are products of conflicting forces good and evil few of us are as good as we would like to have people believe nor as bad as we appear i wonder if you will believe me when i say that i like you certainly not nevertheless i do for one thing you are a good fighter and a good loser i try to be but i fear i lack your spirit i would not have hurt you willingly the woman tossed her head and turned away when she spoke it was wearily i might have known i couldnt make the jump i never did win a big race a good loser eh well ive had enough practice at it how is buddy hurt i suppose his young life is blasted hell never trust another woman he is standing it pretty well and is greatly cheered by the fact that he can see out of his left eye practically as well as ever he is going back to the oil fields and learn the business i am going to put him to work what are you going to do with bennie do with him what can i do with him he is a bright boy im bright too but i have all i can do to get by it is a shame to think he will grow up into what his father was margie fulton wheeled and her blue eyes were dark i suppose you think im a bad mother but what do you know about it how do you know what ive gone through for him the sacrifices ive made ive made plenty and they came hard id like to help you make a man of him what you how id like to put him in business and teach him that there is no profit in shortchanging customers that the real wise guy isnt the fellow who gets the best of every bag of peanuts but the one who can go back to the same customer and sell him another bag the abstract principle has been put much more succinctly but i doubt if it would carry the same weight with him id enjoy giving the boy a hand up but he is more than id care to tackle alone theres mallow to help you hed be a refining influence the mothers lip curled how about you me isnt the sort of life you are living becoming a bit tiresome arent you about fed up on uncertainties the object of these queries drew a deep breath her eyelids flickered but she continued to stare at the speaker worry brings deeper wrinkles than old age wouldnt you like to tie to something solid and be able to show bennie that you are at heart the sort of woman i consider you hell soon be getting old enough to wonder if you are what he thinks you are or if i suppose you learned this bayonet practice in the army mrs fulton said hoarsely anybody can make a good living in a country like this if he cares enough to try ill back you if you need money and whats the price my price oh id feel well repaid if some day bennie acknowledged that i was a regular guy and if you agreed is that all quite all is there something you do well i can cook im a good cook women like me usually have hobbies they never can follow and i have two i can make a fool of a stove and i i can design childrens clothes wonderful things new things will you come to wichita falls and start a restaurant and make good things to eat if i supply the money and the customers will i the speakers face had flushed her eyes had begun to sparkle then its a bargain gray declared gayly why youll get rich for it is the chance of a lifetime ill guarantee patronage ill drum up trade if i have to turn sandwich man and ring a bell leave the details to me margie fulton sank slowly into the nearest chair regardless of the fact that it was piled full of lacy white expensive things her voice quavered broke as she said gee mr gray i figured there must be some decent men in the world but i never thought id meet one chapter xxiii in a long relentless struggle between two men psychology may play a part as important as in a campaign between two opposing armies or so at least calvin gray believed that in fact was one of his pet theories and from the first he had planned to test it it was characteristic of henry nelson on the other hand that he put no faith whatever in imponderables hence grays reference to morale on that day of their first meeting had amused him morale indeed as if a man of his tough fiber could be affected by the mere chanting of a hymn of hate he considered himself the captain of his soul and the antics of a malicious enemy the wild waving of false danger signals instead of distracting a resolute mariner would merely cause him to steer a truer course but nelson was a brooder time came when doubts distressed him when he began to put faith in malicious animal magnetism and despite his better sense to wonder if some evil spell really had not been put upon him in his arrogance it had seemed at first a simple matter to do away with gray that had been mistake number one the miserable breakdown of that plan the refusal of his hireling to go forward and the impossibility of securing a trustworthy substitute convinced him finally that he had erred grievously in his method some men are invulnerable to open attack and gray it seemed had been wet in the waters of the styx no that had been a bad beginning and nelson regretted it for he feared it had served as a warning so indeed it appeared for not long thereafter he actually felt or thought he felt the vengeful claws of his enemy a new strike in one of the western counties had become public and a brandnew oil excitement was born overnight trains were crowded roads were jammed with racing automobiles in the neighborhood of the new well ensued scenes to duplicate those of other pools for the first week or two there was a frenzy of buying and selling a speculation in oil acreage and town lots the nelsons of course were early on the ground for in spite of the fathers contention that they could ill afford at the moment to tie up more money in unproductive properties the son had argued that they must have protection and his arguments had prevailed henry went in person and he was disagreeably surprised to discover gray on the ground ahead of him the latter bore evidences of hard usage in the shape of a black eye and numerous bandages reputed to be the result of an automobile collision henry regretted that his enemys injuries were so trivial it was indeed a pity that so few accidents are fatal he bought rapidly right and left as much to forestall gray as anything else and he was back at the bank shortly with a number of leases not until some time later did he learn that he had paid a price for them twice as high as that charged for properties closer in it was bell who brought this unwelcome information home to him brought it home in his characteristic manner what the hell ails you anyhow the father inquired in apoplectic wrath have you gone clean crazy after some inquiry henry realized what ailed him and who had caused him to throw away his money but he did not apprise bell more than once they had been parties to wash sales and had helped to establish artificial values but to be victimized in the same manner was like the taste of poison of course it meant little in the big game at most the firm had been gypped only a comparatively few thousand dollars and the loss could probably be recouped by a resale nevertheless the incident was significant and upon second thought it appeared to shed light upon certain other expensive transactions in other fields now oddly enough this new oil discovery did not develop as had been expected in fact the excitement died out quickly and when henry nelson undertook to dispose of his holdings he was faced by a heavy loss for gray was offering adjoining acreage at low prices following this unhappy experience the scandal about the jackson well became public the atlantic company having at last located the leak in its pipe line and the whole red river district enjoyed a great laugh henry nelson did not laugh he turned green when he realized how close he had come to buying that lease of course here was a swindle that gray could have had nothing to do with and yet nelson wondered why bob parker had failed to sell it to him bob had tied it upon an option awaiting his return and he had hurried back on purpose to examine it why hadnt he bought it henry asked that question of the girl and when she told him as much as she knew he began to believe that the whole thing was indeed an incredibly bold attempt to swindle him and him alone miss parker of course was deeply chagrined at her connection with the fraud nevertheless the banker felt his flesh turn cold at the narrowness of his escape he assured himself upon calmer thought that his imagination was running away with him this was too devilishly ingenious too crooked and besides gray had promised to fight fair all the same the thing had a suspicious odor and nelson slept badly for a few nights he decided to use extra caution thereafter and see that he neither paid more for leases than they were worth nor permitted anybody to salt him salting after all was rare one read about it in books but no experienced operator had ever been fooled in that way about this time a big gasser blew in north of the louisiana fields and wise oil men began to talk about arkansas and quietly to gather in acreage less than a week later one of nelsons field men brought into the bank a youth who owned some property in the latter state this yokel was a sick man he was thin and white he had a racking cough and he knew nothing about oil except from hearsay all he knew was that he would die if he didnt get to a warmer drier climate but the story he told caused henry nelson to stare queerly at his field man that very night the latter left town on the third night thereafter in answer to a telegram nelson and the arkansas farmer slipped unobtrusively out of wichita falls it so happened that brick stoner en route to hot springs for a little rest was a passenger on the same train stoner returned in due time much rested and he brought with him a large check to the firms account we timed it to the minute he told mcwade and mallow that gasser couldnt have come in better if wed ordered it nelsons dickering under cover for more acreage near what hes got but i tipped off who he was he fell easy eh stoner grinned he was so pleased with himself at swindling an invalid and so scared somebody would discover those seepages that he couldnt hardly wait to sign up if it hadnt of been for the general excitement he might of insisted on time to do some exploring but hes pulled a rig off another job and hes sending it right up weve got some good news too mcwade asserted avenger number one is trying hard to come in no i tell you grays got a rabbit foot if we continue to trail along with him ill be losing you as a partner brick how so why ill be turning honest it seems to pay umm probably id better keep all this nelson money and leave you oh not at all the junior partner said quickly that isnt an oil deal strictly speaking for you say there aint oil enough on the land to grease a jackknife i look on it as a realestate speculation with a laugh stoner accepted this explanation and then announced that he was hungry for his breakfast this time mallow spoke up im ballyhooing for a new joint fultons fancy waffle foundry follow me and ill try to wedge you in but youll have to eat fast and pick your teeth on the sidewalk for we need the room in answer to stoners stare the speaker explained his interest in the welfare of wichita fallss newest eating place and en route thereto he told how margie fulton came to be running it gray did it he got the parker girl to help us and we had the place all fixed up by the time margie got here shes tickled pink and itll coin money if it isnt pinched pinched sure bennies the cashier and he palms everything from dimes to dishtowels force of habit better count your change till i break him of shortchanging the customers you stoner stopped in his tracks oh im giving him lessons in elemental honesty my god are you turning honest too the other man exclaimed seems like thats all i hear lately it was a blue day for henry nelson when avenger number one came in for it made necessary immediate drilling operations on his part and the worst of it was the well was not big enough to establish a high value for his holdings it was just enough of a producer to force him to begin three offsets and that for the moment was an undertaking decidedly inconvenient bell nelson was even more dismayed at the prospect than was his son for upon him fell the necessity of raising the money hell of a note the old fellow grumbled when a wet well puts a crimp in us a little more good luck like this and well go broke we cant afford to let go or to sublease of course not after the stand weve taken theres talk on the street about the bank now and id give a good deal to know where it comes from the junior nelson had heard similar echoes but he held his tongue i never did like your way of doing business the speaker resumed fretfully weve overreached you wanted it all and this is the result now henry nelson was warranted in resenting this accusation for it had ever been bells way to pursue a grasping policy therefore he cried angrily thats right pass the buck you know you wouldnt listen to anything else if were in deep youre more to blame than i nothing of the sort old bell began a profane denial but the younger man broke in irritably ive never won an argument with you so have it your own way but while youre raising money for the avenger offsets youd better raise plenty for gray is going to punch holes down as fast as ever he can who is this gray whats he got against you henrys eyes shifted has he got anything against me he bought a good lease and was wise enough to get somebody to make a well for him those crooks those wildcatters now he proposes to develop his acreage as rapidly as possible nothing strange about that is there is he sore at you we didnt get along very well in france humph i suppose that means you fought like hell and now hes getting even by the way where am i going to get this money that is up to you said henry with a disagreeable grin whereupon his father stamped into his own office in a fine fury not long after this father and son quarreled again for of a sudden a perfect avalanche of lawsuits was released the mysterious origin and purpose of which completely mystified old bell the nelsons like everybody else had unsuccessfully dabbled in oil stocks and drilling companies for some time before the boom started also during its early stages and most of those failures had been forgotten they were painfully brought to mind however when henry was served with a dozen or more citations and when inquiry elicited the reluctant admission from the banks attorney that a genuine liability existed a liability which included the entire debts of those defunct jointstock associations in which he and his father had invested this was enough to enrage a saint henry argued that he had invariably signed those articles of association with the words in parentheses no personal liability and he was genuinely amazed to learn that this precaution had been useless he protested that scores nay hundreds of other people were in the same fix as he and that if this outrageous provision of the law were strictly enforced and judgments rendered widespread ruin would result his lawyer agreed to this in all sympathy but read aloud the provisions of the statute and nelson derived no comfort from the reading the lawyer was curious to know by the way who had taken the trouble to acquire all of these claims a task of heroic size but about all the encouragement he could offer was the probability of a long and expensive series of legal battles the outcome of which was problematical that meant annoyance at best and a possible impairment of credit and the nelson credit right now was a precious thing as henry well knew eloquently he cursed the day he had met calvin gray what next he wondered he discovered what next when the driller he had sent up to arkansas in charge of his rig one day came into the office in great agitation the mans story caused his employers face to whiten salted i dont believe it nelson seized his head in his hands oh my god he gasped misfortunes were coming with a swiftness incredible salted victimized like the greenest tenderfoot a small fortune sunk while the whole country was still chuckling over the jackson scandal this was a nightmare henry was glad that his father was in tulsa in conference with some other bankers over that avenger offset money otherwise there was no telling to what extreme the old mans rage would have carried him at this final calamity and that whining coughing crook that bogus farmer was in arizona or elsewhere out of reach of the law the younger nelson turned desperately sick if this was not more of grays work it was the direct result of the curse he had called down does anybody know henry inquired after he had somewhat recovered his equilibrium nobody but us fellows you you mustnt shut down youve got to keep up the bluff until until i get time to turn you going to bump off that land to somebody else what do you think im going to do nelson was on his feet now and pacing his office with jerky strides take a loss like that he paused and glared at the bearer of bad tidings then growled what are you grinning about oh you neednt say it you want yours eh is that it well its worth something to turn a trick like this how much its a big deal itll take something substantial something substantial and paid in advance to make our boys forget all the interesting sights theyve seen but id rather leave the amount to you henry you know me i wouldnt be a party to a crooked deal not for anything except to help you out how much the banker repeated hoarsely but the field man merely smiled and shrugged so with a grunt of understanding henry seated himself and wrote out a check to bearer the amount of which caused him to grind his teeth now it was impossible to dispose of a large holding like that arkansas tract at a moments notice in order to evade suspicion it was necessary to go about it slowly tactfully hence the financier moved with as much circumspection as possible his careful plans exploded however when he met calvin gray a day or so later gray had made it an invariable practice to speak affably to his enemy in passing mainly because it so angered the latter this time he insisted upon stopping he was debonair and smiling as always but there was more than a trace of mockery in his tone as he said so your luck has changed hasnt it that avenger well of mine has put a good value on your property i congratulate you colonel humph i dont believe in luck nelson mumbled and the avenger isnt enough of a well to brag about so you dont believe in luck it seems to be our lot invariably to differ doesnt it now my dear colonel im not ashamed to confess that i am deeply superstitious and that i believe implicitly in signs and prodigies you see i was born under a happy star at my nativity the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes as it were comfortable feeling i assure you take that incident at newtown not long ago doesnt that prove my contention what incident grays brows lifted whimsically of course how should you know there was a clumsy attempt to do me bodily harm to assassinate me funny isnt it so ill considered and so impracticable but about this avenger matter if you find it inconvenient to offset my wells as fast as i put them down perhaps youd consider selling inconvenient nelson felt the blood rush to his face at this insufferable insult but he calmed himself with the thought that his opponent was deliberately goading him after all it served him right for permitting the fellow to stop him inconvenient ha he turned away carelessly no offense my dear colonel i thought after your arkansas fiasco you might wish what arkansas fiasco nelson wheeled and in spite of himself his voice cracked ah another secret eh gray winked elaborately nothing could have been more deliberately offensive than that counterfeit of a friendly understanding very well i shant say a word you the banker was gasping youre doing your damnedest to to start something arent you every day every hour every minute the speaker bowed in defense of my promise to fight fair let me assure you however that i did not start this as a matter of fact i knew nothing about it until you had been hooked apropos of that quixotic promise please remember that your own actions have absolved me from it the men stared at each other for a moment that seemed interminable gray was watchful expectant nelson was plainly shaken by a desire so desperate that resistance left him weak he was like an animal frozen in the very attitude of springing foxy arent you he managed to say at last tempting me to make the first move with a mighty effort of will he forced his tense body to relax the act of a bully bah wouldnt i be a fool a bully is usually a coward gray said slowly neither of us is a coward im not ready to join the issue that way especially in a place like this the game is too exciting to youll get all the excitement youre looking for nelson cried wrathfully youve cost me a lot of money but you could have cost me a lot more if you hadnt been fool enough to brag about it and give me warning now ill send you out of texas afoot on my back perhaps but never on my feet without another word the banker passed on but he went blindly for his mind was in black chaos no chance now for secrecy he was in for a bit of hell he managed to kill the story in the local papers but it appeared in the dallas journals which was even worse and for the first time in his life he found himself an object of ridicule the arkansas transaction was made to appear the most outrageous swindle of recent oil history and coming so quickly after the jackson exposure it excited double interest and amusement in truth the facts about the salting of that arkansas tract did make a story for the methods employed had been both new and ingenious nelson had been fooled by a showing of oil in an ordinary farm well and by a generous seepage into a running stream some distance away not until a considerable sum had been spent in actual drilling operations however did those seepages diminish sufficiently to excite suspicion sufficiently in fact to induce the crew to pump the water well dry this done an amazing fraud had been discovered it had been found that the vendor of the land had removed the rock curbing and behind it had packed a liberal quantity of petroleumsoaked cotton waste naturally when the well had been walled up again and permitted to resume its natural level the result was all that the unscrupulous owner could have expected the creek seepage had turned out to be equally counterfeit but even more ingeniously contrived it had manifested itself where a stratum of clean white sand underlaid with clay outcropped at the foot of a high bank in the undergrowth quite a way back from the stream tardy investigation disclosed that a hole had been dug down to that layer of sand and into the hole had been poured several barrels of crude the earth from the digging had been removed and the hole had been cunningly covered up naturally the oil from this reservoir had followed the sand stratum and the resultant phenomenon at the waters edge had been well calculated to excite even the coldestblooded observer it had excited henry nelson to such an extent that he had bought not only this farm but a lot of other farms and nelson was shrewd oh it was a great joke the whole midcontinent field rocked with laughter at it nelson senior returned from tulsa bullmad and he came without the money he had expected to get what went on in his office that morning after he sent for his son none of the banks employees ever knew but they could guess for the rumblings of the old mans rage penetrated even the mahoganypaneled walls chapter xxiv gray had once told barbara parker that there was no one quite like him a remark more egotistical in the sound than in the meaning unusual in many ways he probably was but like most men the discovery that his proudest virtues were linked with vices of which he was ashamed struck him as extraordinary as if nature were not forever aiming at a balance in spite of the fact that he was impulsive headstrong swift in most things this girl possessed the unique faculty of rendering him acutely selfconscious and it annoyed him the more therefore to find how timorous he could be in putting her feelings to the test that was the one thing he could never quite summon courage to do she was so young so cool so disconcertingly straightforward that in contrast his own age appeared the greater and his many counterfeit qualities were thrown into uglier relief then too her answer meant so much that fear of refusal became an actual torture and the mere thought of it left his arrogant spirit strangely humble to a man in his vengeful mood to a men whipped by one savage purpose love had come as a blessed relief and in consequence anger at his indecision was the greater sometimes he told himself that he deserved to lose her one such occasion was after he had taken her out to the avenger lease there was more than one well by this time avenger number two and three and four were going down and offsetting the first avenger were three of nelsons rigs bob studied the situation briefly then with a dubious shake of her head she announced you are taking a big risk mr gray you mean these new holes may come dry of course but i believe in crowding my luck i dont know any other way to work you have been lucky havent you she stared at him with a detached impersonal interest everything is coming your way even down in the ranger district oh i have my share of troubles i lost a crooked hole recently had to skid the derrick and start over then a pair of chaintongs was dropped into another hole that makes an expensive fishing job the worst ever somebody must have it in for you when gray nodded bobs face lit up with surprise really do you suspect someone in particular i know how interesting after a moment had passed and he had explained no further the girl went on everybody is talking about you and your success they say you have the golden touch that is a good reputation to enjoy but this country is full of fellows who came here knowing as little about oil as i knew and who have accomplished more sensational results ive come up like a rocket to be sure it remains to be seen whether i shall fall like a stick you wont fall do you really believe that the inquiry was eagerly put id trust your intuition miss bob sometimes i have moments of uneasiness for you see im drilling more wells than i should it is double or quits you understand if my luck breaks so do i you have always impressed me as a a man of destiny i think fate has selected you as an instrument with which to do big things thats why im always a bit overawed by you overawed gray laughed why i feel the same with you if you knew how little i am how little it all signifies except as a means to an end if you only knew what it is that i want so much more than oil or money or i thought you were like all the others here absorbed only in the game i was at first i had reason to be a very great reason i assure you then i saw something far more desirable than fortune far more absorbing than than the motive that brought me here some days like today i think im going to win it then again i grow fainthearted fainthearted you there was an elaborate skepticism in bobs tone but as the meaning of grays ardent gaze struck home to her she turned her head with a lightly affected laugh she was coloring but she knew that her companions agitation was so much greater than hers that he did not notice it fair lady he said a bit uncertainly you multiply my courage tenfold and i shall retain the guerdon of your faith but we swashbuckling fellows are proud we must come as victors or not at all and i am anything but victorious yet ive had many a fall and my armor is dented in a dozen places i have a record of failures that only a lasting success can wipe out when if ever that record is wiped out why my tongue shall be my hearts ambassador this was the boldest speech that gray had ever permitted himself never had he felt bob to be so close to him as on this day and in consequence he made of it a festival he played the lover with a respectful ardor doubly thrilling by reason of its restraint and that night it was not henry nelsons face that lingered last in his memory he wondered before he fell asleep if he had acted wisely in letting slip his hour opportunity has a fickle way of jilting those who ignore her and yet how could he speak with honor to himself it must not be inferred that henry nelson endured with patience the blows that were rained upon him on the contrary he fought back with every weapon he could lay hands upon and there were many in this he was aided by old bell for father and son were much alike and their friction had been only such as results from the rubbing of two hard bodies of identical composition now that they were put under heavy pressure they adhered and functioned without heat they were handicapped however in that they had the bank to think about and in times of frenzied finance such as this a banking business is more of a liability than an asset under normal conditions no single individual of grays limited resources could have caused them more than temporary annoyance but in the midst of a speculative frenzy in a time of vast paper profits and overnight losses at an hour when they themselves were overextended and the financial fabric of the whole oil industry was stretched to a point of inflation where a pin prick was apt to cause complete collapse the feat of warding off a lance in the hands of a destructive enemy was one that kept them in a constant state of nervous panic to make matters worse the crest of the wave had passed the boom was nearly over and money was no longer easy outside investors were cooling mysterious and powerful influences were at work and there were rumors of a break in the price of crude meanwhile so far as the nelsons were concerned it was necessary to pour a steady stream of dollars into the earth in order to save that which had been accomplished at immense cost and such oil as their producing wells gave forth was swallowed up in other holes it became with them a problem of how to hold on how to finance from day to day until production returns overtook exploitation expense a problem that put gray hairs in their heads and lines about their eyes they were forced to many expedients how they managed it at all baffled gray and worried him too for he knew that if ever they turned the corner they would be safe from him and his vengeance would fall illustration never had he felt bob to be so close to him as on this day to the ground one big well would set them up and there was always that danger for scarcely a week went by without news of some gigantic gusher knowing all there was to know about their field activities he set himself to the task of learning more about the bank itself and about their method of operating it this was a task indeed and he spent much time at it time he could ill afford by the way for he too had about exhausted his last resource he was surprised one day to receive from roswell the banker who had first backed him an almost peremptory summons to dallas gray had made much money for roswell and his crowd they were still heavily interested with him and he was counting upon their further support the tone of this letter therefore gave him a disagreeable shock on the whole however he was glad of an excuse to go for the briskows had returned and had bought a home in dallas and he was eager for a sight of them mr roswells greeting was quite as cool as his letter but he betrayed a keen interest in the progress of their joint affairs and asked a good many searching questions gray answered frankly you surprise me the banker announced finally for you confirm something i did not wish to believe i have just learned that you are using us to further a private grudge and to ruin a reputable man i couldnt credit such a statement without it is quite true except that i havent used you not at least in the sense you imply you have used our money it is the same thing oh not at all i have handled a number of speculations investments is a better word for you and your group and ive made a lot of money for you thats the most you expected thats all i promised so long as i continue to do that my motives my personal likes and dislikes concern you in no wise neither are you concerned in the use i make of my winnings legitimate competition is one thing malice doubledealing dishonesty is dishonesty gray interrupted sharply i am a quicktempered man mr roswell ill ask you to choose your words more carefully dont you call salting a well dishonest i do i didnt salt that arkansas property and i assume you refer to that in fact i knew nothing about it and i so informed nelson evidently he didnt believe me and i dont expect you to do so nevertheless it is true i have never lied to you and i never shall now malice yes i bear malice toward henry nelson and i shall continue to bear him malice long after i have put him in his grave roswells startled eyes leaped to the speakers face exactly i propose to put him in his grave and he knows it nonsense thats wild talk and youll regret it what has he done to you the object of this inquiry shrugged a private matter purely as to doubledealing is it doubledealing to go to an enemy and tell him frankly that you intend to down him and how you propose to do it did you do that i did what is more i offered to fight fair and he agreed but of course he broke that as he feels free to break any agreement when it becomes onerous or unprofitable he began by trying to assassinate me what are you saying roswell cried this is incredible grays cigar had gone out he lighted it with steady and deliberate fingers before he said i am giving you facts the fighting has not been all on my side for instance i havent hired men to drop tools in his wells or run crooked holes and that sort of thing as he has not that i wouldnt follow his lead if he forced me to but i havent had to resort to petty annoyances i havent had to make any small change for i have originality imagination even a small amount of daring while he well he is obvious he has nothing except physical courage thank god hes not a coward hell die hard amazing the banker was at a loss for words after a moment he inquired what about bell nelson a harsh headstrong ruthless old man whose history will not bear careful reading his sins shall be visited upon him through his offspring he will have to go too roswell stirred as if to shake off the effect of some oppressive mesmeric influence reluctantly he admitted all i can say is you have a colossal nerve precisely and that is all i had when i came to texas i was coming to that you deceived me gray you said you represented big capital had friends and connections a pardonable deceit under the circumstances was it not as a matter of fact i said nothing of the sort i merely allowed you to infer youre splitting hairs the banker was impatient the fact remains that you led me to make a fool of myself why man alive i have your whole history here and its a record of one sensational failure after another you had no backing whatever no is that the result of your own investigation partly for the rest you took nelsons word eh very well ive beaten him out from cover sooner than i expected now as to my failures failure proves only this that ones determination to succeed is not strong enough who fail except those who try you have not always succeeded neither have i invariably failed your report is a bit unfair you will fail now and you deserve to fail indeed why because youre doing an outrageous thing because see here gray i know why you hate nelson there ensued a moment of silence he told you that the younger mans face had slowly whitened he spoke with difficulty he told me everything he told me that you were dishonorably discharged from the army cashiered we used to call it and that you blame him i dont mind saying it was a shock worst ive had in years in time of war too the army doesnt do that unless without ample well gray its damned nasty quite the nastiest thing that can happen to a man the other agreed in a thin flat voice i couldnt wouldnt believe it why not you believed everything else he told you i wouldnt accept his word on a thing like that without asking you another pause followed theres probably some explanation i told him so mr roswell showed his genuine distress by the frown upon his brow and by his averted eyes he stirred uncomfortably then he broke out irritably well well why in hell dont you say something there is nothing to say what my god man you dont mean see here youre not a coward or a thief or an incompetent whats your side of the story whats the explanation explanations are hateful the man who makes them deceives either himself or the other fellow usually both it is easy to be plausible would a mere statement from me unsupported by proof convince you where it failed to convince a court martial of course not then why make you uncomfortable by doubting my word grays smile was like the mirthless grin of a mummy i was found guilty all in due military order and disgraced branded my uniform was taken from me and i cant wear it again i can never again serve my country it was handled quietly with admirable discretion for those things are bad for the morale you understand very few know about it im a proud man a vain man i assure you the death penalty would have been much easier to bear what did henry nelson have to do with it he alone can answer that an extraordinary situation this is your revenge eh as a man of spirit i had a choice of but two things revenge or suicide hmm it is an embarrassing situation for me indeed nelson has sold a large block of his bank stock to one of our directors tell him to get out from under quick gray said sharply for ill break henry nelson or ill kill him tut tut youre excited you mustnt talk like that i give you credit for an honest hatred but i cant sympathize with it neither can i believe so ill of henry nelson remember ive known him and bell for years with a complete finality the banker concluded youll have to give it up gray i beg pardon i say we shant permit you to go on with this murderous feud we cant be parties to it what youve told me warrants us in withdrawing our support instantly but i i damn it all i cant help liking you and believing in you frankly theres something sublime about a grudge like yours however we cant go on like this we cant put up more money now that we know what you have in mind call this thing off and perhaps i can induce our crowd to leave their money in until it can be worked out thats the most i can undertake i need your money and your support now more than ever the other man gravely confessed i need it at once today nevertheless i shant quit you must roswell cried impatiently you cant defy us the devil i cant it was grays turn to blaze thats exactly what im doing i defy you to get your money out i defy you to interfere with me in the slightest or to wring a particle of mercy out of me i knew this would come sooner or later and i planned accordingly what dyou think i am eh i tell you ive got him otherwise hed never squeal about this army matter now then tell your crowd to try and pull out thats not a threat sir for they have played fair with me and i shant sacrifice a penny of their money unless they force me to do so but im in control im sitting pretty they cant unseat me and i warn them not to try you are making a great mistake we will find a way to to pull you off ever try to pull a bulldog out of a fight when he had the other dog down and his teeth in its throat i have theres something rather horrible about it rather beastly and shocking and theres always the danger of losing a hand the speaker rose he hesitated before leaving to say your son served with honor mr roswell i know how you must feel about this other matter therefore i shall spare you the embarrassment of declining my hand the financiers face reddened rather stiffly he said you know whether you have a right to offer it instantly the departing visitor extended his palm and roswell realized that he had seldom seen a man more deeply moved thanks i it is a blow to lose your support but nothing can swerve me meanwhile im glad that we do not part as enemies when he had gone when he had passed out with head up and shoulders square the banker shivered slightly audibly he murmured god what a man what a hatred the briskows had just moved into their new home and the place was still in some confusion when gray mounted the steps pa answered the bell in his shirt sleeves and with a claw hammer in his hand for he had been hanging pictures he favored his visitor with a wide smile of welcome and a hearty greetingquite a feat inasmuch as his mouth was full of nails then having rid it of its contents he explained we got a slave that tends the door but i aint got gentled up to bells an things yet allies away an mas layin down so ma isnt ill i hope n no just ailin i thought mebbe one of the neighbors had run in to see her but i guess theyre busy we got lots of neighbors here rich ones an we made up our minds to like em if theyll give us a chance you were in luck to find a house in such a smart neighborhood gus now show me around quickly for im dying to see it lord im dyin to show it to somebody youre the first one thats dropped in an we been here most two weeks say youll stay an eat supper wont you of course i will and breakfast too if you can take care of me pshaw didnt we take keer of you when you come to the ranch we got three niggers now just doin the housework as if in justification of this riotous mode of life the oil man explained ma wanted to do it herself but shes porely an allie vetoed it complete she says well be stylish an enjoy life if it kills all three of us id of bought a bigger house if theyd of let me but it is large enough anything more would merely add to your cares her and ma picked out the furniture swell aint it beautiful gray exclaimed inwardly he groaned for although the contents of the home appeared to be expensive almost ostentatious they nevertheless betrayed a conspicuous lack of taste both in character and in arrangement here and there were color combinations so atrocious that they positively hurt the caller on the whole however the place looked better than he had expected and such indications of harmony and restraint as he detected he attributed to allie it was a nice enough home and with a little change a little rearrangement it could be made attractive even to one of elegant tastes those changes of course gray determined to make gus plainly was not yet accustomed to the sense of ownership and he hung with eagerness upon his guests expressions of approval after a tour of inspection the men wound up in the library an absurd misnomer under the circumstances inasmuch as the shelves were entirely bare except for allies dogeared school books and there before a blazing gas log they discussed the miracle allies gone out to the old farm to get some stuff for ma the father explained in due time some pitchers of her an buddy when they was little an a rockinchair an mas favorite bedspread an some other things she likes gray remembered the portraits executed by a st louis enlargement concern they had wide gilt frames and were protected from ravaging flies by mosquito netting he hoped that ma would not hang them in the hall or the livingroom and that rocker for which she yearned was probably the one with the creaking coiled springs the one that had leaped after him and clashed its jaws like an alligator by the way how does buddy like the new home the latter inquired he aint seen it yet says hes too busy to leave the job what you done to that boy anyhow im making a real man out of him and an oil man too he knew how to dress tools when i got him but hes a pretty good driller now before long hell be able to take charge of your property and run it on practical lines i told you he had it in him and that hed make a hand you never wrote us nothin about his his trouble i left the explaining for him gus smiled meditatively first we knew that you an him had been fightin was when he wrote us a letter sayin he was doin great an could see out of one eye then more gravely it was worryin over buddys affair that got ma to ailin she aint been right well since say whad you do with that woman briskow pronounced the last word with an accent of scorn and hatred i gave her a chance to make an honest decent living i set her up in business what and she is making good when the elder man shook his head impatiently gray went on im pretty worldly and calloused but if one virtue has been spared me it is charity for a moment the father studied his caller tell me he began was it altogether on buddys account that you an him tied into one another gray threw back his head and laughed frankly altogether i assure you thats why i found it so hard he oughta been licked takin up with a a thing like her gus was groping for words more eloquent of his displeasure at his son and his hatred for the object of buddys misplaced affections when gray forestalled him just a minute you are a rich man and you are growing richer careful frugal prosperous people like you are apt to become unduly hard and oversuspicious but you mustnt permit it think for instance what environment did to your children then remember that under slightly different circumstances it might have made evildoers even of them most people would like to run straight and would do so if they had a chance anyhow it is an interesting experiment to put the chance in their way tell me gus how much money have you got i dunno figgers over a thousand dollars dont mean much to me gray searched the speakers face with a speculative gaze its mostly liquid i presume there was a pause i mean its in cash or the equivalent oh sure these bonds an stocks an things briskow shook his head disapprovingly land aint any too safe either its rainin now an it ll keep on rainin till the farmers is all drowned out next year itll be droughty an fry em to a crisp no im skeered of land im skeered of everything this last was said plaintively why lookit these liberty bonds goin down steady i wouldnt put no money into the govment unless i had something to say about runnin it an spose i did i wouldnt know how it oughta be run how about oil properties wouldnt you like to invest in a good safe proposition with the prospect of big gosh no im skeerder of oil than anything cause i know somethin about it feller been tryin to sell me life insurance lately but you gotta die to get your money back no theres a catch in all them propositions sometimes i wake up nights dreamin were all back at the old place an pore again that ends my sleepin you see allies a lady now an shes used to silk stockins an buddys been out in the world spendin money on women an mas gettin old i could go back to corn bread but it would kill them worst of it is the black lime aint holdin up an our wells will give out some day briskow sighed heavily and his brows drew together in an anxious pucker youll have enough money in bank to do you banks bust i tell you the hull worlds full of skullduggery suspicious i should say i was i use to think if we had money our troubles would be over but lord thats when they begin you see if i was bright an knew what slick people is up to id be all right but why im like a settin hen i can feel the eggs under me but how am i goin to keep the skunks away when they smell the nest im most tempted to turn everything i got over to some honest man an let him hanle it some feller that had the savvy unfortunately such people are rare i dont know but one indeed who is he i reckon you know said briskow the listener looked up with quickened interest there was a sharp ring to his voice when he said let me get this right youre the only man i ever knowed that id bank my life on an youre smart you wouldnt take buddy but mebbe youd kinda take me take all of us i tell you im skeered just how much confidence do i inspire in you grays expression was peculiar for amazement doubt eagerness were equally blended this much id turn the hull works over to you if youd look out for us you scarcely know me oh i know you well enough briskow smiled his slow shrewd smile so does ma so does allie an bud for quite a while the caller sat with head bowed with his gaze fixed upon the flames when he looked up his face was red his eyes were brighter than usual to be trusted is a greater compliment than to be loved yes and its hell to be born with a conscience he fell silent again for this was a moment to be treasured and he could not let it pass too quickly you say you want nothing to do with oil anything but that i know it so well an mas gettin feeble again silence of course if youd do it i wouldnt ask no questions id rather shut my eyes an trust you than keep em open an you dont know how much id like to say yes but i fought buddy to prevent him from making a mistake and i shant allow you to make this one hmm will you keep me from makin other mistakes i will if i can mebbe thats enough anyhow ill sleep better tonight for seein you i think i hear ma stirring said gray as he rose i brought her a few little presents and id like to take them up to her as he left the room there was the same queer light in his eyes nevertheless he moved slowly like a man tired chapter xxv gray was shocked at the change in ma briskow she had failed surprisingly pleasure lit her face and she fell into a brief flutter of delight at seeing him but as soon as their first greeting was over he led her to her lounge and insisted upon making her comfortable he had tricks with cushions and pillows so he declared they became his obedient servants and there was a knack in arranging them the same knack that a robin uses in building its nest this he demonstrated quite conclusively it was nice to have a great masterful man like this take charge of one and ma sighed gratefully as she lay back it does kinda feel like a birds nest she declared and you kinda look like a robin too youre allus dressed so neat exactly he chuckled robins are the very neatest dressers of all the birds but look like a real robin ive brought spring with me he opened a huge box of longstemmed roses and held their cool dewy buds against ma briskows withered face then laughing and chatting he arranged them in vases where she could see them next he drew down the shades shutting out the dreary afternoon after which he lit the gas log and soon the room whether by reason of his glowing personality or his deft rearrangement of its contents or both became a warm and cheerful place he had brought other gifts than flowers too thoughtful expensive things that fairly took mas breath no one had ever given her presents to be remembered therefore with useless delightful little luxuries filled her gentle soul with a guilty rapture but these were not gifts in the ordinary sense they were offerings from the duke of dallas and his manner of presenting them invested every article with ducal dignity the princess pensacola had not played for a long time and so to recline languidly in a beautiful japanese kimono with her feet in a pair of wonderful soft boudoir slippers spun by the dukes private silkworms and knit by his own oriental knitting slaves while he paid court to her was doubly thrilling the duke certainly was a reckless spender but thank goodness he hadnt bought things for the house things just to look at and to share with other people he knew enough to buy intimate things things a woman could wear and feel rich in ma hugged herself and tried to look beautiful gray was seated on the side of her couch with her cold hand between his warm palms and he was telling her about the princess of wichita falls when the summons to dinner interrupted them ma was not hungry and she had expected to have a bite in her own room but her caller was so vigorous in his objections to this plan that she finally agreed to come downstairs the briskow household was poorly organized as yet and it was only natural that it should function imperfectly nevertheless gray was annoyed at the clumsy manner in which the dinner was served being a meticulous man and accustomed to comfort incompetent servants distressed him beyond measure and he soon discovered that the briskow help was as completely incompetent as any he had ever seen the butler for instance a pleasantfaced colored man had evidently come straight from the docks for he passed the food much as a stoker passes coal to a boiler while the sound of a crashing platter in the butlers pantry gave evidence that the second girl was a house wrecker see here ma gray threw down his napkin you have a beautiful home and you want it to be perfect dont you why of course we bought everything we could buy everything except skillful servants and they are hard to find you are capable of training your cook and teaching your upstairs girl to sweep and make beds but the test of a wellrun house is a wellserved meal dishbreaking ought to be a felony and when i become president i propose to make the spoiling of food a capital offense now then youre not eating a bite anyhow and gus wont mind waiting awhile for his dinner with your permission id like to take things in hand and add a hundred per cent to your future comfort in some bewilderment ma agreed that she would do anything her guest suggested whereupon he rose energetically and called the three domestics into the dining room we are going to start this dinner all over again he announced and we are going to begin by swapping places i am going to serve it as a dinner should be served and you are going to eat it as well i dare say nature will have to take its course i shall explain as i go along and i want you to remember every word i say every move i make mr and mrs briskow are going to look on after we have finished you are going to serve us exactly as i served you naturally this proposition amazed the help in fact its absurdity convulsed them the man laughed loudly the cook buried her ebony face in her apron the second girl bent double with mirth here was a quaint gentleman indeed and a great joker but the gentleman was not joking on the contrary he brought this levity to an abrupt end then gravely ceremoniously he seated the trio they sobered quickly enough at this they became in fact as funereal as three crows but their astonishment at what followed was no greater than that of the briskows gray played butler with a correctness and a poise deeply impressive to his roundeyed audience and as he served the courses he delivered a lecture upon the etiquette of domestic service the art of cooking and the various niceties of a servants calling nothing could have been more impressive than being waited upon by a person of his magnificence and his lecture moreover was delivered in a way that drove understanding into their thick heads it was an uncomfortable experience for all except gray himself he actually enjoyed it and when the last dish had been removed and he had given instructions to serve the meal over again exactly as he had served it the three negroes were glad to obey of course they made mistakes but these gray instantly corrected and the results of his dress rehearsal were on the whole surprising there he said when the ordeal had finally come to an end a little patience a little practice and youll be proud of them incidentally i have saved you a fortune in dishes i wish allied been here shed remember everything you said ma declared lord think of mr gray waitin on them niggers gus was still deeply shocked you see what a meddlesome busybody i am the guest laughed i dont know how to mind my own business and the one luxury i enjoy most of all is regulating other peoples affairs he was still talking still lecturing his hearers upon the obligations prosperity had put upon them when he was summoned to the telephone by a longdistance call he returned in some agitation to announce well at last i have business of my own to attend was that buddy talkin it was and he gave me some good news he says that well on thirtyfive is liable to come in at any minute and it looks like a big one the speakers eyes were glowing and he ran on breathlessly he says theyre betting it will do better than ten thousand barrels ten thousand barls briskow echoed thats what he said of course they cant tell a thing about it buddys only guessing but i havent had a big well yet gray took a nervous turn about the room ten thousand barrels lord that would help that would do the trick and to think that it should come now this very day he laughed triumphantly and ran on as if talking to himself the wicked are fatted for destruction their happiness shall pass away like a torrent pull out and leave me eh a second time he laughed more loudly luck it isnt luck its destiny the mills of the gods are grinding ma briskow the fairy ladies danced upon the hearth when i was born do you know what that means ten thousand barls a day an you buttlin for three niggers gasped the head of the house im going out on tonights train and see it come in if it does come in i told buddy to stop work not to drop another tool until i arrived fatted for destruction i like the sound of that ten thousand barrels ho ill write this day in brass why that lease will sell for a million it it may mean the end gray brought himself to with an effort hastily he kissed ma briskows faded cheek and wrung her husbands hand a moment later he was gone thirtyfive where buddy was working was only a few miles from the briskow ranch therefore the boy was able to meet his sister at ranger and drive her directly to the old home the place was much the same as when they had left it thanks to the watchful attention of the men in charge of the briskow wells and there they spent the night buddy and his sister had always been close confidants and their long separation their varied experiences left many things to be discussed the ranch house seemed very mean very insignificant to allie but she slipped into one of her old dresses and prepared the supper while buddy straddled a kitchen chair and chattered upon ten thousand topics of mutual interest doggone he exclaimed finally i hardly knew you when you stepped off that train but it seems like old times now with you hustlin around in that gingham i wish it was hunh i wish sometimes that wed never struck oil good lord why oh allie turned her back and bent over the stove for lots of reasons ma never had a sick day till lately now shes failin fast buddy frowned at this intelligence and pas as restless as a squirrel all the time scared of losing his money well you got no kick coming sis youve sure made good how i dunno youve got rich ways an rich looks too allie lifted an interested face and her brother undertook somewhat awkwardly to tell her wherein she had improved she listened with greedy delight but when he had finished she shook her head skeptically and declared it sounds nice and god knows ive tried hard enough buttheres a difference bud were trash and always will be of course young briskows mind was full of business and he could not long stay off that absorbing topic when during their supper he announced the fact that the well on thirtyfive showed signs of coming in shortly and that he intended to send for calvin gray allie changed her mind about returning home and decided to wait over until the latter arrived she and buddy talked until a late hour that night but although she was dying to have him tell her about his romance his dream of love he never so much as referred to it and she could not bring herself to disregard his reticence nor could she bear to discuss with him the problem that lay nearest her own heart she had brooded long over that problem and her soul was hungry to share its bitter secret nevertheless she could not do so for it is often easier to bare our wounds to strangers than to those we love if her breedings her bitterness of spirit manifested themselves it was in a fixed undertone of pessimism and in an occasional outburst of recklessness that bewildered her brother on the morning of grays coming she rode with buddy over to thirtyfive it was a wretched rainy day and nothing is more bleak than a rainy day in a drilling camp work had been halted and the men were loafing in their bunk house brother and sister spent the impatient hours in the mess tent as usual they talked a good deal about calvin gray funny him comin here a stranger an gettin to run our whole family aint it buddy said allie nodded funnier thing than that is your working for him buddy was surprised so she asked him arent you sore at him for what he did for breaking up that affair it was a question that had been upon her lips more than once she could not credit her brother with entire sincerity when he answered frankly enough sore not the least bit didnt you care for her why sure i was all tore up at first but he did me the biggest kind of a favor allie shook her head uncomprehendingly men are queer things you must have loved her for a while i reckon i did if youre a mind to call it that but he says that sort of thing aint real love he says the girl cried scornfully my god buddy would you let him tell you is he pickin out women for you like he picks out a dress for me and a hotel for ma how does he know whats the real thing she was a grafter the brother explained with a flush of embarrassment shed of probably took my money an quit me cold bah the girl rose and with somber defiance in her smoldering eyes stared out at the desolate day youd have had her for a while wouldnt you youd have lived while it lasted whats the difference if she was a grafter dyou think youre going to fall in love and marry a duchess or something i wish id had your chance thats all what dyou mean by that buddy queried sharply i mean this allie flamed at him were nobodies and weve got nothing but our money a counterfeit is as good as ever well get and its as good as were entitled to id rather know what it is to live for an hour than to go on forever just pretending to live if ive got to be unhappy then give me something to be unhappy over something to look back on id rather be but pshaw you dont understand you couldnt i dunno whats got into you lately buddy declared with a frown nothings got into me only whats the use of starving when the worlds full of good things and youve got the price to buy them i wont do it if ever i get my chance you watch me grays trip from the railroad was more like a voyage than a motor journey for the creek beds usually dry were angry torrents and the dobe flats were quagmires through which his vehicle plowed hub deep nevertheless he was fresh and alert when he arrived after a buoyant greeting to allie he and buddy inspected the well then he issued orders for work to be resumed were gettin close to something young briskow declared shes making gas an rumblin like shed let go any minute we got reservoys built an the boilers moved back so we can douse the fire when she starts i figger shell drownd us out what are the indications at nelsons well gray turned his eyes in the direction of a derrick on the adjoining property the top of which showed over the mesquite nothin extra they wont tell us anything but theyre deeper n we are how do you know buddy winked wisely we counted the layers of cable on the bullwheel drum checked up their casing too an watched their cuttins they got their eye on us too an theyll be over when we blow in that was an anxious afternoon for as the drill bit deeper into the rock it provoked indications of a terrific force imprisoned far below to the observers it seemed as if that sharpedged tool was taptapping upon the thin shell of some vast reservoir already leaking and charged to the bursting point with a mighty pressure an odor of gas escaped from the casing mouth occasionally there came hoarse throaty gurglings of the thick liquid at the bottom of the well the bailer was run frequently word had gone forth that there was something doing on thirtyfive and from the chaparral emerged muddy motor cars bringing scouts neighboring lease owners and even the members of a nearby casing crew supper was a jumpy meal and nobody had much to say allie briskow least of all she was silent intense she curtly refused buddys offer to send her home and when the meal was over she followed gray back to the derrick he was on edge of course it seemed to him that every blow of that bit was struck upon his naked nerves for he had a deep conviction that this was to prove the night of his life and the strain of waiting was becoming onerous this well meant so much ten thousand barrels fifteen five even one thousand it mattered little how heavy the flow for a goodpaying well would see him through his immediate troubles and this was a well of some sort or else indications meant nothing and everybody was greatly mistaken of course a big well something to create a furor that was what he needed for that not only would bridge his financial crisis but also it would mean a frenzy of quick drilling new wells crowded close together hundreds of thousands of dollars poured into the earth and the nelsons couldnt stand that it would break them break them and he would taste the full sweetness of revenge oh he had waited long nor was that all once he had henry nelson down and his foot on the fellows throat hed have something to say to barbara parker he could say it then and look her in the eyes he wished she was here tonight while he stood on the top of the world ten thousand barrels twenty thousand twentythousandbarrel gushers were not unknown a well like that would mean a fortune every day but why didnt it start they were bailing again and curiosity drew the owner in upon the derrick floor this time the flow might begin at any moment now oil might come with the water there is some danger in standing close to a well during this bailing process but gray was like a bit of iron in the field of a magnet spellbound he watched the cable as it ran smoothly off the drum flowed up over the crown block and down into the casing mouth that heavy torpedolike weight on the end of the line was dropping almost half a mile up it came swiftly as if greased up up until it emerged into the glare of the incandescent overhead and hung there dripping it was swung aside and lowered and out gushed its muddy contents water black and thick as molasses but water nevertheless buddy briskow was running the rig and the dexterity with which he handled brake and control rod gave him pride he had seated his sister on a bench out of the way where she was protected from the drizzle and he felt her eyes upon him it gave him a sense of importance to have allie watching him at such a crisis he wished his parents were with her if this well blew in big as it seemed bound to do it would be a personal triumph for not many cub drillers could boast of bringing in a gusher the first time it was in fact no mean accomplishment to make any sort of a well to pierce the earth with an absolutely vertical shaft a half mile deep and line it with tons upon tons of heavy casing joined airtight and fitted to a hairs breadth was an engineering feat in itself it was something that only an oil man could appreciate and he was an oil man a darn good one too so buddy told himself he eased the brake and the massive bailer slid into the casing as a heavy shell slips into the breech of a cannon as he further released his pressure the cable began to pour serpentlike from the drum buddy turned his wet grimy face and flashed a grin at allie she smiled back at him faintly some lightninglike change in her expression or perhaps some occult sense of the untoward warned him that all was not as it should be and he jerked his head back to attention there are moments of catastrophe when for a brief interval nature slows time stops and we are carried in suspense such an instant buddy briskow experienced now he knew at first glance what had happened and a frightened cry burst from his throat but it was a cry too short too hoarse to serve as a warning during that moment of inattention the bailer had stuck perhaps five hundred feet below friction had checked its plunge and meanwhile the velvetrunning drum spinning at its maximum velocity by reason of the whirling bull wheel was unreeling its cable down upon the derrick platform down it poured in giant loops and within those coils either unconscious of his danger or paralyzed by its suddenness stood calvin gray men schooled in hazardous enterprises carry subconscious mental photographs of the perils with which their callings are invested and they react involuntarily to them buddy had heard of drillers decapitated by flying cables of human bodies caught within those wire loops and cut in twain as if made of lard for when a wedged tool resumes its downward plunge it straightens those coils above ground in the twinkling of an eye instinct rather than reason warned buddy not to check the blinding revolutions of the bull wheel without thought he leaped forward into the midst of those swiftly forming loops and as he landed upon the slippery floor he clenched his fist and struck with all the power he could put behind his massive arm grays back was to him the blow was like that of a walking beam and it sent the elder man flying as a tenpin is hurled ahead of a bowling ball buddy fell too he went sprawling as he slid across the muddy floor he felt the steel cable writhing under him like a thing alive and the touch of it as it streamed into the well burned his flesh he kicked and fought it as he would have fought the closing folds of a python for the bailer was falling again and the wire loops were vanishing as the coils in a whiplash vanish during its flight buddys booted legs were thrown high he was tossed aside like a thing of paper but blind half stunned he scrambled back to his post by this time the whole structure of the derrick was rocking to the mad gyrations of the bull wheel the giant spool was spinning with a speed that threatened to send it flying like the fragments of a bursting bomb but the youth understood dimly the danger of stopping it too suddenly to fetch up that plunging weight at the cable end might snap the line collapse the derrick jim the well buddy weaved dizzily in his tracks nevertheless his hand was steady and he applied a gradually increasing pressure to the brake nor did he take his eyes from his task until the drum had ceased revolving and the runaway bailer hung motionless in the well when he finally looked about it seemed to him that he had lived a long time and was very old gray lay motionless where he had fallen and his body was twisted into a shockingly unnatural posture he was bleeding allie briskow was bending over him other dim dreamlike figures were swarming out of the gloom and into the radiance of the derrick lights there was a faraway clamor of shouting voices buddy briskow felt himself growing deathly sick they carried gray to the bunk house and his limbs hung loosely his head lolled in a manner terrifying to buddy and his sister as they stumbled along beside the group the girl cried oh my god oh my god she repeated the cry over and over again in a voice strange to her brothers ears it it wasnt my fault he told her hoarsely i aimed to save him you killed him he aint buddy choked and clung to her hes just stunned like he aint that the youth was amazed when allie turned and cursed him with oaths that he himself seldom ventured to employ but gray was not dead buddys blow had wellnigh broken his neck and he had suffered a further injury to his head in falling nevertheless he responded to such medical aid as they could supply and in time he opened his eyes his gaze was dull however and for a long while he lay in a sort of coma quite as alarming as his former condition they brought him to at last long enough to acquaint him with what had happened and although it was plain that he understood their words only dimly he ordered the work resumed when for a second time he lapsed into semiconsciousness it was allie briskow who put his orders into execution you aint doing any good standing around staring at him and whispering bring in that well as fast as ever you can and bring it in big now get out and leave him to me buddy was the last to go he inquired miserably honest he aint hurt bad is he you dont think get out he wont die aint no chance of him doin that is there if he does ill the speakers face was ashen but her eyes blazed ill fix you buddy briskow i will so help me god it was late that night when the well came in it came with a rush and a roar drenching the derrick with a geyser of muddy water and driving both crew and spectators out into the gloom up up the column rose spraying itself into mist and from its iron throat issued a sound unlike that of any other phenomenon it was a hoarse rumbling bellow growing in volume and rising in pitch second by second until it finally attained a shrieking crescendo ten thousand safety valves had let go and they steadily gathered strength and shrillness as they functioned a shocking sound it became a sound that carried for miles rocking the air and stunning the senses it beat upon the eardrums pierced them men shouted at each other but heard their own voices only faintly calvin gray had recovered his senses sufficiently to understand the meaning of that uproar and he tried to get up but allie held him down upon his bed she was still struggling with him when her brother burst into the house shouting its a gasser mr gray biggest i ever seen gas the latter mumbled indistinctly isnt there any oil his words were almost like a whisper because of the noise not yet may be later say shes a heller aint she ill bet shes makin twenty million feet gassers no good cant tell yet we gotta shut her down easy so she dont blow the casing out run wild on us understand buddy was still breathless but he plunged out the door and back into that sea of sound with a tragic intensity akin to wildness gray stared up into allie briskows face worthless eh and they told me ten thousand barrels he carried a shaking hand to his bandaged head and tried vainly to collect his wits whats matter he queried thickly everything whirling sick you had an accident but its all right all right no no please lie still running wild eh thas what hurts my head so blown the casing out bad isnt it sometimes they run wild for weeks years ruin everything he tried again to rise then insisted querulously goto get oil in this well ive got to last chance allie got to get ten thousand barrels please you mustnt allie had her strong hands upon his shoulders she was arguing firmly but as gently as possible under the circumstances when something occurred so extraordinary so unexpected as to paralyze her of a sudden the interior of the dimlit canvasroofed shack was illuminated as if by a searchlight and she turned her head to see that the whole outofdoors was visible and that the night itself had turned into day with a cry that died weakly amid the chaos of sound beating over her the girl ran to the window and looked out what she beheld was a nightmare scene the well was afire it had exploded into flame where a moment before it had been belching skyward an enormous stream of gaseous vapor all but invisible except at the casing head now it was a monstrous blow torch the flaming crest of which was tossed a hundred feet high nothing in the nature of a conflagration could have been more aweinspiring more confounding to the faculties than that roaring column of consuming fire it was a thing incredibly huge incredibly furious incredibly wild human figures black against its glare were flying to safety nearby silhouettes were flinging their arms aloft and dashing backward and forward faces upturned to it were white and terrified the scattered mesquite stood against the night like a wall spotted with inky shadows and above the heavens resembled a boiling caldron it was a hellish picture it remained indelibly fixed upon allie briskows mind as she looked on in horrid fascination she saw the derrick change into a latticelike tower of flame saw its upper part begin slowly to crumble and disintegrate the force with which the gas issued blew the blaze high and held it dancing tumbling in midair a phenomenon indescribably weird and impressive the men who stood nearest bent their heads and shielded their faces from the heat allie tore her eyes away from the spectacle finally she turned back to the bed then she halted for it was empty the door still ajar from buddys headlong exit informed her whence her patient had gone and she flew after him she found him not half a dozen paces away in fact she stumbled over his prostrate body with an amazons strength she gathered him into her arms then staggered with him back to his couch and as she strained him to herself she loudly called his name amid that demoniac din amid the shrieking of those million devils freed from the black chasms of the rock her voice was as feeble as the wail of a sick child when she had laid her inert burden upon the bed allie knelt and took grays head upon her bosom then for the first time those forces imprisoned deep within her being ran wild and under the red glare of that flaming geyser she kissed his hair his eyes his lips over and over again she kissed them with the hungry passion of a woman starved chapter xxvi a subdued but continuous whispering irritated calvin gray when it persisted minute after minute he opened his eyes asking himself dully why it was that people couldnt let a fellow sleep he lay for some time trying to recognize his unfamiliar surroundings oddly enough he could not discover the origin of that lowpitched murmur since there was nobody in his bedroom evidently he had slept too hard for his eyes were heavy his vision was distorted and an unaccustomed lassitude bore down his body and stupefied his brain a thousand indistinct memories were moving about in the penumbral borderland of consciousness but they refused to take shape they would emerge into the light presently of course meanwhile it was restful to remain in this state of semistupefaction he was pretty tired that whispering he realized after a while was nothing more than the monotonous murmur of rain upon a shingle roof and the gurgle from dripping eaves oh yes it had been pouring for several days raining buckets barrels ten thousand barrels a day yonder was something familiar a patent spring rockingchair gray knew it well it creaked miserably when you sat in it and when you got up to look at diamond rings it snapped its jaws at you like an alligator odd that theyd let an alligator into the ajax hotel nelsons doings probably always up to some deviltry that nelson but thank god the fire was out and that earsplitting racket that hurt his head had changed into the soothing patter of raindrops there couldnt be any fire with ten thousand barrels of rain falling gray closed his eyes and dozed briefly but he had dreams calamity haunted him he awoke to the realization of some horror slowly his brain began to function then more swiftly until like a flood released memory returned he groaned aloud allegheny briskow appeared out of nowhere and laid a soothing hand upon his brow when she saw the light of sanity in his eyes her face brightened and she cried eagerly youre coming around all right arent you ten thousand barrels he mumbled they said it would be a big well and i counted on it dont try to think but it came in a gasser i remember it all now nearly all i im about ruined i guess no no it caught fire you mustnt talk everything is all right all right honestly ill tell you everything but just you rest now until buddy comes there was magnetism to the girls touch and comfort in her voice it was some time later that gray opened his eyes and spoke in a more natural voice saying how do i happen to be here in your house allie we brought you over at daylight buddys gone for a doctor but hell be back the girl averted her face quickly and moved toward the window i remember being hurt in some way derrick fell on me or something then the well caught fire what time is it its afternoon about four oclock buddy ll be back allies voice caught queerly hell get back somehow he ought to be at the well putting it out god what a sight i see it yet the well is out allie returned and seated herself beside the bed you probably wont understand it or believe it i can scarcely believe it myself for its a miracle all the same it is out shut in and not much damage done youre not ruined either for buddy says theyre short of fuel here and a gasser this size is worth a good deal most as much as a fair oil well how can it be shut in it was blazing roaring a tower of flame the derrick itself was going i know but the strangest thing allie spoke breathlessly let me do the talking please you remember the drill stems were standing over in one corner well the fire drove everybody off of course there was no facing it and they thought sure theyd have a job have to send for boilers and smother it down with steam maybe or tunnel under or something work for days maybe weeks and spend a fortune anyhow they were in a panic but when the derrick went down what do you think that stack of drill stems fell in such a way as to close the gate valve at the top of the casing gray frowned he shook his head impossible youre trying to ease my mind of course its impossible but it happened just as i tell you buddy had a bar fixed in the valve wheel like a long handle so that a half turn or maybe a quarter would shut it anyhow those drill stems caught that bar in falling and closed the valve somebody said it happened once before to an oil well over in louisiana it sounds incredible the speaker made an effort to collect himself he raised an uncertain hand to his bandaged head what ails me i recall a lot of things but theyre pretty well confused allie made known the nature of the accident resulting in grays injury and he nodded his understanding so buddy saved my life he smiled great boy buddy ill know better than to mix it with him again he learns too quickly oh it was terrible ive been so so frightened allie briskow suddenly lost control of herself and bowing her head she hid her face in the musty patchwork quilt her shoulders shook her whole strong body twitched and trembled youve bbeen awful sick i did the best i could but there there gray placed his hand upon the girls head he took her palm in his and stroked it im not worth your tears child and anyhow im all right again i am indeed im as well as ever so far as i can tell by the way what set the well afire buddy thinks somebody must have dropped a cigarette when the stampede came the girl raised her face and wiped the tears from it it doesnt seem possible anybody would be so careless as to smoke near a well that was coming in but just think mr gray those drill stems shut it off why it was the hand of god it seems so my luck hasnt run out thats plain the speaker pondered briefly then he said shut in safe jove its wonderful buddy can take me to the railroad tonight and oh you cant leave youre not able i must this gasser was a great disappointment to me i allowed myself to count on a big well and now i have a serious problem to meet it must be met without delay buddy will soon be back i dare say allie undertook to evade the speakers eye but unsuccessfully and he inquired sharply whats wrong whats happened to him nothing hes all right but grays evident alarm demanded the truth therefore she explained but i dont know when hell be back thats why ive been so frightened it has been raining cats and dogs the creek has overflowed and everything is under water under water here why that cant be gray insisted upon rising and allie finally consented to his doing so then despite his protest that ha was quite able to take care of himself she helped him to the window from that position he beheld a surprising scene the briskow farm lay in a flat saucerlike valley arid and dusty at most seasons of the year but now a shallow lake the surface of which was broken by occasional fences misty clumps of bushes or the tops of dead weeds the nearest briskow derrick was dimly visible its floor awash its shape suggestive of the battle mast of a sunken manofwar its not more than a foot or two deep on the level allie explained but thats enough and it has come up six inches since buddy left hed have been back before this if he could have made it did you ever see it like this before once when i was a little girl some years the creek never has a drop in it then were marooned we were cut off for three days that time gray frowned what next he asked himself here was a calamity that could not be dodged he shrugged finally no use to fret no use to crouch beneath a load id give my right arm to be back in dallas but this is our chance to cultivate the christian virtue of submission so be it one must have a heart for every fate but he smiled at the girl it is hard to be philosophical when youre hungry and im hungry oh you are better im well i tell you except for the bruises bequeathed me by your brutal brother three days a week maybe my god by the way is there any food in the house plenty then weve nothing to do except get better acquainted and that is something ive wanted to do for some time allegheny briskow sang while she prepared supper for the reaction from the strain of the last twelve hours was like an intoxication mr gray was in no further danger he was well except for a bandaged head and some bruises and he was here alone with her they were as completely cut off from the outside world as if shipwrecked on some island and for the time being at least he was hers to look out for hers to wait upon and to guard allie laughed at the drumming of the rain upon the kitchen roof and she thrilled at memory of some of the things she had done she could feel again grays head upon her bosom his lips against hers his body strained to hers she had listened to his heartbeats with her own abundant strength she had shielded him fought for him drawn him by very force of her will back to life the anguish she had suffered during those long hours became in retrospect a poignant pleasure she wondered if by any chance he would remember there had been times when he had seemed to be almost rational she hoped not and yet why not if he did remember if indeed he had felt her kisses or heard her pleadings that memory even if subconscious might serve to awaken him it might evoke some response to the flaming passion that had finally escaped her control gray was a strong man his emotions once roused were probably as wild as hers therefore who could tell what might happen irresistible forces fire and flood had thrown them together they were at the mercy of elemental powers and they were alone with each other a man and a woman allie hoped against hope she prayed recklessly defiantly that her hour had struck gray came into the kitchen after a while to warm himself over the stove he was still a little bit unsteady on his feet and his head felt queer but he assumed a certain gayety and insisted upon bearing an awkward hand with the cooking and the dishes he had never seen allie as she was now nor in a mood to compare with this and for the first time he realized how fully she had developed it was not surprising that her metamorphosis had escaped his attention for he had never taken time to do more than briefly appraise her with leisure for observation however he noted that she had made good her promise of rare physical charm and that her comeliness had ripened into real beauty beauty built on an overwhelming scale to be sure and hence doubly striking moreover he saw that all traces of her stolidity had vanished she was an intelligent wideawake vibrant person and at this moment a genial fire a breathless excitement was ablaze within her gray complimented her frankly and she was extravagantly pleased buddy said almost the same thing she told him i dont care whether its true or not if you believe it oh its true i saw great things in you but even when you saw me hoeing in the garden that first day even then but i wasnt prepared for a miracle you were an enchanted princess and it required only a magic word to break the spell it is all your doings mr gray whatever i am i owe it all to you and its the same with the rest of the family i allie hesitated looked up from her work then shook her head smilingly what i feel as if well as if youd made me and i belonged to you it was dusk by this time the girls face was lit only by the indirect glow from the open door of the stove therefore gray could make nothing of her expression how very flattering he laughed as a real matter of fact i had almost nothing to do with it all the same thats how i feel as if i owed you everything and had to give something back women are queer i guess they love to give and yet theyre selfish more selfish than men i wouldnt say so you dont know how bad hurt you were mr gray i saved your life as much as buddy did youd have died only for only i wouldnt let you i believe it so you see you have more than evened the score after all i merely awakened the sleeping beauty while you the prince woke her up with a kiss didnt he allie said with a smile so the story goes fairy stories by the way are the only kind one can afford to believe then ive got something coming to me havent i this time the girl turned her face invitingly to the speaker and waited here was a new allie briskow indeed and one that amazed nay disturbed gray romance he told himself the girl meant nothing by this nevertheless her fancy had run far enough he ignored her invitation and instead of kissing her he patted her shoulder affectionately saying youre a dear child and i can never repay you for mending my poor cracked head he turned his back went to the table and lit the lamp uncomfortably aware of the fact meanwhile that allie remained motionless where he had left her he ran on casually during the time he adjusted chimney and wick i was on the porch just now and found a rabbit crouching there the poor thing was too wet and frightened to move allie did not seem to hear him all sorts of things are floating about dead chickens rattlesnakes and oh yes another thing i noticed theres a good deal of oil on the water i wonder where it comes from allie stirred herself she jerked open the oven door peered in then slammed it shut her voice was sullen as she said theyve been expecting a gusher on sixteen maybe the reservoirs have overflowed or a pipe line has broken maybe it came in wild you cant tell this flood will cost a good many people a lot supper when the two sat down to it proved to be a pleasant meal for the soft glow of the lamp the warmth from the stove made of the briskow kitchen a cozy place while the drumming of the rain overhead enhanced their feeling of comfort and security grays appetite was not that of a sick man and allie who had regained her agreeable humor by this time waited upon him with eager face and shining eyes he paused finally to say see here youre not eating a bite im not hungry i couldnt eat tonight please im perfectly happy i feel like a slave at the great lords table all i care to do is look on after a moment she continued it couldnt have been so bad to be a slave a girl slave somebody owned them anyhow they belonged to their masters body and soul and thats something women are like that theyve got to belong to somebody to be happy gray was a talkative man therefore he argued this point until he began to suspect that his companion was not heeding his words so much as the sound of his voice more plainly than before he realized that there was something about allie tonight utterly strange and quite contrary to his conception of her but because he believed her to be unlike other women he did not try to understand it during the night an explosive crash followed by a loud reverberation awoke calvin gray and brought him up sitting his room was lit by white flickers against which he saw that the rain still sheeted his windows he fumbled for his watch and found that it was two oclock this was a storm indeed and he began to fear that this deluge might swell the waters to a danger point therefore he rose struck a light and dressed himself sleep was out of the question anyhow amid such an uproar as he stepped out upon the front porch his attention was instantly drawn to a yellow glow in the west a distant torch the flame of which illuminated the angry night he stared at it for a moment before he realized its meaning a well was afire lightning had wrecked a derrick and ignited the stream of oil no wonder he told himself for this field was dotted with towers well calculated to lead lightning out of the skies and amid a play of destructive forces such as this nothing less than a miracle could have prevented something of the sort but it was a pity for yonder a smallsized fortune was going up in smoke by the next flare he saw that the waters had crept higher they were nearly up to the porch floor now and obviously they were still rising that rabbit was crouched where he had last seen it a wet ball of fur with round black eyes the heavens echoed almost constantly now to a thick distant rumble again to an appalling din directly overhead for seconds at a time there was light enough to read by the house gray decided was in no danger except from a direct bolt for the valley was nothing more than a shallow lake nevertheless a blinding bluewhite streak came and he counted the seconds before the sound reached him sound traveled something like a thousand feet a second he reflected that bolt must have struck about a mile distant nothing alarming about that surely a moment then he blinked and rubbed his eyes for out of the murk was born another bonfire like that to the westward hearing an exclamation behind him gray turned to behold allie briskows dim figure in the door hello he cried excitedly did you see that yonder are two wells afire i know i havent closed my eyes you can see another one from my window allia snapped the light from a pocket flash upon gray and noting that he was only partly clad she urged him to come into the house when he ignored the request she joined him and together they stared at the mounting flames jove thats terrible he muttered look here allie directed the beam of her light down over the edge of the porch and moved it slowly from side to side the surface of the water was not only burdened with debris but also it was thick with oil its just like that on the other side that gusher on sixteen must be wild why didnt you call me the man inquired sharply what was the use theres no chance for us to get out how far is it back to high ground quite a ways too far to wade it would be over our heads in places too i dont like the look of it do you not with those fires going and i dare say it wont get any worse gray spoke with a carelessness that he was far from feeling but his tone did not deceive the girl it doesnt have to get any worse she declared im patiently theres oil enough here to burn were in the middle of a lake of it what ll happen if it catches fire frankly i dont know ive never been marooned in a lake of oil probably this rain would quench it you know better than that allie cried dont act as if i were a kid were in a bad fix with fire on three sides of us at least well be as well off inside as out here gray declared and his companion agreed so together they went into her room where side by side they peered through her window what allie had said was true and the man pinched himself to see if he were dreaming this conflagration was even closer than the others and he could not doubt that there was every likelihood of its spreading to the surface of the lake itself here was a situation truly for the life of him he could think of no way out of it ive read about this sort of thing allie was saying tanks bursting and rivers afire it spreads all over the fire does and theres no putting it out one thing sure this lightning wont last long a blue glare and a ripping explosion gave the lie to grays cheering words allie briskow recoiled from the window well be burned alive she gasped roasted like rats in a trap i im frightened mr gray she drew closer to him no need of that well get out of this scrape somehow people always do a flicker lit the room and he saw that the face upturned to his was wide eyed strained that brief glimpse of allie like a picture seen through the shutter of a camera remained long with the man for her hair was unbound her lips were parted and her dark eyes were peculiarly brilliant through the opening of her lacy negligee her round white neck and swelling bosom were exposed it was a head a bust to be remembered i you got to hold me she said huskily and he felt her body shrink close to his she clung tightly to him trembling at first then shaking in every limb fright it seemed had suddenly mastered allie briskow gray endeavored for a moment to soothe her then gently to loosen her hold he spoke to her as he would have spoken to a terrified child but the wildness of her emotion matched the wildness of the night and her strength was nearly equal to his knowing her as he did this abysmal terror was inexplicable such abandon was entirely out of keeping with her but she had acted queerly ever since gray was ashamed of the thought that leaped into his mind he hated himself for harboring it he hated himself also for the thrill that coursed through him at contact with this disheveled creature the touch of her flesh disturbed him unbearably roughly he tore her arms from about his neck and put her away from him by main strength he forced her into a chair then snatched a covering of some sort from the bed and folded it around her shoulders his voice was hoarse to him it sounded almost brutal as he said get hold of yourself were in no great danger really now then a light will help us both with clumsy hands he struck a match and lit the lamp lights a great thing drives away foolishness nightmares and fancies of all sorts without looking at her he seized the electric torch and muttered ill take a look around just to see that things are snug back presently gray despised himself thoroughly when the turmoil within him persisted when he still felt the unruly urge to return whence he had come wild horses that was how gus briskow had described his children well allie had followed buddys example and jumped the fence here was something unique in the way of an experience sure enough here were forces at play as savage and as destructive as those that lit the heavens the girl was magnificent maddening and he was running away from her he a man of the world as ruthless as most men of his type it was a phenomenon to awaken sardonic mirth he wondered what had come over him he had changed indeed could it be that he had read a wrong significance into allies actions thus his mind worked when he grew calmer he tried to answer in the affirmative but already he hated himself sufficiently no the night had done it texas cattle stampede on stormy nights they run blindly to destruction the very air was surcharged electric and the girl was untamed only a step removed from the soil the possibility that she could be seriously interested in him strangely enough never presented itself gray laid strong hold of himself but it is not easy to subdue thought and he could feel those strong smooth velvet arms encircling him disorder without and chaos within this house the heavens rumbled like a mighty drumhead the lightning made useless the feeble ray in his hand it was the place the hour of impulse gray swore savagely at himself then he stumbled into his room and dressed himself more fully well there doesnt seem to be much change he said cheerfully as he opened allies door awhile later the fires dont seem to be spreading she was sitting where he had left her she had not moved anything new on this side allie shrugged slowly she turned exposing a face tragic and stony i guess you dont think much of me she said indeed he declared heartily this is enough to frighten anybody i dont mind saying it has upset me but the worst is over he laid a reassuring hand upon her shoulder allie moved her body convulsively lemme be she cried sharply i dont mind the lightning i aint scared of the fire either hell fire or any other kind i aint scared of anything and yet im a dam coward she rose gathered her loose robe more closely about her and made blindly toward the bed she flung herself upon it and buried her face in the pillows just a dam coward she repeated in a muffled wail my god i wish the blaze would come chapter xxvii buddy briskow had difficulty in getting out of the valley on his way for a doctor for never had the roads been like this he drove recklessly where necessary he disregarded fences and pushed across pastures that were hub deep he even burst through occasional thickets in defiance of axle and tire it was a mad journey like the ride in a deathdefying movie serial only by some miraculous power of cohesion did the machine hold together and thus enable him to keep it under way and bring it out to high ground since he had not taken time before leaving to change into dry clothing he was drenched to the skin he was in fact sheeted with mud like the car itself to find a doctor however was a problem buddy tried first one camp then another but without success meanwhile the downpour continued and the creeks rose steadily obliging him to make numerous detours and to follow the ridge roads wherever possible he was aching in every bone and muscle from the pounding he had received his arms were numb his back was broken he drowned his motor finally in fording a roily stream and abandoned the car he came into ranger that afternoon on the back of a truck horse that he had borrowed without the owners consent for a time it seemed that if he got a doctor at all he would have to follow a similar procedure but the briskow name was powerful and buddy talked in big figures so eventually he set out on the return journey this time in a springless freight wagon drawn by the stoutest team in town a medical man was on the seat beside him progress was maddeningly slow incredibly tedious creek beds long dry had become foaming torrents in places even the level roads were belly deep and the horses floundered when one of them fell it required infinite labor and patience to get it upon its feet again it was after midnight when buddy and his miserable companion gained the comparatively easy going of the last ridge that flinty range beyond which lay the briskow farm here they drove in the glare of lightning and under a sky that rumbled almost steadily for a frightful electric storm had broken here it was that they saw what havoc was being wrought they counted several blazing wells ahead of them buddy stopped at a drilling camp where lights showed the occupants to be astir and there he received confirmation of his fears the flats beyond were inundated to a depth rendering travel impossible and although some of the men stationed out there had managed to work their way back others were for the time being hopelessly cut off what was more alarming by far in view of these blazing beacons was the news that a huge gusher on sixteen was wild and pouring its inflammable flood out upon the surface of the water buddy stood in the midst of a spreading puddle from his streaming clothes and through chattering teeth announced my sister and mr gray are out there i gotta get through how you going to get through kid one of the drillers inquired our men had to swim in places i guess i can swim if i try feller can do most anything if he has to how about you doc buddy turned to his traveling companion the latter shook his head positively youre crazy briskow wed probably drown if we didnt wed be burned alive when that loose oil catches fire looks like its bound to catch if this lightning keeps up some one declared listen to that buddy cursed furiously and lurched toward the door it took force to restrain him from going that was indeed a night of terror in the oil fields for destruction was wholesale and to those who were fortunate enough to be in no danger it was scarcely less trying than for the luckless ones out in the flooded area buddy briskow was half demented at one time it seemed certain that the surface oil was aflame near his fathers farm and the pictures he conjured up were unbearable the rain ceased with the passing of the electrical storm but the late hours of the night were thick and the fires continued to burn it seemed as if morning would never come with the first light buddy mounted one of his horses and regardless of admonitions set out in miles he had no great distance to go nevertheless it was midday before he came in sight of his fathers unpainted farmhouse and when he dismounted at the front porch he fell rather than walked through the door he broke down and blubbered weakly when he saw calvin gray up and around and apparently well he collapsed into a chair and huddled there in a wet heap the while he sobbed and laughed hysterically he was considerably ashamed of his show of feeling even after he had been helped into the kitchen and his wet clothes had been stripped from him he could tell little about his trip but hot food and drink brought him around and then indeed his story was one that deeply touched the elder man already the waters had ceased to rise but buddys difficulty in getting through proved the folly of attempting escape for the time being his horse had been forced to swim with him in more than one place in others he had waded waist deep stumbling through thickets hauling the animal after him by main strength there was nothing to do it seemed but await a subsidence of the flood then too the boy was half dead for sleep under the circumstances it was not easy for the elder man to face this delay his affairs were in a precarious condition and more in need of his immediate attention than ever before to be cut off therefore to be lost for several days at this particular time was more than a misfortune it was a catastrophe such vague plans as he had considered he was now forced to abandon he could see ruin ahead one purpose this enforced idleness did serve however it enabled him nay it forced him to evolve a new scheme of relief some minds become paralyzed in moments of panic others function with unexpected clearness and ingenuity and his was such a mind an idea came to him finally which seemed sound the more he thought about it indeed its possibilities galvanized him and he wondered why he had been so long in arriving at it it was spectacular daring it might prove to be impossible of accomplishment nevertheless it was worth trying and he could scarcely wait for buddy briskow to wake up so that he could put it to him late that evening after allie had gone to bed he had a long talk with his young friend during which he told him more about his affairs than he had made known even to roswell the banker buddy listened with the closest attention he drew a deep breath at last and said i knew you was in deep but i thought it was just your way now i know it was nelsons crew that fired our gasser why they might have cost us thousands yes hundreds of thousands if it had been the kind of a gusher we figgered on say the speakers brows drew together in an angry scowl what ails this nelson anyhow tryin to get you shot an firin your wells an everything he once did me a great injury what kind there was a pause id rather not go into that now buddy to repeat what ive been telling you however the situation is this ive gone as far as i can go with the backing i have and i must make a quick turn strike one final blow or give up nelson and i are like two wrestlers floundering on the mat were both tired groggy out of breath whichever one gets the first hold will win for the other lacks strength to break it do you think your father would trust me do you think hed go it blind on my sayso if he wont i will i got money sos allie gray declined this offer with a positive shake of the head it must appeal to him on its merits i wouldnt permit you to go contrary to his judgment judgment whats pas judgment worth he knows its no good an so do we everybodys tryin to do him up but you youre the only one he trusts an the same here theres my bank roll you can shoot the whole piece i dont care if it never comes back tryin to get you killed an spoilin a well on me thank you buddy you make me slow to trust my own judgment i i seem to be developing a conscience but im sure this is the thing to do for you and your father as well as for me people cant stand still they must go forward the briskow fortune must grow or it will crumble i dunno if weve got as much in us as you seem to think the boy said doubtfully look at allie and you too you took hold of this field work and ran it like a man i said youd make a hand and you have the day is coming when people like you who went from poverty to affluence overnight will retrace that journey thats the time when the truly dramatic story of the texas oil boom will be written then will come the real tragedy and you mustnt be caught in it money isnt a servant buddy it is a master and a mighty stern relentless master at that when your first well blew in it didnt mean ease and enjoyment as you thought it meant hard work for the rest of your life if youd talked to me like this when i went off to school the boy said after a moment of consideration mebbe id of made myself swallow some more education even if i had to take it out of a bottle along with the little kids gray smiled you have common sense at least and thats something you cant get in school men wear smooth from contact with one another and it is time you got in touch with something bigger than mere drilling if youre willing ill take you to wichita falls with me willing buddys eyes sparkled guiltily he confessed its been pretty lonesome out here with the scorpions but i wanted to show you i could make good do you drink any more havent touched a drop i dont reckon i ever will either i dont take to the idea of backtrackin to this farm an gettin old in overalls like you say im sort of penurious an i aim to keep what little sense i got a feller as dull as i am cant afford to drink one thing more gray nodded approvingly i want you to promise me that you wont fall in love with the first woman you meet id never be able to lick you again buddy showed his strong white teeth in a broad grin i promise that boy with the bass voice cured me im goin to be a hermit news of the damage wrought by the recent storm was naturally of grave concern to henry nelson but owing to the fact that lines were down about his only source of information during the days immediately following it was the press reports he was reading the dallas papers with interest one morning when his attention was arrested by the name of calvin gray now grays name in print affected the banker almost as disagreeably as did a sight of the man himself therefore it was with intense resentment that he read the article in which it appeared it was a vividly written account of the formers experience during the flood and due no doubt to grays personal touch it read a good deal like fiction the man had a unique turn for publicity a knack for selfadvertising that infuriated nelson to read this anybody would think that he was one of the dominant figures in the oil industry and that his enterprises were immensely successful with a sneer nelson flung the paper aside so that was how it had happened the well had been fired henry believed he could account for that but a miracle had quenched the flame falling drill stems who ever heard of such a thing such luck was uncanny enough to give one the creeps if gray were tied hand and foot and thrown into a river somebody would drag him out with his pockets full of fish and to be marooned for days in the midst of a blazing lake damnation well luck like that was bound to change it had changed the note of assurance in this selfedited story was patently counterfeit or so henry told himself for surely the fellow must know by this time that his race was run probably this was a desperate effort to secure further backing if so it would fail henry believed that he had weakened his enemys support so completely that he would fall of his own weight he considered it in fact about the cleverest move he had ever made to dispose of a block of bank stock in such a way as not only to tide him over his own difficulties but also to make allies of grays associates the very men who had been fighting him those men were through with the scoundrel now and who else could he appeal to once they abandoned him nobody no the ice had been thin at times henry had felt it bending under him but he was safe at last the crossing had been made so much accomplished now that the fellow was down and could no longer fight back it was time to see that barbara parker learned the truth about her gallant suitor the next time tom parker came into the bank henry called him into his private office and had a talk with him old tom listened silently nevertheless it was plain that he was deeply shocked i spose you aint lyin he said coldly when the banker had finished its a matter of record tom he cant deny it why did you hold off so long were not exactly friends he foolishly believes that i had something to do with his disgrace and he has done his best to injure me under the circumstances i couldnt very well say anything i wouldnt speak now except for the fact that bob is interested in him and well im interested in bob shes been interested in him from the first i dont see that the circumstances are much different than they have been tom said sourly put it down to jealousy if you wish henry was impatient and i dont know as bob ever encouraged you to think perhaps not but she is the only woman i ever saw that id make mrs nelson what was it he did conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman is the way the record stands that covers a lot did he welch quit under fire no steal something no woman scrape there was a woman concerned pretty nasty mess tom hes the sort of man to intrigue any foolish woman women cant see far i spose so mr parker rose stiffly but we dont have to worry about bob she aint foolish and her eyesight is good shes got more sense than all three of us men with this noncommittal remark the father limped out but tom was more deeply troubled than he had shown nothing to be said against a man could have weighed more heavily with him than this particular charge to a man of his type dereliction of duty was a crime dishonorable discharge from the army of his country was an appalling indictment implying utter moral turpitude tom had known more than one fellow who was guilty of conduct unbecoming a gentleman as a matter of fact he had reason to respect certain of them for some of their ungentlemanly conduct but conduct unbecoming an officer was something altogether different he had never met but one such and he had shot that fellow just above the bridge of the nose a traitor to his oath of office a man who could dishonor his state his country was worse than a renegade his name was a hissing upon the lips of decent people scalawags like that were not to be tolerated it seemed incredible that gray could be one yes and bob liked the fellow but so did he for that matter in great perturbation of spirit tom consulted judge halloran the judge listened to him in astonishment angrily he cried the idea of his paying court to bob the insufferable insolence of it why i consider it a personal affront where do you come in to get all het up tom growled what hallorans irascible face reddened where do i my god havent i dont i stand in loco parentis to the girl you aint as loco parentis to her as i am shes my son trouble is i like mr gray you dont think henry could be lying he wouldnt dare it is too serious no tom theres just one thing to do you and i will go directly to the scoundrel tell him we are aware of his infamy and order him out of town ha thats the way to go about it cut deep and quickly tar and feathers are too good for trouble is tom repeated with a reluctant sigh i like him and i aint sure the trouble is youre a weakling halloran snapped you are a sentimentalist you lack my stern uncompromising moral fiber like him pah what has that to do with it i have no weakness no bowels of compassion i am a spartan i am youre a damned old fool if you think you can run him hes liable to run you judge halloran was furious at this he was hurt too he sputtered for a moment before managing to say have it your own way you are trying to be unpleasant not that it requires conscious effort but i wont argue with you dont i hate arguments thats why i dont like to talk this over with mr gray when im mad enough to argue im mad enough to fight and i fight better than i argue if indeed calvin grays affairs were in a condition as precarious as nelson believed he showed no signs of it when he returned to wichita falls on the contrary he was in an exultant mood and even on the train young briskow who accompanied him was amazed at the change that had come over his friend with every mile they traveled grays buoyancy increased and upon his arrival he trod the street to his office like a conqueror mcwade and stoner who came in for a conference with minds preoccupied and faces grave left with a smile and a jest when they had gone gray rose with relief and surprised buddy by saying thats enough for now thank goodness business is only one side of life my boy you are going to make this city your home so you must begin by meeting the right people the influential people nicest people in the world right here buddy nicest place in the world too now to a youth who for months had been immured in the oil fields wichita falls did indeed resemble a city of marvelous portent pavements large buildings bright lights theaters buddy was thrilled he prepared himself for introduction to oil operators to men of finance sitting in marble and mahogany offices he made ready to step forth into the big world great was his astonishment therefore when after a swift walk gray turned into a tiny frame insurance office on a side street funny place to look for people of influence buddy cogitated a girl was seated at a desk she rose at sight of gray and her face broke into a smile her greeting was warm her hand lingered in his for the moment neither of them seemed to remember buddys presence when she did hear his name however her face lightened and she gave her hand to him as to an old friend when she smiled at him as she had smiled at his companion buddy dropped his hat he had never seen anyone in the least like this creature and she knew allie she knew his mother that was astonishing he wondered why they had never said anything about it before she had finished telling him about that meeting in the store at dallas buddy realized that here indeed was an influential person a citizen of supreme importance he had missed her name but probably she owned that dallas department store or was the mayor of wichita falls he had never before been so embarrassed mr gray certainly was a wonderful man his poise his air of respectful but easy familiarity with this this angel raised him immensely in buddys esteem think of joking chatting making pretty speeches to an an angel that was going some the gall of it they were talking about that big gasser of grays the fire the overflow and the melodramatic occurrences of the past fortnight gray was telling her how buddy had saved his life at the well how he had risked his own later in braving the flood and she was listening with eager smiles and nods and exclamations when she turned admiring grateful eyes upon the hero of grays story and the story had been told in a manner to make buddy no less that youth felt himself suffocating burning up mr gray sure knew how to talk he could sling language and lie gosh how beautifully he could lie it was splendid of him to exaggerate like this so as to set him in solid with the most important person in town that was noble people were awful nice and this certainly was a grand city buddy knew he was going to get along fine and hed never forget mr gray for this after a while when the two men were on the street again buddy inquired who is that young lady i mean her name gray told him then with a friendly twinkle well speak out what do you think of her oh gee buddy cried breathlessly whereupon his companion laughed in perfect satisfaction chapter xxviii gray returned to his desk that morning after his call on bob parker determined to tackle energetically the numerous business details needing his attention but he found that he could not do so as usual his brief sight of the girl instead of satisfying him had merely increased his hunger made him the more restless the more eager to see her again alone he gave up fighting his desires presently and invented the necessity of a hurried trip to the avenger lease her ready acceptance of the invitation he construed to indicate an eagerness akin to his own and during the several hours they were together he had hard work to keep from breaking his resolve and telling her all she had come to mean to him bob seemed to expect something of the sort as a matter of fact her shyness her fluttering agitation when his voice unconsciously became tender and he realized that in spite of himself the tone of his voice conveyed a message quite at variance with his words taxed his selfcontrol to the utmost well it wouldnt be long now another two weeks perhaps but two weeks is an eternity when hearts are pounding when ears are strained and lips are waiting two callers were awaiting gray when late that afternoon he mounted the stairs to his office tom parker and judge halloran and something in their formal awkward greeting sent a quick chill of alarm through him mechanically he ushered them into his private room and offered them chairs he heard himself chatting casually enough but neither his own words nor theirs conveyed much meaning to him nelson it seemed scorned no advantage however dishonorable grays hatred of the man attained deeper blacker depths than ever today of all days what a reckoning was due the two old men were talking one lamely supplementing the others efforts to lead up to the object of their visit gray turned a set face to tom parker finally and interrupted by saying permit me to ease your embarrassment sir you object to my attentions to your daughter is that it tom dropped his eyes and mumbled an uncomfortable affirmative not i hope because you question the nature of my intentions oh no id say yes and no to that halloran declared argumentatively tom and i are gentlemen of the old school we live by the code and bob is our joint property in a way any man who aspires to the honor of well of even paying attentions to that girl must stand the acid test there must be no blot upon his scutcheon you imply then that there is a blot upon mine that is what prompts our visit sir can you assure us that there is none after a moment of hesitation gray inquired curiously judge do you believe that a man can live down disgrace disgrace yes dishonor never a mans honor is so sensitive that to stain it is to wound it like the human eye it cannot suffer the slightest injury without serious damage the younger man ignored the pompous tone of this speech he nodded i see someone said also that it is like an island rugged and without landing place and once outside of it we can never reenter that is your idea i dare say precisely tom parker stirred irritably he broke out im damned if i think you did it did what tom remained silent but when his companion drew a deep preparatory breath gray lifted a hand he rose nervously and in a changed tone continued again let me speak for you and shorten our mutual distress first however i must make my own position plain i love your daughter mr parker the declaration came at great cost the speaker turned away to hide his emotion i think i hope she is not indifferent to me i would give my life to marry her and god willing i shall so much for that he swung himself about and met the eyes of first one old man then the other harshly defiantly he added understand me nothing you can do nothing on earth nothing in heaven or in hell for that matter will stop me from telling her about my love when the time comes now then henry nelson has told you that i was that i was sent back from overseas in disgrace you want to know if he spoke the truth he did after a moment of silence judge halloran said with stiff finality under the circumstances there is nothing more to talk about you amaze me when you say i want to know more than if he was just telling the truth tom interrupted grimly i want to know if you were guilty that was the verdict of the court martial to hell with that innocent men have been hung a faint smile softened grays face and guilty men have gone to the gallows protesting their innocence which are you to believe i made the best defense possible but it was insufficient i have no new evidence i would rather endure the stigma of guilt than have you consider me a liar and of course that is what you would think if i denied it halloran was on his feet now and evidently anxious to terminate the interview there are two sides to every case of course and justice is not always done however that really makes no difference in this instance the findings of a military tribunal are as conclusive as those of any court of law and it is not for us to question them to repeat what i started to say just now i fail to understand how you can expect us to tolerate your further attentions to miss barbara or how you can persist in your insane determination to ask her hand in marriage perhaps youll understand when i say that i propose to clear myself how when soon i hope and in the meantime gray considered this question briefly in the meantime if you will agree to say nothing to bob i will promise not to declare my feelings not to see her alone thats a go said the father mind you i may fail to right myself in that event i shall feel at liberty to tell her the facts and ask her to believe in me against the world i trust she will do so if she loves me as i love her she will marry me even though she knows i am a liar and a blackguard never halloran exploded bob isnt that sort of a girl i hope it never comes to the test i hope so too the father declared earnestly im right fond of bob and i wouldnt like to see her team up with a man she couldnt be proud of i wouldnt take it easy mild as were these words coming from tom parker they had the ominous effect of a threat without further ado the two old men left there was little sleep that night for calvin gray and the days that followed were a torture it was a torment to avoid bob for selfdenial only whetted his appetite to see her and those cunning plans he had laid at the time of their last meeting plans devised solely to bring them together he had to alter upon one excuse or another he even forced buddy briskow to substitute for him fortunately there were certain negotiations requiring his presence in dallas in tulsa and elsewhere and it some what relieved his irritation to put miles between him and the city he had come to regard as his home the nelsons bank was known as the security national and it represented the life work of two generations of the family bells father had founded it in the early cattle days but to the genius and industry of bell himself had been due its growth into one of the influential institutions of the state other banks had finer quarters but none in this part of the country had a more solid standing nor more powerful names upon its directorate bennett swope for instance was the richest of the big cattle barons martin murphy was known as the arkansas hardwood king and herman gage owned and operated a chain of department stores the other two there were but seven including bell and his son were northern capitalists who took no very active interest in the bank and almost never attended its meetings for that matter the three local men above named concerned themselves little with the actual running of the institution for the nelsons who owned ninetenths of the stock were supreme in that sphere it was only at the annual meetings when directors were reelected and invariably they succeeded themselves that they forgathered to conduct the dull routine business which is a part of all annual meetings after they had adjourned as stockholders they reconvened as directors and again mumbled hurried and perfunctory ayes to the motions put before them so that bell could the more quickly get out his bottle of fine old bourbon the one really ceremonious procedure of the day the security national was as conservative as rock ribbed as respectable and as uninteresting as any bank could well be and its directors were always bored when election time came around in spite of the fact that the program this year was as thoroughly cut and dried as usual the day of the meeting found both father and son decidedly nervous for there were certain questions of management and of policy which they did not wish to touch upon and their nervousness manifested itself in an assumption of friendliness and good fellowship quite unusual senator lowe the banks attorney and secretary was arranging his minute books his reports and his miscellaneous papers martin murphy was telling his latest story when a knock came at the door to the directors room bell himself answered it but his protest at the interruption died upon his lips when he beheld calvin gray gus briskow and the latters son ozark facing him gray spoke sharply and his words fell with the effect of a bomb at least upon bell and henry for what he said was we are attending this meeting as stockholders and we came early to enable the secretary to record the necessary transfer of our shares disregarding the presidents gasp of astonishment the speaker pushed past him and entered then introduced himself and his companions to the other men present henry nelson experienced a sick moment of dizziness the room grew black before his eyes it was bell who broke out harshly stockholders where did you get any stock in this bank id like to know we bought it picked it up here and there i dont believe it bell glared at the speaker then he turned his eyes upon swope upon murphy upon gage did any of you sell out we dont own enough to make it worth while swope said dryly murphy and gage agreed bells peculiar display of emotion surprised them they exchanged glances i thought there wasnt any stock outside of whats owned by our group whats the idea gray answered easily there is now a considerable amount outside of that a very considerable amount henry nelson made himself audible for the first time and sneered angrily quite theatric gray this eleventhhour move how much have you got whats your your object in spite of himself his voice shook my object is purely selfish grays tone was equally unpleasant he had expected to create a sensation and he was not disappointed mr briskow and his son are looking for a secure investment and i have convinced them of the soundness of your institution my operations make it necessary for me to establish a close banking affiliation one where i can ask for and receive consideration his mockery was now unmistakable so where should i turn except to my friends i assume you make no objection to the stock transfer very well he drew from his pocket a bundle of shares and tossed them across the table to senator lowe henry made his way to his fathers side they withdrew to a corner and bent their heads together murmuring inaudibly gray watched them with unblinking intensity he nodded to buddy briskow and the latter as if heeding some prearranged signal removed his hands from his pockets and stepped farther into the room he too watched the agitated pair why look here the secretary gasped after a moment or two this this gives you control bell nelson raised a stricken face control he repeated faintly control he strode to the end of the table and with shaking hands he ran through the sheaf of neatly folded certificates sold out by god he fell to cursing certain men the names of whom caused swope and murphy and gage to prick up their ears gray was still staring at the junior nelson it was to him more than to the father that he spoke sold out is right it came high but i think it was worth the price we intend to vote our stock by that i infer that youre going to take the bank over take its management away from bell and henry bennett swope ventured naturally the elder nelson voiced an unintelligible exclamation thats a pretty rough deal bell has put his life into it it is an an institution a credit to the community it would be a misfortune if it fell into the hands of into the control of somebody who the ranchman hesitated then blurted forth angrily well i dont like the look of this thing i want to know what it means ill tell you henry cried unevenly ill tell you what it means persecution revenge hatred i quarreled with this man in france hes vindictive he followed me here tried every way to ruin me cost me thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars father and i were we were pinched we had to realize some quick money to protect our oil holdings offsets and the like and we sold a lot of our stock with the understanding that we could that we would buy it back at a higher figure we only borrowed on it you might say hypothecated it we thought we were dealing with friends but friends my god the speaker seized his head the stock was not hypothecated you sold it gray said quietly and we bought it in it is all a personal matter a grudge is that true mr gray swope inquired substantially but im waiting for colonel nelson to tell you more to tell you the whole story of our antagonism martin murphy who had been a silent onlooker up to this point made himself heard mr gray i dont like the look of this any better than swope does your quarrel with henry is wholly your and his affair but the welfare of the security national is partly ours banks are not toys to be juggled and played with in mischief or in spite you say you paid high for your stock do you intend to wreck the institution lose a fortune by no means thats precisely what you will succeed in doing i had ventured to hope that you three gentlemen would remain on the board am i dreaming bell nelsons collar appeared to be choking him and with clumsy fingers he tugged at it going to kick henry and me off the board eh rob us well im damned if you do youll not kick us off he doesnt want the bank the son exclaimed hoarsely thats all a bluff he wants blackmail thats the kind of man he is he wants his price i know him how much gray whatll it cost us ill tell you what it will cost ha didnt i say so oh there is a price for everything mine will surprise you however it is so low cant you guess what it is the speakers intent gaze had never left henry nelsons face it was fixed there now as cold as relentless as the stare of a python bell nelson leaned forward his lips parted a new eagerness came into his purple countenance well well what is it he demanded querulously vindication there was a moment of silence what is he talking about henry bells eyes were strained toward his son i dont know the latter said in a thin voice hes crazy always was im giving you a chance colonel youd better take it think carefully when there came no response to this warning gray shrugged very well there is nothing further except to complete the transfer and proceed with the business of the meeting mr briskow will be the next president and i shall occupy the position of vicepresident and treasurer now held by you the effect of this declaration was electric with a cry the younger nelson lunged forward confusion followed it was of short duration however for henry found himself locked in the arms of the briskow giant others lent buddy their assistance and in spite of his struggles the vicepresident was flung backward upon a deep leather divan he rose unsteadily but meeting buddys threatening gaze and realizing the impossibility of getting past him he cried let me out of here let me out damn you i ill get you for this gray let me out i tell you buddy gray jerked his head in the direction of the door to one of the adjoining offices he keeps a gun in his desk top drawer get it before me makes a fool of himself young briskow stepped out of the room gray continued speaking to the others i have something to say to you gentlemen before we go on with the meeting and i wish to say it in the presence of colonel nelson and his youll not keep me here i refuse to stay henry shouted and he pushed past swope toward the door wait it was the elder nelson speaking and in his voice was a new note a note of triumph stock cant be transferred at an annual meeting it has to be done in advance ten days i think it is am i right senator that is the usual procedure senator lowe agreed better look it up and make sure gray directed there followed a few moments of uncomfortable silence while the banks attorney ran through the bylaws it seemed to those waiting that it was a long time before he frowned and shook his head i ah i can find nothing against it it seems i have nothing to do except transfer the shares then there wont be any meeting bell loudly declared the three directors greeted this remark with exclamations of genuine relief sure lets adjourn put it over until one of them began but the banks president was bellowing in rising fury at the interlopers get out get out of my office dyou hear get out looks to me like its my office gus briskow said quietly or it will be directly you bell put on the muffler i came a long ways to attend this meetin its the first one i ever been to an its goin to happen shut up your fuss i want you to hear what mr grays got to say to hell with him and you too stormed the financier hold the meeting eh hold it if you dare i defy you steal my bank doublecross me well see about that come along henry youre in gray said menacingly youd better stay and vote your stock or you may never get back again but neither father nor son heeded him when they had gone he frowned im sorry really i am i hoped i could force i think wed better go too some one said this is too extraordinary were in no frame of mind to go ahead i must insist that you remain long enough to hear me out you have no right to refuse there is something you must be told ill admit im curious to know what the devil it all means murphy the lumberman confessed but i dont know that i should accept an explanation from you not after henrys accusations ive known him and bell for years i respect your friendship for them and i shant expect you to put trust in my words it seems to me however that you owe it to that friendship to hear me this incident has taken a turn wholly unexpected and i must confess disappointing i looked for a different outcome hoped id be able to force an explanation the speaker shook his head and frowned again perplexedly when after a moment of indecisive murmuring the three directors seated themselves gray thanked them with a bow ill be as brief as possible and if you dont mind ill stand as i talk im in no mood to sit ill have to go back a bit it was several seconds before he resumed when it became evident that the united states was going to war i managed to get in at plattsburg and took the officers training course it was easy for me to complete that course because i had served in the spanish war and had kept up my interest in military affairs something convinced those who ought to know that i possessed qualifications of unusual value to the country a wide business experience at home and abroad a knowledge of languages perhaps anyhow i was called to washington there i met henry nelson a valuable man too in his way we were commissioned at the same time and sent overseas on the same ship to engage in the same work military intelligence i didnt like the job but it was considered important and naturally i couldnt pick and choose of course it was secret confidential work no need of going into that here nelsons and my duties were identical our authority was equal we were ordered to work hand in hand and although we were commissioned together technically he outranked me owing to the fact that he was given his commission a moment before i got mine thats where the trouble started we clashed even on shipboard he proved himself to be authoritative overbearing he immediately assumed the position of my superior officer im not a mildtempered man but i put up with it figuring that our paths would soon separate but they didnt when we arrived in france i tackled my job with all the energy in me i tried for results nelson i discovered in time was concerned only in taking entire credit for all that he and i and the whole organization under us accomplished and in advancing himself i worked he played politics you are not military men so i shant bore you with army terms or technical details but by one means or another he managed to intrench himself in a position of actual authority over me not at all in accord with our purpose or our instructions i swallowed my resentment for it seemed rather petty rather selfish in a time like that to divert my attention from the important work in hand to quarrel with him you understand then too he was not making good and i was and i thought time would surely cure the trouble he must have appreciated my feelings nevertheless he persisted in abusing his powers he began finally to really interfere with me to call me off of important tasks and humiliate me with futile assignments and i realized that i was threatened with failure through his meddling this may sound trivial to you the speaker raised his eyes to his audience but take my word for it there were many instances of the kind over there jealousy intrigue malevolence petty spite drove more than one earnest patriotic officer to rebellion and ruined many a career i rebelled i had to or be made ridiculous i warned him privately as man to man he ignored the warning then i prepared a complete report showing by the copies of his orders by the records of our respective accomplishments by our correspondence how he had systematically and maliciously endeavored to nullify my work and and the like it was not a pretty report to read i turned it in to him for submission higher up then it was that he outgeneraled me he was furious of course but he apologized abjectly he admitted that he had been wrong that he had imposed upon me he promised to play fair if id permit him to withhold the report and i was deceived no man likes to be thought a crybaby those were eventful times personal complaints were not welcomed in any quarter not with the world rocking on its foundations i was glad to accept his promises for a while we worked in harmony i became engaged in an intricate case having to do with a leak concerning transport sailings and routes a matter involving the lives of thousands of our boys millions of dollars in supplies and i went to brest under cover it had to be handled with extreme care some danger about it too a very interesting case i assure you i lived in a house with some of the people under surveillance one of them was a woman extremely attractive thoroughly unscrupulous my avenue of approach was through her nelson of course knew what i was doing he was about the only one who did i worked a long while and i was upon the verge of success it would hare been a real accomplishment too when without apparent cause the gang took warning scattered the whole thing blew up months of work for nothing i had made worse than a failure this time you mean to accuse henry of of treachery of that sort swope inquired i do and thats not all out of a clear sky charges were preferred against me outrageous charges in which that woman figured up to this point gray had spoken smoothly rapidly but now his tone changed his words became hesitant jerky i was amazed joke i called it at first sort of a blanket indictment it was charging me with inefficiency negligence exceeding my authority dishonesty and things even worse those were some of the least serious the least nasty it was all too absurd being peculiarly vain and sensitive my impulse was to shoot henry nelson but i couldnt believe the charges would be taken seriously well there was an investigation i was courtmartialed i disproved a good deal i think id have exonerated myself on every count only for the woman that one i spoke about she turned the trick i was found guilty disgraced sent back even though you are not military men you can appreciate the extent of my dishonor there gentlemen you have in a few words an unconvincing summary of a long and complicated story one that i detest telling however i could not permit you to sit with me at the directors table of this bank without knowing who i am what i am and why i have run that rat into his hole colonel nelson spoke the truth when he said this was purely a personal matter between us it is so purely personal that i was willing to spare humiliation to his father leave old bell in control of his bank and end our fight if hed right that old wrong but you heard him refuse so they must both fall he said ive been persecuting him gray smiled grimly let me tell you how that disgrace cost me my friends and what money i had for i tried long and earnestly to get back to get a rehearing to enter the navy anything to reestablish myself failing that i came to texas i came without a dollar without an acquaintance and began my persecution of henry nelson i began it by coming here to the bank and telling him what i was up to i put him on guard and we engaged each other as the french would say to the death i won thats all there is to the story well ill be damned martin murphy exclaimed at least henry played fair in this he didnt betray your secret gage said coldly oh i meant to tell you that he didnt dare betray me for he too came back in disgrace the pot couldnt very well talk about the kettle what henry nelson impossible i mean exactly what i say no man of his type could have lasted over there then too the story of our quarrel leaked out that old report of mine turned up yes he got the same medicine he gave me but he had influence in washington and he managed to delay final action almost up to the day of the armistice even then he succeeded in pretty well covering up the reason for his dismissal why even bell doesnt know that henrys been a terrible hero hereabouts said gus briskow after a moment he addressed the other men mr gray told me this an i wanted him to tell it to you i dunno what youall think of his story but i know him an i believe every word of it whats more i believe this bank is goin to be run as well as ever it was even if i am president a man can be president an stay at home if hes got folks under him that know more than he does what dyou say if we start that meetin we been talkin about im willing to see mr gray settin in yonder at henrys desk if you are i dont see that it makes much difference whether were willing or not swope confessed you have the votes between you to do about as you choose of course we have but with bell an henry gone it seems like some of their neighbors ought to stay an look out for what potaters theyve left in the ground what dyou say swope eyed his companions briefly then he nodded well stay then mr secretary let her go chapter xxix one morning several days after the annual meeting gus briskow opened the door between his and grays office and inquired busy the new vicepresident of the security national raised a preoccupied face to the new president and said im never too busy to talk to you what is it nothing im just kinda lonesome kinda tired of lookin bright about things i dont savvy gus seated himself and crossed his thin legs folks give an owl credit for bein wise just because he keeps his mouth shut probly hes got nothing of interest to say perhaps but you can say no gus and thats about all the average banker is called upon to say umm the elder man nodded reflectively i heard about a captain of industry that allus smelled a pink when he did his heavy thinkin now me im goin in for bananas i keep a bag of em in my desk imost killed myself on bananas when our first well came in never thought id be able to afford all i wanted hows the bank why its still here as you see i know thats the remarkable part i keep thinkin its goin to bust i mean blow up an disappear i wake up nights dreamin its gone its all right is it positively i put an accountant at work on the books and he should be ready to report any time now no chance of bell nelson throwin us out is there hes in dallas tryin to stir up money not a chance unless you want him to do so unless youre afraid well make a failure of the business we gus smiled quizzically you wont fail folks around town are talkin about how quick youre takin hold an theyre beginning to think youll make a better banker than the nelsons funny aint it how easy reconciled folks is to losin a coupla prominent citizens like that looks like bell an henry are about the only ones that take it hard the funny thing is gray frowned perplexedly they dont take it hard at least henry doesnt appear to do so thats what puzzles me no move of any sort thats not like him gus agreed to this i been expectin him to cut some capers thats why i been hangin around so steady i know every time i peel a banana i peel an eye for henry i worry whenever you go out alone the younger man rose and nervously paced the floor im completely mystified he admitted the whole affair has been a great disappointment to me i thought id sprung a coup but im at a standstill im stumped checkmated about that trouble between you an him eh why we took your word for that unfortunately that didnt help me very greatly other people arent so easily convinced as you and swope and gage and murphy damnation i thought my troubles were over well your money troubles is over theyre the smallest part id go back and start all over again if i could clean up that that army record its a pretty flat triumph humph most triumphs is a feller has a dream a longin an he bows his back an works his life away tryin to realize it if he does the chances is hes disappointed he finds hes kep his back bent so long he cant straighten it look at me pore as dirt an scarcely enough to eat i used to pray for a miracle pray for money enough to do something for ma an the children for a thousan dollars here i am president of a whole bank but mas sick allies miserable an i cant sleep nights for fear ill lose what i got poverty wouldnt have helped mas health oh i aint sayin id trade gus wagged his sandy head i get my shoes shined every two hours because that bootblackin stand is a nice place to look at the bank from i set there an tell myself im president of it but thats the biggest dividend ive got so far five shines a day an all the bananas i can eat flat is the word gray smiled affectionately at the speaker at least buddy is happy hes reaping his dividends if im any judge i figger hes in love again good heavens gray paused in his restless pacing and turned an expression of almost comic dread upon the father with that woman eh well i refuse to interfere again i havent fully recovered from his first infatuation for her i can tell the boys symptoms i felt the same way when i was courtin ma i acted just like him he has been trying to tell me something for a week but ive been too busy and too worried to listen briskows kindly face had settled into graver lines when next he spoke you probly wonder why i take it so easy well i remember what you told me once about judgin people i dont know mebbe allie was right too when she said a little genuine happiness is worth all it costs anyhow if buddy wants that woman i wont say a word shes turned out pretty good an people speak well of her buddys a man an some men just have to get married the sooner its over the better for em hes like that but whats more n all that love between two young people is a pretty sacred thing an when old folks keep interferin it seems to me theyre settin themselves up to be wiser than god mas folks didnt care much for me i feel a rebuke in your words gray said and no doubt ive earned it for it has always been my weakness to rearrange the lives of those i love but who am i after all if i were so divinely wise why is my own life what it is when i marry perhaps i shall have to ask b ask the girl to ignore in me things as as disagreeable to think about as those which buddy will have to ignore in margies past that boy in fact all you briskows have put me so deeply in your debt that im afraid i shall have to conquer my meddlesome instincts the speaker looked up suddenly youll never know by the way how deep is my debt of gratitude when a vainglorious supersensitive man finds himself under a cloud it is pretty nice to know that there is somebody whose faith is unshakable somebody who needs no legal proof that hes proof here i am back again right where i was when you came in back to my own selfish concerns i cant get away from them what to do next the nelsons are on their last legs the loss of this bank will certainly destroy what credit remained and even a good well now would scarcely tide them over but damn it gus i cant kick a man if he refuses to stand up i cant beat a corpse there came a rap at the door and the accountant whom gray had put to work upon the banks books entered id like to talk to you about this report the man began dont go gray said as briskow unfolded his legs and rose but the president of the security national shook his head saying bookkeepin is all choctaw to me i saw one statement an i thought liquid assets meant that bottle of whisky bell left in his desk mr gray the auditor announced when they were alone i wish youd ask somebody else to take this job off my hands why well somebody else could probably do it better there was a pause ive known bell nelson all my life that is why i engaged you youve been over these books before again there was an instant of silence then into grays face there flashed a curious alertness come he cried sharply what is it im sorry to be the one to the auditor shrugged if you insist on an explanation i suppose i shall have to tell you perhaps its just as well anyhow they say figures dont lie but you and i know better i only wish they didnt have you caught them lying here i have and it has made me rather ill youd better prepare yourself for a shock it was nearly an hour later that gray telephoned to senator lowe the banks attorney and to bennett swope the latter being the only member of the board available at short notice this done he wrote a note to henry nelson in spite of his effort to control his hand it shook when he signed his name and on second thought he destroyed the missive there is something ominous about the written word if nelson grew suspicious hed never come gray stepped into gus briskows office and asked him to call the former vicepresident first however explaining exactly what he wished gus to say the ruse succeeded then gray returned to his own office he drew a deep breath within him he felt a ferocious eagerness take fire for it seemed to him that the day of reckoning had come henrys behavior was now easily understandable the fellow was cringing cowering in anticipation of a second blow well the whip was in grays hands and he proposed to use it ruthlessly to sink the lash to cut to the bone to leave scars such as henry had left upon him nor was that his only weapon there was for instance old bell nelsons honor if coercion failed there were rewards inducements oh henry would have to speak the nelson fortune or what remained for salvage from the wreck thereof the bank itself they were pawns which gray could and would sacrifice if necessary his hunger for a sight of bob had become unbearable freedom to declare his overwhelming love and that love he knew was no immature infatuation but the deepset passion of a fullgrown man was worth any price he might be called upon to pay yes henry would speak the truth today or for one of them at least there would be an end to the feud gray too kept a revolver in his desk he removed it and placed it in his pocket buddy briskow chose this of all moments to thrust his grinning visage into the door and to inquire got time for me now mr gray not now buddy when why almost any other time i wouldnt bother you but its important and i i promised a certain party the youths face reddened his smile widened vacuously later if you dont mind it was plain that buddy did mind nevertheless he withdrew when swope and lowe arrived gray could with difficulty restrain himself from blurting out the reason for his urgent summons but he contented himself by asking them to wait in the presidents office henry nelson entered the bank with his head up with a contemptuous smile upon his lips and an easy confidence in his bearing his hand was outstretched toward the knob of briskows door when the one adjoining opened and from the office he himself had so long occupied calvin gray spoke to him please step in here colonel nelson recoiled no thank you he said curtly briskow and i are amateur bankers there is a matter upon which we need your advice indeed finding it isnt as easy to run a bank as a drilling rig he said you were out otherwise will you come in stiffly reluctantly as if impelled by some force outside of himself nelson stepped within but he ignored the chair that was proffered him gray closed the door before saying the deception was mine not briskows you prefer to stand umm i appreciate your feeling of formality i felt a bit ill at ease on the occasion of my first call here when our positions were reversed if you got me here just to be nasty by no means nevertheless it gratifies my vanity to remind you that you considered me a braggart a bluffer whereas i havent changed my opinion so be it one matter only remains between us i am about to ring up on the last act of our little comedy theatrical as always arent you nelsons lip curled for a moment gray stared at the speaker curiously his tone had altered when he said youre a better poker player than i thought youre almost as good a bluffer as i am that by the way is probably the last compliment i shall pay you come ive no time to waste you will soon have ample time if not to waste at least to meditate what do you mean by that the query came sharply ive had an examination of the banks books that as you will readily understand explains why i sent for you why no i dont i wondered how you and your father got the money to keep going so long for i discovered you were in a bad way even before i turned up it is no longer a mystery when you and he as directors of the security national lent yourselves money as individuals you must have realized that you were well arranging ample leisure for yourselves in which to meditate upon the stringency of the banking laws nonsense thats nnothing nothing serious nelsons ruddy color had slowly vanished with uncertain hand he reached for the nearest chair and upon it he leaned as he continued jerkily irregular perhaps ill admit it was irregular but theres nothing wrong oh youll make it look as bad as possible i dare say but you dont understand the circumstances anyhow father is getting it straightened out all he needs is time well be able to handle it all right were good you know perfectly good youre broke everybody else knows it if you dont irregular ha theres a choice of words the speaker laughed silently it is an irregularity that carries with it free board and lodging at the states expense an incoherent protest issued from nelsons throat when next he managed to make himself audible his words were such as really to amaze his hearer i didnt do it he cried in a panicstricken voice it was fathers idea you had us crowded there was no other way i warned him wait a minute you blame it on him grays inquiry was harsh incredulous after a momentary pause his lips moved but for once he stammered his ready tongue refused its duty he exploded finally with an oath he jerked open a drawer in his desk from his pocket he removed his revolver flung it inside then jammed the drawer back into place with a crash you rat he exclaimed he turned his back upon henry nelson and made a circuit of the little room its a thing you and i can easily fix up the latter feebly insisted now that personal matter of yours perhaps i could help you reopen it somehow clear it up ah indeed give and take i say im willing to do anything i can if there wont be any ifs no conditions whatever is that so nelson flamed forth in a momentary explosion of resentment if you think i intend to stand the brunt of this youre crazy i cant afford to figure in a scandal banking scandal like this im a young man bell has had his day hes old you can hush this up there are lots of ways to do that keep me out of it and and ill do whats right by you ill do anything you say youll do that anyhow gray replied in a voice that grated he flung himself into his desk chair and seizing pen and paper he began to write rapidly shakily i want to see what im signing nelson warned a growl was his answer for an interminable time the only sound in the office was the scratching of that pen when at last it came to an end gray rose thrust the loose sheets into nelsons hand then indicating the vacant chair said sign that the wretched recipient of this curt command read the lines caiefully he read them twice thrice for his mind no longer functioned clearly he raised a sick face finally and shook his head wouldnt i be a fool he queried listen you grays body was shaking his words were uneven im sorry for bell but not for you ill never forget nor forgive what you did to me nothing can undo that disgrace clings to a man youre going to get yours now and you cant squirm out of it or lie out of it no matter how you try for i shant let you youre ruined discredited blown up but i dont think i want to send you to the penitentiary id rather see you walking the streets with dandruff on your collar id rather keep you to look at anyhow youll have to sign that if youll guarantee to keep this bank matter quiet if youll protect me ill sign otherwise you can go to hell well beat it out somehow we can do it inflexibly gray asserted im going to turn you over whether or no but ill help bell get the money to repay those loans hell probably manage to save himself and save you too i wont do it nelson flung down the pen not on those conditions you cant bulldoze me its your day to crow but i warn you dont push me too far gray voiced an epithet it was low pitched but its explosive force the impelling fury back of it fairly caused the room to vibrate he was white of lip his rage had reached the foaming point dont make me lay hands on you choke you into it he cried hoarsely if you do by god ill finish you like a man fighting some hypnotic influence stronger than his will henry nelson took up the pen and signed his name waveringly the next moment gray smote the door to briskows office a heavy blow and as it flew open he barked come in here all three of you he stood aside as gus bennett swope and senator lowe entered yonder is a statement which i want you to read and witness when youve done that im going to tell you why henry nelson signed it the rest will be up to you it was midafternoon swope and lowe had left the bank briskow drew a deep breath and said with genuine relief im glad thats over we can handle the debt between us an after all old bells a pretty good citizen as for henry i spose hell wiggle out of it somehow i dunno as id of been so easy on him if id been in your place ill tell you why i was easy on him gray confessed im tired of fighting im worn out ive won my point and hell carry the sort of load ive been carrying but there is this difference for him there will be no vindication at the end taking from his pocket nelsons statement he stared at it then slowly his face lightened i was blind mad at first i felt as if i couldnt keep my hands off him it was such a dirty trick he did me and so reasonless he had no excuse whatever for injuring me gus however i suppose most quarrels sprout from tiny seeds well im square with the game i im afraid even yet that its all a dream ive wanted to yell the speaker chuckled the chuckle grew to a laugh theres magic in this document gus old boy ive grown young all at once you neednt of took it so hard us fellers would have stood by you if youd turned out to be a horse thief texas men are like that you proved it but that wasnt enough a mans business associates will frequently overlook a lot more than their wives and daughters will overlook theres a certain loyalty that doesnt apply outside of the office gray rose and filled his lungs dyou know why i felt this thing so keenly why i fought so long of course you dont for ive held out on you fact ive held out on my partner had a secret from him now then steel yourself for a surprise im suffering from buddys complaint only ten times aggravated what briskow stared up at the animated countenance above him you thinkin about gettin married im thinking about nothing else thats what ails me why gus youve no idea what a perfectly charming person i can be when when i can be what i am i thought i was too old and too blase ever to become seriously interested in a woman above all in a girl but do you remember when ma and allie came to dallas that first time something happened about then to upset all my ideas briskows sunparched face slowly lightened his bright inquisitive eyes grew bluer brighter im mighty glad i allus hoped he tried to finish his sentence then shook his head and murmured huskily mighty glad here was a marvel a miracle for which he had never dared even hope he thought of allie and a lump came into his throat she had reached the stars his girl he would be mighty glad too gray was speaking and in his voice was a new vibrant quality a new vigor now youll know why this is the biggest day of my life why i thought those men would never go im shaking all over gus youll have to run the bank for a while im too young and irresponsible im going out to buy a hoop and a jumping rope and a pair of roller skates again he laughed boyishly then with a slap that knocked the breath from briskows lungs he walked lightly into his own office and seized his hat for a long time the father sat at his big empty desk staring smiling into space this would make ma well money wasnt altogether a worry after all it bought things that nothing else could buy stars and and things from the expressions upon the faces gray passed in leaving the bank he realized that his own must wear a grin but in spite of his dignified effort to wipe it off he felt it widening well this was his day to grin his day to dance and caper people were too grave anyhow they should feel free to vent their joy in living why act as if the world were a place of gloom and shadow why shouldnt they hop skip and jump to and from business if so inclined he visualized the streets of the city peopled with pedestrians old and young fat and thin thus engaged and he laughed aloud nevertheless it was a good idea and when he became mayor or perhaps the junior senator from texas hed advocate public playgrounds for grownups bob would help him put it through there was a girl who would never grow old they would grow young together he caught sight of his reflection in a shop window and slowed down his gait telling himself that pending the time his new idea was definitely planted it might be well to walk in the oldfashioned manner men of substance bankers for instance shouldnt rush through the streets as if going to a fire they shouldnt dash over crossings and take curbstones as if they were hurdles it wasnt being done no reason however why a banker shouldnt throw his shoulders back and walk springily upon his toes when he beheld the familiar painted sign tom and bob parker real estate and insurance he paused the mere sight of the little wooden building the name gave him an odd shortness of breath it was weeks since he had been here he realized of a sudden that he had brought nothing with him no gift not even flowers but there was enough to talk about shed forget that what a shower of gifts he would pour upon her and upon old tom too good old tom tom had wanted to believe tom and he would be great pals they couldnt help being pals with just one thing between them to love one thing in all the world it was a disappointment to find the office empty except for the father himself but gray began with a rush well i told you id clear myself and here i am walking on air you did it eh thats good news we had a showdown at the bank henry nelson and i locked horns and but here read what he signed that cleans the slate hell do anything further that may be necessary officially wheres bob theyre fishin for a bit in one of your avenger wells shes out there so id forgotten did you see did buddy have a talk with you today i mean buddy oh buddy briskow i saw him for a moment only shell be back soon i dare say tom parker stirred it was a moment before he spoke then it was with apparent irrelevance that he said im sorry you and he didnt have a good talk bob asked him to see you sent him there apurpose the sight of grays smiling eager uncomprehending face caused the old mans steady gaze to waver he cleared his throat buddys a fine boy finest in the world i claim responsibility for him in a way hes part mine gray laughed his eyes sparkled him and bob are out there together theyve been together a lot mr gray both of em young thataway of course i knew youd both like some quality in toms voice some reluctant evasiveness to his eyes bore a belated message to the younger man snapped his chain of thought dried the words upon his lips into his eyes leaped a sudden strained incredulity sharply he cried what do you mean then after an instant why did he want to see me the two men gazed squarely at each other for the first time my god why thats absurd i i brought him here hes just a boy and shes just a girl mr gray the younger man shrank as if at a blow he closed his eyes he raised a shaking hand to his face which was slowly assuming the color of ashes thats too rottenly unfair he said faintly i brought him here made a man of him of course he doesnt know his eyes opened eagerly he ran on why tom its just the boy and girl of it puppy love you know how that is i didnt notice how things was going till if was too late we might as well talk frankly mr gray probly its well you saw me first eh well when i understood where they was heading i worried a lot after what you said that day understand but those two pshaw it was like they had known each other always it was like bobs mother and me when we first met her beautiful and fine and educated and me rough and awkward only buddys a better boy than i was hes got more in him i spose all womenfolks have that mother feeling that makes em yearn over the unlikeliest fellers parker looked appealingly at his stricken hearer then quickly dropped his eyes for grays countenance was like that of a dying man or of a man suffering the stroke of a surgeons knife after all its youth youre a good deal older than bob and i spose you sort of dazzled her she likes you she thinks youre great you kinda thrill her but i dont believe she ever dreamed you was actually that you actually cared for her youve got a grand way you know and she aint a bit conceited about herself why i know she never figgered it that way because she made buddy promise to tell you the first thing sent him to the bank apurpose thinking youd be so glad on his account then theyve settled it between them tom nodded gravely she told me last night and from the way she told me i know its not just boy and girl love shes been singing like a bird all day and buddy hes breathless i know how he feels i couldnt draw a full breath for two weeks after bobs mother gray uttered a wordless gasping cry he moved unsteadily toward the door then paused with his hand upon the knob tom parker was surprised when after a moment he saw the mans shoulders shake and heard him utter a thin cackling laugh time is a grim old joker isnt he no way of beating him none at all now i thought i was young but lucky i found you here and spared my vanity he turned exposing a face strangely contorted you wont mention my foolish mistake will you no use hurting the ones we love you know how we feel fatherly thats it fatherly love i was a silly old fool theyll be happy young people like that the speaker choked young people well adios old man he opened the door and walked blindly forth chapter xxx calvin gray did not return to the bank he went straight to his hotel and as soon as he could sufficiently control himself to do so he telephoned gus briskow telling him that he intended to leave town then he began mechanically to pack his bag he moved like a man in a trance for the blow had fallen so suddenly as to numb him his only impulse was to escape to hide himself from these people who of a sudden had become hateful his city of dreams had collapsed the ruins as they lay meant nothing as yet for his mind refused to envisage them and he could see them only as they had stood he groped amid a hopeless confusion of thought at one moment bewildered piteously hurt at the next suffering a sense of shameful betrayal he had grown old and dull and feeble too and for the time being he was incapable of feeling the full force of a strong mans resentment this surprised him vaguely soon however like kindling fires among the ruins his fury rose fury at himself at buddy at barbara and in the heat of those scorching flames he writhed she had loved him hed swear to that he had swayed her overpowered her he had lacked only the courage to trust his instinct cowards luck it served him right he had held her in his arms and had let her slip through her lips had been raised to his and he had refused to press them imbecile he groaned he tore the collar and the tie from his neck for they were choking him old eh too old that was the grimmest jest of all for at the mere thought of barbaras lips unruly forces took possession of him he experienced a fierce resistless vigor such as he had never felt in his younger days it was a dreadful an unappeasable yearning of soul and body and when the paroxysm had passed it left him weak he sank into a chair and lay there stupid inert until again those fires began to lick at him and again he twisted in dumb agony buddy briskow buddy of all people that lout that awkward simpleton who owed him everything but buddy was young gray heard himself laughing in hoarse derision he rose and tramped heavily around his room and as he went he crushed and ripped and mutilated whatever his hands encountered his slow deliberate murderous rage demanded some such outlet all the while he felt within himself two conflicting impulses heard two voices the one voice shouted at him to search out buddy and visit upon him the punishment warranted by a base betrayal the other told him jeeringly to lay the scourge upon his own shoulders and endure the pain since he had betrayed himself his mind was like a battle ground torn upheaved obscured by a frightful murk he remembered a night in france a black night of rumbling crashing terror when as now the whole world rocked and tumbled some remnant of selfcontrol induced him to lock his door and pocket the key for buddy might come he probably would look him up all grins and smirks and giggles to tell him the glorious news to acclaim the miracle that would be too much one thing was certain there was no safety except in flight ignominious cowardly flight after all how could buddy have known he was a good boy and he had shown his love his loyalty in a thousand ways gray hated him at this moment but more bitterly even he hated himself it was fate he fell to cursing aloud but there was no relief in that and again the appalling irony of the situation silenced him he had deified himself set himself upon a high place bent men and affairs to his own ends until he had acquired a godlike belief in his power to accomplish all things his victory had been complete he had won all except the one thing he most desired the very fruit of victory some time later he heard buddy come whistling merrily down the hall and knock at his door gray cowered in his chair listening in breathless dread until the footsteps retreated when he rose he moved about stealthily when night came he took his bag and slunk out of the hotel for it seemed that men must surely know what a fool he had made of himself it would have been a relief to feel that he was leaving never to return but even that was denied him for after his first panic the truth had come home he could not run away he had forged chains for his own limbs like a tethered mustang he could plunge only to the end of his rope friendship again there was simple trustful faithful gus briskow and the bank god what a mess things were in gray knew he would have to return have to see bob and buddy day after day month after month and the prospect was too distressing to dwell upon again his mind grew weary baffled he experienced a wretched physical illness where to go where to hide until his sickness had passed that was the question for the first time he appreciated the full extent of his loneliness his utter lack of resource in a crisis like this most men however solitary lay by material things for themselves build homes and surround themselves with personal possessions from which or amid which they can gain some sort of solace in times of trial but he had not fashioned so much as a den into which he could creep and lick his wounds once he had left his hotel room behind him he was in the open and without cover not a single soul cared whether he came or went not another door stood ajar for him and he had planned so much upon having a home a real home but he could not trust himself to think much along that line it induced an absurd desire to weep at his plight it made him feel like a child lost in a wood that was silly just an emotional reaction nevertheless the impulse was real and caused him to yearn poignantly for human comfort he thought of ma briskow finally she was human she had a heart and dallas was a sort of homey place anyhow the bellboys at the ajax knew and liked him that was probably because he had tipped them handsomely but what of that if theyd be kind to him now hed tip them more handsomely than ever lonely men old ones must expect to pay for what they get he bought a ticket to dallas ma briskows eyes were dim nevertheless she saw the change in calvin gray when late the following afternoon he came to see her land sakes she exclaimed in a shocked voice pa never said you was ailin why mr gray im not really ill he told her wearily just old ive had a bad night seating himself beside her couch he took her hand in his and made her tell him all about herself he had brought her an armful of flowers as usual and extravagant gifts for her adornment giving it seemed was his unconscious habit while she admired them with ecstatic ohs and ahs he busied himself with bowls and vases but ma noted his fumbling uncertainty of touch and the evident effort with which he kept up his assumption of good cheer she told him finally something mighty bad has happened to you mr gray he gazed at her mutely then nodded is it something about the the princess of wichita falls yes ma tse tse tse it was a sympathetic cluck was she a wicked princess the query was gently put but it deeply affected the man he tried to smile failed then like a forlorn little boy he came and bowed his head beneath her hand i knew youd understand mother briskow so i i ran to you with my hurt just as i used to run to my mother gray after a while he continued in a smothered voice she isnt a wicked princess she didnt mean to hurt me and thats what makes it hurt so deep she tumbled the old dukes castle down upon his head tumbled the old duke out of his dreams he isnt a duke any longer hell allus be a duke mrs briskow firmly declared he was born that way at any rate hes a sad old duke now all his conceit is gone you see he was a vain old gentleman and his courtiers used to tell him he was splendid handsome they said he looked as handsome as a king and by and by he began to think he must be a king his enemies sneered at this and said he was neither duke nor king but a a mountebank that made him furious so he went to war with them and by jove he fought pretty well for an old fellow anyhow he licked em when they fell down and begged for mercy he knew he was indeed a great person greater even than he had suspected and worthy of any princess in the land pshaw aint a duke higher than a princess no ma not higher than this princess her father made all the laws she is very noble and very good good princesses are scarce and and so of course theyre very high but the duke of dallas didnt stop to think of that he told himself that he was so strong and so rich and so desirable that she would be flattered at his notice he got all dressed up and went to call on her and on the way whenever he looked into a shop window he didnt see the buns and the candies and the dolls inside all he saw was his own reflection it looked so magnificent that he strutted higher and thought how proud he was going to make her i guess that was the trouble with the old duke all along he had never looked deeply enough to see what was inside anyhow what do you think ma while hed been off at war conquering people and making them acknowledge that he was a king the little princess had fallen in love with with his nephew nice boy that nephew and the duke thought a lot of him ma briskows hand which had been slowly stroking grays bent head ceased its movement she drew a sharp breath there happened to be an old mirror in the princesss boudoir and while the duke was waiting for her he saw himself in it he saw himself just as he was not as he had looked in the shop windows for it was a truthful mirror and it told everything my that was a bad moment for the duke of dallas when he saw that he wasnt young and beautiful but old and wrinkled and funny that was bad enough but when he looked again and saw the princess whom he loved in the arms of his handsome nephew why he gave up all his fine garments fell off and he realized with shame that after all he was only the withered mountebank when he got home his castle had collapsed there wasnt a stone standing so he ran away ran to his mother oh mr gray ma briskow quavered i could cry an after all you done for buddy the man shook his head vigorously still with his face hidden it isnt buddy its youth youth needs no fine adornment no crown no victory what you goin to do she asked him go on playing the duke i suppose rebuild the castle the best way i can thats the hard part if i could run away and forget but i cant the old duke walled himself in he must grin and strut and keep people from guessing that hes only a fraud until he can find a hole in the wall through which he can creep there was a long silence then ma inquired would you like to tell me something about the little princess sometimes it helps to talk nnot yet youre a duke an the best one that ever lived mr gray you cant fool me ive met too many of em that lookinglass lied real dukes an kings an such people dont get old its only common folks theres lots of magic the worlds full of it an your castle is goin up again after a fashion perhaps gray raised his head and smiled crookedly but it will never be a home and thats what i wanted most of all do you think im very weak very silly to come to you for a little mothering thats the kind of children mothers love best the old woman said then she drew him down to her and laid her cheek against his there ive made you cry he exclaimed reproachfully what a selfish beast i am ill go now wont you stay an have supper with allie an me were awful lonesome with pa gone allies out somers but it would do me good to know you was here an it ll do you good to stay you can rest yourself while i take my nap ma briskow did not wish to take a nap but she knew that gray needed the solace of his own thoughts just now so when he agreed she sent him downstairs first balm indeed had come to the man the smart was less intense to put his trouble into words somehow lightened it then too the grateful knowledge that some warmth of sympathy was his made it easier to bear but it remained a cruel burden that gentle dreamy soul up yonder could not know how it hurt how could she understand for instance what it meant to go back and face the deadly dull routine of a life from which all zest all interest had fled a routine broken only by moments of downright torture yes and the effort it would take to smile god if there were only some way to break his fetters slip his gyves grays brain like his body had grown tired and feverish to be sure little more than a day had gone by since he had sallied forth like a knight but it seemed a year an age and every hour brought a new and keener distress he found it possible now for the first time to relax a bit physically so he closed his eyes and lay back in an easy chair while the twilight stole in upon him sooner or later his mind too would cease its torment for pain distils its own anodyne then he would sleep it would be a blessing to forget for even an hour and thus gain strength with which to carry on the fight but what a useless battle it was he could never win peace would never come he heard allie enter the house but he did not stir he would have to put on the mask soon enough for of course she must never suspect on buddys account the room which had grown agreeably dark was suddenly illuminated and he lurched to his feet to find the girl facing him from the door she was neither startled nor surprised at his presence and when he tried to smile and to greet her in his accustomed manner she interrupted him by saying i knew you were here so then ma is awake again allie shook her head vaguely i knew you were here the minute i came in i can most always tell there had been a shadow of a smile upon her lips but it vanished a look of growing concern crept over her face whats the matter whatever has happened mr gray why nothing i was feeling tired worn out indulging myself in a thoroughly enjoyable fit of the blues his voice broke when he tried to laugh allie uttered a quick low cry a wordless sympathetic sound her dark eyes widened grew darker she came forward a step or two then she halted would you rather be alone she asked he signified his dissent and she went on i know what the blues are like i sit alone in the dark a good deal she busied herself about the room for a few moments straightening things adjusting the window shades allie had the knack of silence blessed attribute in man or woman and to grays surprise he found that her mere presence was comforting she startled him by saying suddenly youre hurt hurt badly he looked up at her with an instinctive denial upon his lips but realizing the futility of deceit he nodded yes allie the girl drew a deep breath her strong hands closed harshly she said i could kill anybody that hurt you i wanted to kill buddy that time is it those nelsons have they got you down there was something fierce and masterful in allies concern and her inquiry carried with it even more than a proffer of help she had in fact flung herself into a protective attitude she suggested nothing so much as a lioness roused no no it is nothing like that i merely fooled myself had a dream you wouldnt understand my dear allie studied him soberly for a moment oh yes i would i do i understand perfectly nobody could understand as well as i do what do you mean by that ive been hurt too she laid a hand upon her breast thats why i sit in the dark my dear child im sorry gus said you were unhappy but i thought it was merely the new life youre young you can forget its only us old ones who cant forget sometime you must tell me all about it the girl smiled faintly but he nodded positively oh its a relief to tell somebody i feel better already for confiding in ma yes and your sympathy is mighty soothing too it seems almost as if i had come home he closed his eyes and laid his head back allie placed her hand upon his forehead and held it there for a moment before she moved away it was a cool and tranquilizing palm and he wished she would hold it there for a long time so that he could sleep forget allie briskow went to her room and there she studied her reflection in the mirror carefully deliberately before saying you can do it youve got to do it for hes hurt when a girl is hurt like that it makes a woman of her but when a mans hurt it makes him a little boy i i guess it pays to keep on praying it was perhaps a half hour later that ma briskow heard a sound that caused her to rise upon her elbow and listen with astonishment it was the sound of low indistinct but joyous singing it came from allies room allie singing again what could have happened slowly mas face became wistful eager oh mister fairy king she whispered please build up his castle again you can do it theres magic in the world make him a duke again an her a queen for yours is the power an the glory for ever an ever amen the end
