bens nugget or a boys search for fortune chapter i the mountaincabin whats the news ben you didnt happen to bring an evenin paper did you the speaker was a tall loosejointed man dressed as a miner in a garb that appeared to have seen considerable service his beard was long and untrimmed and on his head he wore a mexican sombrero this was jake bradley a rough but goodhearted miner who was stretched carelessly upon the ground in front of a rude hut crowning a high eminence in the heart of the sierra nevada mountains ben stanton whom he addressed was a boy of sixteen with a pleasant face and a manly bearing no jake he answered with a smile i didnt meet a newsboy there aint many in this neighborhood i reckon said bradley i tell you ben id give an ounce of dust for a new york or boston paper who knows what may have happened since weve been confined here in this lonely mountainhut uncle sam may have gone to war for aught we know prhaps the british may be bombarding new york this moment i guess not said ben smiling i dont think it likely myself said bradley filling his pipe still there may be some astonishin news if we could only get hold of it i dont think we can complain jake said ben turning to a pleasanter subject weve made considerable money out of mr deweys claim thats so the three weeks weve spent here havent been thrown away by a long chalk we shall be pretty well paid for accommodatin dick dewey by stayin and takin care of him how much golddust do you think were got mr bradley what exclaimed bradley taking the pipe from his mouth hadnt you better call me the honorable mr bradley and done with it dont you feel acquainted with me yet that you put the handle on to my name excuse me jake said ben thats what i meant to say but i was thinking of mr dewey and thats how i happened to call you mister thats a different matter dicks got a kind of dignity so that it seems natural to call him mister but as for me im jake bradley not a bad sort of fellow but i dont wear storecloes and id rather be called jake by them as know me well all right jake but you havent answered my question what about the golddust oh yes well i should say that the dust weve got out must be worth nigh on to five hundred dollars so much as that asked ben his eyes sparkling yes all of that that claim of deweys is a splendid one and no mistake i think we ought to pay him a commission for allowing us to work it i think so too jake they were sitting outside the rude hut which had been roughly put together on the summit of the mountain the door was open and what they said could be heard by the occupant who was stretched on a hard pallet in one corner of the cabin come in you two he called out sartin dick said bradley and he entered the cabin followed by ben what was that you were saying just now asked richard dewey tell him ben said bradley jake was saying that we ought to pay you a commission on the golddust we took from your claim mr dewey said our hero for that is bens position in our story why should you asked dewey because its yours you found it and you ought to get some good of it so i have jake in the first place i got a thousand dollars out of it before i fell sick that is sprained my ankle but you aint gettin anything out of it now i think i am said dewey smiling and looking gratefully at his two friends i am getting the care and attention of two faithful friends who will see that i do not suffer while i am laid up in this lonely hut we dont want to be paid for that dick i know that bradley but i dont call it paying you to let you work the claim which i dont intend to work myself but you would work it if you were well no i wouldnt answered dewey with energy i would leave this place instantly and take the shortest path to san francisco to see the gal that sent us out after you yes but jake suppose you call her the young lady of course you mustnt mind me dick i dont know much about manners i was raised kind of rough and never had no chance to learn politeness ben here knows ten times as much as i do about how to behave among fashionable folks i dont know about that jake said ben i was brought up in the country and i know precious little about fashionable folks oh well you know how to talk besides didnt you bring out miss douglas from the states she brought me said ben it seems to me we are wandering from the subject said dewey it was a piece of good luck for me when you two happened upon this cabin where i lay helpless with no one to look after me but ki sing ki sing took pretty good care of you for a haythen said bradley so he did he is a good fellow if he is a chinaman and far more grateful than many of his white brothers but i was sighing for the sight of one of my own color who would understand my wants better than that poor fellow faithful as he is i reckon the news we brought you helped you some dick said jake bradley yes it put fresh life into me to learn that florence douglas my own dear florence had come out to this distant coast to search for me but i tell you jake its rather tantalizing to think that she is waiting for me in san francisco while i am tied by the ankle to this lonely cabin so many miles away it wont be for long now dick said bradley you feel a good deal better dont you yes my ankle is much stronger than it was yesterday i walked about the cabin and even went out of doors i felt rather tired afterward but it didnt hurt me all you want is a little patience dick you mustnt get up too soon a sprain is worse than a break so ive often heard i cant say i know from experience i hope you wont its a very trying experience as i can testify youd get well quicker if we had some doctors stuff to put on it but i reckon anyhow youll be out in a week or ten days i hope so if i could only write to florence and let her know where and how i am i wouldnt mind so much the waiting dont worry about her shes in frisco where nothing cant happen to her said bradley whose loose grammar i cannot recommend my young readers to imitate i am not sure about that her guardian might find out where she is and follow her even to san francisco if i were on the spot he could do no harm i tell you dick that gal excuse me i mean that young lady is a smart one and i reckon she can get ahead of her guardian if she wants to ben here told me how she circumvented him at the astor house over in york shell hold her own agin him even if he does track her to frisco some of my readers may desire to know more about dewey and his two friends and i will sketch for their benefit the events to which bradley referred florence douglas was the ward of the albany merchant john campbell who by the terms of her fathers will was entrusted with the care of her large property till she had attained the age of twentyfive a period nearly a year distant mr campbell anxious to secure his wards large property for his son sought to induce florence to marry the said son but this she distinctly declined to do irritated and disappointed mr campbell darkly intimated that should her opposition continue he would procure from two pliant physicians a certificate of her insanity and have her confined in that most terrible of prisons a madhouse the fear that he would carry his threat into execution nerved florence to a bold movement being mistress of a fortune of thirty thousand dollars left by her mother she had funds enough for her purpose she fled to new york where chance made her acquainted with our hero ben stanton under whose escort she safely reached san francisco paying bens expenses in return for his protection arrived in san francisco she furnished ben with the necessary funds to seek out richard dewey to whom without her guardians knowledge she was privately betrothed and inform him of her presence in california after a series of adventures ben and his companion had found dewey laid up with a sprained ankle in a rude hut high up among the mountains he had met with an accident while successfully working a rich claim near by of course richard dewey was overjoyed to meet friends of his own race who could provide for him better than his faithful attendant ki sing as he could not yet leave the spot he offered to ben and bradley the privilege of working his claim in the next chapter i will briefly explain bens position and the object which brought him to california and then we shall be able to proceed with our story chapter ii the missing chinaman if florence douglas was an heiress our young hero ben stanton was likewise possessed of property though his inheritance was not a very large one when his fathers estate was settled it was found that it amounted to three hundred and sixtyfive dollars though rather a large sum in bens eyes he was quite aware that the interest of this amount would not support him accordingly being ambitious he drew from his uncle job stanton a worthy shoemaker the sum of seventyfive dollars and went to new york hoping to obtain employment in this he was disappointed but he had the good fortune to meet miss florence douglas by whom he was invited to accompany her to california as her escort his expenses of course being paid by his patroness it is needless to say that ben accepted this proposal with alacrity and embarking on a steamer landed in less than a month at san francisco he did not remain here long but started for the miningdistricts still employed by miss douglas in search of richard dewey her affianced husband whom her guardian had forbidden her to marry as we have already said ben and his chosen companion jake bradley succeeded in their mission but as yet had been unable to communicate tidings of their success to miss douglas there being no chance to send a letter to san francisco from the lonely hut where they were at present living besides carrying out the wishes of his patroness ben intended to try his hand at mining and had employed the interval of three weeks since he discovered mr dewey in working the latters claim with the success already referred to the time when the two friends are introduced to the reader is at the close of the day when fatigued by their work on the claim they are glad to rest and chat mr bradley has a pipe in his mouth and evidently takes considerable comfort in his evening smoke i wish i had a pipe for you ben he said you dont know how it rests me to smoke ill take your word for it jake returned ben smiling wont you take a whiff you dont know how soothin it is i dont need to be soothed jake im glad you enjoy it but i dont envy you a particle well praps youre right ben our old doctor used to say smokin wasnt good for boys but ive smoked more or less since i was twelve years old theres something id like better than smoking just now said ben whats that eating supper just so i wonder where that heathen ki sing is ki sing was cook and general servant to the little party and performed his duties in a very satisfactory manner better than either ben or bradley could have done and left his white employers freer to work at the more congenial occupation of searching for gold ki sing is unusually late said richard dewey i wonder what can have detained him i am beginning to feel hungry myself the heathen is usually on time said bradley though he hasnt got a watch any more than i have dick what time is it halfpast six answered richard dewey who though a miner had not been willing to dispense with all the appliances of civilization maybe ki sing has found another place suggested ben jocosely he is faithful i will vouch for that said dewey i am more afraid that he has met with some accident like mine for instance you wont catch a chinaman spraining his ankle said bradley theyre too spry for that theyll squeeze through where a white man cant and i wouldnt wonder if they could turn themselves inside out if they tried hard it is possible suggested dewey that ki sing may have met with some of our own race who have treated him roughly you know the strong prejudice that is felt against the poor fellows by some who are far less deserving than they they think it good sport to torment a chinaman i cant say i like em much myself said bradley but i dont mind saying that ki sing is a gentleman he is the best heathen i know of and if i should come across any fellow harmin him i reckon id be ready to take a hand myself we couldnt get along very well without him jake said ben thats where youre right ben hes made himself useful to us and no mistake i have reason to feel indebted to him said dewey injured as i was i should have fared badly but for his faithful services i am not at all sure that i should have been living at this moment had not the grateful fellow cared for me and supplied my wants it may be explained here that richard dewey had at one time rescued ki sing from some rough companions who had made up their minds to cut off the chinamans queue thereby in accordance with chinese custom preventing him ever returning to his native country it was the thought of this service that had prompted ki sing to faithful service when he found his benefactor in need of it half an hour passed and still the chinaman did not appear all three became anxious especially dewey bradley said he would you mind going out to look for ki sing im sure something has happened to him just what i was thinkin of myself said bradley ill go and ill bring him back if hes above ground ill go with you jake said ben rising from the ground on which he was seated youd better stay with dick dewey said bradley maybe hell want you i forgot that yes i will stay no i would rather you would go with bradley said the invalid two will stand a better chance of success than one i shant need anything while you are away just as you say dick well ben lets start along i reckon well find ki sing before long and then well have some supper as the two started on their errand richard dewey breathed a sigh of relief i really believe im getting attached to ki sing he said to himself hes a good fellow if he is a chinaman and if ever i am prosperous i will take him into my service and see that he is comfortably provided for the poor chinaman though dewey did not suspect it was at that moment in a very uncomfortable position indeed and he himself was menaced by a peril already near at hand against which his helpless condition allowed of no defence his lonely and monotonous life was destined to be varied that evening in an unpleasant manner chapter iii two gentlemen of the road perhaps two hours earlier two horsemen might have been seen riding slowly over a lower slope of the mountain the horses they bestrode were of the mexican breed or in common parlance mustangs they were themselves dressed in mexican style and bore a strong resemblance to bandits as we are apt to picture them these gentlemen were bill mosely and tom hadley hailing originally from missouri but not reflecting any particular credit on their native state they were in fact adventurers having a strong objection to honest work and a decided preference for gaining a living by unlawful means the very horses they bestrode were stolen having once belonged to jake bradley and ben stanton the circumstances under which they were stolen will be remembered by readers of the young explorer beastly place this tom said bill mosely with a strong expression of disgust i should say so answered hadley who was wont by this phrase to echo the sentiments expressed by his companion and leader i wouldnt have come up here if it had proved safe to stay lower down continued bill mosely that last man we relieved of his golddust might prove troublesome if we should fall in with him again eh tom i should say so remarked mr hadley in a tone of sincere conviction i should like to see him when he wakes up and finds his bag of dust missing said mosely with a laugh as he spoke he drew from his pocket a goodsized bag which appeared to be nearly full of dust there must be several hundred dollars worth there he said complacently he expected to hear hadley answer in his usual style but was disappointed when are we going to divide asked hadley with an expression of interest not unmingled with anxiety youd better let me carry it tom its all the same i should say so no i would prefer to take charge of my part said hadley or at least to carry the bag part of the time bill mosely frowned darkly and he brought his hand near the pocket in which he carried his pistol hadley he said sternly do you doubt my honor i should say not answered tom hadley in a dissatisfied tone bringing out the last word after a slight pause but i dont see why i shouldnt carry the bag part of the time had you doubted my honor continued mosely with a grand air though you are my friend i should have been compelled to take your life i never take any back talk i chaw up any one who insults me im a regular outandout desperado i am when im riled ive heard all that before said tom hadley rather impatiently it was quite true for this was the style in which bill mosely was accustomed to address new acquaintances it had not succeeded with jake bradley who had enough knowledge of human nature to detect the falsity of moselys pretensions and the sham character of his valor youve heard it before said mosely severely but aint it true thats what i ask you tom hadley i should say so slipped out almost unconsciously from the lips of the habitual echo tis well said mosely waving his hand you know it and you believe it im a bad man to insult i am i generally chaw up them that stand in my way tom hadley was really a braver man than mosely and he answered obstinately give me half that golddust or ill take it bill mosely saw his determined face and felt that it was necessary to back down i dont know why i dont shoot you he said trying to keep up his air of domination because two can play at that game said hadley doggedly he produced a pouch and bill mosely much against his will was compelled to divide the contents of the stolen bag managing however to retain the larger share himself i dont want to quarrel with a friend said bill more mildly but you dont act friendly today its all right now said hadley satisfied maybe you think i dont want to act fair continued mosely in an injured tone why the very horse you are riding is a proof to the contrary i didnt ask for both horses did i you couldnt ride both answered tom hadley with practical good sense i wonder where the fellows are we took them from said mosely with a change of subject the man was a regular fireeater i wouldnt like to meet him again i should say so chimed in hadley emphatically bradley had paid mosely in his own coin and boasted of his prowess even more extravagantly than that braggadocio claiming to have killed from seventy to eighty men in the course of his experience mosely had been taken in by his confident tone and knowing that he was himself a sham desperado though a genuine thief and highwayman had been made to feel uneasy while in bradleys company i wonder what became of them continued mosely thoughtfully as tom hadleys special phrase could not come in here appropriately he forbore to make any remark he thought he would scare me by his fierce talk said mosely who would hardly have spoken so confidently had he known that bradley was only two miles distant from him at that identical moment it takes a good deal to scare a man like me eh tom i should say so returned hadley but it was noticeable that he spoke rather dubiously and not with his usual positiveness im a hard man to handle continued mosely complacently relapsing into the style of talk which he most enjoyed im as bad as they make em i should say so chimed in tom hadley and there was nothing doubtful in his tone now bill mosely looked at him as if he suspected there was something suspicious under this speech but tom hadley wore his usual look and his companion dismissed his momentary doubt you never saw me afraid of any living man eh tom i should say so answered hadley there was something equivocal in this speech and bill mosely looked vexed cant you say anything but that he grumbled it looks as if you doubted my statement no man doubt my word and lives tom hadley merely shrugged his shoulders he was not a man of brilliant intellectual ability or of rare penetration but there were times when even he was led to suspect that his companion was a humbug yet mosely had greater force of character and took uncommon pains to retain his ascendency over his more simpleminded companion and had in the main been successful though in the matter of the golddust he had been obliged to score a defeat as hadley did not see fit to express any doubt of this last statement bill mosely was content to let the matter drop assuming that he had gained a victory and recovered his ascendency over his echo they had met no one for some hours and did not look for an encounter with anything wearing the semblance of humanity when all at once tom hadley uttered an exclamation what is it tom asked mosely look there was the only answer as hadley with outstretched finger pointed to a chinaman walking slowly up the hill its a heathen chinee exclaimed mosely with animation i should say so echoed hadley mosely urged his mustang to greater speed and soon overtook ki sing for it was richard deweys attendant whom the two adventurers had fallen in with chapter iv ki sing in the hands of the enemy ki sing turned when he heard the sound of horses feet for in that mountainsolitude such a sound was unusual he was not reassured by the appearance of the two men whose intention seemed to be to overtake him and he turned aside from the path with the intention of getting out of the way stop there you heathen called bill mosely in his fiercest tone ki sing halted and an expression of uneasiness came over his broad flat face what are you doing here you chinese loafer ki sing did not exactly comprehend this speech but answered mildly how do melican man how do echoed bill mosely laughing rather boisterously tom the heathen wants to know how i do well heathen im sos to be around and wouldnt mind chawing up a dozen chinamen where do you live up mountain answered ki sing which way the chinaman pointed in the right direction what do you do for a living wait on melican man cookee washee so you are a servant to a white man john yes john dont you call me john you yellow mummy im not one of your countrymen i reckon what do you say to that tom the fellows gettin familiar i should say so remarked tom hadley with his usual originality whats the name of the melican man you work for continued mosely after a slight pause dickee dewee answered ki sing repeating the familiar name applied by bradley to the invalid the name seemed still more odd as the chinaman pronounced it well hes got a queer name thats all i can say continued mosely whats your name ki sing ki sing hows mrs ki sing asked mosely who was disposed like the cat to play with his victim before turning and rending him me got no wifee said the chinaman stolidly then youre in the market do you want to marry me no want to mally so much the worse for the ladies well as to this dickee as you call him what does he do he sick lie down on bedee hes sick is he whats the matter with him fall down and hurt leggee oh that was it what did he do before he hurt himself dig gold bill mosely became more interested did he find much gold he asked eagerly yes muchee answered ki sing unsuspiciously does he keep it with him bill mosely betrayed a little too much interest when he asked this question and the chinaman hitherto unsuspicious became on his guard why you wantee know he asked shrewdly do you dare give me any of your back talk you yellow heathen exclaimed mosely angrily answer my question or ill chaw you up in lessn a minute what you ask said ki sing innocently you know well enough where does this dickee keep the gold he found before he met with an accident he no tellee me answered ki sing this might be true so that mosely did not feel sure that the chinamans ignorance was feigned still he resolved to push the inquiry in the hope of eliciting some information that might be of value for already a plan had come into his mind which was in accordance with his general character and reputation that of relieving the invalid of his hoard of golddust where do you think he keeps the gold john he asked mildly ki sing looked particularly vacant as he expressed his ignorance on this subject has he got a cabin up there asked mosely yes and how far might it be long way answered ki sing who wished to divert mosely from the plan which the faithful servant could see he had in view bill mosely was keen enough to understand the chinamans meaning and answered long or not i will go and see your master i am a doctor he added winking to hadley and perhaps i can help him aint i a doctor tom i should say so answered hadley whose respect for truth did not interfere with his corroborating in his usual style anything which his companion saw fit to assert ki sing did not express any opinion on the subject of bill moselys medical pretensions though he was quite incredulous lead the way john said mosely where me go asked the chinaman innocently go go to the cabin where your master lives and that by the shortest path do you hear yes ki sing however still faithful to the man who had befriended him in the hour of danger did not direct his course toward richard deweys cabin but guided the two adventurers in a different direction the course he took was a circuitous one taking him no farther away from the cabin but encircling the summit and drawing no nearer to it he hoped that the two men whose purpose he suspected was not honest nor friendly would become tired and would give up the quest he did not however understand the perseverance of mosely when he felt that he was on the scent of gold finally mosely spoke john he said is the cabin near by ki sing shook his head long way he answered how did you happen to get so far away from it then i should like to know and he examined the face of his guide sharply but ki sings broad face seemed utterly void of expression as neglecting to answer the question he reiterated his statement housee long way the mans a fool tom said mosely turning to his companion i should say so was all the help he got from hadley do you know what i mean to do hadley here you yellow mummy go a little ahead the chinaman did so theres a bonanza up there in that cabin wherever it is the chinaman says that this man with the queer name had got out a good deal of gold before he met with an accident broke his leg likely well it stands to reason hes got the gold now there aint no chance here of sendin off the dust and of course hes got it hid somewhere in his cabin do you see the point tom i should say so and i should say so too it strikes me as a particularly good chance this man is disabled and helpless he cant prevent us walking off with his gold can he suppose he wont tell us where it is suggested tom hadley with extraordinary mental acuteness why well knock him on the head or put a bullet in him hadley its a pity if two fireeaters like us cant tackle a man with a broken leg what do you say i should say so fifteen minutes more passed and they seemed to be getting no nearer their destination at any rate no cabin was in sight ki sing only answered when interrogated long way hadley said bill mosely i begin to believe that heathens misleading us what do you say i should say so then ill attend to his case here you heathen whatee want bill mosely sprang from his mustang seized ki sing and in spite of howls with hadleys assistance tied him to a small tree with a strong cord he had in his pocket that disposes of you my friend he said mounting his mustang i think we shall find the cabin better without you the two men rode off leaving poor ki sing in what appeared considering the loneliness of the spot to be hopeless captivity chapter v further adventures of bill mosely bill mosley and his companion pushed on after leaving the poor chinaman tied to the tree the yellow heathen may starve for all i care said mosely carelessly its all his own fault why didnt he speak up like a man and tell me what i wanted to know i should say so chimed in tom hadley the question is now whereabouts is that cabin we are in search of hadley appeared to have no idea and no suggestion to offer it strikes me it must be somewhere near the top of the mountain said mosely what do you say i should say so then well take the shortest way to the summit i tell you tom were on the track of something rich well take all this fellows golddust and he cant help himself itll be richer than any claim weve worked yet if it pans out as well as i expect eh tom i should say so bill answered hadley with an expression of interest i tell you tom said bill mosely complacently you were in luck when you fell in with me weve done pretty well since we jined hosses pard i should say so but added hadley after a pause it would go hard with us if we got caught we dont mean to get caught said mosely promptly as for this new job theres no danger in it this man is down with a broken leg and he cant help our taking his gold the chinamans out of the way and weve got a clear field take a good look tom for your eyes are better than mine and tell me if you see anything that looks like a cabin anywhere around this inquiry was made some twenty minutes after they had left ki sing they had pursued a circuitous course or in half the time they might have been as near the cabin as they now were tom hadley didnt answer in his customary phrase but instead raised himself erect on his mustang and looked sharply about him well demanded mosely impatiently i dont see anything that looks like a cabin said hadley deliberately but i think i see smoke where asked his companion in an eager tone there said tom hadley pointing with his whip in a particular direction mosely strained his eyes but he was a trifle nearsighted and could see nothing i cant see anything he said but that proves nothing if theres smoke theres a house theres no question about that and theres not likely to be more than one cabin about here steer in the direction of the smoke tom and ill follow in your tracks my horse is getting tired hell be glad to rest for the night will it be safe queried hadley safe enough the chinaman is disposed of and as for this brokenlegged dewey well bind him fast and set him outside of the cabin while we make ourselves comfortable within i shall be sorry to inconvenience him but when a man has company he must expect to be put out eh tom i should say so bill the two worthy gentlemen kept on their way till making a sudden turn the house which had hitherto been concealed from them by a cliff stood plainly revealed there it is tom cried mosely joyfully weve found it in spite of that lying heathen it seems good to see a house after wandering about for weeks without a chance to sleep under a roof eh tom i should say so bill it will be observed that mr william mosely was fond of designating ki sing as a heathen evidently appreciating his own superiority as a christian yet i am inclined to think that a heathen like the chinaman possessed more moral worth than a dozen christians of the type of mosely from youth he had preyed upon the community and his aim had been to get a living in any way that did not involve labor honesty was an obsolete word in his vocabulary and a successful theft yielded him a satisfaction such as other men derive from the consciousness of welldoing in fact moselys moral nature was warped and there was very little chance of his reformation now that the cabin was near at hand the two men did not quicken their speed for the ascent was somewhat steep and their animals were tired take it easy tom the whole things in our hands wonder whether deweys expectin visitors he added chuckling i say hadley hell be glad to see us dont you think so i should say so returned hadley before the joke dawned upon him you see we are going to relieve him of the care of that golddust of his were two bankers from frisco thats what we are and well take care of all the golddust we can take in i shall want my half said tom hadley unexpectedly deviating from his customary formula mosely shrugged his shoulders he did not quite like this new disposition of hadleys to look after his own interests but at present did not think it politic to say much about it though tom hadley had generally been subservient to him he knew very well that if any difficulty should arise between them tom would be a formidable antagonist fortunately for him hadley did not know his own power or he would not have remained in subjection to a man whom he could have overcome had he been so disposed he did not fully believe bill moselys ridiculous boasts of his own prowess but he was nevertheless disposed to overrate the man who made so many pretensions all he asked was a fair share of the booty which the two together managed to secure and this he had made up his mind to have they reached the cabin at last and halted their horses before the door both sprang off and bill mosely with a sign to his companion to remain in charge of them entered at the open door is that you ki sing asked dewey whose face was turned toward the wall bill mosely could not tell from the way he lay on the pallet covered with a blanket whether his leg were broken or not but believed that this was the case that doesnt happen to be my name stranger he answered richard dewey turned suddenly on his low bed and fixed his eyes on the intruder who are you what do you want he demanded suspiciously i thought id come round and make you a call being in the neighborhood answered mosely with a smile who are you well im not the president of the united states nor i aint queen victoria as i know of said mosely you look more like a horsethief said richard dewey bluntly do you mean to insult me exclaimed bill mosely fiercely do you know who i am dewey was not easily frightened and he answered coolly you havent told me yet well im bill mosely from the state of missouri im a regular tearer i am i dont take no back talk when a man insults me i kill him very well now i know who you are said richard dewey calmly now what do you want how much golddust have you in this cabin we may as well come to business none at all i know better you cant pull wool over my eyes your chinaman tells a different story ha have you seen ki sing asked dewey interested at last yes i had the pleasure of meeting the heathen you refer to where is he now can you tell me to the best of my knowledge he is tied to a tree a mile or so from here i dont think he will get away very easily scoundrel you shall answer for this exclaimed richard dewey springing to his feet and thereby showing that neither of his legs was broken chapter vi an unequal contest bill mosely was decidedly startled when the man whom he thought helpless sprang up so suddenly and approached him in a menacing manner he rose precipitately from the rude seat on which he had settled himself comfortably his face wearing an expression of alarm richard dewey paused and confronted him a frown was on his face and he appeared very much in earnest in the question he next asked have you dared to illtreat my servant you scoundrel he demanded look here stranger said mosely with a faint attempt at bluster youd better take care what you say to me im a bad man i am i dont doubt it said dewey contemptuously this was not altogether satisfactory to bill mosely though it expressed confidence in the truth of his statement you havent answered my question continued dewey what have you done with my servant perhaps he wasnt your servant said bill mosely evasively there is but one chinaman in this neighborhood said richard dewey impatiently and he is my faithful servant did you tie him to a tree he was impudent to me answered bill mosely uneasily ki sing is never impudent to any one returned dewey his eyes flashing with anger tell me what you did with him or i will fell you to the ground i didnt harm him said bill mosely hastily i wanted to teach him a lesson that is all and so you tied him to a tree did you yes then go back and release him instantly or it will be the worse for you i would go with you to make sure that you did so but my ankle is weak where did you leave him a little way down the hill then go at once and release him if you fail to do it some day i shall meet you again and i will make you bitterly repent it all right stranger make your mind easy bill mosely turned to leave the cabin and richard dewey threw himself down on the pallet once more but mosely had no intention of letting the matter rest there had he been alone he would not have ventured on any further conflict with dewey who invalid as he was had shown so much spirit but he felt considerable confidence in his companion who was strong and powerful he approached tom hadley and whispered in his ear tom nodded his head and the two stealthily approached the entrance again and reentered the cabin richard dewey had laid himself down on the pallet thinking that bill mosely had gone about his business when tom hadley who had been assigned to this duty by his more timid companion threw himself upon the invalid and overpowered him perhaps youll insult a gentleman again exclaimed mosely tauntingly as he stood by and witnessed the ineffectual struggles of toms victim who had been taken at disadvantage heres the cord tom tie his hands and feet youre contemptible cowards exclaimed dewey it takes two of you to overpower a sick man you dont look very sick said mosely tauntingly i have sprained my ankle or i would defy both of you talks cheap retorted bill mosely what is your object in this outrageous assault upon a stranger demanded dewey well tell you presently answered mosely now tie his feet tom be careful of my ankle it is sore and sensitive said dewey addressing himself to tom hadley you need not tie me further in my present condition i am no match for you both tell me why it is you have chosen to attack a man who has never harmed you tom hadley looked to mosely to answer ill tell you what we want dewey if that is your name said the superior rascal we want that golddust youve got hidden about here somewhere who told you i had any golddust inquired the invalid your servant he let it out without thinking but when we wanted him to guide us here he wouldnt thats why we left him tied to a tree isnt it tom i should say so poor fellow i am glad to hear he was faithful even when he found himself in the power of two such ruffians as you look here dewey dont give us any of your back talk it aint safe eh tom i should say so bill i intend to express my opinion of you and your villainous conduct said dewey undaunted whatever you choose to call it so ki sing wouldnt guide you here no he led us round in a circle when we found it out we settled his hash pretty quick like cowards as you were are we going to stand this tom asked bill fiercely tom hadley shrugged his shoulder he did not enjoy what bill mosely called back talk as well as his partner and it struck him as so much waste of time he wanted to come to business and said briefly wheres the gold yes dewey let us know what you have done with your gold so you are thieves you two i should say so interjected tom hadley youre a fool ejaculated bill mosely frowning what makes you give yourself away because said hadley bluntly we are thieves or we wouldnt be after this mans gold that aint the way to put it said bill mosely who shrank from accepting the title to which his actions entitled him were bankers from frisco and we are going to take care of deweys gold as he aint in a situation to take care of it himself you are very kind said dewey who embarrassing as his position was rather enjoyed the humor of the situation so you are a banker and your friend a thief i believe i have more respect for the thief who openly avows his objects tom if that is your name i am sorry that you are not in a better business that man is wholly bad but i believe you could lead an honest life tom hadley said nothing but he looked thoughtful his life had been a lawless one but he was not the thoroughgoing scoundrel that bill mosely was and would have been glad if circumstances had favored a more creditable mode of life were wastin time dewey said bill mosely wheres the golddust sure you know i have it i leave you to find it for yourself answered the sick man who was never lacking for courage and did not tremble though wholly in the power of these men what shall we do tom asked mosely hunt for the gold suggested tom hadley if mosely had judged it of any use to threaten dewey he would have done so hoping to force him to reveal the hidingplace of the gold but the undaunted spirit thus far displayed by his victim convinced him that the attempt would be unsuccessful he therefore proceeded with the help of his companion to search the hut the floor was of earth and he occupied himself in digging down into it considering that the most likely place of concealment for the treasure richard dewey watched the work going on in silence if only ben and bradley would come back he said to himself i should soon be free of these rascals they wont find the gold where they are looking but i neednt tell them that chapter vii tied to a tree when ben and his friend bradley left the cabin in search of ki sing they were puzzled to fix upon the direction in which it was best to go there was no particular reason to decide in favor of any one against the others shall we separate jake or shall we go together asked ben i think we had better stick together ben otherwise if one succeeds he wont have any way of letting the other know thats true besides we may need each others help added bradley you mean in case ki sing has met with an accident well no i dont exactly mean that ben perhaps said ben laughing you think two pairs of eyes better than one thats true ben but you havent caught my idea then suppose you catch it for me and give me the benefit of it i think said bradley not smiling at this sally of bens that our chinese friend has fallen in with some rough fellows who have done him harm i hope not said ben sobered by this suggestion so do i ki sing is a good fellow if he is a heathen and id like to scalp the man that illtreats him there are not many travellers among these mountains no but there are some some men are always pulling up stakes and looking for better claims besides we are here and why shouldnt others come here as well that is so i think ben well keep along in this direction said bradley indicating a path on the eastern slope of the hill i havent any particular reason for it but ive got a sort of idea that this is the right way all right jake i will be guided by you i hope youre mistaken about ki sings fate why couldnt he have fallen and sprained his ankle like mr dewey of course he could but it isnt likely he has why not because chinamen i have always noticed are cautious and supple they are some like cats they fall on their feet they are not rash like white men but know better how to take care of their lives and limbs thats why i dont think ki sing has tumbled down or hurt himself in any way of course he wouldnt leave us without notice said ben musingly certainly not that isnt ki sings way hes faithful to dick dewey and wont leave him as long as dick is laid up i never had much idea of chinamen before and i dont know as i have now but ki sing is a good fellow whatever you may say of his countrymen theyre not all honest i was once robbed by a chinaman but ill bet something on ki sing he might have robbed dick when he was helpless and dependent before we came along but he didnt do it there are plenty of white men you couldnt say that of for instance the gentlemen who stole our horses it makes me mad whenever i think of that little transaction said bradley as for that braggart mosely hell come to grief some of these days hell probably die with his boots on and his feet some way from the ground before that happens id like a little whack at him myself i owe him a debt too said ben his running off with my mustang cost me a good many weary hours but hark whats that said ben suddenly whats what i thought i heard a cry where away to the left jake bradley halted and inclined his ear to listen ben said he looking up i believe were on the scent that cry came either from a chinaman or a cat ben couldnt help laughing in spite of the apprehensions which the words of his companion suggested let us push on then he said three minutes later the two came in sight of poor ki sing chafing in his forced captivity and making ineffectual attempts to release himself from his confinement thats he sure enough exclaimed jake bradley excited the poor fellows regularly treed the chinaman had not yet seen the approach of his friends for he happened to be looking in another direction ki sing called ben an expression of relief and joy overspread the countenance of the unfortunate captive when he saw our hero and bradley how came you here ki sing asked bradley did you tie yourself to the tree no no replied the chinaman earnestly velly bad men tie ki sing how many of them bad men were there queried bradley two thats one apiece for us ben said bradley there a job ahead for us at the same time he busied himself in cutting the cord that confined the poor chinaman to the tree and ki sing with an expression of great relief and contentment stretched his limbs and chafed his wrists and ankles which were sore from the cutting of the cord now ki sing tell us a little more about them men what did they look like the chinaman in the best english he had at command described the two men who had perpetrated the outrage did you hear either of them call the other by name inquired bradley one billee the other tommee answered ki sing who remembered the way in which they addressed each other why those are the names of the men who stole our horses said ben in surprise thats so exclaimed bradley in excitement it would be just like them scamps to tie up a poor fellow like ki sing i say ki did them fellows have horses yes answered the chinaman i believe theyre the very fellows cried bradley i hope they are for theres a chance of overhauling them why did they tie you ki sing ki sing explained that they had tried to induce him to guide them to richard deweys cabin but that he was sure they wanted to steal his gold and he had led them astray thats the sort of fellow ki sing is said bradley nodding to ben you see he wouldnt betray his master so they tie me to tlee continued the poor fellow i thought i stay here all night you didnt take us into the account ki sing when these scoundrels left you where did they go ki sing pointed and you think they went in search of the cabin yes they say so did they know we were there ben and i no me only say dickee dewey did you say that dewey was sick yes it is clear said bradley turning to ben that them rascals were bent on mischief from what ki sing told them they concluded that dewey would be unable to resist them and that they would have a soft thing stealing his golddust they may have found the cabin and be at work there now suggested ben so they may answered bradley hastily what a fool i am to be chattering here when dick may be in danger stir your stumps ki sing were goin back to the cabin as fast as our legs can carry us i only hope well be in time to catch the scoundrels not without anxiety the three friends retraced their steps toward the little mountainhut which was at present their only home chapter viii turning the tables when the three friends came in view of the cabin the first sight which attracted their attention was the two mustangs who stood in patient enjoyment of the rest they so much needed just outside their unlawful owners as we know were engaged inside in searching for golddust without the slightest apprehension or expectation of interference thats my mustang exclaimed bradley in a tone of suppressed excitement i never looked to lay eyes on him again but thank the lord the thief has walked into a trap which i didnt set for him well have a reckoning and that pretty soon how do you know its your mustang asked ben theres a white spot on the left flank the other ones yours i know it by his make though i cant lay hold of any sign even if i didnt know him his bein in company with mine makes it stand to reason that it belongs to you i shall be glad to have it again said ben but we may have a tussle for them im ready said jake bradley grimly by this time they had come to a halt to consider the situation i dont hear anything said bradley listening intently i expect the skunks must be inside pray heaven they havent harmed poor dewey just then deweys voice was heard and they were so near that they could distinguish his words well gentlemen he said how are you getting on have you found anything yet no curse it responded mosely suppose you give us a hint thank you but i dont see how thats going to benefit me if you find the money you mean to take it dont you i should say so answered tom hadley frankly richard dewey smiled i commend your frankness he said well you cant expect a man to assist in robbing himself can you youre mighty cool growled bill mosely on the contrary my indignation is very warm i assure you look here dewey said mosely pausing im goin to make you a proposition go on of course we shall find this golddust of yours but its rather hard and troublesome work so ill tell you what well do if youll tell us where to find it well leave a third of it for you thatll be square wont it one part for me one for my pard and one for you what do you say that you are very kind to allow me a third of what belongs wholly to me but even if i should think this a profitable arrangement to enter into how am i to feel secure against your carrying off all of the treasure you can trust to the honor of a gentleman laid mr william mosely pompously meaning you asked dewey with a laugh meaning me of course and when perhaps for myself perhaps for my pard also eh tom i should say so bill ive heard theres honor among thieves said dewey smiling and this appears to be an illustration of it well gentlemen im sorry to say i dont feel that confidence in your honor or your word which would justify me in accepting your kind proposal do you doubt my word blustered mosely i feel no doubt on the subject answered dewey i accept your apology said mosely its lucky you made it me and my friend dont stand no insults we dont take no back talk were bad men when we get into a scrimmage eh tom i dont doubt your word in the least said dewey it gives me pleasure to assent cordially to the description you give of yourselves tom hadley who was rather obtuse took this as a compliment but mosely was not altogether clear whether dewey was not chaffing them that sounds all right said he suspiciously if you mean it oh set your mind quite at rest on that subject bill if that is your name you may be sure that i mean everything i say then you wont give us a hint where to dig i am sorry to disoblige you but i really couldnt do you hear that ben said jake bradley his mouth distended with a grin dicks chaffin them scoundrels and they cant see it it looks as if they was huntin for the golddust they havent found anything yet and they havent hurt dick or he wouldnt talk as cool as he does there was a brief conference and then the first movement was made by the besiegingparty ki sing by bradleys direction walked to the entrance of the hut and looked placidly in as mosely looked up he saw the chinamans face looking like a full moon and for an instant he was stupefied he could not conceive how his victim could have escaped from his captivity tom he ejaculated pointing to the doorway look there i should say so ejaculated tom hadley no less surprised than his friend how did you get here demanded bill mosely addressing the chinaman me walk up hill answered ki sing with a bland smile how did you get away from the tree thats what i mean you stupid fliend come along cut stling answered the chinaman pronouncing his words in mongolian fashion bill mosely was startled so ki sing had a friend was the friend with him where is your friend he asked abruptly that my fliend said the crafty ki sing pointing to his master on the pallet in the corner yes ki sing said dewey we are friends and will remain so my good fellow though he did not quite understand why ben and jake bradley did not present themselves he felt sure that they were close at hand and that his unwelcome visitors would very soon find it getting hot for them look here you yellow baboon said bill mosely angrily you know what i mean this man here didnt free you from the tree anyway you were a fool to come back do you know what i am going to do with you ki sing shook his head placidly i am going to tie you hand and foot and roll you down hill youd better have stayed where you were no want loll down hillee said the chinaman without however betraying any fear i shant ask whether you like it or not but stop perhaps you can help us do you know where the golddust is yes answered ki sing bill moselys face lighted up with pleasure he thought he saw the way out of his difficulty thats the very thing he cried turning to his partner eh tom i should say so bill just show us where it is and we wont do you any harm if my fliend dickee dewee tell me to i will said ki sing dewey thus appealed to said no ki sing they only want to rob me and i am not willing to have you show them youd better shut up dewey said mosely insolently youre a dead duck and youre only gettin this foolish heathen into trouble weve got tired of waitin round here and i am ready to excuse you any time said dewey dont stay on my account i beg in fact the sooner you leave the better it will please me bill mosely who didnt fancy deweys sarcasm frowned fiercely and turned again to ki sing will you show us or not he demanded velly solly said ki sing with a childish smile but dickee dewee wont let me with an oath mosely sprang to the doorway and tried to clutch the chinaman when the latter slid to one side and jake bradley confronted him youd better begin with me bill mosely he said chapter ix bradleys signal victory bill mosely started back as if he had seen a rattlesnake and stared at jake bradley in mingled surprise and dismay you didnt expect to see me i reckon said bradley dryly mosely still stared at him uncertain what to say or what to do i take it very kind of you to bring back the hosses you borrowed a few weeks since you took em rather sudden without askin leave it was a kind of oversight on your part i dont know what you mean answered mosely determined to brazen it out and keep the horses if possible for he was lazy and a pedestrian tramp would not have suited him very well you know what i mean well enough bill mosely if you dont them mustangs outside may refresh your recollection they look kinder fagged out youve worked em too hard mosely those mustangs are ours we bought em said mosely boldly didnt we tom i should say so remarked hadley with striking originality thats a lie tom remarked bradley calmly and you know it as well as i do are we goin to stand that tom blustered mosely whose courage was beginning to revive as he had thus far only seen bradley and considered that the odds were two to one in his favor of course the chinaman counted for nothing tom hadley looked a little doubtful for he could see that the enemy though apparently singlehanded was a man of powerful frame and apparently fearless even to recklessness he had a strong suspicion that bill mosely was a coward and would afford him very little assistance in the event of a scrimmage if you cant stand it said bradley sit down if you want to thus far richard dewey had remained silent but he wished to participate in the defence of their property if there should be need and of course must be released first jake said he these fellows have tied me hand and foot they couldnt have done it if i had not been partially disabled send in ki sing to cut the cords they dared to tie you said bradley sternly mosely what was that for to remove one obstacle in the way of plunder dewey answered for them theyre not only hossthieves but thieves through and through since they tied you they must untie you mosely go and cut the cords i am not a slave to be ordered round returned mosely haughtily what are you then a gentleman then youll be a dead gentleman in less than a minute if you dont do as i tell you as he spoke he drew out his revolver and levelled it at mosely the latter turned pale dont handle that wepon so careless stranger he said it might go off so it might as like as not answered bradley calmly put it up said mosely nervously tom just cut them cords tom you neednt do it mosely youre the man for that duty do you hear bill mosely hesitated he didnt like to yield and be humiliated before the man over whom he had retained so long an ascendency youd better be quick about it said bradley warningly this here wepon goes off terrible easily i dont want to shoot you but there might be an accident ive killed twentyone men with it already youll be the twentysecond that was hint enough pride gave way and bill mosely knelt down and cut the cords which confined dewey and the invalid with a sense of relief sat up on his pallet and watched the conference there are you satisfied asked mosely sullenly itll do as far as it goes mosely said bradley i wouldnt advise you to try any more of them tricks he lowered his weapon and was about to replace it when mosely who had made a secret sign to his companion sprang forward simultaneously with tom hadley and seized the intrepid bradley the attack was sudden and also unexpected for bradley had such a contempt for the prowess of william mosely that he had not supposed him capable of planning or carrying out so bold an attack it must be admitted that he was taken at disadvantage and might have been temporarily overpowered for tom hadley was strong and mosely though a coward was nerved by desperation richard dewey saw his friends danger but unhappily he had no weapon at hand but help was not long in coming concealed by the walls of the cabin ben had heard all that had been said and observed the attack upon his comrade he did not hesitate a moment but sprang forward and showed himself at bradleys side let him go or ill shoot he exclaimed in a tone of command pointing at mosely the twin brother of the revolver which bradley owned confusion ejaculated mosely in fresh dismay let go repeated ben firmly bill mosely released bradley and the latter threw off the grasp of tom hadley now said he as standing side by side with ben he confronted the two thieves shall we shoot no no said mosely nervously serve you right if we did so you thought youd got me did you you didnt know about ben there he aint half your size but hes got twice the courage ben what shall we do with them bill mosely turned toward ben anxious to hear what our hero would say he was entirely in the power of the two friends as he realized serve them as they served ki sing suggested ben thats a good idea that is here you two rascals trot out here following directions the two men emerged from the cabin and stood on one side of the doorway feeling that they would gladly be in some other part of california at that precise moment mosely do you see that tree yes go to it bill mosely slowly and unwillingly proceeded to do as he was told ki sing said jake bradley to the chinaman who was standing near at hand his face wearing a bland and contented smile have you any cord in your pocket yes answered the celestial tie that man to the tree ki sing approached to follow instructions when bill mosely shouted ill brain you you yaller heathen if you dare to touch me just as you say squire said bradley nonchalantly raising his revolver if youd prefer to be shot im a very accommodatin man and ill oblige you i guess itll be better as well save all trouble stop stop cried mosely in dismay he can tie me youve changed your mind i thought you would said bradley ki sing go ahead with native dexterity and not without a feeling of satisfaction easily understood under the circumstances ki sing proceeded to tie his former captor but present captive to a stout sapling is it strong asked bradley velly stlong answered the chinaman with a satisfied look thats good now tom its your turn theres your tree annex yourself to it tom hadley saw the futility of resistance and quietly allowed himself to be confined in the same manner as his companion when both were thus disposed of jake bradley turned to the chinaman now ki sing let us have some supper as soon as possible weve been doin considerable business ben and i and were as hungry as bears goodnight mosely hope youll have a good nights rest you are not going to leave us here all night are you said bill mosely uneasily thats just what im goin to do ill let you go in the mornin if you behave yourself still if youd rather be shot i can accommodate you what a bloodthirsty brute ejaculated the unhappy mosely as bradley disappeared within the doorway i should say so echoed tom hadley from the other tree chapter x the best of friends must part mosely and his companion continued in captivity through the night some of my readers may consider the punishment a severe one and it must be admitted that it was attended with no small share of discomfort but for that time it was an exceedingly mild penalty for the offence which the two men had committed in the early days of california theft was generally punished in the most summary manner by hanging the culprit from a limb of the nearest tree and that in the majority of cases would have been the fate of bill mosely and tom hadley but neither bradley nor ben was willing to go to such extremes jake bradley had had rough experiences and he was no softhearted sentimentalist but he had a natural repugnance to taking the life of his fellowcreatures money he said on one occasion to ben aint to be measured agin a mans life i dont say i wouldnt kill a man for some things though i should hate to mightily but it wouldnt be on account of robbery i wouldnt have a mans blood on my conscience for such a thing as that it is needless to say that our young hero whose heart was warm and humane agreed fully with his older companion when the two friends got up in the morning and went out of the cabin they found their two captives in the same position in which they had left them they looked weary and were stiff in the limbs as well they might be well my friends said bradley i hope youve passed a pleasant night im almost dead growled bill mosely i feel as if id been here a week do you feel the same way inquired bradley addressing tom hadley i should say so answered hadley in a voice of intense disgust it was your own choice mosely said jake bradley it was either all night braced up against a tree or to be shot at once and put out of your misery who wants to be shot returned mosely that would be worse than stayin here all night you might have let us go last night so i might but i wanted to teach you a lesson you know very well bill mosely youd have fared a good deal worse with some men youd have been swingin from the nearest bough and so would your friend youll come to that some time but id rather some one else would hang you it aint a job i hanker after are you goin to set us free asked mosely impatiently not enjoying bradleys prediction as to his future fate yes i think i will on one condition go ahead ill agree to anything that youll leave this part of california and not come back i dont want you to cross my path agin you can bet i dont mean to said mosely and there is no doubt he was entirely in earnest do you make the same promise tom asked bradley turning to hadley i should say so returned hadley and there is no reason to doubt his sincerity also you see my friends you dont appear to know the difference between your property and mine particularly when it comes to hosses it is an unfortunate little peculiarity of yours that will bring your life to an untimely end some of these days if you should ever reform and set up as respectable men i might be willin to know you but theres about as much chance of that accordin to my reckonin as of water runnin up hill while he was expressing himself thus he was cutting the cords of his prisoners and they took the first chance to stretch their cramped limbs feel better dont you asked bradley smiling i should say so answered hadley couldnt you give us something to eat asked mosely i havent eaten a mouthful since yesterday noon and i feel faint ki sing said bradley bring out some victuals these men are not particular friends of mine but we wont send them away hungry ive known what it is to fast for thirtysix hours at a stretch and i understand how it feels ki sing brought out some cold meat and other plain food which the two adventurers ate as if they were famished their long fast and exposure during the night had sharpened their appetites and lent a keener zest to their enjoyment of the meal when they had finished jake bradley pointed down the mountain youve had your breakfast he said and now there is only one thing more i want to see you travel bill mosely looked askance at the two mustangs which were tied only a few rods off jake bradley caught the direction of his glance its no go my friend he said you dont borrow our mustangs this time we shall have occasion to use them ourselves it wont do you any harm to try your own legs for a while bill mosely wasnt easily abashed he was lazy and the prospect of tramping all day was by no means agreeable to him thanks to his last robbery he and his companion were tolerably well supplied with golddust which was a common circulating medium in california at that time an idea struck him which he lost no time in carrying out what value do you set on them horses he asked what makes you ask inquired jake bradley with some curiosity well buy em if youll take a fair price buy our mustangs have you got the money weve got golddust where did you get it ill warrant you didnt work for it thats our business answered mosely stiffly the question is do you want to sell no i dont and if i did i should want to know whose money i was takin bill mosely was disappointed in that lonely neighborhood it was hardly likely there would be any other opportunity of obtaining horses and there was nothing for it but to walk you havent got any other business have you mosely asked bradley no tom come on goodbye then our acquaintance has been brief mosely but i know you as well as if wed lived in the same town for years youre a fine man you are and an ornament to your native state but if you aint a little more careful youll be likely to die young and the world will lose a man who in his line cant be beat bill mosely did not attempt any reply to this farewell but strode down the sloping path closely followed by tom hadley when he had got out of hearing of his late captors he turned to hadley and said i hate that man he has put a stain on my honor he has insulted and outraged me i should say so observed tom hadley he has treated you just as badly hadley that stain must be washed out in blood when inquired his companion in a matteroffact manner i dont know some time he has had the advantage over us this time but we shall meet again do you hear that tom hadley continued mosely in a theatrical tone raising his voice at the same time we shall meet again i dont want to meet him again said hadley you dont comprehend me when we meet it will be our turn to deal with him just as you say returned tom hadley varying his usual formula its very unlucky we went up to that cabin said bill after a pause i should say so chimed in tom very emphatically it was cursed illluck but how could we know that that daredevil was a friend of deweys if wed let well enough alone we shouldnt have lost our horses and been compelled to tramp on foot over these mountains where are we going asked tom hadley down hill answered mosely briefly this answer did not appear to tom hadley to contain much information but his mind was not active enough to frame another question and the two plodded along in silence chapter xi plans for departure the recovery of the horses was in one respect especially fortunate richard dewey was anxious to leave the mountaincabin as soon as possible and make his way to san francisco where as we know his promised wife was anxiously awaiting him but there was considerable danger that his ankle which had been severely sprained would not be in a condition for travelling for a considerable time yet the rough mountainpaths would have tried it and perhaps a second sprain would have resulted now however he would be able to ride on one of the horses and need not walk at all if he pleased this idea occurred to jake bradley who suggested it to richard dewey deweys face brightened up for he was secretly chafing over the delay made necessary by his accident but my friend he said it would be selfish in me to take your horse and leave you to go on foot look here dick dewey said bradley what do you take me for do you think im so delicate i cant walk i wasnt brought up in no such way i can do my regular share of trampin whether on the prairie or on the mountain i aint no tenderfoot i dont doubt your strength and endurance friend bradley said dewey but a man doesnt always like to do what he is fully able to do then we neednt say no more about it theres a gal i beg your pardon a young lady in frisco thats pinin to see you dick dewey and that hossll get you there soonern if you waited till you could walk i am too selfish to resist your arguments my good friend said dewey i think i can venture to start within a week as i am to ride no doubt of it youd better let me buy your horse and then if we dont meet again or anything happens to it you wont be the loser if we dont meet again repeated bradley puzzled you dont mean to say you are goin to set out alone i dont want to take you and ben away from your claim it isnt half exhausted yet then let somebody else exhaust it returned bradley you dont suppose dick we are goin to let you go off alone i shall not be alone my faithful attendant ki sing will be with me and what good would ki sing be in case you fell in with a grizzly i want to know that asked bradley i dont say anything against the heathen hes squarer than many a white man ive met with and hes worth a dozen such men as bill mosely and tom hadley but all the same he wouldnt be much in a scrimmage them chinamen are half women accordin to my reckonin they look like it and speak like it no ben and i go when you do and the first man that comes along is welcome to the claim i shall certainly be delighted to have you both with me said richard dewey youre a good fellow jake bradley and i trust you more than any man i have met since i came to california ben acted as escort to florence and i owe him a debt for that which i hope some day to repay then its all fixed said bradley in a tone of satisfaction we four are to keep together till we see you within reach of frisco when you and your young lady meet you wont need us any more richard dewey smiled florence will wish to thank you for your kind care of me bradley he said ive no objection to that you can invite me to the weddin dick i give you that invitation now and hope you may not have long to wait for the occasion all difficulties are not yet removed but i hope they may vanish speedily i get impatient sometimes but i try to curb my impatient feeling i reckon i would feel so myself if i was in your fix observed bradley i hope you may be jake bradley shook his head im a crossgrained old bachelor he said and i reckon no gal would look at me twice chapter xii the profits of mining a few evenings later ben and bradley were sitting just outside the cabin as the twilight deepened it doesnt seem as if this was our last night in the old shanty said jake bradley taking the pipe from his mouth it aint a palace but i shall kinder hate to leave it ive got to feel very much at home here myself jake still i should like to get somewhere where it isnt quite so far out of the world theres something in that ben i havent heard anything from home for a good many weeks i wish i knew whether my uncles family are all well how many is there in the family ben theres uncle job and aunt hannah and cousin jennie thats just what i thought said jake i dont understand you said ben puzzled what did you think i thought there was a cousin jennie our hero laughed and it may be blushed a little what made you think that there generally is i notice said mr bradley eagerly is cousin jennie pretty to be sure she is i thought that too ben what are you driving at jake i was sure there was some one besides the old folks that you was anxious about well you happen to be right said ben laughing but i must tell you that jennie is only fourteen and i am only sixteen youll both of you be older some day ben but theres a matter that we must settle before we go whats that about the gold we have found since weve been here we must have some arrangement about dividin it we shant quarrel about that jake no theres no danger of that thatll be easy enough well divide it into two piles one for you and the other for me jake i have no right to half of it you ought to have twothirds id like to argy that matter ben why should i have twothirds because you earned it you understood mining better than i were equal partners ben i stick to that and i mean to have my way ive been making a little calculation and i reckon theres nigh on to a thousand dollars for the two of us as much as that jake said ben eagerly i reckon there is though i cant justly tell it doesnt seem possible i can be worth five hundred dollars said ben thoughtfully weve only been here four weeks that makes a hundred and twentyfive dollars a week so it does thats pretty high pay for a boy before i left home said ben there was an old farmer deacon pitkins who wanted to hire me for a year what do you think he offered me how much twenty dollars a year and board answered ben i reckon you did better to come to californy it looks so now how the old deacon would stare if he knew how i had been prospering at the mines i wish there was any way of sending part of this money home i would like to make a present to uncle job when you get to frisco you wont have any trouble about sendin it uncle job thought it was very risky for a boy like me to leave home and seek my fortune in california i would like to prove to him that i didnt make a mistake its likely you havent ben said bradley cautiously but you aint out of the woods yet i hope things will go on as well as they have and youll be able to carry a pile home but weve got to start in good season tomorrow and we may as well turn in and go to sleep chapter xiii ki sings ride the next morning after breakfast the party got off fortunately there were no trunks or heavy luggage to carry california pioneers had no occasion for saratoga trunks and the amount of clothing they carried in addition to what they had on was very small ki sing said bradley jocosely i am afraid we cant carry your trunk with us tlunk repeated the chinaman looking puzzled yes trunk or tlunk as you call it havent you a trunk to carry your clothes got clothes on said ki sing pointing to his blouse and wide pants i see said bradley laughing were all about in the same fix the clothes of the whole party wouldnt half fill a trunk the two horses were brought out and saddled bradley assisted richard dewey to mount one and motioned to ben to mount the other get on ben he said its time the procession was moving ben shook his head no jake he said you are older than i am it is proper that you should ride if im older than you said bradley i am stronger than you and am better able to walk i am strong enough jake i shant get tired one of us ought to ride theres no use in havin a horse if you aint going to use him suppose suggested ben laughing we let ki sing ride bradley saw that a joke was intended and he turned gravely to the chinaman ki sing he said come here and mount this mustang we are goin to let you ride an expression of alarm overspread the chinamans broad face he had never been on a horses back in his life but he knew something of the californian mustangs more than once he had seen them buck and throw the illfated riders over their heads and not being of a daring or venturesome nature he preferred to walk rather than trust himself to mount the back of so treacherous an animal ki sing no wantee lide he said starting back in alarm but ki sing you will get tired tramping over these hills it will be much easier to ride on a mustang no likee mustang mustang buckee objected the chinaman you are right ki sing they do buck sometimes but this animal is as mild and peaceful as a lamb however we wont insist on your riding now some other day when you have found out how safe he is you shall try him the chinaman seemed much relieved at the privilege accorded him of walking and with his small bundle prepared to take his place in the procession ben said bradley the best way for us to arrange will be to take turns in riding id a good deal rather walk half the way my legs get cramped when i am on horseback too long you remember i used to get off and lead the horse when we had one apiece you may take your turn first and as you are riding i will give you a bag to carry mind you dont lose it for it contains our store of golddust all right jake ill ride first if you say so in truth ben was pleased to find himself once more on the back of a horse he had not had much practice in riding at the east but the practice he had had in california had already made him a good rider and even if the mustang had taken a fancy to buck he would have found it rather hard to dislodge our young hero the animal he bestrode however was very wellbehaved especially when he felt that his rider had the mastery over him any horse with any spirit is apt to take advantage of a timid or unpractised rider and the animal is very quick to learn when this is the case during the first day the mustang behaved remarkably well to begin with both ben and bradley were good riders moreover the path was very uneven chiefly up and down hill and the horse was too sensible to go much beyond a walk as for dewey he got on very comfortably his ankle was nearly as strong as at first but if he had been compelled to use it for a days tramp it would undoubtedly have ached and become sensitive on the back of his horse or rather bradleys there was of course no danger of injury when he became tired of his constrained position he got off and walked a quarter or half a mile and experienced the needed relief at the end of the first day they had got well down the mountain and the commencement of the second days ride was over a nearly level plateau this is a good place for ki sing to ride suggested ben just so said bradley taking the hint ki sing you must take your turn now no wantee lide said the chinaman but he did not greet the proposal with so much alarm as on the morning previous he had noticed the quiet behavior and regular pace of the two mustangs and concluded that they were of a different kind from those he had seen misbehave on former occasions oh youll like it well enough when you try it ki sing said bradley were you ever on a horses back me never lide answered the chinaman then it is high time you began you see ki sing it isnt exactly fair that ben and i should ride half the time and leave you to walk all the way likee walk said ki sing thats because you never tried riding you see these two hosses of ours are jest like lambs theyre so gentle they could be rid by a twoyearold baby the chinaman looked at the mustangs and confidence came to him so far as he had observed what jake bradley said was strictly true they certainly did seem remarkably tame with a little more persuasion he was induced to mount ben assisting him to get into position and the reins were put into his hands the mustang began to move off at a regular pace very favorable to an inexperienced rider and a bland and childlike smile of content overspread the face of the chinaman you see ki sing said bradley who walked alongside its nothing to ride you thought you couldnt ride yet you are pacing it off like a veteran me likee lide observed ki sing with a pleased smile just so i thought you would ben doesnt ki sing ride well splendidly said ben contemplating with amusement the mongolian horseman certainly ki sing in his chinese garb as he gingerly held the reins with his bland smiling face did look rather queer but i am sorry to say that the poor chinamans pleasure and contentment were destined to be of short duration bradley and ben were eager for the amusement they promised themselves when they planned this practical joke at the expense of their asiatic friend winking at ben bradley said you dont go fast enough ki sing as he spoke he brought down a stick which he had in his hand with emphasis on the flanks of the mustang the effect was magical the tame animal immediately started off at great speed arching his neck and shaking his head while the poor chinaman his bland smile succeeded by a look of extreme terror was bounced up and down in the most unceremonious fashion and would have been thrown off quickly but for the mexican saddle which is a securer seat than that used at the east he uttered a howl of anguish while his almond eyes seemed starting out of their sockets as his steed dashed along the road though ben sympathized with the terrified chinaman he knew there was little or no danger and he threw himself on the ground and gave way to a paroxysm of laughter finally the horse slackened his pace and ki sing lost no time in sliding to the ground how do you like it ki sing asked bradley trying to keep his face straight no likee lide answered mr chinaman horsee most kill ki sing you rode splendidly ki sing said ben laughing you made him go fast no likee go fast said ki sing inspecting his limbs to see that none were broken the poor chinamans limbs were sore for a day or two and he could never be induced to mount one of the mustangs again it was his first and last ride chapter xiv golden gulch hotel the party were able to cover a greater distance on the second day than on the first being now among the foothills where travelling was attended with less difficulty in the mountaincabin they had been solitary their only visitors had been bill mosely and his friend tom hadley and such visitors they were glad to dispense with now however it was different here and there they found a little miningsettlement with its quota of rough bearded men clad in strange fashion yet some of these men had filled responsible and prominent positions in the east one of the most brigandishlooking miners had been a clergyman in western new york who had been compelled by bronchial troubles to give up his parish and being poor had wandered to the california mines in the hope of gathering a competence for the support of his family it seems good to see people again said ben whose temperament was social i felt like robinson crusoe on his desert island when i was up on the mountain yes answered bradley i like to see people myself when theyre of the right sort when theyre like bill mosely id rather be alone i agree with you there said ben poor company is worse than none besides the miningsettlements there were little knots of miners at work here and there who generally gave the travellers a cordial welcome and often invited them to stay and join them no said bradley were in a hurry to get to frisco oh youve made your pile then was generally answered what luck have you had our pile is a small one bradley was wont to reply but weve got business in frisco leastwise he has pointing to richard dewey who headed the procession will you come back to the mines i shall for one said bradley i aint rich enough to retire yet and i dont expect to be for half a dozen years yet will the boy come back yes answered ben im in the same situation as my friend mr bradley i havent my fortune yet youd better stay with us boy well do the right thing by you ben shook his head and declined with thanks he did not want to forsake his present companions besides he had been commissioned by florence douglas to find richard dewey and he wanted to execute that commission thoroughly he wanted to see the two united and then he would be content to return to the rough life of the miningcamp it is easy to understand why ben should have received so many friendly invitations a boy was a rarity in california at that time at any rate in the miningdistricts there were plenty of young men and men of middle age but among the adventurous immigrants were to be found few boys of sixteen the age of our hero the sight of his fresh young face and boyish figure recalled to many miners the sons whom they had left behind them and helped to make more vivid the picture of home which their imaginations often conjured up and they would have liked to have ben join their company but as i have said ben had his reasons for declining all invitations at present though he had every reason to anticipate good treatment toward the close of the second day the little party reached a small miningsettlement containing probably about fifty miners it was known as golden gulch and it even boasted a small hotel with a board sign on which had been scrawled in charcoal golden gulch hotel kept by jim brown i believe we are getting into the domain of civilization said richard dewey actually here is a hotel if mr brown is not too exorbitant in his prices we had better put up here for the night it doesnt look like an expensive hotel said ben looking at the rough shanty which the proprietor had dignified by the appellation of hotel it was roughly put together had but one story was unpainted and was altogether hardly equal architecturally to some of the huts which are to be found among the rocks at the upper end of manhattan island such was jim browns golden gulch hotel such as it was however it looked attractive to our pilgrims who for so long had been compelled to be their own cooks and servants they found upon inquiry that jim browns terms for supper lodging and breakfast were five dollars a day or as nearly as that sum could be reached in golddust it was considerably higher than the prices then asked at the best hotels in new york and philadelphia but high prices prevailed in california and no one scrupled to pay them the party decided to remain and the landlord set to work to prepare them a supper as good as the limited resources of the golden gulch hotel would allow still the fare was better and more varied than our travellers had been accustomed to for a long time and they enjoyed it ki sing sat down to the table with them this was opposed at first by jim brown the landlord who regarded chinamen as scarcely above the level of his mules you dont mean to say you want that heathen to sit down at the table with you he remonstrated yes i do said richard dewey id sooner be kicked by a mule than let any yaller heathen sit next to me remarked jim brown whose education and refinement made him sensitive to such social contamination richard dewey smiled of course you can choose for yourself he said ki sing is a friend of mine though he is acting as my servant and i want him to have equal privileges jim brown remarked that of course dewey could choose his own company though he intimated that he thought his taste might be improved me eatee aftelward said ki sing when he perceived that his presence at the table was the subject of controversy but he was overruled by richard dewey who possessed a large share of independence and would not allow himself to be controlled or influenced by the prejudices of others this may not seem a very important matter but it aroused a certain hostility on the part of the landlord which arrayed him against dewey and his companions at a critical time entirely unconscious of the storm that was soon to gather about them the little party did good justice to the supper which mr brown set before them how would it seem jake to have supper like this every night remarked ben it would make me feel like a prince answered jake bradley it is no better than i used to get at uncle jobs and yet he was a poor man how he would stare if he knew i was paying five dollars a day for no better fare than he gave me replied our hero thats true ben but maybe its easier to get the five dollars here than it would have been to scrape together fifty cents at home youre right there jake fifty cents was a pretty big sum to me a year ago i dont believe uncle job himself averages over a dollar and a quarter a day and he has a family to support if i only do well here ill make him comfortable in his old age i guess youll have the chance ben youre the boy to succeed youre smart and youre willin to work and thems what leads to success out here thank you jake i will try to deserve your favorable opinion as ben finished these words there was a confused noise outside the hoarse murmur as of angry men and a minute later jim brown the landlord entered the room his face dark and threatening strangers said he i reckoned there was something wrong about you when you let that yaller heathen sit down with you now i know it you aint square respectable men youre hossthieves chapter xv bill mosely reappears it will be necessary to go back a little in order to explain how so extraordinary a charge came to be made against the party in which we are interested bill mosely and tom hadley did not become reconciled to the loss of their stolen horses they found it much less agreeable to use their own legs than the legs of the two mustangs which had borne them so comfortably over the hills they cursed the fate which had led to their meeting with ki sing and the poor chinaman would have fared worse at their hands had they anticipated the trouble which he indirectly brought them bill mosely was naturally lazy any sort of work he considered beneath him and he desired to avoid all possible trouble in the lawless and vagabond life which he had chosen he took it worse indeed than his companion who was neither so shiftless nor so lazy as he during the few days which had elapsed since they were glad to leave the mountaincabin they had averaged less than ten miles daily travel they had money enough to purchase animals to replace those which had been taken from them but had not found any one who was willing to sell for a reasonable price and mosely though he came easily by his money was far from lavish in the spending of it it chanced that an hour after the arrival of richard dewey and his party at the golden gulch hotel mosely and his companion dusty and tired approached the small miningsettlement of which the hotel was the principal building they had had nothing to eat since morning and both of them felt hungry not to say ravenous thank heaven tom theres a miningtown ejaculated mosely with an expression of devotion not usual to him now we can get something to eat and i for my part feel as empty as a drum its hard travelling on an empty stomach i should say so remarked mr hadley with his usual formula it must be admitted however that in the present instance he was entirely sincere and fully meant what he said theres a hotel said tom hadley a minute later venturing on an original observation so there is what is the name inquired mosely who was not as farsighted as his companion the golden gulch hotel answered hadley shading his eyes and reading from a distance of fifty rods the pretentious sign of the little inn i suppose theyll charge a fortune for a supper said mosely whose economical spirit was troubled by the exorbitant prices then prevalent in california but we must have it at any cost i should say so assented tom hadley cordially you always have a good appetite of your own observed mosely not without sarcasm which however tom hadley was too obtuse to comprehend i should say so returned tom complacently as if he had received a compliment no doubt youll get your moneys worth no matter how much we pay for supper tom hadley himself was of this opinion and so expressed himself they had already caught sight of two mustangs which were browsing near the golden gulch hotel and the sight of these useful animals excited the envy and longing of bill mosely do you see them mustangs tom he inquired i should say so i wish we had them couldnt we take them suggested hadley his face brightening at the thought of this easy mode of acquiring what they so much needed are you mad tom hadley returned bill mosely shrugging his shoulders are you anxious to die i should say not then youd better not think of carrying off them horses why wed have the whole pack of miners after us and wed die in our boots before twentyfour hours had passed on the whole this prospect did not appear to be of an encouraging character and tom hadley quietly dropped the plan perhaps we can buy them suggested mosely by way of amendment ive got tired of tramping over these hills on foot after weve got some supper well inquire who they belong to up to this point neither mosely nor his companion suspected that the mustangs which they desired to purchase had once been in their possession that discovery was to come later before reaching the golden gulch hotel they encountered the landlord already introduced as jim brown mr brown scanned the newcomers with an eye to business being strangers he naturally looked upon them as possible customers and was disposed from motives of policy to cultivate their acquaintance evenin strangers he remarked as affably as a rather gruff voice and manner would permit goodevening said bill mosely socially what might be the name of this settlement you kin see the name on that sign yonder stranger ef your eyes are strong enough golden gulch i reckon it ought to be a good place from the name its middlin good where might you be from were prospectin a little answered bill mosely vaguely for there had been circumstances in his california career that made it impolitic to be too definite in his statements where are you bound continued the landlord with that licensed curiosity which no one ventured to object to in california that depends upon circumstances my friend said bill mosely guardedly we may go to frisco and then again we may not tonight we propose to remain here in golden gulch is that a comfortable hotel well stranger seein i keep it myself it mightnt be exactly the thing for me to say much about it but i reckon you wont complain of it if you stop there im glad to meet you said bill mosely grasping the landlords hand fervently i dont need to ask any more about it seein youre the landlord you look like a man that can keep a hotel eh tom i should say so returned tom hadley making the answer that was expected of him youre a gentleman said jim brown on whom this flattery had its effect just come along with me and ill see that you are treated as such what are your terms say for supper and lodgin landlord asked bill with commendable caution five dollars answered brown bill moselys jaw fell he had hoped it would be less and for supper alone he asked two dollars well only take supper said mosely just as you say were so used to campin out that we couldnt breathe indoors eh tom i should say so bill suit yourselves strangers i reckon youll want breakfast in the mornin as likely as not then turning his attention to the mustangs are them mustangs yours landlord no they belong to a party thats stoppin with me will they sell i reckon not theres a lame man in the party and he cant walk much a lame man who is with him asked bill mosely with a sudden suspicion of the truth well theres another man and a boy and a heathen chinee tom said bill mosely in excitement its the party we left on the mountain i should say so bill do you know them strangers know them ejaculated bill mosely who instantly formed a plan which would gratify his love of vengeance and secure him the coveted horses at one and the same time i reckon i know them only too well they stole those mustangs from me and my friend a week ago i thought them animals looked natural hossthieves said the landlord well i surmised there was something wrong about them when they let that yaller heathen set down to the table with them chapter xvi a travesty of justice it was speedily noised about in the miningcamp that a party of horsethieves had had the audacity to visit the settlement and were even now guests of the golden gulch hotel now in the eyes of a miner a horsethief was as bad as a murderer he was considered rather worse than an ordinary thief since the character of his theft gave him better facilities for getting away with his plunder he was looked upon by all as a common and dangerous enemy on whom any community was justified in visiting the most condign punishment bill mosely knew very well the feeling he would rouse against the men whom he hated and having started the movement waited complacently for the expected results to follow jim brown was by no means slow in spreading the alarm true these men were his guests and it might be considered that it was against his interests to denounce them but he knew his claim for entertainment would be allowed him out of the funds found in possession of the party with probably a liberal addition as a compensation for revealing their real character horsethieves no sooner did the news spread than the miners most of whom were through work for the day began to make their way to the neighborhood of the hotel there hadnt been any excitement at golden gulch for some time and this promised a firstclass sensation hang em up thats what i say suggested brown the landlord wheres the men that call em thieves asked one of the miners a middleaged man who was sober and slowspoken and did not look like a man to be easily carried away by a storm of prejudice or a wave of excitement here they be said brown pointing to bill mosely and tom hadley who were speedily surrounded by an excited crowd what have you say asked the first speaker of mosely bill mosely repeated his story glibly it was to this effect they had met the chinaman who induced them to accompany him to the cabin where his master lay sick from motives of compassion they assented when they reached the cabin they were set upon by the combined party their horses were taken from them they were tied to trees where they were kept in great pain all night and in the morning stripped of the greater part of their money and sent adrift it will be seen that the story did not entirely deviate from fact and was very artfully framed to excite sympathy for the narrator and indignation against the perpetrators of the supposed outrage tom hadley who had not the prolific imagination of his comrade listened in openmouthed wonder to the fanciful tale but did not offer to corroborate it in his usual manner the tale was so glibly told that it carried conviction to the minds of most of those present and a storm of indignation arose lets have em out lets hang em up exclaimed one impetuous miner others echoed the cry and the company of miners in stern phalanx marched to the hotel where unconscious of the impending peril our friends were resting after the days fatigue we have already described the manner in which jim brown burst in upon them with the startling charge that they were horsethieves of course all were startled except ki sing who did not fully comprehend the situation richard dewey was the first to speak what do you mean he said sternly by this preposterous charge youll find out soon enough said the landlord nodding significantly jest you file out of that door pretty quick theres some of us want to see you what does all this mean asked dewey turning to jake bradley i dont know answered bradley it looks like a conspiracy the party filed out and were confronted by some thirty or forty blackbearded sternfaced men who had tried and condemned them in advance of their appearance richard dewey glanced at the faces before him and his spirit sank within him he had been present at a similar scene before a scene which had terminated in a tragedy and he knew how swift and relentless those men could be who could have made such a charge he did not yet know but innocent as he and his companions were he knew that their word would not be taken and the mistake might lead to death but he was not a man to quail or blanch hossthieves string em up was shouted from more than one throat richard dewey calmly surveyed the angry throng gentlemen he said i am no more a horsethief than any one of you there was a buzz of indignation as if he had confessed his guilt and implicated them in it i demand to see and face my accusers he said boldly what man has dared to charge me and my friends with the mean and contemptible crime of stealing horses jake bradley had been looking about him too over the heads of the men who stood before them drawn up in a semicircle he saw what had escaped the notice of richard dewey the faces and figures of bill mosely and tom hadley dick said he suddenly i see it all look yonder there are them two mean skunks bill mosely and tom hadley its they who have been bringin this false slander agin us richard dewey and ben immediately looked in the direction indicated bill mosely eyed them with a glance of evil and exulting triumph as much as to say its my turn now i am having my revenge but jim brown who seemed to be acting as prosecuting attorney had already summoned the two men to come forward and testify heres the men he said exultingly heres the men you robbed of their horses and tied to trees isnt it so stranger bill mosely inclined his head in the affirmative and tom hadley being also asked answered but rather faintly i should say so lying did not come as natural to him as to bill richard dewey laughed scornfully are those the men he asked who charge us with stealing their horses in course they do then burst forth jake bradley impetuously of all the impudent and lyin scoundrels i ever met theyll carry off the prize of course you deny it said bill mosely brazenly persisting in his falsehood a man thatll steal will lie perhaps you will charge us with stealin the horses next thats just what i do said bradley in an excited tone youre not only horsethieves but youll take golddust an anything else you can lay your hands on gentlemen said bill mosely shrugging his shoulders you see how he is tryin to fasten his own guilt on me and my innocent pard here it isnt enough that he stole our horses and forced us to foot it over them rough hills but now he wants to steal away our reputation for honor and honesty he thinks youre easy to be imposed on but i know better you wont see two innocent men lied about and charged with disgraceful crimes i admire that fellows cheek said bradley in an undertone to richard dewey but he soon found that the consequences were likely to be disastrous to him and his party the crowd were getting impatient and readily seconded the words of jim brown when he followed up bill moselys speech by a suggestion that they proceed at once to vindicate justice by a summary execution they rushed forward and seized upon our four friends ki sing included and hurried them off to a cluster of tall trees some twenty rods away chapter xvii lynch law nothing is so unreasoning as a crowd under excitement the miners were inflamed with fierce anger against men of whom they knew nothing except that they were accused of theft by two other men of whom also they knew nothing whether the charge was true or false they did not stop to inquire apparently they did not care they only wanted revenge and that stern and immediate the moderate speaker already referred to tried to turn the tide by an appeal for delay wait till morning he said this charge may not be true let us not commit an injustice but his appeal was drowned in the cries of the excited crowd hang the horsethieves string em up each of the four victims was dragged by a force which he couldnt resist to the place of execution richard dewey was pale but his expression was stern and contemptuous as if he regarded the party of miners as fools or lunatics was this to be the end he asked himself just as the prospect of happiness was opening before him just as he was to be reunited to the object of his affection was he to fall a victim to the fury of a mob jake bradley perhaps took the matter more philosophically than either of the other three he had less to live for and his attachment to life was not therefore so strong still to be hanged as a thief was not a pleasant way to leave life and that was what he thought of most again his sympathy was excited in behalf of the boy ben whom he had come to love as if he were his own son he could not bear to think of the boys young life being extinguished in so shocking a manner this is rough ben he managed to say as the two side by side were hurried along by the vindictive crowd bens face was pale and his heart was full of sorrow and awe with the prospect of a shameful death rising before him life was sweet to him and it seemed hard to lose it yes it is answered ben faltering cant something be done jake bradley shook his head mournfully i am afraid not he said id like to shoot one of those lyin scoundrels referring to bill mosely and his companion before i am swung off to think their word should cost us our lives its a burnin shame ki sing looked the image of terror as he too was forced forward by a couple of strong miners his feet refused to do their office and he was literally dragged forward his feet trailing along the ground he was indeed a ludicrous figure if anything connected with such a tragedy can be considered ludicrous probably it was not so much death that ki sing feared for with his race life is held cheap but chinamen shrink from violence particularly that of a brutal character they are ready with their knives but other violence is not common among them bill mosely and tom hadley followed in the rear of the crowd they would have liked to improve the time by stealing away with the mustangs which they coveted but even in this hour of public excitement they knew it would not be safe and the act might arouse suspicion while mosely felt gratified that the men he hated were likely to be put out of the way there was in his heart a sensation of fear and he involuntarily shuddered when he reflected that if justice were done he would he in the place of these men who were about to suffer a shameful death moreover he knew that some day it were far from improbable that he himself would be figuring in a similar scene as a chief actor or rather chief victim so though he exulted he also trembled meanwhile the place of execution had been reached then it was discovered that one important accessory to the contemplated tragedy was lacking a rope so one of the party was sent to the hotel for a rope being instructed by jim brown where to find it it seemed the last chance for an appeal and hopeless as it seemed richard dewey resolved to improve it gentlemen he said in a solemn tone i call god to witness that you are about to put to death four innocent men enough of that said jim brown roughly we dont want to hear any more of your talk but dewey did not stop you have condemned us he proceeded on the testimony of two as arrant scoundrels as can be found in california and he pointed scornfully at bill mosely and his partner are you goin to let him insult us asked mosely in the tone of a wronged man that dont go down stranger said jim brown we know youre guilty and thats enough you know it how do you know it retorted dewey what proof is there except the word of two thieves and liars who deserve the fate which you are preparing for us hang em up shouted somebody and the cry was taken up by the rest if you wont believe me continued dewey i want to make one appeal to ask one last favor spare the life of that innocent boy who certainly has done no evil if there are any fathers present i ask have you the heart to take away the life of a child just entering upon life and its enjoyments he had touched the chord in the hearts of more than one thats so cried the speaker who had tried to stem the popular excitement it would be a crime and a disgrace and ill shoot the man that puts the rope round the boys neck youre right cried three others who themselves had left children in their distant homes the boys life must be saved the two men who held ben in their grasp released him and our young hero found himself free there was a great rush of joy to his heart as he saw the shadow of death lifted from him but he was not satisfied that his life alone should be spared he resolved to make an appeal in turn gentlemen he said i am only a boy but i want to speak a few words and those words shall be true ben had been a good speaker at school and he had unconsciously assumed the attitude with which he commenced declaiming upon the schoolrostrum hear the boy shouted several and there was a general silence it was a new thing to be addressed by a boy and there was a feeling of curiosity as to what he would say i want to say this continued ben that what mr dewey has said is strictly true not one of us is guilty of the crime that has been charged upon us the men who have testified against us are thieves and robbed us of these very horses which we finally recovered from them may i tell you how it all happened partly from curiosity the permission was given and ben in plain simple language told the story of how they had received mosely and hadley hospitably and awoke in the morning to find that they had stolen their horses he also described the manner in which later they tried to rob dewey when confined to his bed by sickness his words were frank and sincere and bore the impress of truth evidently a sentiment was being created favorable to the prisoners and bill mosely saw it and trembled let us go he whispered to hadley if you wish to know whether i speak the truth ben concluded look in the faces of those two men who have accused us the terror in the face of bill mosely was plainly to be seen suddenly the minds of the fickle multitude veered round to the two accusers and shouts arose the boys right hang the thieves then bill mosely did perhaps the most unwise thing possible his courage fairly broke down and he started to run immediately a dozen men were on his track he was brought back moaning and begging for mercy but the crowd was in no merciful mood victims they demanded and when the rope was brought the two wretched men were summarily suspended to the branches of two neighboring trees they had fallen into the pit which they had prepared for others as for ben he became the hero of the hour the miners raised him on their shoulders and bore him aloft in triumph to the hotel from which he had so recently been dragged to execution chapter xviii after the execution while ben rejoiced and lifted silent thanks to god for his narrow escape from a shameful death he felt no satisfaction in the knowledge that the men who had basely conspired against them had suffered the like terrible fate he averted his head in horror from the sight and innocent as he was of fault he felt depressed to think that his words had resulted in bringing this punishment upon them i have said that he was the hero of the hour boys were scarce in california and the hearts of the miners warmed to him on account of his youth and the memories it called up of their own children far away a selfappointed committee waited upon him and asked him to stay with them well all help you along they said we will make your share equal to that of the luckiest miner among us youre true grit and we respect you for it what do you say what shall i do jake he asked of bradley its a fair offer ben perhaps youd best stay id stay too only i want to see dick dewey safe in frisco when he and his gal are jined ill come back and try my luck here i will do the same jake i want to go to san francisco and see the lady who was so kind to me i shant feel that ive done all my duty till i have seen her and mr dewey united then i shall be ready to come back tell em so ben ben gave this answer to those who had asked him to stay thanking them gratefully for their kind offer his answer gave general satisfaction ben could hardly realize that these very men had been impatient to hang him only an hour before he was thankful for this change in their sentiments though he did not pretend to understand it bradley and dewey knowing the fickleness of a miningcommunity were a little apprehensive that their original suspicions might again be aroused and that some among them might be led to think they had make a mistake after all and hung the wrong men that would be serious and perhaps dangerous to them they reflected that only bens speech had turned the tide of sentiment and the two thieves had been hung on the unsupported word of a boy might not this occur to some of the company in some of their cooler moments they decided in a secret conference that it would be best for them to get away early the next morning that is as early as practicable before any change had come over the minds of their new friends later however they were relieved from their momentary apprehension two men who had been out hunting did not return to the camp till an hour after the execution had taken place whats happened they asked weve only been hangin a couple of hossthieves was answered coolly by one of their comrades we came near hangin the wrong men but we found out our mistake the two hunters went to view the bodies of the malefactors who were still suspended from the extemporized gallows i know them men said one with sudden recognition what do you know about them did you ever meet them i reckon i did they camped with me one night and in the morning they were missing and all my golddust too then its true what the boy said theyre thieves and no mistake youve made no mistake this time youve hung the right men this fresh testimony was at once communicated to the miners and received with satisfaction as one or two had been a little in doubt as to whether the two men were really guilty no one heard it with more pleasure than dewey and bradley who felt now that they were completely exonerated chapter xix ben wins laurels as a singer our party had no further complaint to make of illtreatment during the remainder of the evening they were treated with distinguished consideration and every effort was made to make their sojourn pleasant as the miners gathered round a blazing logfire built out of doors which the cool air of evening made welcome it was proposed that those who had any vocal gifts should exert them for the benefit of the company three or four of those present had good voices and sang such songs as they knew finally one of the miners turned to bradley cant you sing us something friend he asked you dont know what youre asking said bradley my voice sounds like a rusty saw if you enjoy the howlin of wolves mayhap you might like my singin i reckon youre excused said the questioner my friend dick dewey will favor you perhaps i never heard him sing but i reckon he might if he tried wont you sing was asked of dewey richard dewey would have preferred to remain silent but his life had been spared and the men around him though rough in manner seemed to mean kindly he conquered his reluctance therefore and sang a couple of ballads in a clear musical voice with good effect now its the boys turn said one ben was in fact a good singer he had attended a country singingschool for two terms and he was gifted with a strong and melodious voice bradley had expected that he would decline bashfully but ben had a fair share of selfpossession and felt there was no good reason to decline i dont know many songs he said but i am ready to do my share the first song which occurred to him was annie laurie and he sang it through with taste and effect as his sweet boyish notes fell on the ears of the crowd they listened as if spellbound and at the end gave him a round of applause i dont wish to represent that ben was a remarkable singer his knowledge of music was only moderate but his voice was unusually strong and sweet and his audience were not disposed to be critical he sang one song after another until at last he declared that he was tired and would sing but one more what shall it be he asked sweet home suggested one and the rest took it up in chorus that is a song that appeals to the heart at all times and in all places but it may well be understood that among the california mountains before an audience every man of whom was far from home it would have a peculiar and striking effect the singer too as he sang had his thoughts carried back to the home three thousand miles away where lived all who were near and dear to him and the thought lent new tenderness and pathos to his song tears came to the eyes of more than one rough miner as he listened to the sweet strains and there were few in whom homememories were not excited there was a moments hush and then a great roar of applause ben had made a popular success of which a prima donna might have been proud one enthusiastic listener wanted to take up a contribution for the singer but ben steadily declined it i am glad if i have given any one pleasure he said but i cant take money for that ben said jake bradley when the crowd had dispersed youve made two tenstrikes today youve carried off all the honors both as an orator and a singer you saved all our lives by that speech of yours ben said dewey we will not soon forget that it was your plea for me that give me the chance mr dewey said ben i owe my life first of all to you that does not affect my obligation to you if i am ever in a situation to befriend you you may count with all confidence upon richard dewey thank you mr dewey i would sooner apply to you than any man i know except bradley he added noticing that his faithful comrade seemed disturbed by what he said jake bradley brightened up and regarded ben with a look of affection he had come to feel deeply attached to the boy who had shared his dangers and privations and in all proved himself a loyal friend the next morning the three friends set out for san francisco carrying with them the hearty good wishes of the whole miningsettlement you have promised to come back said more than one yes said bradley well come back if we aint prevented and i reckon we wont be unless we get hanged for hossstealin somewhere on the road this sally called forth a hearty laugh from the miners who appreciated the joke its all very well for you to laugh said bradley shaking his head but i dont want to come any nearer hangin than i was last night alls well that ends well said one of the miners lightly neither ben nor richard dewey could speak or think so lightly of the narrow escape they had had from a shameful death and though they smiled as was expected by the crowd it was a grave smile with no mirth in it youll come back too boy was said to ben yes i expect to you wont be sorry for it boys let us stake out two claims for the boy and his friend and when they come back well help them work them for a while agreed agreed said all so with hearty manifestations of goodwill the three friends rode on their way its strange observed dewey thoughtfully how this wild and lonely life effects the character some of these men who were so near hanging us on the unsupported accusation of two men of whom they knew nothing were good lawabiding citizens at home there they would not have dreamed of such summary proceedings thats where it comes in said bradley it aint here as it is there theres no time here to wait for courts and trials so you too are in favor of judge lynch judge lynch didnt make any mistake when he swung off them two rascals hadley and bill mosely we might have been in their places jake said ben that would have been a pretty bad mistake said bradley shrugging his shoulders chapter xx a little retrospect it will be remembered that a merchant in albany mr john campbell was the guardian of miss florence douglas whom our hero ben had escorted from new york to san francisco the disappearance of his ward was exceedingly annoying since it interfered with plans which he had very much at heart he had an only son orton campbell now a young man of twentyeight he was young in years only being a stiff grave woodenfaced man who in his starched manners was a close copy of his father both father and son were excessively fond of money and the large amount of the fortune of the young lady who stood to the father in the relation of ward had excited the covetousness of both it was almost immediately arranged between father and son that she should marry the latter either of her own free will or upon compulsion in pursuance of this agreement mr orton campbell took advantage of the wards residence in his fathers family to press upon her attentions which clearly indicated his ultimate object florence douglas felt at first rather constrained to receive her guardians son with politeness and this being misinterpreted led to an avowal of love orton campbell made his proposal in a confident matteroffact manner as if it were merely a matter of form and the answer must necessarily be favorable the young lady drew back in dignified surprise hastily withdrawing the hand which he had seized i cannot understand mr campbell she said what can have induced you to address me in this manner i dont know why you should be surprised miss douglas returned orton campbell offended i have never given you any reason to suppose that i regarded you with favor you have always seemed glad to see me but perhaps that was only coquetry said orton in a disagreeable manner i certainly have never treated you with more than ordinary politeness except indeed as my residence in your fathers house has necessarily brought us nearer together i dont think miss douglas you would find me a bad match said the young man condescending to drop his sneering tone and plead his cause i am already worth a good sum of money i am my fathers partner and i shall become richer every year it is not a matter of money with me mr campbell when i marry that will be a minor consideration of course because you have a fortune of your own yes said florence regarding him significantly for she suspected that it was rather her fortune than herself that he desired being no stranger to his love of money perhaps he understood her for he continued of course i dont care for that you know i should offer myself to you if you had nothing this florence douglas thoroughly disbelieved she answered coldly i thank you for the compliment you pay me but i beg you to drop the subject i will wait you will wait in vain i will look upon you as a friend if you desire it but there can be nothing more than friendship between us orton campbell was very much chagrined and reported the result of his suit to his father i will speak to her myself said the father as her guardian i ought to have some influence with her he soon ascertained however that florence douglas had a will of her own after a time he dropped persuasion and had recourse to threats miss douglas he said i shall have to remind you that i am your guardian i am quite aware of that fact sir and i shall remain in that position till you have completed your twentyfifth year that is quite true sir if you take any imprudent steps i shall think it necessary to interfere what do you mean sir i shall not allow you to fall a prey to any designing fortunehunter you need not fear sir i am in no danger i am of a different opinion i am quite aware that richard dewey has been seeking to ingratiate himself with you then said his ward with dignity i have no hesitation in informing you that he has succeeded ha i thought so that is why you rejected my son excuse me sir you are quite mistaken i should refuse your son if there were no other man in the world likely to marry me and what is the matter with my son miss douglas demanded her guardian stiffly florence might have answered that he was too much like his father but she did not care to anger her guardian unnecessarily and she simply answered it would be quite impossible for me to regard him as i wish to regard the man whom i hope to marry but you could regard richard dewey in that way sneered campbell well miss douglas i may as well tell you that he asked my permission yesterday to address you and i ordered him out of my presence moreover i have charged the servants not to admit him into the house so you have insulted him mr campbell said his ward her eyes flashing with resentment it was the treatment which he deserved as an unscrupulous fortunehunter that word will better apply to your son said the young lady coldly i shall not remain here to have mr dewey insulted you will repent this miss douglas said her guardian with an ugly frown mark my words i will keep you and dewey apart i have the power and i will exert it two weeks later richard dewey sailed for california in search of fortune and five months later miss douglas fearing that her guardian might imprison her in a madhouse escaped from his residence and aided by ben also managed to reach california for a time mr campbell was entirely ignorant of her place of refuge the next chapter will show how he discovered it chapter xxi mr campbell receives tidings of his ward it is strange we cant find florence said orton campbell to his father one morning some months after the young ladys departure is there no clue the detective i have employed has failed to trace her has he no theory he suggests that she may have gone to europe said mr campbell but i am not of that opinion what do you think then i suspect she has buried herself in some obscure country place under some assumed name there to remain till she has attained her twentyfifth year when my guardianship ceases when will that be six months hence it is very important then that we should find her before that time said orton campbell thoughtfully that is true after the time referred to my power ceases and i shall be unable to assist you in your plans her fortune amounts to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars does it not more than that the interest has been accumulating till it amounts to nearer one hundred and seventy thousand dollars orton campbells eyes sparkled with covetous greed that is a stake worth playing for he said with what i have of my own it would make me independently rich just so orton said his father and nothing stands in the way but the caprice of a foolish girl i declare father it is too exasperating suppose we try another detective your man cant be very sharp i have no objection orton said the merchant but as he would be employed in your interest it is only fair that you should pay the expense incurred i dont see that said the son she is your ward you know it ought to come out of her property the item may not be allowed in that case i should be responsible said john campbell cautiously ill tell you what i will do father if she is found and i marry her ill freely pay the whole expense suppose we find her and she wont marry you what then asked his father keenly the son looked nonplussed but finally consented in that case to defray the expense out of his private means that is if it could not be taken out of the young ladys fortune the matter having been satisfactorily adjusted they were discussing the choice of a detective when a clerk came to the door of the private countingroom in which father and son were seated and said theres a man outside wants to speak to you mr campbell who is he saunders i think its jones who used to be in your employ as light porter how does he look welltodo he is decidedly shabby answered saunders come to ask help probably muttered the merchant i think i wont see him saunders left the office but presently returned well has he gone asked the merchant no he says he wants to see you on business of importance of importance to himself probably shall i see him orton yes father if he is humbugging us we can send him off so permission was given and almost immediately saunders ushered into the room a short broadshouldered fellow who looked very much like a professional tramp goodmorning mr campbell said he deferentially humph jones is it you you dont look as if you had prospered no more i have sir dont come near me really your appearance is very disreputable i cant help that sir ive just come from california in the steerage and you cant keep very neat there i believe you went to california to make your fortune didnt you jones said orton campbell with a cynical smile yes mr orton i did and you didnt make it i infer from your appearance i havent got much money about me now said jones with a shrug and a smile you would have done better not to have left my employment jones said the merchant you wanted higher pay i believe and as i wouldnt give it you decided that you could better yourself at the mines that is about so sir well and what luck did you have good luck at first sir i made a thousand dollars at the mines in a few months indeed said orton in surprise i came with it to san francisco and gambled it away in one night then i was on my beamends as the sailors say did you go back no i went to work in the city and managed to get enough money to buy a steerage passage and here i am i suppose you have come to ask me to take you back into my employ that i take it is your business with me no sir not exactly then what is it asked the merchant looking a little puzzled it crossed his mind that jones might so far have forgotten his rule never to give away money for any purpose as to suppose there was a chance to effect a loan i thought you and mr orton might be willing to pay my expenses back to san francisco said jones coolly are you out of your head jones demanded orton campbell amazed at the mans effrontery not at all if this is meant as a joke jones said the merchant in a dignified tone it is a very poor and i may add a very impudent one what possible claim have you on us that you should expect such a favor have you heard anything of your ward mr campbell asked jones not in the least abashed no what has my ward to do with your concerns i have seen her answered jones briefly where asked john campbell and his son simultaneously that information belongs to me said jones quietly a detective doesnt work without pay the two campbells now began to see the point this man had information to sell and would not give it up without what he considered suitable compensation they determined to drive the best possible bargain with him he was poor and probably could be bought over for a small sum your information is worth something jones said the merchant guardedly i will go so far as to give you twentyfive dollars cash for it that wont do said jones shaking his head your information may be worth nothing said orton you may have seen her but that doesnt show where she is now i know where she is now said jones is she in california i dont mind telling you as much as that mr orton then we can find her without your assistance i dont think you can at any rate it will take time especially as if you dont make a bargain with me i shall write her that you are on her track father and son looked at each other it was evident that jones was no fool and they would be obliged to submit to his terms or give up the search which was not to be thought of what do you propose jones asked mr campbell a little less haughtily that you pay my expenses back to california and one thousand dollars said jones promptly if you or mr orton will go with me i will show you where she lives and then you can take your own course this was finally agreed to and orton campbell and the exporter sailed by the next steamer for san francisco where florence douglas still boarding with mrs armstrong was waiting impatiently for news of richard dewey chapter xxii a morning call florence douglas had now been an inmate of mrs armstrongs household for some months she avoided making acquaintances and therefore was often lonely but she was buoyed up by the thought that richard dewey was somewhere in the state and that the two messengers whom she had sent out would eventually find him she felt great confidence in ben and also in bradley who had impressed her as an honest straightforward man though illiterate and not at all times superior to temptation her hope had been sustained by a letter received from ben at the time he and bradley were on the point of starting for the sierras where they had information that dewey was engaged in mining then weeks passed and she heard nothing she began to feel anxious for the safety of her two agents knowing that not alone wild beasts but lawless men were to be encountered among the mountains should ben and his companion come to harm she would be sincerely sorry for their fate feeling in a measure responsible for it still more richard dewey would then be left ignorant of her presence in california and might return to the east in that ignorance leaving her friendless and alone more than three thousand miles from her old home how would her heart have been cheered could she have known that at that moment richard dewey with his two faithful friends was but four days journey from the city so it happens that good fortune is often nearer to us than we imagine even when our hearts are most anxious while she was trying to look on the bright side one morning mrs armstrong entered her room miss douglas she said there is a gentleman in the parlor who wishes to see you her heart gave a great bound who could it be but richard dewey who would call upon her did he give his name she asked in agitation no he said you would know him it must be richard she said to herself and controlling her agitation as well as she could she descended to the parlor she paused a moment before opening the door to regain her selfpossession then with an effort she turned the knob and entering the room found herself face to face with orton campbell it was so unexpected and so bitter a disappointment that an expression of blank dismay overspread her face and she sank into the nearest chair without venturing on a single word of greeting you didnt expect to see me miss douglas said orton enjoying the effect of his appearance for he had never deceived himself with the thought that his fathers ward would be glad to see him by this time florence had regained her selfpossession and with it came back scorn for the man whose object in pursuing her she well understood to be love of her fortune not of herself you are entirely right mr campbell she answered you are the last person i expected to see you dont appear very glad to see me he continued why should i appear so you know very well that i am not glad to see you said the heiress frankly that is complimentary said orton rather provoked though he knew very well in advance that such was her feeling i suppose you didnt come here for compliments mr campbell said florence coldly you are right i didnt may i ask if you are in san francisco on business you take things very coolly i must say miss douglas certainly you cannot be ignorant of my motive in coming here at great personal inconvenience i hope i have nothing to do with your reason you are the sole reason i am sorry to hear it i came to remonstrate with you on the very unwise step you took in running away from your legal guardian my legal guardian as you call him though i look upon him as such only as far as my property is concerned rendered the step necessary i dont see how in plain terms mr orton campbell i believe that you and your father entered into a conspiracy to keep my fortune in the family by inducing me to become your wife i certainly did ask you to become my wife but it was not because of your fortune answered the young man florences lip curled she thoroughly disbelieved his statement though she said nothing it was clear to him from her expression that she put no confidence in his words you may believe me or not he said doggedly but why should you think so poorly of yourself as to suppose you have nothing to attract lovers except your money i may not be so modest as you suppose mr campbell i do believe that i have won the love of a true and noble man my doubt only related to yourself you mean richard dewey i suppose said orton campbell with a sneer i do mean richard dewey answered florence with composure by the way he came to california i believe yes and you came here in pursuit of him he added with a sneer i came here to find him knowing that in him i had a true friend while your fathers persecution and your own made me feel the need of one have you found him do you know where he is asked orton campbell eagerly i only know he is somewhere at the mines i have taken steps to find him and hope eventually to succeed why dont you advertise asked the young man with an angry sneer would you advise it asked miss douglas coolly no muttered orton for he feared such a step might prove successful what steps have you taken he asked i prefer to keep them to myself miss douglas said orton campbell after a pause all this is very foolish and humiliating there is only one proper course for you to pursue what is it return to new york with me in the next steamer and place yourself once more under the care of my father whose protection you never ought to have left protection repeated florence with bitter emphasis what protection did he give me all that was required all that was required you know very well that you and he had conspired to put me in a madhouse if i would not agree to enrich you by giving you my hand that is not true said orton campbell rather confused not true he distinctly threatened to do it as a means of terrifying me into compliance with his and your wishes it was not until then that i decided to leave your house and seek some place of refuge until time and the law should set me completely free from your family and their machinations it is evident miss douglas that you are under a delusion your way of talking is sufficient to show that your mind is affected any good physician would need no other proof florence douglas looked at him with distrust was this a threat or how should she interpret it it is convenient mr orton campbell she retorted with spirit to charge with madness those who oppose us at home i felt afraid of your threats here i am secure he thought that perhaps he had gone too far since the young lady was independent of him and it was not certain that he could gain possession of her miss douglas he said i have already told you that you have taken an unwise step there is one way to remedy it and i hope i may be able to induce you to take it let me assure you that i have called upon you as a friend as a warm friend as one who seeks to be something more than a friend well sir let me urge you to consent to an immediate marriage with me and to accompany me home on the next steamer my father will receive you as a daughter and never allude to your flight i suppose i ought to thank you for your disinterested proposal mr campbell but i can only tell you that you ask what is entirely out of the question this is final allow me to wish you goodmorning but miss douglas she did not turn back nor heed these last words and orton campbell found himself alone he rose slowly from his seat and an evil look came into his eyes she has not done with me yet he muttered as he left the house chapter xxiii a secret conference the affairs of florence douglas are so interwoven with the fortunes of my young hero that i find myself obliged to devote a part of my space to their record i confess that i have no pleasure in detailing the schemes of orton campbell who seems to me a very disagreeable character but it seems necessary after leaving the presence of miss douglas he took a walk to consider the situation and decide what it was most expedient to do he was spending considerable time and money in the effort to recover his fathers ward and he did not like to fail yet it was not easy to decide upon any plan which would bring success it was not a matter in which he could invoke the assistance of the law the young ladys manner convinced him that she would not of her own free will consent to accompany him back what then was to be done on the principle that two heads are better than one he resolved to take his companion jones into his confidence and ask him to make a suggestion how did you find the young lady mr orton asked his follower on his return to the hotel very offish jones then she wasnt glad to see you said jones with a grin by no means she hardly treated me with civility thats because of the other man said jones sagaciously you are right mr dewey as i learned is in california then maybe they have an understanding together no she doesnt know where he is jones was puzzled and showed it in a way common to men of his class he scratched his head and looked perplexed then what good is it for her to stay here he asked after a pause she is taking steps to find this dewey who is somewhere at the mines though she would not tell me what they were he may turn up any time and then goodbye to all my hopes you want to marry her yourself mr orton of course otherwise i wouldnt have come so far in search of her the young lady is very rich isnt she asked jones shrewdly she has a moderate fortune replied orton guardedly but that doesnt influence me of course not said jones but there was something in his tone which made campbell eye him sharply i am no fortunehunter said he stiffly youd want to marry her just the same if she hadnt a cent of course i would snapped orton now thats what i call real love said jones to be sure youre rich yourself and neednt mind precisely so i may not be rich but i can support a wife as the young lady prefers some one else i suppose we may as well go home thats what i want to talk to you about jones very likely this dewey is dead at any rate hes a mere fortunehunter now although florence doesnt care to marry me now if our marriage could be brought about she would no doubt be reconciled to it after a while now jones have you anything to suggest orton campbell threw himself back in his chair and eyed jones he had formed a plan but if possible he wanted the proposal to come from jones jones was not overscrupulous he had never been so and the months he had spent in the mines in the company of adventurers of all kinds had not improved him even lawabiding citizens often lost their regard for law in california and jones had fewer scruples to overcome than most he suggested a plan which met with the approval of his employer and promised his cooperation on the understanding that if successful campbell should properly reward him it may be added that of the thousand dollars which he was to receive for his information he had actually received but three hundred orton campbell having on various pretexts put off paying him he received the assurance that this also should be paid him without further delay as soon as the plan referred to was successfully carried out chapter xxiv miss douglas receives a message florence douglas felt somewhat uneasy after the visit of orton campbell though he had no legal right to interfere with her even as the representative of his father she knew the unscrupulous character of the man and that he would not have spent time and money in a visit to california unless he had a strong hope of carrying her back with him her chief fear was that he would carry out his fathers threat and try to have her pronounced of unsound mind in which case he could have her confined in an asylum if i could only hear from richard dewey she fervently ejaculated if he were here i would have nothing to fear two days passed and considerably to her relief she heard nothing from campbell she began to hope that he had given up his purpose and made arrangements to return to the east she was determined to refuse him an audience if he should call upon her again either with or without companions that she might feel more secure she took her landlady mrs armstrong into her confidence this lady had become much attached to her guest and listened with great indignation to the account which florence gave her my dear miss douglas she said if that man campbell calls leave me to deal with him how would you propose to do it asked florence smiling i would give him a piece of my mind you may depend upon that he would be rude to you in that case i would order him out of the house said mrs armstrong resolutely the man needs a lesson and i should like to be the one to give it to him i shall be very glad to have you meet him in my place said the young lady an interview with him is something which i would gladly avoid that you shall i only hope hell come soon hell find one woman that isnt afraid of him i am not afraid of him mrs armstrong but i own that i am apprehensive of what he may do it would not surprise me at all if he should make his appearance with some needy physician who for a fee will be ready to pronounce me insane dont be alarmed miss florence ill send the doctor packing as well as his employer perhaps he will pronounce me insane if he does he is welcome to i think he would find me an unsatisfactory patient i think so too said florence smiling as she scanned the firm determined face and the tall and muscular form of her hostess who certainly would never be classed as a weak or timid woman on the afternoon of the third day a knock was heard at the door for as yet it was unprovided with a bell mrs armstrong and florence were sitting together the two glanced at each other and the same thought came to each it may be orton campbell said florence who was the first to speak then let me go to the door stay where you are miss douglas i will receive the gentleman but when the landlady opened the door she saw a man who looked like a coachman a covered carriage was at the gate which he had evidently driven well sir what can i do for you demanded the landlady sharply is there a young lady living with you named florence douglas asked the man miss florence douglas boards here answered mrs armstrong ive got a message for her maam if its from mr orton campbell you can go back and tell him that she wont receive any messages from him said the landlady resolutely i dont know who you mean maam replied the man in apparent surprise i dont know any such gentleman then who sent you inquired the landlady whose turn it was to be surprised its a man just come from the mines said the driver a mr dewey florence had drawn near to the head of the stairs in her interest to hear who had called and she caught the name of her lover she came flying down stairs and demanded breathlessly what about richard dewey i am miss douglas and your message is for me jones for it was he touched his hat respectfully and held out a note penned on rough paper and written in pencil this will explain everything miss he said florence took the paper and with some difficulty read it it ran thus dear florence i have struggled to reach you but have been struck down by fever when i was nearly at the end of my journey i have had bad luck at the mines and was almost discouraged when i learned that you were in san francisco poor as i was i determined to come to you even at the risk of your misjudging me i am not able to write much and must defer particulars till i see you i am staying at the house of a kind stranger a few miles from the city the man whom i send with this note is trustworthy if you will trust yourself to his guidance he will bring you to me i know that i am asking a great deal of you but i think you will not fail me yours with love richard dewey the writing was hurried indeed it was hardly more than a scrawl he must be very weak thought florence her heart swelling with painful emotions my good friend she said to the landlady richard is sick and poor he asks me to come to him i must go but can you trust that man is the letter genuine asked mrs armstrong suspiciously i am sure it is genuine it is written as richard would write but dont be in haste miss douglas florence make some inquiries and find out whether this news can be depended upon would you have me hesitate when richard needs me asked florence reproachfully no mrs armstrong i must go and at once i have waited so long to see him he will be very glad to see you miss said jones respectfully he has been talking about you constant were ben and mr bradley with him why didnt one of them come because miss said jones with ready invention though he had never heard of either of the persons mentioned one went for the doctor and the other stayed to take care of him this seemed very plausible without a particle of suspicion florence douglas hastily dressed herself and entered the carriage in waiting chapter xxv walking into a trap the thought that she was so soon to see richard dewey and to minister to his comfort was a source of pleasure to florence her patient waiting was at length to be rewarded what mattered it to her that he was poor and sick he had all the more need of her its a long ride miss said jones as he closed the carriagedoor i hope you wont be tired before we get there i shall not mind it said florence how far is it i dont rightly know its a matter of ten miles im thinkin very well jones resumed his seat and florence gave herself up to pleasant thoughts she felt thankful that she was blessed with abundant means since it would enable her to spare no expense in providing for the sick man others might call him a fortunehunter but that produced no impression upon her except to make her angry she had given her whole love and confidence to the man whom her heart had chosen the carriage rolled onward rapidly as from time to time she glanced out of the window she saw that they had left behind the town and were in the open country she gave herself no concern however and did not question jones taking it for granted that he was on the right road and would carry her to the place where richard dewey had found a temporary refuge it is some poor place probably she reflected but if he can be moved i will have him brought into town where he can see a skilful doctor daily at the end of an hour and a half there was a sudden stop florence looked out of the carriagewindow and observed that they were in front of a shabbylooking dwelling of two stories jones leaped from his elevated perch and opened the door of the carriage this is the place miss he said did you get tired no but i am glad we have arrived its a poor place miss but mr dewey was took sick sudden so i was told and it was the best they could do it doesnt matter perhaps he can be moved perhaps so will you go in yes the door was opened and a slatternlylooking woman of sinister aspect appeared at the threshold florence took no particular notice of her appearance but asked hurriedly how is he oh hell get along answered the woman carelessly will you come in he is not dangerously sick then said florence relieved hes got a fever but aint goin to die this time this is mrs bradshaw miss douglas said jones volunteering an introduction i thank you mrs bradshaw for your kindness to a sick man and a stranger said florence earnestly can i see him now yes miss if youll just walk up stairs i hope youll excuse the looks of things i havent had time to fix up oh dont mention it in a tumult of emotion florence followed her guide up a rough staircase on the landing mrs bradshaw opened a door and standing aside invited florence to enter on a sofa with his back to her lay the figure of a man covered with a shawl richard said the visitor eagerly the recumbent figure slowly turned and revealed to the dismayed florence not the face of the man she expected to see but that of orton campbell mr campbell she ejaculated in bewilderment i see you know me miss douglas said orton campbell throwing off the shawl and rising from the couch for the first time it dawned upon florence that she had walked into a trap she hurried to the door and strove to open it but mrs bradshaw had locked it what does this mean mr campbell she demanded with spirit in spite of her terror is this unworthy trick of your devising i am afraid i must confess that it is said orton coolly and it was all a falsehood about richard deweys sickness yes and the note i wrote it myself then sir you have acted shamefully said florence indignantly i am afraid i have said orton campbell smiling but i couldnt help it couldnt help it repeated miss douglas no you would not receive me and i had to contrive an interview do you know anything of richard dewey no he is perfectly well so far as i know or he may be dead pray be seated i would rather stand may i ask what you expect to gain by this base deception your consent to a marriage with me then it is clear you dont know me orton campbell it is quite as clear miss florence douglas that you dont know me i believe you capable of any atrocity then you do know me i am capable of anything that will break down your opposition to my suit do you propose to keep me here yes until you give me a favorable answer that will never be then you will stay here an indefinite period are there no laws in california none that will interfere with me the people who live here are devoted to my interests as you will find i dont wish to hurry you in your decision and will therefore leave you for the present your meals will be sent you at regular times and i will call again tomorrow he drew a key from his pocket opened the door and left the room locking the door behind him florence sank into a chair almost in despair chapter xxvi a hardhearted jailer florence soon recovered a degree of selfpossession and began to consider the situation the room in which she so unexpectedly found herself a prisoner was about fifteen feet square there were two front windows from which she took a survey of the neighborhood which she had but slightly observed from the windows of the carriage she could see no other house and naturally concluded that this had been selected on account of its lonely location the distance from the windowsill to the ground was not over twelve feet and florence began to consider whether she could not manage to escape in this way she tried to open one of the windows but could not stir it closer examination showed her that it had been nailed down she went to the second window and found that secured in a similar way they evidently anticipated that i would try to escape she thought to herself next her thoughts recurred to the woman who appeared to be the mistress of the house not that she had any intention of appealing to her kindness of heart for the hardfeatured mrs bradshaw was not a woman likely to be influenced by any such considerations florence had enjoyed but a transient view of the ladys features but she already had a tolerably correct idea of her character she is probably mercenary thought florence and is in orton campbells pay i must outbid him this thought inspired hope especially when from the window she saw her persecutor ride away on horseback this would gave her a fair field and a chance to try the effect of money upon her jailer without risk of interruption she would have felt less sanguine of success if she had heard the conversation which had just taken place between mrs bradshaw and her captor mind mrs bradshaw you must not let the young lady leave her room on any consideration all right sir i take it for granted mrs bradshaw you are not easily taken in i should say not sir said the woman emphatically the young lady will try to impose upon you while i am away then shed better save her trouble said mrs bradshaw tossing her head shes very artful said orton most crazy people are you dont mean to say shes crazy said mrs bradshaw in surprise she dont look like it you are quite right she doesnt look like it but she wrong here continued campbell tapping his forehead why she fancies herself immensely rich mrs bradshaw when as a matter of fact shes a penniless cousin of mine who would have gone to the poorhouse but for my fathers charity you dont say so exclaimed mrs bradshaw interested sometimes she thinks shes worth millions of dollars i wish she were for in that case my father would be relieved of the burden of supporting her to be sure sir some time since she managed to elude our vigilance and escaped from our home in albany knowing how feebleminded she was we felt very anxious about her but for some time were unable to get a trace of her finally we learned that she had been seen in california and i came out at great personal inconvenience to bring her back very kind of you sir i am sure but how could she travel so far without money that is easily explained she opened my fathers desk and took out some hundreds of dollars answered orton campbell with unblushing falsehood of course we dont consider her responsible as she is of unsound mind otherwise we should look upon her as very ungrateful she seems to be very goodlooking observed mrs bradshaw so she is and if her mind were healthy i can imagine that she would be admired as it is her beauty counts for nothing to be sure i hope to calm her down and induce her without a violent disturbance to embark on the next steamer for new york with me she wont listen to me now but i shall call tomorrow forenoon and see how she appears meanwhile she will probably try to bribe you to release her she may promise you thousands perhaps millions of dollars for its all the same to her poor thing but of course youre too sensible a woman to be taken in by the promises of a crazy girl i should say so returned mrs bradshaw who was thoroughly deceived by the artful story of her employer who by the way had promised her one hundred dollars for her cooperation in his scheme she will probably tell you that she came to california in search of her lover who is at the mines of course there is no such person but she thinks there is i understand said the woman confidently i thought you would well mrs bradshaw i will see you tomorrow i am sure you are to be relied upon about six oclock mrs bradshaw carried up some supper to her prisoner i hope youve got an appetite miss she said stay a moment said florence eagerly i want to speak to you now its coming thought mrs bradshaw with some curiosity she was rather taken aback by the first words of her prisoner how much money has mr orton campbell promised to pay you for assisting him in his plot well i declare said mrs bradshaw bridling for though she had been bribed she did not like to confess it he is to pay me rent for this room she said after a pause then i am your lodger am i asked florence i suppose so answered the woman rather embarrassed by this unexpected question very well then i dont think i care to occupy the room i will pay you a weeks rent out of my own purse and leave you after supper i think not said mrs bradshaw decidedly then i am to consider myself your prisoner you may call it so if you like it is just as well to call things by their right names of course mr campbell has hired you to detain me here tell me how much he is to pay you and i will pay you more to release me then you are rich i suppose said the woman yes i am rich mrs bradshaw laughed you are worth several millions i suppose she said mockingly certainly not who told you so mr campbell warned me that you would pretend you were rich it is no pretence i am rich though at present his father has the greater part of my fortune under his charge oh of course said the woman laughing again i understand all about it what has orton campbell told you asked florence suspiciously he said you would pretend to be rich and try to bribe me though you were only a poor relation of his who would have gone to the poorhouse unless his father had supported you out of charity he has deceived you mrs bradshaw his father wanted me to marry this man in order to keep my fortune in his own family that is why i ran away from his house what made you come to california asked the woman because the man whom i really loved was at work somewhere in the mines ho ho laughed mrs bradshaw loudly why do you laugh because you are as crazy as a loon mr campbell told me just what you would say he told me all about your stealing money from his fathers desk and running off to california after a lover in the mines its turned out exactly as he said did he dare to slander me in that way demanded florence so indignantly that her jailer drew back in some alarm no violence miss if you please she said youd better be quiet or youll have to be tied good heavens exclaimed florence i would not have believed orton campbell so false and artful hes acting for your good miss so youd better not make a fuss and the landlady left the room not failing to lock the door securely behind her chapter xxvii a star in the cloud meanwhile though things looked dark for florence and favorable for her persecutor there was one circumstance that threatened failure to the latters plans orton campbell was a mean man and his meanness in this instance worked against him he had promised his confederate jones a thousand dollars as the price of his information and cooperation but intended all the while to avoid paying it if it were a possible thing of this sum seven hundred dollars were still due besides an extra sum for the services of jones in making florence a captive it was in regard to these sums that jones called on mr campbell on the evening succeeding the success of the plot orton campbell was about to go out when jones appeared at his hotel i would like to see you a few minutes mr orton said the man respectfully you must come some other time jones said campbell carelessly ive got an engagement i must see you now sir said jones still respectfully but in a resolute tone must repeated orton campbell arching his brows you are impertinent call me what you please said jones doggedly im not to be put off what do you mean demanded his employer angrily you know well enough i want the money you are owing me you seem to be in a hurry said campbell with a sneer you dont retorted jones all i ask is that you will keep your promise what promise do you refer to what promise do i refer to you said if i would join you in kidnapping hush said orton looking around apprehensive of listeners the young lady jones continued you would pay me the seven hundred dollars you owed me and two hundred dollars extra for my help now orton campbell knew very well that he had made this promise but the payment of nine hundred dollars he dreaded as much as some of my readers would dread the extraction of half a dozen teeth he had got all he needed from jones and he decided that it would be safe to throw him off it might be dishonorable but for that he cared little i suppose you have my promise in writing jones he said with a sneer no i havent mr campbell then you cant prove that i owe you anything i take it you dont mean to say mr orton youd cheat a poor man out of his hardearned money ejaculated jones who in spite of his knowledge of his employers character could hardly believe his ears i never intended to give you such an enormous sum for the little you have done for me didnt you promise it sir demanded jones exasperated not that i remember answered campbell coolly i should have been a fool to promise so large a sum i paid your expenses out to california and three hundred dollars that i take it is pretty liberal pay for your services for a month ill have justice if i live said jones furiously he looked so threatening that orton campbell thought it might be best to placate him even at the expense of a small extra sum dont be a fool jones he said you know very well that your demands are beyond all reason ive treated you very liberally already but i dont mind doing a little more ill go so far as to give you fifty dollars down and a further sum of one hundred dollars on my weddingday if i marry florence douglas if youll be content with that i wont be content with it orton campbell said jones indignantly i wont be content with anything less than the full sum you promised me youd better pay me at once or you may see trouble orton campbell should have known that it was dangerous to trifle with a man so thoroughly roused as jones was but his love of money and dislike to part with it overcame every other consideration and he said youve refused my offer and i have done with you you neednt come near me again do you mean this asked jones slowly of course i do you have served my purpose and been paid i have offered you more and you have refused it that ends everything i understand you now orton campbell mr campbell if you please interrupted campbell haughtily mr campbell then and i am sorry i didnt know you better before but it isnt too late yet thats enough you can go as jones walked away campbell asked himself what is the fellow going to do i wonder i suppose he will try to annoy me never mind i have saved nine hundred dollars that will more than cover all the damage he can do me it was about the same hour that a party of three dusty and shabby entered san francisco and made their way to a respectable but not prominent hotel we look like three tramps ben said bradley anywhere but in san francisco i dont believe we could get lodged in any respectable hotel but theyll know at once that we are from the mines and may have a good store of golddust in spite of our looks if my friends at home could see me now said ben laughingly they wouldnt think i had found my trip to california profitable it would give my friend sam sturgis a good deal of pleasure to think that i was a penniless adventurer he might be disappointed when he heard that you were worth not far from a thousand dollars ben he certainly would be on the other hand uncle job would be delighted i wish i could walk into his little cottage and tell him all about it when you go home ben you must have more money to carry than you have now a thousand dollars are all very well but they are not quite enough to start business on a year ago i should have felt immensely rich on a thousand dollars said ben thoughtfully no doubt but you are young enough to wait a little longer after our friend dewey has seen his young lady and arranged matters well dust back to our friends the miners who came near giving us a ticket to the next world and see whether fortune wont favor us a little more agreed said ben i shall be ready shall you call on miss douglas this evening mr dewey asked ben yes answered dewey i cannot bear to feel that i am in the same city and refrain from seeing her will she know you in your present rig suggested bradley i shall lose no time in buying a new outfit said dewey there must be shops where all articles of dress can be obtained readymade i was afraid you were going as you are said bradley of course shed be glad to see you but she might be sensitive about her friends and that wouldnt be agreeable to you im thinkin i thank you for your kind suggestion my good friend said dewey no doubt you are right richard dewey swallowed a hasty supper and then sought the clothing shops where he had no difficulty in procuring a readymade outfit so many persons came from the mines in his condition desiring similar accommodation that he was not required to go far to secure what he wanted then having obtained from ben the proper directions he took his way to the house of mrs armstrong which he reached about eight oclock can i see miss florence douglas he asked mrs armstrong hearing the request came herself to the door she was feeling anxious about the prolonged absence of her young friend may i ask your name sir she inquired richard dewey richard dewey repeated mrs armstrong in amazement why i thought you were sick in bed what made you think so asked dewey in equal amazement your own note miss douglas on receiving it went away at once with the messenger and has not returned i have sent no note and no messenger has come from me i dont understand you said richard dewey bewildered it was soon explained and the bitter disappointment of dewey may well be imagined this feeling was mingled with one of apprehension for the personal safety of the young lady this is indeed alarming he ejaculated who can have planned such an outrage i will tell you sir said a voice turning quickly richard deweys glance rested upon jones chapter xxviii jones checkmates orton campbell who are you inquired richard dewey not favorably impressed by the appearance of the man who addressed him you wouldnt know if i should tell you said jones so i may as well say that i came out to san francisco with orton campbell orton campbell in the city exclaimed dewey apprehensively had he anything to do with the disappearance of miss douglas everything sir but i cant tell you about it in the street i will go with you to your hotel tell me on the way said richard dewey first has any harm befallen florence miss douglas none as yet is any threatened the loss of her liberty but i will help you to thwart orton campbell jones told the story which need not be repeated here as it is already known to the reader he had difficulty in restraining mr dewey from starting out instantly to the rescue of the young lady but on his representing that she was safe and that it would be soon enough to go out in the morning richard dewey yielded a little before eight oclock jones driving the same carriage in which he had conveyed florence to her place of captivity halted in front of mrs bradshaws dwelling remain in the carriage mr dewey he said and i will see if i cant secure the young lady without any fuss wont it be better for me to accompany you i think not sir mrs bradshaw knows i am the one who brought miss douglas here and she will think it is all right stay he continued with a sudden thought i have an idea mr campbell told mrs bradshaw that the young lady was insane i will make her think that you are the doctor from the asylum come to take miss douglas back with you did orton campbell really intend such an outrage asked richard dewey in a tone of horror yes if miss douglas wouldnt consent to marry him go then and lose no time jones knocked at the door which was opened by mrs bradshaw in person she naturally regarded jones with surprise not anticipating so early a call how is miss douglas he asked very contrary answered the landlady i cant get her to eat its my belief she means to starve herself its a crazy freak said jones shrugging his shoulders well ive come to take her away to take her away so soon asked mrs bradshaw in surprise yes mr orton thought it best is he with you no i think i see some one in the carriage to be sure its the mad doctor from the asylum dont let miss douglas know it continued jones lowering his voice or she wouldnt consent to go with us i see answered the landlady nodding do you want to go up now yes let me see her alone so that i can tell her a story which will quiet her suspicions mr campbell hasnt paid me all he promised yet said mrs bradshaw rather uneasily oh thats all right said jones he never forgets his promise and seldom keeps it he said to himself florence was sitting on the lounge in her room in rather a despondent state of mind when the door opened and she looked up expecting to see orton campbell jones closed the door behind him and then putting his hand over his lips said miss douglas i bring you good news are you not the man who brought me out here yesterday the same one then how have you the face to show yourself in my presence because i am come to free you from your imprisonment florence started to her feet in some excitement if this were true she exclaimed but no you are an agent of orton campbell and this is some new trick of his i was an agent of orton campbell but he deceived me and i am his enemy is he with you asked florence suspiciously no but in the carriage outside is one whom you will be glad to meet who is it richard dewey you brought me a note from him which he never wrote how do you expect me to believe you now if he is not there dont get into the carriage not a word to mrs bradshaw she is in the employ of mr campbell who represented you as insane and i told her that mr dewey whom i did not dare to bring in was a doctor from the insane asylum are you sure you are not deceiving me said florence earnestly i am on the square miss but you can easily convince yourself by coming down stairs if you prefer to remain here till nine oclock when orton campbell will be here you can do so no no anything better than that mrs bradshaw watched the exit of her guest with a peculiar look she little knows where shes going thought the woman well if shes crazy its the best place for her as may easily be imagined there was scant leavetaking florence was eager to leave this shabby cabin where she had passed a night of anxious solicitude she approached the carriage and jones opened the door she looked in and saw dewey who said in a low voice get in at once florence but keep silent till we are on our way an expression of joy came over her face as she saw this most convincing proof of her drivers good faith he mounted the box and drove rapidly off on their way back to san francisco the two who had been so long separated had ample time to compare notes and form plans for the future florence said richard dewey after this treachery of orton campbell there is but one way of safety for you and what is that let me become your legal protector and at once when we are married your guardian will be powerless he will have me to deal with then not a defenceless girl but richard this seems so sudden it ought not to florence have we not waited for each other long enough have we not been separated long enough i am not much richer than when i left you not so rich he added smiling as your other suitor orton campbell i will marry you if only to get rid of him richard said florence impetuously i wont quarrel with your motives since you consent so it happened that on their arrival in san francisco they directed jones to drive to the house of a clergyman and were speedily united in marriage the clergymans wife and daughter being witnesses circumstances compelled them to dispense with the usual cards and cake at nine oclock orton campbell secure of his prey drove up to mrs bradshaws door and leisurely descended well and how is miss douglas this morning he asked of the astonished landlady how is she shes gone what ejaculated orton furiously you have dared to let her escape you sent for her yourself she went away with the mad doctor the mad doctor i dont know anything about any mad doctor woman you are deceiving me dont call me woman said mrs bradshaw offensively putting her arms akimbo im no more a woman than you are then youd better dress differently sneered campbell tell me what all this means the man that drove the lady out here yesterday came here more than an hour ago and said you had sent for her he said there was a doctor in the carriage who would take her to the asylum that corresponded with what you told me and i let her go that scoundrel jones exclaimed orton campbell so this is his revenge i must go back to the city at once and circumvent him if i can he was about to go when mrs bradshaw said before you go youd better pay me what you promised i wont pay you a cent said campbell angrily jack the word spoken by the woman brought a roughlooking man to the carriagedoor this man says he wont pay me a cent jack said mrs bradshaw youd better reconsider that stranger said jack pulling out a revolver and fingering it significantly i owe her nothing said orton campbell surveying the revolver uneasily if she had kept the young lady here it would have been different if theres a trick been played on you my wife aint goin to suffer by it shes earned the money stranger and ill give you just two minutes to pay it over orton campbell read something in the mans face that convinced him he was not to be trifled with with many an inward groan he drew out one hundred dollars from his purse and handed it over thats all right stranger said jack coolly i thought youd be reasonable short reckonings make long friends with a muttered imprecation orton campbell sharply ordered his driver to turn the horses heads toward san francisco and make his way there as quickly as possible his thoughts were by no means pleasant company he had just been forced to pay out a considerable sum without value received and was beginning to think the sum paid to jones also money thrown away chapter xxix a wedding reception orton campbell cursed his folly in arousing the hostility of jones he concluded that the latter had released florence in order to obtain a hold upon him and would be ready to assist him again if satisfactorily paid in that event all was not lost it was necessary to see jones as early as possible and make matters right with him he was not quite clear as to where jones could be found but concluded that he had carried florence back to her boardinghouse he therefore ordered his driver to proceed at once to the house of mrs armstrong he hastily descended from the carriage and rang the bell it was answered by mrs armstrong in person who regarded him with no very friendly eye orton campbell knowing his own treachery and conscious that it was also known to the lady before him asked in some embarrassment is miss douglas here no sir orton campbell looked surprised i i thought she might be here he stammered were you the person who lured her from my house yesterday by a false letter demanded mrs armstrong sternly no answered campbell unblushingly it was an agent of mine who has deceived and betrayed me then you had nothing to do with the disappearance of the young lady certainly not answered orton campbell boldly i assure you it has given me great concern and i have been riding hither and thither this morning in search of her wont you come in sir perhaps we may be able to throw some light on this mystery she believes me thought orton campbell congratulating himself on the effect of his duplicity certainly he answered i shall be most happy to do so he was ushered into the parlor into which five minutes later entered florence richard dewey and a gentleman of clerical appearance miss douglas exclaimed orton campbell in astonishment i thought you said turning to mrs armstrong that miss douglas was not here i am not miss douglas said florence quietly i dont understand you perhaps i can explain the mystery said richard dewey coming forward i wish you would if you can said orton campbell with a sneer this young lady is my wife your wife and who are you richard dewey at your service orton campbell had never known dewey well and his life at the mines had so changed his appearance that it was not surprising he did not recognize him is this true he asked in visible dismay when were you married half an hour since by this gentleman and richard dewey waved his hand in the direction of the clerical gentleman already referred to you have done a good stroke of business sir said campbell with a sneer and a look of baffled hatred the ladys fortune makes her a good match so you evidently thought sir answered dewey your unscrupulous methods have not succeeded and i beg to warn you that the lady now has a protector who will punish any such persecution as that with which you have recently visited her you are quite mistaken my agent only followed your instructions said an unexpected voice as jones who was within hearing now entered from the adjoining room mr orton i have confessed all so you neednt try to humbug this gentleman you are a scoundrel said campbell wrathfully excited by the appearance of the man who in return for being cheated had betrayed him then theres a pair of us mr campbell said he coolly i admit that i behaved like a rascal but ive tried to set matters right you can find your way back to new york as you can i have done with you said campbell hardly conscious that this very remark betrayed him mr dewey has kindly offered to take me back with him said jones not at all disturbed by this notice if you are going back by the next steamer mr campbell said richard dewey i will thank you to apprise your father of his wards marriage and ask him to arrange for the surrender of her property at the proper time you may attend to your own messages sir said orton irritably i will have nothing to do with them without any further words he hurried out of the house and drove at once to the office of the steamship company where he secured passage by the earliest vessel eastward bound that same evening mr and mrs richard dewey held an informal reception at their boardinghouse it was not largely attended for florence had made but few acquaintances during her stay in the city uncertain as her prospects were she had thought it best to keep aloof from her friends who might possibly make known her residence to her guardian among those present however were richard deweys tried friends bradley and ben stanton bradley tried to excuse himself on the ground that he was only a rough miner and not accustomed to society but his objection was overruled both by florence and her husband you are a true friend mr bradley said florence gratefully and i should miss you more than any one else except my young friend and cousin ben bens different from what i am said bradley he aint such a rough specimen im only a miner like you said ben i am a country boy and not used to society but i dont believe cousin ida will care for that cousin ida was the name by which ben had been instructed to call florence when she came out to california under his escort the upshot of it all was that both bradley and ben were present at the brides reception and were made so thoroughly at home by mrs richard dewey that neither felt in the least awkward two weeks later richard dewey and his wife sailed for new york but ben and bradley remained behind come with us ben said florence i dont like to leave you behind thank you miss florence i mean mrs dewey said the boy but i am not ready to go yet dont let the thought of money keep you here ben i am rich or i shall be in a few months when my guardian surrenders his trust and i will take care that you are well provided for thank you again said ben but ive promised to go back to the mines ive got a claim reserved for me and so has bradley well go back now and try to gather a little more golddust but youll let us see you in new york before long yes i shall go home in a few months even if i come back again later i want to see uncle job and cousin jennie and all my old friends not forgetting sam sturgis added ben smiling we must be content with that i suppose said the young lady i hope you will have good luck but even if you dont remember that you have two friends who will only be too glad to be of service to you please consider mr bradley that this is said to you also thank you maam said jake bradley awkwardly for with all his good traits he was not quite at ease in the society of ladies ben and bradley saw the young couple off on the steamer and then prepared to go back to the mines its made me feel kind of lonesome to part with dick dewey said bradley thoughtfully hes a wholesouled feller and hes struck it rich in a wife thats so jake chapter xxx the nugget ben and bradley made their way back to golden gulch by easy stages they reached the gulch about sunset and were welcomed in such noisy style by the miners that it might almost be called an ovation we reckoned youd come said one of the leaders you look like youd keep your promise i hope there aint any hosses been stole since we went away said bradley jocosely ben and i aint quite ready to hand in our checks we wouldnt hold you responsible if there had been was the reply that makes me feel a little easier in mind said bradley it may be pleasant to hang from a branch with a noose round your neck but i dont want to try it the miners were just preparing to take their evening meal and ben and his friend were invited to share their hospitality after supper pipes were produced and bradley was called upon to bring forth his budget of news in the little miningsettlement far from the great world a man who could give the latest news from the city or produce a late paper from any of the eastern cities was hailed as a public benefactor so it was at an unusually late hour that our friends and the miners retired to rest the next morning the two newcomers were shown the claims which had been set aside for them they were eligibly located and already had a commercial value but were bestowed out of goodwill without a cent of compensation bradley and ben got to work at once they had had their vacation and were ready to settle down to business they were stimulated to effort by the success of some of their fellow miners bens next neighbor had already gathered nearly three thousand dollars worth of golddust and it was quite within the limits of probability that our young hero might be as successful if i fail it wont be for lack of trying thought ben three thousand dollars in addition to the thousand he already had would make him feel rich some of my readers who have been luxuriously reared will be surprised to hear this but ben had always been used to small things he had been brought up in a small country town where a dollar counts for a good deal more than it does in the city and where a man possessing ten thousand dollars is thought to be independently rich his uncle job who was thrifty and industrious and generally through careful economy had a little money in the savings bank was probably worth at the outside fifteen hundred dollars no wonder then that the prospect of being worth four thousand dollars dazzled our young hero and stimulated him to unwonted effort neither of our two friends got on fast they averaged perhaps fifty dollars a week each but out of this their expenses had to be paid and these on account of the high price of all articles of necessity were rather heavy still the end of each week found both richer and they were contented it was the aim of every miner to strike it rich each had a dream of some day cutting a rich vein or finding a nugget of extraordinary size which should compress into one day the profits of a year or two of ordinary success but such lucky finds were not numerous as in ordinary life the large prizes are rare and average success is the rule but the general hope was kept up by occasional lucky strokes ben said bradley one day in excitement returning from a visit to the claims half a mile distant on the other side of a hilly ridge ive got great news what is it jake perkins has just found a nugget that must contain five hundred dollars worth of gold you dont say so jake fact i just saw it i hope theres more of them round here so do i thats a find worth having the discovery made a sensation at golden gulch it excited the hope of all and stimulated labor what had fallen to perkins might chance to any one of his comrades so as the miners sat round their roaring fire for it was getting chilly in the evening one and another discussed the interesting question what would i do if i could find a nugget various of course were the answers one would go home and start a drygoods store he had been a drygoods clerk in philadelphia another would buy the old stuart place and get married another would pay off a mortgage on the old homestead and so on what would you do ben asked bradley i would go home by the next steamer and buy uncle job the threeacre lot he has been wanting so long and buy new dresses for aunt and jennie but it isnt much use forming plans till the nugget is found thats so ben but you are as likely to find it as the next man i will hope for it at any rate though bens prospects were excellent and he had met with unusual success his thoughts often wandered back to the quiet village where the years of his boyhood had been chiefly passed from time to time he was disturbed by the thought that something might have happened to his uncles family of whom he had heard little or nothing since he went away he afterward learned that letters had been sent which he had not received he was not exactly homesick but he felt keenly the lack of news from home in spite of this however he worked on with energy and industry he felt that every dollar he earned brought nearer the day when he would feel justified in turning his back upon the goldfields of california and wending his homeward way to hampton meanwhile ben did not neglect to do what he could for the general entertainment it has already been mentioned that he could sing very creditably and his talent was very often called into requisition in the evening ben was obliging and finding he could give pleasure he generally complied with the request of the miners and rehearsed such songs as he knew so that he was considered a decided acquisition by the little company and his popularity was unbounded ive been thinkin ben said bradley one sunday when they were taking a walk together that if there was any offices to be filled youd stand a good show of bein elected what makes you think so jake youre the most popular man in the camp leastways boy i can easily believe that jake as i am the only boy well theres no one ahead of you man or boy i am glad if that is so said ben modestly it is chiefly because i am a boy boys are not always popular it depends a good deal on the kind of boy so the reader will get some idea of bens life at the mines and the estimation in which he was held by his comrades it was not very exciting nor very eventful but there was to be a change one day his pick struck something hard it might be a rock which would need to be removed he dug round it patiently but when he wished to lift it after it was loosened he found it necessary to summon bradley to his assistance why ben exclaimed bradley in excitement this isnt a rock it is a nugget and a bouncer a nugget repeated ben incredulously yes look here and bradley pointed out the indubitable signs of its value yes ben your fortune has come at last how much is it worth demanded ben almost breathless with excitement and exhilaration how much three thousand dollars at least then i can go home yes ben youre got your pile it may as well be stated here that bradleys guess was not far out of the way the nugget when it reached san francisco was found to amount to three thousand seven hundred dollars to the credit of the miners of golden gulch it must be said that all rejoiced in bens success no ones good luck would have excited so little envy or jealousy as that of the boy who had worked by their side for months and done so much by his goodhumor and musical gifts to cheer up and entertain them when he was ready to start for the city on his homeward journey all joined in wishing him a pleasant journey and the best of luck in the years to come ben was not obliged to travel alone bradley decided not only to accompany him to san francisco but to sail to new york in his company ive never seen york he said and i never shall see it if i dont go now so if you dont mind ben ill go along with you mind jake theres nothing i shall like better while they are on the steamer homeward bound events have transpired in bens old home which require to be noted chapter xxxi job stantons mistake there had not been many changes in the little town of hampton since ben left it it was one of those quiet new england villages where life moves slowly and a death or a marriage is an event uncle job still lived in his plain little cottage with his wife and daughter and still plied his humble task as the village cobbler essaying sometimes to make shoes when there were none to be repaired there was a plat of land belonging to his house rather more than an acre in extent but land was cheap in hampton and it is doubtful whether both house and lot would have brought if thrown into the market over one thousand dollars uncle job had at one time about a hundred dollars in the savings bank in a neighboring town a fund to draw from in an emergency and this money with his plain home constituted his entire wealth eleven hundred dollars all told it was not a very brilliant result for forty years labor beginning with the days of his boyhood but job stanton was not ambitious and he actually felt welltodo he earned enough to supply the simple wants of his family and had something over and this satisfied him but one day a strong temptation came to job stanton and he yielded to it a trader came riding over from a neighboring town and called on uncle job the good man thought he had come to order a new pair of shoes and felt flattered that such a dashing man should have gone so far out of his way to patronize him im glad to see you mr richmond he said wont you set down he should have said sit but job stantons educational advantages had been very limited i dont care if i do snug place youve got here mr stanton its very plain and humble but its home and i set by it answered job who was busily engaged in tapping a shoe belonging to eliphalet nourza a farmlaborer ive come over to see you on a little business mr stanton said the trader affably jest so returned uncle job cheerfully glancing over his spectacles at the traders shoes to see if they looked much worn want a pair of new shoes i reckon i shall need a new pair soon said richmond but that isnt exactly what i meant it flashed across job stantons mind that his visitor might be going to make him an offer for the old place but he felt that he could not bear to part with it he had lived there ever since he was married thirtyfive years ago and there jennie the child of his old age had been born but the traders next sentence relieved him of this thought the fact is uncle job proceeded the trader adopting the title by which the shoemaker was generally known in hampton ive got a favor to ask of you a favor to ask of me repeated job looking up with some surprise at the welldressed merchant who seemed by his presence to honor the homely little shop yes continued richmond with gravity i want you to indorse my note for five hundred dollars what made you come to me asked job stanton in surprise i am not a capitalist i am a poor man oh well youre good for five hundred dollars yes answered job with some complacency my place here is worth twice that let alone the money ive got in the savings bank of course it is still i dont want to run no risk youd better go to some moneyed man like major sturgis for instance why the fact is uncle job its the major that lets me have the money on my note but he stipulated that i should have an indorser and he particularly mentioned you thats curus said job why should he think of me oh he knew you were a reliable man how does it happen that you need money asked job bluntly isnt your business good thats just it said richmond glibly its so good that ive got to extend my stock and that takes money im turning money over all the time and it wont be long before i am able to retire im glad of that but i dont quite understand if thats so why youre short of funds its clear you are not a businessman said richmond laughing but i think i can explain to you how it is he did explain and the explanation seemed very plausible yet job stanton who was a cautious man hesitated this brought the trader to his closing argument you mustnt think uncle job that i expect this service for nothing i am ready to pay you ten dollars for the accommodation and to order a pair of shoes at your own price thats handsome said job and all ive got to do is to sign my name just so its a mere formality i shall have the money to pay the note twice over before it comes due then i wonder the major wants an indorser oh its his invariable custom i know it isnt necessary mr richmond he told me but its my rule and i wont break over it even in your case if you will get job stanton to indorse for you it will be perfectly satisfactory i know he is a poor man but then its only a form well i dont know said job doubtfully if ben was here i would ask him you mean your nephew dont you yes the boy that went to california im glad you mentioned him as soon as he gets back send him to me and ill give him a place in my store ive heard hes very smart so he is said job and id like to have him with you so that he could come to see us once in a while there aint no openin in hampton of course not and youll give ben a place when he gets home certainly that is if you indorse my note i am ready to pay you the ten dollars down he drew a crisp banknote for ten dollars from his pocket and job stanton yielded for it was a great deal of money to him i think however that he was more influenced by the prospect of obtaining a good place for ben that would keep him from wandering farther away from home if he had been shrewder it would have occurred to him that a prosperous businessman such as richmond claimed to be was unusually anxious for a small accommodation however to him five hundred dollars represented a large sum and it didnt seem at all strange so uncle job took off his leather apron ushered his visitor into the sittingroom and sitting down at the table indorsed the note thank you said richmond here is the ten i dont know as i ought to ask you so much said job with conscientious scruples oh thats all right now ill go into the shop and you may take my measure for a pair of shoes this has been a lucky day for me thought job stanton ive got ten dollars for writing my name and it isnt often i earn as much as that in a week the trader seemed equally pleased and the two parted in mutual good spirits the note was for three months or ninety days and job stanton thought no more about it why should he richmond had expressly told him that it was a mere form and he supposed that this was the case the ten dollars went to buy new dresses not very expensive of course for his wife and jennie and that seemed to be the end of it but job was destined to be undeceived and that very rudely one day he was surprised by a call from his dignified fellowtownsman major sturgis goodmorning mr stanton said the major condescendingly goodmorning major i hope your family are quite well quite well i thank you whats he come about thought job wonderingly you indorsed a note for richmond the drygoods man three months since so i did is it really three months close upon it mr stanton i regret to say that i shall be obliged to call upon you to pay it me to pay it ejaculated uncle job thunderstruck why i only indorsed it precisely that means that you are to pay it if richmond doesnt but he will pay it said the poor shoemaker eagerly he said it was only a matter of form then he deceived you i have just received a note from him telling me to look to you chapter xxxii the house is mortgaged job stanton would not have been more utterly overwhelmed if he had seen his treasured home reduced to ashes before his eyes that he should be responsible for a debt of five hundred dollars seemed to him almost incredible the traders representation that indorsing the note was only a matter of form he had accepted as strictly true well what are you going to do about it asked the major impatiently goin to do about it ejaculated job certainly when a man indorses a note he knows that he may be called upon to pay and of course has some plan for doing it i dont know what to do said the poor shoemaker sadly i cant pay the note humph there seems to be only one thing to do then what is it you must sell or mortgage your place what sell or mortgage my house i cant do that major sturgis very well i wont insist on it if you can pay the note in any other way heaven knows i cant then mr stanton said the major sharply its time to speak plainly unless you do as i suggest i shall attach your property and compel you to raise the money in the way i indicate job stanton was mortally afraid of legal proceedings and after a while he acceded to the majors proposal which was himself to accept a mortgage for the sum of five hundred dollars secured upon the place his wife who had to be told wept bitterly for it seemed to her as if they were parting with their main reliance but major sturgis carried his point and walked off triumphant and now for the majors motive for he had one and he had artfully made use of richmond to forward his plan he was desirous of getting possession of the poor shoemakers house and land having in view the purchase of the lot adjoining then he would move the house off throw down the fence between the two lots build a nice dwelling and rent it to a city friend who wished to spend his summers in hampton he knew very well that job stanton wouldnt listen to a proposition for selling his house and he therefore tried to accomplish by stratagem what he could not fairly pa you are looking in good spirits said sam sturgis when his father came home i dont feel so said the major hypocritically i have had to do a very disagreeable thing this morning what was it sam asked his curiosity being excited mr richmond the trader owed me a note for five hundred dollars indorsed by job stanton and as he did not pay it i had to call on stanton he couldnt pay hes too poor said sam not in money but he owns his place i have accepted a mortgage for six months time on his house and lot suppose he doesnt pay when the time comes i am afraid i shall have to foreclose the mortgage and hell have to leave wont he unless he can raise the money some other way there isnt any other way is there richmond might hand over the money by that time do you think he will he ought to but i dont think there is much chance of it ben will be rather astonished when he comes home and finds his uncle has lost his place yes i suppose he will i shant be sorry for him he puts on a good many airs considering how poor he is i wish i knew how he is getting along in california he may get a living there but that is about all said the major i shouldnt be at all surprised if his uncle came to me for money to get him home you wouldnt let him have it would you pa i might answered major sturgis if he would surrender the place to me without putting me to inconvenience would you take ben for my servant pa in that case why do you want him for a servant i want to humble his pride answered sam with a gleam of something like hatred in his eyes chapter xxxiii the blow about to fall all this happened soon after ben went away his uncle did not write him of it for he knew it would trouble the boy and it could do no good no wife he said ben will have a hard row of his own to hoe he mustnt have any part nor lot in our troubles its very hard job at our time of life said mrs stanton despondently so it is wife but it may turn out for the best after all i havent given up hope that mr richmond will pay the sum so that i can take up the mortgage im goin to see him about it tomorrow uncle job left his work the next day and walked five miles to the store of the man who had brought this calamity upon him ive come to see you mr richmond he said wiping his forehead with his red cotton handkerchief about that money ive had to pay oh yes said richmond with his usual suavity im very sorry it happened so it seems to me you didnt treat me just right said poor job such things will happen you know mr stanton but you said it was only a matter of form signin the note of course i so regarded it i could have sworn i should be ready to pay when the note became due you see there was money owing to me that i couldnt collect didnt you know that was likely to happen when you tempted me to indorse the note it wasnt likely to happen but it was possible my plans miscarried as any mans are liable to if you were more used to business uncle job youd see that i hadnt acted wrong in the matter i dont understand the ways of business men but i know youve done me a grievous wrong john richmond said job stanton gravely ive come to ask if you can pay me back a part of that money well i cant do it this morning ive got two payments to make you dont look at it in the right light uncle job i want my money said the old man when can you give it to me since you push me so hard i can only say i dont know said richmond dropping his soft tones and looking angry is that all the satisfaction you are goin to give me dont you ever mean to pay me that money youve made me pay out on your account mortgaging my house and risking my home of course i shall pay you some time but i cant say exactly when said the trader brusquely will you sign a note for the money at three months or six months john richmond no i wont youll have to wait uncle job till i get ready to pay you thats all about it i may be ready next week or it may not be till next month a businessman cant always foresee how hell be situated at any definite time with this poor consolation job stanton had to rest content he looked around him and saw every evidence of prosperity several customers were in the store and the two clerks seemed to have as much as they could do he saw money paid over for purchases in considerable amounts and he felt that a part of it might be spared as a partial payment to him but it was of no avail and he turned sadly away the next week passed and the next month passed and job stanton waited vainly for a payment on account from john richmond he didnt like to judge the trader harshly but it did seem as if he was quite indifferent in the matter another month passed and job made another visit to the store of his prosperous debtor richmond wasted few words on him uncle job he said its no use your coming over here ill send you the money when i can spare it finally six months passed the mortgage became due and job received a notice from major sturgis that he wanted his money if you cant raise it said the major i am willing to cancel the note give you two hundred and fifty dollars and take a deed of the place that is only allowing seven hundred and fifty dollars for it said poor job its all it is worth said the rich man coldly if you prefer to put it up at auction i am willing but you may in that case get less ill give you three days to decide there was great sorrow in job stantons house that evening six months before he had considered himself welltodo now at the age of sixty poverty and destitution stared him in the face chapter xxxiv conclusion do you think we shall have to give up the house job asked mrs stanton anxiously i see no other way said job mournfully i cant raise five hundred dollars anywhere have you been to deacon pitkin yes but the deacon says hes just put out what money he had and cant accommodate me its hard said mrs stanton with sad brevity yes it is hard assented job i did hope the lord would show us a way of deliverance but it seems likely that the sorrow must come upon us how meanly major sturgis and that man richmond have behaved i cant help feeling that they will be come up with sooner or later said mrs stanton who mild as she generally was could not help feeling exasperated i do think theyve been inconsiderate job admitted inconsiderate their conduct has been contemptible the major dont need the money he could just as well let us stay here while this conversation was going on ben and his friend bradley were approaching the little cottage full of joyful memories ben lifted the latch and walked into the presence of his uncle and aunt nothing but his return could have chased the mournful expression from their faces why its ben come back exclaimed his aunt joyfully well i declare so it is answered job stanton hurrying forward and grasping the hand of his boy after his aunt had embraced him how youve grown ben said his aunt admiringly yes aunt clarissa ive grown four inches said ben proudly but ive brought a friend with me jake come in and then bradley was introduced to job and his wife and was cordially welcomed by both youre lucky to come while weve got a home to welcome you to said job his face again saddening why uncle job youre not thinking of selling the house are you then the whole story came out ben listened attentively and when his uncle had finished he said that richmond is a firstclass rascal and id like to give him a firstclass kick said bradley indignantly that wouldnt mend matters said job shaking his head it wouldnt pay off the mortgage you say the mortgage amounts to five hundred dollars uncle job yes then theres six months interest at six per cent makes fifteen dollars more when do you expect major sturgis to call this morning its almost time for him i met sam on my way here said ben he told me id come just in the nick of time i didnt know what he meant but i know now the major offers to buy the house paying me two hundred and fifty dollars over and above the note why thats robbery said ben indignantly so it is ben but what can i do i think said ben smiling youd better borrow five hundred and fifteen dollars of your rich nephew what do you mean ben asked job in surprise i mean this uncle job that ill lend you the money to pay up this shark you dont mean to say youve got money enough ejaculated uncle job yes i do uncle and a little over ill prove it to you he produced a wallet from which he drew out five onehundreddollar bills and three fives take them uncle and ask me questions afterward for i see through the window that the major is coming indeed a knock was heard directly and job answering it himself ushered in the stately figure of major sturgis the major looked around him in surprise finding more persons than he expected to see dont you remember ben major sturgis asked job when did you come home benjamin asked the major taken by surprise i have just arrived sir tired of california eh for the present yes sir i think my son sam wishes to see you he thinks of offering you a place ben bowed and smiled he understood what sort of a place sam was likely to offer well mr stanton asked the major pompously have you decided to accept my offer for the house no major your offer is too small you are quite at liberty to look around for a higher bid or rather you were now it is too late just so major on the whole i dont think i want to sell dont want to sell repeated the major frowning you will have to sell why will uncle job have to sell demanded ben irritated by the majors tone young man said the major grandly this is not a matter with which you have anything to do your uncle and i can arrange it between ourselves still i shall advise uncle job to pay the mortgage though he was swindled into agreeing to it i apprehend sneered the major he will have some difficulty in paying me five hundred and fifteen dollars i guess i can manage to do it major said job mildly i dont believe you said the major hastily have you got the mortgage with you asked job yes here it is and here is your money said the shoemaker producing the bills major sturgis received them in amazement bordering upon stupefaction and counted them over three times i guess theyre all right said job where did you get them inquired the major unable to control his curiosity i guess that doesnt matter so long as theyre good answered job still ive no objection to tellin you that its bens money that hes kindly lent to me did you bring this from california asked the major turning to our hero yes sir answered ben have you any more ive got enough more so that i dont expect to need the situation sam thought of offering me when major sturgis left the cottage his grand air had passed off and he looked disappointed and mortified sams spirits too were perceptibly dashed when he learned that the boy he disliked had been successful in california that settles the major said ben this afternoon i will see what i can do in the case of richmond you cant do anything ben said his aunt leave him to the reproaches of his own conscience he hasnt got any conscience aunt clarissa said ben jake will you ride over with me to the next town this afternoon i shall be glad to ben ben went at once to the office of an able lawyer engaged his services and put the matter into his hands the result was that john richmond received a note by messenger summoning him to the lawyers office he at first tried to bluster then to temporize but the lawyer was stern and threatened to exhaust the resources of the law in behalf of his clients like most bullies richmond was a coward and ended by giving a note for the full amount with interest at thirty days you had better leave this note with me said the lawyer to ben i will collect it when due and he did with a crestfallen air john richmond had to confess himself defeated in his mean attempt at swindling for he had obtained uncle jobs indorsement with the deliberate intention of leaving him to pay the note supposing that the old man would be too timid to do anything about it ben remained in hampton a week during that time he bought the threeacre lot adjoining the major having given up the purchase when his plan of getting possession of job stantons little property fell through and gave it to his uncle this made job feel like a rich man and he only accepted it on bens assurance that he had plenty more money at the end of a week ben received a letter from richard dewey informing him that he proposed to go into business for himself in the city of new york and was anxious to engage ben as a clerk this offer was too good to refuse so ben a month later found himself in a responsible business position as his employer within a few months came into possession of his wifes large fortune which her guardian was reluctantly obliged to surrender he was not hampered by lack of capital but within a year had his business securely established ten years have passed ben is now junior partner and enjoys a high reputation for business ability a year since he married his cousin jennie and in so doing has made a wise choice he lives in the city but uncle job and his wife still live in hampton though job is no longer compelled to work for a livelihood he has given up his shop and confines himself to the cultivation of his small tract of land though now seventy his eye is not dim nor his natural force abated major sturgis is dead and sam it is understood has wasted a considerable portion of the handsome property that was left him it is quite possible that he may end in poverty and destitution and be forced at last to work for a living this he would regard as a misfortune but it will probably be a blessing in disguise for the necessity of honest labor is generally a salutary restraint bradley has gone back to california his son in now with him and both are prosperous richard dewey and his wife are rich and happy the two do not always go together and have four children the second of whom a boy is named benjamin stanton dewey in honor of our hero i have endeavored to ascertain what became of our mongolian friend ki sing but without entire success my impression is that he started a laundry in san francisco made enough money for a chinaman to retire upon and went back to his native land to live in competence the happy husband of a highborn chinese maiden with incredibly small feet doubtless he has more than once retailed to wondering ears the account of his adventures and perils when he as well as ben visited california in search of fortune the end famous alger books ragged dick series by horatio alger jr vols mo cloth ragged dick
